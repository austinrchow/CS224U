Written by Max Landis Based on a story by Josh Trank and Max Landis '
- to indicate time lapses within a scene - ' The room is dingy
Unkempt
The camera sits on the bed, on its side, facing the door
We can hear someone moving around off screen
The door handle clicks; someone's trying it
Then nothing
Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door
Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking
He speaks with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety
(
) What do you want, 'm getting ready for school- (
) Why is the door locked, unlock this fucking door right now
The bed stirs as Andrew sits down
(
) (') said unlock this door ,
(
) You're drunk- (
) Listen, you don't tell me-  ' , - (
) It's seven thirty
In the
You're drunk, dad, that's crazy- (
) What're you doing in there
(
) 'm filming this
(
) What
(
) bought a camera
'm filming all your shit from now on
2
There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr
Detmer moving away from the door
-  ' Equally dingy
, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in bed
Andrew's filming her
She's clearly very ill, speaking in a weak rasp
Andrew now holds the camera
(
) Mom
Will you say hi to the camera
Who's the audience
(
) The millions of people watching at home
Hello world
Do  look awful
(
) No, you look great
've been looking a little better, yeah
(
) Oh yeah, definitely
It's a nice camera
- Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon
Andrew carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into the passenger side of a car
In the driver's seat is  Garrety, 17, with messy hair
He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school intellectual
got you egg salad
3
(
) Oh, yeah, thanks
They're driving
So
Should  ask about the camera, or- (
) 'm filming things now
'm filming everything
You're filming everything
(
) For my mom
'm trying to get custody of her from my dad
She's getting worse, and he's not
helping, and this way, in case something goes down- He gets violent or whatever- (
) Right, it'd be evidence
Evidence
But you're not with him right now, but you're filming this
(
) Well, yeah, to add context
Context
Andrew, you are
a weird dude
(') Did you ever read any Auguste Comte
(
) What is that
He's this philosopher 'm reading
4
(
) For school
He's just like- his whole thing is about being positive and like, taking up for yourself
You should read him, maybe, it might make you feel- you know, improve your outlook
(
) Yeah, right
- Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to see Matt lighting a pipe
(
) Are you not coming in
'm gonna blaze a little first, yeah
(
) You're going to miss first period- Matt turns on the radio, loud
(
) (') Okay, okay
- Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway
(
) This is my school,  guess
This is the hallway- Vote "Kaz
" girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer
(') Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior class president
5
(
) yeah- Every vote counts
Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before something yanks the camera away
For the first time we see  Detmer, 17, pale, awkward and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard
He looks anxious, if not afraid
(
) Yo this camera is a piece of shit
It's like from 2004 or some shit
, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy -shirt, appears wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew
Hey, how do  look
(starts muscle posing) Like this
Ooh, that's good
Like this
That's sexy, right
Bryce, gimme my camera back- (
) Fuck you Andrew, shut up
This camera's a piece of shit
You got me, let's go
Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker
Bryce starts to walk away with the camera
(
) Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back- The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly kicked back to Andrew
He picks it up, checking on it
(') (quietly, sad) Oh come on
6
- view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices
The cheerleaders are practicing too
We cut: a different view, lower
(
) This is where  eat lunch, out here on the bleachers
The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the bench
approaches
Hi
Hey- Could you not videotape us, please
It's really fucking creepy
wasn't, videotaping you, so much as  was just- Just don't videotape-              -you know, filming what  do during the- Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll call security
We see you watching us, we're not stupid, and it's sketchy, so back off
okay
Is it on right now
Yes
Turn it off
Andrew turns off the camera
7
' Matt's driving
Andrew's filming from the passenger seat
There's a party tonight
barn party at Haven Hills
(
) thought Haven Hills was closed
It's abandoned, yeah
That's why it's a good place for a party
Two kegs
(
) Why are you telling me
You wanna go
don't wanna go alone
(
) Nah
When was the last time you went to a party
(
) don't like parties
You're a senior
Just come, you'll have fun
(
) 'll think about it
Okay, right
Andrew, can  give you like, a pro tip
Yeah
Keep the camera at home
It's weird
It has a purpose- 8
'm trying to be a good cousin, here
This is me being your friend, yeah
Okay
Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house
(
) Hey, what you doing
(
) Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your fuckin camera
The camera pans up to reveal  and , moron hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the other side of the road, drinking forties
Hey don't film me nigga, don't film me
Hey fuck off, you better run to your house, bitch
Run to your house and lock the door
Andrew just stands there filming them
Howard hurls his forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to him
The fuck, fuck you faggot- Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns and runs back towards his house
- ' The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room
Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working
'm uploading what  shot today
you have to keep a back-up, you know
The door suddenly opens, revealing
Adrian , 40s, Andrew's father
He doesn't look as white trash as you'd expect
9
Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working
Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair
When  say open this door, you open this fucking door
Mr
Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out
Andrew sits on the floor in silence
- We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old fence and rusted out farm equipment
(
) Are you sure it's here
(beat) Are you sure it's here, this all looks closed- It's here, calm down
Listen
We can faintly hear party music
(
) Oh yeah
- Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and Andrew approach
We see Christmas lights strung up, and there's clearly a party going on inside the barn
Kids are milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around
Hey dude, don't follow me around all night
(
) What
Don't follow me around all night, okay
(
) What am  supposed to do thought you said you didn't want to go alone- 10
Talk to people
Have a beer, don't know
Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full swing
Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking, girls dancing sexy, guys joking around
Andrew is silent and detached, just filming
He sees a girl,  Letter, 16, filming as well
They shout over the music
Hey, what are you filming for
(
) Oh,  don't- just filming
What
'm filming for my blog
(
) What
have a video blog
Why are you filming
Andrew simply backs away
More footage of the party
, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere
He's clearly a little drunk
Hey, were you filming my girlfriend
Yes or no, were you filming my girlfriend
(
) No,  wasn't filming anyone specific, just filming the party
(beat) Okay, good, because  don't wanna have to beat your ass
(
) Okay
Don't talk back to me
Don't get smart, okay, 'm being nice here
'm being nice to you
() 11
(') (beat) Say okay
(
) Okay- Cause  know you were filming my girlfriend dancing
should break your fucking nose, you know that
You know that,  should beat your ass right now, but 'm trying to be nice
Fuck you
Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on the camera, and then spits on him
Andrew backs up, shocked, lowering the camera
- Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the lens of the camera, obstructing our view
Cut to a few moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the ground
We can see the barn, the party still going on
After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying
(
) (loud, sudden) Are you Andrew
(
) (startled) What- Are you Andrew-with-the-camera
(beat) Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a camera
The camera is picked up to reveal  "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17, approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, instantly likeable charisma
He's a little drunk and giddy
(') Dude, are you okay
(
) 'm Andrew
12
'm Steve Kazinsky- (
) No,  know
yeah
(
) Everybody knows who you are
Haha, yes, that is true
Listen, come on, bring the camera
(
) What
don't- Come on
Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates
(
) don't- Dude, come on, we found something
- Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward woods
It's rather dark
(
) Look,  don't think we're supposed to- Is there a light on that
On your camera
(
) Oh,  don't- Hm,  don't know- The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with it
The light clicks on, illuminating Steve
Awesome
13
They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the remains of a fence
The light bounces around wildly
(
) What were you guys doing out here
This is way out- Me and your cousin were blazing a little
(
) Matt's out here
bunch of people were out here, but  think they've all gone back, now, cause we're like, obsessed with the thing
(
) The what
They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying
It's near silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground
Steve walks out ahead
Andrew Detmer, that's right remember you from homeroom, Freshman year
(
) You remember that
Yeah,  have a memory for faces
'm gonna go into politics, which is ironic because 'm soooo fucking high right now- probably shouldn't be letting you videotape this- (
) 'm gonna be so rich when you're president, you have no idea- Yeah, video footage of me luring you into the woods for gay sex- wait, hey- , ,
14
(
) Down here
(
) Matt
The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the woods
It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to the camera
It looks like a big black spot
There we go
There it is
Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole
Andrew is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness, nervous
(
) Where is everybody
They all left
(
) We're not supposed to be out here
Is it still making the sound
Yeah
Did you tell Andrew
Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound- Here, listen
(
) Guys- You've got to get really close to hear it
Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole
(
) Guys, just don't like- don't push me, or do anything like that- 15
(
) You've got to go closer
Like almost inside it
There's a beat
We're not going to push you, we just wanna get it on tape
Another pause
Andrew moves towards the hole
Even with Nightvision, it's completely dark in there
beat
(
) Do you hear it
(
) It's like, whispering
(
) Listen
(
) Singing
(
)                        (
) Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy
Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve
(
) (') What is that
We didn't dig the hole, man
Is the sound on the camera
(
) don't know, probably
mean, it's- it's kinda loud, right
Matt looks to Steve
Do you guys wanna go in and have a look, or what- (
) No,  don't-  mean,  won't do th- Hold your nose
16
Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the darkness
(
) Hey, wait- (  ) (faintly) Come on
Steve, come on, we don't know if it's stable in there- It's probably just the wind, we should- Andrew abruptly goes into the cave
(
) (') Andrew, hey, come on
Don't
shit
It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing
It's claustrophobic in here
Eerily quiet
The camera searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low
(
) Hello- (
) (suddenly appearing)           Aah
'm right here
(
) (') Does it go down much deeper, or- Yeah, really far
It's not a cave, it's like a tunnel- do you hear how loud that's getting
(
) Do you think it could be like wind, or- Come on, man
Come on
(
) Then what do you think it is
17
Huh
dunno
don't believe in ghosts
(
) Who said anything about ghosts
Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness
Andrew follows
Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera
-shouldn't have come in here
(
) Steve's up ahead- At first  thought this was a solutional cave, but now
dunno, it's like a lava tube, or something
(
) don't know what you're talking about
Look at the walls
Look at how smooth they are
It's just straight shot down,  mean, we must've already gone forty or fifty feet- (
) Don't talk about it, you're making me nervous
You ever hear of Plato's allegory of the cave
(
) No
Nevermind
18
Walking
Darkness
The cave is even tighter now
The light flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the nightvision mode comes on
The nightvision is scrambling badly
All the forms are distorted and then- (
) Can you believe this, this is - The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt
They've come into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow
They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't hear
Is that, is that showing up on the camera
(
) don't wanna film it, it's messing with the camera- Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing from, or maybe embedded in, the wall
Around it, and him, float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful
Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the light
Touch one
We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light, beautiful
(
) Guys maybe
maybe we shouldn't
light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand to extend to touch it
The subsequent little light burst badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage
19
Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow
The light clouds have turned yellow
Matt is practically inside the structure, pressing it with his palms
-changes color, see
It must be reacting to the heat, some kind of exothermic reaction- (
) can't hear you over the- you know- Make it change again
This is awesome
Matt presses with his palms
There's a low sustained hiss as the light clouds turn an angry shade of red
stream of them is released from beneath the structure
The camera jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears
(') Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly and we see Matt seemingly  out of the crystalline structure
It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart, revealing a blinding light within which  ; we can suddenly hear an    , and the camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the tunnel- '
'  - The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera
It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed
20
Ready
(
) Rolling, yeah
Okay, ball test
Take one
baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing Matt in the face; he drops like a rock
(') Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too
'm sorry, oh shit, 'm sorry- Now it's Steve who stands on the yard
(') Go
baseball comes in from off camera, slower
It comes down towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre, impossible course correction, (') , ,
Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice- pack to his face
Again, we hear Andrew laughing
- Andrew's out across the yard
He looks a little better; he's gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a little better kept
He nods
In flies the baseball
It abruptly stops in the air, a foot and a half from Andrew's face
Steve and Matt let out a cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and Andrew
21
Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball
trickle of blood comes out of his nose
Ah, shit
The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle
They are playing catch
no hands
The ball simply flies from guy to guy
They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout encouragement, and are clearly having a good time
Finally, they get the ball going  fast
Matt looks up
Is- Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew rush to him, laughing
`In the- penis- the penis- thought  heard my dad ' Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over bread
The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and Andrew watching
The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate
You get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it, and you can move it however you want
Mhm
've been pretending  was like, holding it in a fist, like a floating hand
22
Yeah
Plate's easier for me
Guys, check it out
Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter floating freely
They slap together and then down onto the bread, which slaps closed
(') Ha
(notices his bloody nose) Shit, shit- '  - Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess
Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a set with his telekinetic abilities
Andrew's filming from the bed, where he's laying down
(
) Try to imagine that your squeezing the entire piece in your hand
That's what 'm doing, it's just, it's hard
You're better at this than me, you do it
(mocking) Really
Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together
(wowed, laughing) Dude, holy shit
Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his cell phone
Guys, listen, listen
Samantha
Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker
Pezon, 16, sounds a bit frustrated
23
( ) know you're over at that guy Matt's house right now, okay, cause they said you didn't show up for soccer practice, but you said the only reason you couldn't come see Bound By Love with me was because of soccer practice, so
You know, just,  don't know what to think
feel like we never hang out anymore, you've just been hanging out with those two guys for the last like three weeks, and
ugh, call me back
What would you suggest, as like, a course of action for me, here
Why are you asking  for advice on girls
(
) Because we're his mistress
Steve laughs
'  - Steve is driving Andrew home
-new camera's working out for you, that's good
(') have to admit, though,  don't understand the filming thing
(
) told you, it's just my thing for right now
You don't feel like it's a little weird
Like it puts a barrier between you and everything
(
) Maybe  want a barrier
24
Okay
respect that
(
) My dad is actually a fireman, or was,  don't know
He got injured like two years ago, and now they just pay him out of, like, insurance
He doesn't do anything, mean he goes out during the day, but  don't know where
He drinks a lot
So how do you pay for your shit
(
) do computer repair, and stuff actually make a lot of money
What about your mom
(
) My mom has spinal meningitis, she's- she can't work or anything, and the insurance doesn't cover all of her medicine, so a lot of my money has to go into that
figure if  get enough on camera, maybe  can, dunno, get custody of her or something
Steve mulls this over
've actually been having some problems with my parents, too
(
) Yeah
Nothing like yours, though
Not- Never mind
There's a long beat
25
(') They've just been fighting a lot
think my mom is cheating on my dad
(
) That's intense
Yeah
know
'm actually, yeah, 'm sure my mom is cheating on my dad
(
) How- just, you know,  saw some stuff
It's weird, you don't think about your parents as like
people, or whatever
don't know
The two guys drive in silence
(') Don't tell anybody about that- (
) Haha no of course, no way
Good
- ' It's dark
We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house; "useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc
Andrew reaches over and turns off the camera
-   - Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers
See last night, alone,  got my whole bed off the ground
No nosebleed
Yeah,  was doing weights, too
26
Weights, like- Free-weights, a barbell
got up to two hundred pounds before bled
So it's, yeah, this is my theory- it's like a vagina
Like it's elastic, but if you stretch it too far too quick it'll tear- (
) Ew- And that's why we're getting better
We're loosening up
(
) Couldn't that metaphor just be for any muscle in the human body, like working out or- No,  like braingina
Braingina is the shiiiiit
Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid fires them into his mouth
(
) think it's time we took this out of the backyard
Matt and Steve look confused
' Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the back
If anyone criticizes you, just call them a hater
It's like calling someone a racist, they'll just drop whatever they're complaining about and be like "'
" Nobody wants to be a hater
27
- Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming
(') Just stay back a little ways, yeah- (
) got it
- The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an aisle where shoppers stand
(
) That girl, with the cart
frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling on the cart
It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it
We can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet
(
) She's chasing- she's chasing it- Toy aisle
toddler is looking at teddy bears
(
) got this
One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the little boy
The little boy is wowed
The teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air
Again the stifled laughter
(
) Oh my god Andrew, look- Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed
They're by the check out
28
(
) See that guy chewing gum
(
) Umm
(camera finds the guy) Got him
'm gonna get the gum right out of his mouth- watch this
There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy rack, which all crashes apart
The guys all crack up and start running
(laughing) ,
We don't need to run, we don't need to run
- Matt sits on the hood of a car
He and Andrew are flinging rocks with their powers
That was a good one, you got that one far
(
) Hey Matt
(beat) Do you like me
What
(beat) Sure, yeah
mean,  didn't, always- (
) Why not
Don't get mad,  mean,  like you now,  like you a lot
You're just, you're not super easy to talk to
You've got a lot of- 29
(
) You're an asshole
See, that's what 'm saying
You're hostile, man
(
) (beat) You know, you
If you hadn't invited me to that party, none of this would've happened
Yeah
(
) Thanks
Matt laughs
'  -  - - None of the guys are visible
They're filming a woman park her car
(
) just always feel like  miss stuff
(
) We were just sitting around throwing rocks, it was nothing
(
) Yeah, until all those chicks showed up
(
) What
Shut up
(
) Okay, here we go, here we go
(
) Are you sure there's no one around- (
) There's no one,  just looked, just go, ready
(beat) Ready
() 30
(
) (') Okay, Andrew, remember, get under it, you're the strongest, Steve get the sides, 'll get the front and back, we gotta do this quick
Countdown
Three
Two
One
The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately dips right
(
) (') Steve Steve Steve- (
) Got it, got it
Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then sets down, neatly in place
(')                   (
) , blood- - -   - Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his nose, soaked with blood
Steve is leaning nearby, with a brown paper napkin
(beat) My braingina is having like a
face period
Yeah, you got some from your ears, too
You've gotta start working it out more, Matt
Yeah man, in between my yoga
(
) You just need focus, Matt
Ha
(
) You're lucky you got the kleenex, 'm stuck with the taco bell wrapper
31
Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera
That's like, at least twice as much blood as  usually see on a taco bell wrapper
Guys, guys
Look
The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the space where her car was parked
She stops, baffled, and looks around
We hear the guys stifle laughter
She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it, looking around
Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she notices him, and stares
(
) (') Ignore us
(
) We're (beat) Mormons
The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car
'  - Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the back
It's raining
-sfucking insane, we just changed her life
We did- (
) Her face,  can't get her face out of my head
That was fucking great
mean, this just gives me so many ideas, already, stuff we could do- There's honking from outside
Oh come on, what is this
32
He's like right on your bumper, too
Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass
More honking
Can you fucking believe this guy
He's just some asshole redneck, look at him
He's fucking with us
They are driving out over a bridge in the woods
don't know what to do, what should - (
) (laughing) Here, take the camera, take the camera
He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting in the back seat
Behind him, through the back window, we can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close
(') Abracadabra
Andrew flicks his hand at the truck
The effect is instantaneous: , , ,
(
) what
The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side; everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can hear the guys are clearly freaked out
(
) What the fuck did you do, man, what the fuck- (
) didn't mean to,  didn't- 33
(
) Fuck
What's wrong with you, look at this, fuck
(
) Is he still in there
If he's in there we have to get him out- (
) Guys, just calm down, 'm sorry, okay- (
) Fuck that, take your fucking camera
The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge; the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet below
We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket
(
) You don't have to-  mean  can- Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the car
It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain
Andrew, just stop, just stop doing things
Steve dives off the side of the bridge
Andrew films him for a moment, swimming to the car
'  - Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very quickly
(
) Are you mad
Stop, just stop
Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the out of the water
They hurry out of the car
34
Steve has the guy on the shore
He's dazed and bleeding
-what happened, cause
don't know
my truck, my truck
(
) Is he okay
Steve just stares directly at Andrew
Andrew pans to reveal Matt, on a cell phone
Yes, just past White Crescent bridge
Down by the- yes- (
) Is that the cops, are you calling the cops
(ignoring him) Yeah, just come- no,  don't know
don't know, maybe internal bleeding, or- Later
The cops and an ambulance have arrived
An officer is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low
-looks like he'll be okay
Lucky you guys were here
Is that on
You can go ahead and turn that off
The camera shuts off
- Matt looks , while Steve just looks uncomfortable and freaked out
Matt's car is parked nearby
(
) don't see how you guys can be so angry- You don't see how we can be angry
You put a man in the hospital for fucksakes
You put a man in the hospital, you hurt somebody- 35
(
) He was being an asshole- he- didn't mean to- Which part of that do you mean, do you mean he was being an asshole, or was it an accident
Was it an accident, Andrew, cause you're the strongest
Listen, with this, we can't fuck around, ever
(
) Then what've we been doing, we've been fucking around- ,
That's- you can't use it on people, or hurt people like- Steve, help me out
Steve seems lost for words
(
) - We need rules, okay
Rule #1, you can't use it on living things
Rule #2, you can't use it when you're angry- (
) You can't just declare rules, you're not- will fucking declare rules, okay
If we keep going, and getting stronger, we need rules
We need rules
(beat) Damn it Andrew turn off the cam- - ' It's morning
The camera lays on the bed
Andrew can be heard breathing
36
The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it moves across the floor
It crawls up onto the side of the bed, then onto the sheets
Andrew's finger points at it
The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air
It hangs struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid
He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates into all of its component parts
They stop moving, hanging lifeless
Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider
Rings again
(
) (from downstairs) Andrew
Answer the fucking phone
'  - ' Andrew's filming Matt from shotgun
(
) Did he say what it was about
When he called, what did he say
Matt's quiet
(
) (') Are you still mad at me
'm not mad
(
) (beat) You seem mad
Power corrupts, is all 'm saying, man
What does that even mean
just mean that we have to think about things more now, okay
We can't just  things, we have to think first
understand
37
It's just- nah, nevermind, we're here
'  - The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated
Matt is walking up ahead of Andrew to the door
(
) Hey kids
Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around
Steve
Where are you
Steve is atop a power line pole, thirty feet in the air
Andrew and Matt look up at him from the ground
Just try it, it's easy
(
) That doesn't look easy
You throw yourself at the ground
You just fall, and catch yourself, and then it's easy,  swear
Don't try to jump or you'll flip yourself
Matt hurls himself at the ground,
Cut, and again, Cut, and this time he flips himself
(
) Let me try- Yeah
'm done for now
Matt's now holding the camera, showing Andrew
He checks the street for cars
(
) (') No cars, no cars, go
38
Andrew throws himself forward
And stops, hanging in mid air
Whoaaaamygod
whoaaa
Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole
, , , - At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky
Wind is very loud
The camera pans down to reveal we're , in a clearing between two larger cloudbanks
The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop
We can hear Andrew laugh
We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats and hats to keep warm
They're playing catch with a football
Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into a short dive to catch it
He looks up to see Steve and Matt distantly cheering and waving their approval
Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier
Matt does a few neater tricks in some clips
(
) Hey Matt, you're finally good at something
(loud) What
The wind
(
) said you're an idiot
Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs
39
It's about aerodynamics
If  put a barrier just in front of me, can go way faster, cause it cuts wind resistance
(
) can't hear a damn thing you're saying
Yeah
Definitely
Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away, near a large cloud bank
Matt is using his abilities to shape cloud fluff into an
There is a humming, rattling sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind
(
) Guys, do you hear that
Neither of the guys can hear him
Steve however stops in the distance, looking around
He shouts something, inaudible
(
) (') What
can't hear you
Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging
737
He's spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock
Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead
The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in some tall grass
Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting apart
They lay there, breathing hard
Andrew sits up, coughing; his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding
Steve suddenly leaps up
,
Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him
40
(') You saved   my life, dude
Andrew, you saved   my fucking life
Is that- Holy shit   is that the camera
You caught me (exhausted) - yeah- '
Matt touches down behind them, frantic
What happened, are you- Ahhhhh
Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground
(laughing) What the hell, what the hell- Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera
They're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging out
This is what people have wanted forever, since like caveman times
Do you understand,  mean do you- jesus christ,  can't even- Everything is fucking great Matt, listen, just say it
can fly
Shout it out man
(realizes it feels good) Matt stands, shouting out at the field
41
(') Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs
(
) '  -  - Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of Steve's house; empty beers are all around
All three are at least tipsy
Matt is up
Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat
(
) (flatly) No
All three crack up
That's cold, you're so cold Steve, dial me up- Steve immediately starts beatboxing
(') Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you wanna get high you ain't high as me, you chillin' at yo mom's house 'm at four thousand feet, cauuuse got those tight muscles, in my, braingina, and you better believe 'm a, frequent flyer, and you know don't need no turbines, ladies fly first class on Garrety airlines, my  is senior class, president, straight outta Oregon, gotta, represent, Matt Garrety bitches, 'm the young Clark Kent
42
Steve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow
The guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at each other; it's beautiful
We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man" by The Village People
'  -   - The guys are in that sleepy mode, now
Andrew's filming, but not really focusing on anything
Matt's sprawled out on a couch opposite him
Steve's in a chair nearby
But how does she not notice
Well,  mean, she notices that it's gotten better, definitely
You just have to be subtle
(
) That's so cool
Doesn't that count as breaking rule #1 though
Pfff, technicalities
Man,  haven't had sex since like
a year
(
) haven't had sex since ever
Ugh, man, you guys
how are you so cool
Liquid nitrogen
43
Later
Drowsier
Light's coming from the
The camera is laying haphazardly on Andrew
They're all nearly asleep, drowsy drunk
(') Hey guys, are you up
Yeah
(
) Today was like
the best day of my life
Like  was thinking and can't think of any day  liked better than today
There's a silence
(
) Yeah
Unanimous
Yes
Okay
good
Beat
Silence
-   - Time has passed; maybe two weeks
It's early
The hole is clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards
Well that answers that
(
) feel stupid now that  was scared to come back
Nah man, we were all-  mean, was, definitely, yeah
appears
Hey, you kids can't be here, okay
You gotta move on out
44
What
The ground is unstable, we're cordoning the whole place off
- Steve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table
(
) 'm live on scene here with Matt and Andrew, boys, can you tell us what's happening
Well, uh, it would appear that a Virgin Mary has appeared in the maple syrup on a young local man's pancake
In a second it will, wait
Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary
(
) That is, that is some very uh, definitely supernatural shit, going on there
Well, when  was really little, wanted to be police officer
(
) Oh, no shit
Fuck you, pig
No,  just really got into on the idea of altruism, you know
What's that mean
45
Like making things better for everyone
So what, you wanna do like, a charity
That's lame
(
) Why is that lame
dunno
mean, 'm not gonna- it doesn't matter, you know
'm never gonna get out of this piece of shit town
You know, we're all just little pieces
One person can't really make a difference
used to think- don't know
don't know
Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the camera; it plinks off
Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve
(
) So what's it feel like to be good at everything
'm not good at everything- (
) Name something you're bad at
'm not  at everything,  just do my best at everything
That's what it's about
mean you talk about philosophy and shit all the time, but you never really do anything
Have you even applied to colleges yet
'll get to it- 46
You could use some of that, man, 'm just saying
(
) Oh yeah
Well you could use some shut the fuck up
You lack initiative
You lack
a dick
- The guys are walking along
Andrew's holding the camera loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill
Matt gets a text
Shit man,  got my mom's birthday, gotta go
Say hi for me
Later dude
Matt turns and casually rockets off into the sky
(') What're you doing, where are you going now
Well  don't wanna go home yet
You wanna go into the city
Ah, dude, it's rush hour
So
There's a beat, and then Steve laughs
Hell yeah, dude
47
-       - They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes
It's fucking awesome
The city is beautiful
wish  could bring Samantha up here
She'd love this
(
) You still haven't told her
Nah, no way
She'd freak out
(') Mom's like, never home anymore mean, you saw how my dad is, he's just quiet
Sits around
don't know
And talking to him about it is just pointless
He's got nothing to say
(
) And it's bad, because her pain gets real bad, you know, and we can't afford the good meds anymore
When was little it wasn't as bad, but even then dad was still, you know, the way he is
don't know don't know anymore
don't know how to feel
It'll be fine, dude
You'll figure it out
(
) hope so
Hey,  wanted to ask you, winter break's coming up
You wanna do the talent show with me
Get you out there, you know, meet some new people
48
(
) No, -  mean, no, that's not- 'm really shy, and  don't have any talents, or- Yes you do, you have a talent, you have a talent
(
) (getting it) Oh, no way
No way- -  ' Sandra's in bed, sicker than ever
You look handsome
(
) Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's gonna do my hair
'm glad you are spending so much time with your friends
(
) Oh yeah, me too
Andrew's camera is down at his side
(
) -getting to school
don't know what you mean- (
) Don't bullshit me idiot
Matt doesn't come, he don't drive up
You leave the house, and who the fuck is giving you rides to school
Matt
49
No, wrong
Something's fucking going on with you, you can't hide it
Think you can slink around, sneaking- sneaking around the house, smiling,  know your shit
And we ain't got no more fucking money for your mother's pain medication, either
'm sorry, 'll try to- Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up
You're a fuck up
You fuck everything up
Put that fucking camera away- - At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around
It goes to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to normal
(
) (grumbling) Fuck
the stupid
The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's stage
group of kids are playing screamo music
Cut, a little later
girl is singing
Cut
Casey, the girl with the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty dancing
She's good
The camera lingers on her
(
) (') s'fuckin awesome
It's a few minutes later
"Techno-Syndrome" (
) begins to play
There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo, rushes out onto stage
The applause is , girls screaming, etc
He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew, also in a tuxedo
Mixed reaction from the crowd
Andrew's carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto the floor
Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in exasperation
50
Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands
There's a beat, and then the audience goes
(
) (') Yes
Fuck yes
Andrew is juggling, six balls at once
Steve is drinking a soda, and offers Andrew the soda
Andrew is annoyed
Steve pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda
Andrew stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and snatches away Steve's soda
Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have all the balls drop out of the air and hit him
The audience is
People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is
Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage, spilling water everywhere
Steve is pantomiming anger at the shoddy job he's doing
Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try
" Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the bucket flying out over the audience- -only for it to seemingly  back into the bucket
The place
Steve and Andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers, separately
Andrew bows again, and people freak out
We hear Matt cheering behind the camera
'  - Andrew's filming from shotgun
Just amazing dude- (
) You really think so- Are you fucking kidding, 've never seen a reaction like that in the auditorium, you guys- it was fucking like- it shook the building
You guys are rockstars
51
(
) Yeah, it did- it did feel like that
All the girls screaming- Ah, see, here's the first stage of your downfall, hubris
(
) What's that
What
(
) What's "hubris
" Seriously
(
) What "seriously," fuck you seriously
(laughing) 'm sorry, 'm sorry- (
) Hey Matt
(beat) What's "seriously" mean
It's a house party, raging
Steve's out on the porch with his girlfriend , 16, super hot, of course
Samantha runs down and embraces Andrew, knocking around the camera
(') Hi Matt
Hi Samantha
52
Everybody's freaking out, you've gotta come in here- We see shots of the house party, which is rocking
People keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome
" Or "You fucking rock
" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing is talking
This is , 16
She's a little drunk
Just fucking amazing
Magic is so hot
Do you know, me and my mom, in Vegas, went to a magic show, but they didn't have anything like that
(
) Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time practicing- Do you not remember me, at all
(
) What
We took American History together
(
) Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was different; it was blue, right
Yeah
(
) Monica, yeah- Yeah
Hiiii
More shots of the party, of Monica talking
She entreats Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team
little tipsy, Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch
It lays there
picks it up
53
And now, you get a special treat, 'm gonna film myself taking a piss
Matt snatches away the camera from him
Matt's walking around with the camera now he films people dancing, talking, a people taking shots
Casey passes, filming for her video blog
Matt's camera follows her, but then goes back to Steve, who's cheering on Andrew and Monica, who are of course dominating at beer-pong
But they take shots anyway
(drunk) Matt, you have the camera yeah
You have the camera, cause, don't let him forget the camera, okay
That's Andrew's camera
(
) Right on
Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up
Hey Matt, wanna blaze
(
) (beat) No, 'm good
'm just filming for Andrew
Andrew
He's upstairs in the bedroom hooking up with that, whatshername, hair girl
(
) Yeah, 'm a little drunk though
Movies
Makin movies
The stoner wanders off
(
) (') 'm making an experimental film
54
- Matt turns the camera around to film himself
Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing this
Congratulations, sir
'm drunk, sorry
was really worried about you, like, before everything, but  do feel like
(beat) feel like this will get better for you, man
'm sorry  haven't been there for you as much, you know, when we were growing up, because,  know you could be an angry
be an angry dude
But love you, you know
Detmer-Garrety extended family for liffffeeeeee
(beat) But listen when did  become the one who's
who's out alone filming myself, with the camera- Hey Matt
The camera spins to reveal her, and then immediately drops to Matt's side
(
) (') What were you filming
(
) Just a thing, it's nothing like- you know, Eye Of The Storm or anything- (
) You watch my blog
(
) - yeah, a lot of people do
've actually been stalking you since like, sophomore year- sorry, use of the word stalking- Stockings are why  love Christmas
You wanna get outta here
This place is too loud for me
55
Yeah, - - yeah, just gotta drop off the cam- Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off
- '  - We can hear it raining hard outside
The camera is laying on its side on the floor, and turns on when Andrew fumbles with it
There's screaming from downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds
Andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door
The camera lays on the floor
Time passes
(
) (faintly) Mom, it's going to be okay, okay
Just try to get through, it's going to be okay
Mr
Detmer enters, and notices the camera
He reaches down and picks it up
- In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence
The camera is being held off at an angle by Mr
Detmer, as Andrew tries to get it back
It moves around a bit, so Andrew and his father are both on/off screen
-think you can fucking use me, you're abusive, you're a fucking user little piece of shit
went through your camera
What'd you
You- what'd you see
Just you fucking being a drunk mess, spending my money, drinking with your fucking friends- 56
didn't spend any of your money, - Cause  don't have any fucking money to spend, it all goes to school for you, for medication for your mother- School doesn't cost any money,  go to public school you idiot- -now we can't afford your mother's pain meds anymore, up there screaming- did you just- what Mr
Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face
It knocks him down and clatters to the floor
(clutching his face) You asshole, you fucking crazy asshole- ' ,
Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and again, and again, and
Andrew backhands Detmer , flooring him
Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling it coolly on his father as he tries to stand
Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat, lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall
(') can't- can't move- Get- off- let me go- you're ,           hurting me- * Andrew turns and flings Mr
Detmer into the sofa, which flips on the impact
We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked, as he turns, runs out of the house, and 57
Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous above him
It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his body, lightning crackling inside the clouds
We can hear him breathing hard
He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit
(
) The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up to meet Andrew
(
) Where's Matt
We have to get down from here right now, Andrew
This isn't safe
(
) Where's Matt
Hung over, dude
You should be too
Let's just- (
) No
What the fuck are you doing
(
) 'm filming the storm, no one's ever filmed a storm like this up close bef- No, we're getting the fuck down, now
This is fucking crazy, Andrew- what- what happened to your face
(
) My dad- Your dad fucking beat the shit out you
Come on, we'll go to the cops, let's get out of here
He can't do that Andrew
() 58
(') This is not the way you handle it, we'll go together, let's go, he can't do that- (
) You don't give a shit, stop acting like you care
don't fucking care
You're my best friend, idiot
What
hang out with you and Matt practically every fucking day
You think  talk to anyone else about my parents, or my feelings on shit, are you that fucking insecure
(long beat) 'm an idiot
'm sorry Steve, oh god, 'm sorry- Dude, it's okay
You just need help, okay
Yeah, yes,  don't know what 'm doing- It'll be fine
But we've-
Do you hear that
hear
singing
, The boom of thunder is deafening
For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing
- It's a gray, dark day
funeral is in progress; we're filming from within the mourning party
59
large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a eulogy
Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and confined, back to how they were when we first started
We see Steve's mother and father
His mother is sobbing
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away
There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably
The camera passes Matt
Who's staring directly at us
Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones
(
) What are you doing
Filming graves,  don't get it
The camera looks up at Matt
He's keeping his distance
(') You're not returning my calls, why aren't you returning my calls
(
) 've been busy
No you haven't
Why aren't you returning my calls
Turn off the camera
(
) No
Turn off the camera
Silence
(') had a missed call from you, that morning
And from Steve listened to your voicemail
No voicemail from Steve
(
) was upset
60
(long beat) How do you get struck by lightning during a storm with no recorded lightning strikes
(waits, nothing) You can look that up online, you know, they keep track of it looked it up
Zero
And they find him out in a field, why would Steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm
The camera shifts a little
(
) don't know- What
(
) don't know- No, no, you do know, you do know, think you do know
(
) don't
What happened, Andrew
Just stop, stop lying to me, and tell me- (
) 'm not lying,  don't know what happened- don't believe you, okay
don't believe you,  want you to- put the fucking camera down
(
) No, why- Because  want to talk to you
Put it down- put it down, Andrew, please- put it down, turn it off, put the fucking- 61
Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull the camera away
He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew
The camera hangs limply for a moment
(') (breaking down a little) What did you do, Andrew
What am supposed to do
Who am  supposed to tell, about this, man
Who do tell
mean-  don't,  don't know how 'm supposed to- Why won't you just tell me what happened
The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing away from Matt
- ' The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror
Andrew suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife
(addressing the camera) -wanted to show you what  was talking about
Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm
He takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh of his wrist
He drags the blade down hard, all the way to his elbow
but no cut appears
He then violently jabs himself several times
but no penetration
(') See, it's-  put a little sheet between myself and the knife, and the barrier, the sheet, is too strong
The knife can't cut it mean like, what 'm saying is if concentrate,  can't be hurt can't be injured
Because of the little sheet
- Andrew sits alone on the bleachers
The cheerleaders are practicing
The camera zooms in on Samantha
She sits alone on the sidelines, watching numbly
62
- Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker
He's suddenly shoved into the locker roughly
The camera turns, revealing Wayne walking away
The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away
(
) Hey Wayne
What, you got a probl- One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly gushes blood
Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately tended to by other students
- Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one
They're Wayne's bloody teeth
(
) See, this one,  got clean, cause did a little lasso around the root, but these two, they're broken cause think  pulled them from the middle
Matt was always better at the little, the intricate stuff, he got good at that
See how broken it is, ugh, sloppy
-  ' Mike , 30s, serious but warm, sits across the desk from Andrew
The concern in his voice is very real
Could you put the camera away
(
) No, 'm filming this
film everything
63
understand that things have been very hard for you recently, Andrew, but the camera kind of- it alienates a little, you know
(
) What did you want to talk about
(beat) There's concern for your grades, Andrew
And as far as  know you've yet to apply to any colleges, so- (
) It's not doable
Financially, they're not-  mean, my dad didn't go to college either
Well, yes, but  still think it's worth thinking about
There are three different community colleges locally that offer great programs for- (
) don't need college, Mr
Fernandez
(beat) think that's a very close-minded attitude, Andrew
know that you come from a difficult background, and  know how horrible the pain can be when you lose a friend
But don't think you should let this make you lose hope
mean, this is your future
You don't want to compromise your future
(long beat) Andrew
- ' The camera is sitting on the floor
We can hear screaming from downstairs
Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the mirror, filming himself filming
After a beat, he steps out from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air
64
He stands looking at himself, and then the camera
The camera turns to face Andrew
He doesn't look good, but gives a weak smile
-
' We're peeking in through the door
We can see Sandra Detmer writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain
She lets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching
Richard is that you
Richard, you have to let me have my medicine, can't
Andrew
Who is that
Look, please come in here,  need help to turn over
It hurts, please, Andrew, you have to tell your father
tell your father to get my medicine
Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto her side
(') Andrew
thank you Andrew
was that you
Did you- The door closes
- The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old equipment
The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted
The area is lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but you can tell he's not supposed to be in here
Andrew moves out in front of the camera
He telekinetically pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily
He moves it left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down
Andrew is sitting, resting, tired
He speaks directly to the camera
65
've been doing a lot of reading, like you know, online, about evolution, and the way it works, and you know, natural selection
The uh
(cut) The strongest animals will always survive, and they're the ones that you know, will prosper, or grow, and survive, by feeding on the smaller animals
And as humans we- see, there's
uh- (cut) There's this thing called an Apex Predator, and basically what that is the most powerful predator in an ecosystem
And humans, you know, we're the apex predator, because there's nothing that preys on us, cause of weapons and stuff
But if something could,  bet it would
(cut) mean, what 'm trying to say is, a lion doesn't feel guilty when it kills a gazelle
You don't feel guilty when you squash a fly, you know-  think that means something
think it really means something
Andrew's back out with the car
He lifts it again, then makes a quick "squeezing" motion
As he does this, the car violently compresses down to the size of a basketball
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which collapses loudly
Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which bites him twice before he's able to fling it off
The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand, blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly
Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off
'
Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter
Higher resolution
66
'  - We're looking at the door to a bathroom, only a crack open
It's pushed open, revealing Matt, shirtless, brushing his teeth
(
) Casey runs up and hugs Matt from behind, startling him
'  -  - Matt is cooking; he's got four different things on the stove
(
) How'd the interviews go
told you how the interviews went
(
) But now we do it for the camera
(
) -                        Come on
not so good, Columbia was good, University of Miami was really good, Arizona State was okay
(
) Who ended up paying for all of the airfare
Did your parents- Haha, no,  told you they wouldn't
(
) Did you pay
Nope
Nobody
flew myself needed the exercise
(
) (beat) You are a man of mystery
Matt smiles
67
(
) (') God, how do you always cook so many things- Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her arms
(') (running away) They're at the breakfast table
Matt's eating, and Casey, filming, is talking between bites
(
) (') You have to do at least one of your tricks for the camera, though
am so sick of being filmed, you have no idea, Casey- (
) No  know, but 'm not going to use any of this
just want you to do a trick, one of your good ones
When do your parents get back from Spain
week
(beat) Okay, if you don't film me for one week- (
) Ahhhh- One week, 'll show you my new trick
guarantee you will shit bricks
Yeah
Ughhhh
68
'  - ' Matt's asleep in bed on a different day
Casey's filming from next to him
(
) (whispering) 'm filming you and you don't know
'm terrible
'm gonna show you this later and you're gonna be like "whaaaaaaaaaat
" '  - Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck- and-jive boxer dance
(
) You ready
'm ready
(
) Are you sure- Let's do it
Woo
Casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera
She fires
Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast
He holds up the caught paintball
(
) (awed) Holy shit, Matt
Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them effortlessly, then hurls them all into the air
Mid-air, they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera and Casey
(
) (laughing, awed) Matt, oh my god, oh my god
69
'  - '  - It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing Matt, groggy, half awake
(
) What happened
Ughhhh camera
had that dream again
(
) Tell me
It's like 'm
'm not me, 'm something else
And 'm out in this
out in space
And stars are all around me, and 'm zooming past them; everything is really like three-,  can see the shape of the stars
'm looking for somewhere to sleep, or something, and  see earth, and  go down to earth
And then
don't know, just the main part is that 'm out and there are the stars and they just look like millions of little points of light
And Steve is there
(
) Steve is there
Yeah but he feels like he's not part of it
Like he's there separately, inside my head
Andrew is there too
don't know
'm worried about Andrew
(beat, slyly) Why don't you put the camera away
(
) Oh yeah
What's gonna happen to me if  put the camera away- Oh  think you know
think you know what's going down
(
) We could leave the camera on
70
You arrrrreeee
'mere
Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side of the bed
We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly muffled by kissing
- The camera is aimed at Steve's tombstone
There are still flowers and memorials spread around
Some are rotting
The camera moves around a little, then back to Steve's tombstone
- '  - Screaming from Sandra's bedroom
The heater rattling
The from downstairs
There's a knock on the window
The camera is picked up, to reveal Matt floating outside, looking around nervously
After a moment, Andrew opens the window
Matt stands fidgeting, clearly uncomfortable, as Andrew films him
You haven't been returning my calls, so  thought 'd just
you know, ambush
(
) That's rude
just- 've been getting, you know, bad vibes or whatever
Andrew is silent
(') know you stopped coming to school, and my mom said you guys are having a lot of problems with money
'm worried about you
71
(
) Why
Your life's great- Dude, don't be like that, okay- (
) You don't need to worry about me
'm stronger than ever now
can lift a whole car by myself could fucking crush this entire house, 'm fine
That doesn't- that actually sounds like the opposite of fine
Andrew, come on, let's get out of here, your room's a mess, it smells like a Denny's bathroom in here
(
) So what
You're my cousin
You're my friend- it's my responsibility to take care of you
(
) think you should go
have to pick up my mom's medication
Are you going to break the rules
(beat) We're too strong now, Andrew
We're too strong for that
If you did that, you know 'd have to- (
) You'd have to what
You were always the weakest
You couldn't do shit to me
Andrew- (
) 'm not gonna break your stupid fucking rules, just fuck off and stay out of my life
72
Matt stands staring at Andrew
The camera fidgets uncomfortably
Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and then rockets off into the sky
The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window
The camera approaches the counter
Hello, how can  help you
(
) 'm here to pick up a prescription for Sandra Detmer
Um, yes, hold on
That's Imuran, Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin
(
) That's right
Okay, and the copay on that is
Seven hundred and fifteen dollars, eighty three cents
Silence
(
) have to come back
Okay, we'll hold it for you
- '  - Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave
His stereo plays David Bowie
Once his dad's car is gone, Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the mirror, and leaves the room
Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate
He opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform
We do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof inner lining is exposed
"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo
73
Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror, his back to the camera
He reaches down, and picks something up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head
It's a gas mask
He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless figure in the mirror
Looks right
Looks left
Adjusts the mask
Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly yanked across the room
-  - It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood
The streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in yellow orange haze
Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt
They clearly haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street
He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the house
It flies up and breaks a window
Costly, Howard and the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as they rapidly surround Andrew
He doesn't react
You are about to get fucking stomped, you know that right
You hear me son
Come to my house, it's late,  don't see any fucking police officers or some shit, don't know what you you think you're doing throwing shit at my house- No, wait, what the fuck
What the fuck are you dressed up like that for
Are you high
Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping right now,  don't even know, 'ma give your ass a wake up call- Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front of the camera
He makes the "gun sign
" 74
(') Oh you got a gat
got a gat too bitch- Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants
(
) (firing the finger gun) Bang
Howard's body abruptly   with a sickly loud chorus of cracks, and then is
The thugs, shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew telekinetically     , sending him smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car
Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him, breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's propelled face first into the ground,
Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of Costly, who skids to a halt
-no, no- Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls across the curb
We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but other than that, the night is silent
Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose money lift away from them, flying to him
There's a beat, and then Andrew launches into the air
- 80   - Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on one of the strut supports
The camera sits nearby, watching the expressionless figure as it counts the money
There's a beat and he hangs his head
We can hear muffled noises of frustration from under the mask
Something that sounds like a low, angry scream
Very suddenly, he dives off the tower
second later, the camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall
75
Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas station
He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards it
We transition to
Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio
We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station store
The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store
Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who says something, looking concerned
He's suddenly blown out of frame
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter, and floats over to Andrew
Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him; as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling
He goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun
Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells, raising the shotgun
Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as he's hit by a wave of energy
The shotgun blast goes wild, striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage
The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down
'
The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio from its damaged microphone
It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays motionless, burning
76
The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is horribly injured and screaming
His gas pump lays on the ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt
Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces himself to roll over
The fire on his body touches the fire on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump
The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station
The camera is spun violently out into the street- The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat distorted audio
The image is a little blown out
Andrew on a bed
His entire right side is absolutely scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper, blackened and red
The parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood
He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon
This is ensured by the handcuff on his left wrist
The machines beep
Andrew doesn't move
The door opens, and Mr
Detmer enters, speaking to a   on the other side of the door
-come down to the city, cause his mother's all alone right now
She's got ,  had to leave her at the house all a fucking alone
understand, Mr
Detmer
Shit
Jesus, look at this
Can have a moment with my son
Yeah - 'll be outside the door, yeah
77
Okay
The officer closes the door, and Mr
Detmer goes and sits down in a chair next to the bed
He sits there staring at Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in his hands
We    , and Detmer just sits like that
After five minutes of speed up, we slow down
(') want you to apologize to me
Andrew is comatose
(') said  want you to apologize to me
know you can hear me
So want you to sit up and apologize to me
want you to stop this bullshit right now
Andrew is comatose
(') Do you know how much this shit is going to cost me
Do you know what you've done to your family
(beat) You don't even care, do you
You just don't give a fuck, you've got your fucking morphine, don't you
There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt shoulder
Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on the monitor
(') Stop it
'm not buying this shit, you can't just play this off like a fucking (slap) Game, this is real
You really fucked me, me and your mother you know that, you little (slap) Shit
Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding molten welts
Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a quick pace forward and back
(') Goddamn it, goddamn it
- 78
Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up
Mr
Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air
He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes rigid
Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates into all of his component parts
They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground in a bloody mess
Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of agony, and then another, tearing at his
The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to the gore that was Andrew's father
They barely have time to scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and lets out    , blowing apart everything in the room including the camera
: '
'  - All of Casey's family is present, along with lots of little kids
Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother, who's being presented with a birthday cake
Matt looks happy
-appy birthday to you
Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she notices Matt abruptly duck out
She follows him to the bathroom
where he's holding his nose, which is bleeding badly
Matt- Do you hear that, how can you not hear that
79
In the background, we can hear the house phone ring
Then cell phones
Matt, what hap- The singing, how can you not hear that
Something's wrong, okay, something's wrong with Andrew, or- Matt, please, okay, you're scaring me, are you okay- No, something's wrong, something's wrong
Matt pushes past her, running upstairs
Casey starts to follow, but then stops, lowering the camera
'  (
) Casey, you have to come in here
Mom, Matt is- ' Come in here right now
Come in here right now
Casey's filming the big screen , which is showing the news
-going to have a feed live on the scene in the second, we apologize for the delay but as of right now every news helicopter in the greater Multnomah County is headed to Portland- again, right now we have very little information, but the word is that the bombings started just over nine minutes ago, and haven't subsided yet, with- okay, here's the feed from Chopper 5
We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland, everything seems okay, and then something streaks by, crashing headlong into the side of a building
80
The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete,
(
) Wait, that was- that was not a bomb- repeat, not bombings, it's something else- The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex
We hear another of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes back to the , revealing the big    sign in Old Town toppling down into the street
(
) need your car
(
) What
Matt, look, what's happening, look at what's happening- see,  know,  have to go, okay- (
) Don't leave, don't leave me- Give me your keys
(
) - Matt- '  - Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now, unimportant
(
) Please don't leave, don't go- We hear helicopters pass low overhead
have to go to the city
(
) , - 81
can't fly if there are all these helicopters in the air,  just have to drive there, or, listen,  have to figure this out, Andrew's in trouble
This is my fault
(
) Andrew
What are you talking ab- Matt gets in the car and starts it
Casey's breaking down, openly crying now
(
) (') Matt please
, ' , '
' ,
'  - Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives
His face is unreadable
They're driving on the -5
More helicopters
Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires
Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap
This is all my fault
No
No it isn't
It isn't your fault
We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt
(') Matt, it's not safe
It's not safe
What's going on
What's happening
Why are we doing this, Matt, please
Please take me home
You don't have your license, you can't drive without your license
They're getting into downtown now
We can hear sirens
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal, until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky
82
(') How- how is that possible, that's not possible- There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains down onto the car
Matt slams on the brakes, looking up through the windshield, searching the sky
Where are you, man
There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on the passenger's side, next to Casey
Listen, you can't be here,  need you to turn this car around right now and- The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away
Casey screams
What's
What is
What's
Matt please, please- The car     , straight up, flipping end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet
Casey's breathing is painfully short and sharp
Matt stares out into the night sky
He flicks on the brights
There's Andrew, in his hospital gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain
news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight
His eyes flash to the car
(screaming) The windshield is  , and seconds later , taking his seatbelt with him
No 83
The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew, plummeting down, down, down
Casey's screams are barely audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to her death
And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting, the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans
Stillness
Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her adidas
and Matt's high-tops
(
) Stay here, okay
You have to stay here
(
) (barely coherent) You can fly
(
) Stay here
have to talk to Andrew
(
) Matt
what
(
) Casey, 'm sorry, 'm so sorry
Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame
(
) Matt wait
: In the following sequence, everything is seen in glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing
Much of what happens should be seen through implication, rather than direct effect
Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can fully keep track
The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio, meaning no narration from the reporter
There are several chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and we intercut as necessary
84
The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's floating hunched over, vomiting
Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew shoves him away
We're too far away to hear anything that's said
Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something
Matt, clearly upset, replies
Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures towards his burns
Matt tries to reply several times, but Andrew isn't hearing it
Matt smiles nervously at the destruction, and says something gently
Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a radical shift in Matt's demeanor
He's no longer concerned; he seems repulsed
Andrew says more, clearly  at Matt
Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents
Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something to his right
, Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper; a mailbox comes
'
is, along with several other people from his building, out on his roof
He watches in horror as the helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of frame
Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes
(
) Oh, oh no, those people, man, those people, oh god- '  (
) Where's the other guy
(
) He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh shit oh shit- Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded bird, crashing into the roof
He vomits again, mostly bile; everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in pain and rolls over
85
He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears
(agonized, crying) No one's gonna help me
No one's gonna help me now
We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones, etc on the roof
Some people scream and try to run past Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins, which leads to more screaming
Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto
(
) Please man, please,  don't know you man- (mumbled) What type of camera is that
(
) (breaking down) What
don't know,  don't know you man,  didn't- please okay, please- Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly , blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour
The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a halt when The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys fighting for their lives
Matt gets the upperhand, decking Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop car (our ), lifts off
, crashing out the camera as he turns and creates a telekinetic wall
86
'
, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent , and we glimpse it as it passes her window, lights still flaring
Her sister rushes up, looking out the window
(
) Sissy stay away from the window
What's happening what's happening- (
) They're right out there fighting
They're- Andrew and Matt come ,
-'
The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the apartment building
Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc
But Matt's too good a flyer
What he doesn't block he simply dips and weaves around
Andrew, clearly still woozy, is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on the asphalt
- They're down
One of them just went down
Jesus christ
Matt slowly lands nearby
The camera zooms in and hits them both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand
We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth and ears
He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly covered with injuries
He looks like he's been in a car wreck
- (') Oh shit, look at him
87
He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently
Andrew just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to stand, like a wounded dog
Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading and taking cover
One of them advances on Matt and Andrew, gun raised
Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective, pleading, raising his hands
The cop is clearly panicked
He fires a shot
Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain, holding his hand, which is gushing blood
Andrew blasts the Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands
officers backwards
- (') Oh jesus christ
Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely terrifying
Matt turns and     , Andrew following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air
-' ---
We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared and looking for answers
fixes herself, preparing to speak
Are we
Okay, yeah, gimme- two, one- We're live on the scene on Parson Boulevard just south of the center of downtown, and- There's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner
The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman man running to see what the sound is
(') Shawn, wait, you're unplugged
Shawn- Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man, Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a pinball until- 88
5'
-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing downwards as though shot out of a cannon
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to the ground
Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops down at a broken, dead angle
Andrew lands nearly as badly, lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him
' The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street
Andrew writhes
Matt is motionless, blood pooling around him, his back broken
,  , ,
bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue
Matt and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and news helicopters hang overhead
Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a perimeter and pushing in
We're with them as they approach; the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting back and forth to each other
Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots
Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and he shakily raises both hands
The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are telekinetically lifted into the air
They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their limbs go rigid
We've seen this before
Andrew screams, and then
It all happens in under two seconds: 89
Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard, first through Andrew, then into the pavement
Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out, striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly
All of the floating people drop, dazed
Matt collapses
After a moment, the police advance
The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear, with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the top and bottom of the screens
Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room
At the far end is a blackened out two way mirror
There's a camera on the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable expressions
There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of the chair
It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical attention
To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things, massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back
He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the cameras
He is barely coherent, screeching in agony
Please
Help me
Help me,  , please
'm sorry
'm so sorry, tried- help me, help me, 'm dying, 'm dying
Stars-  see stars, somebody- It hurts, please
'm- the blood
tried
Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some kind of radiation sensors
They go over to Matt, scanning him
90
(') Listen, help me, help me
'm dying, you have to help me, don't just let me-  '
'm - The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his eyes going wide
(') can
can hear the singing
Matt entirely stops moving
He lays there, not breathing, completely still
And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the table and the chair
There are a series of grotesque popping and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees
The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves
His broken bones have already molded back into place
His bruises are shrinking away to nothing
The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking military personnel, along with several men in civilian clothes
Matt stares at them
They stare back at him
4- (terrified) Listen
Son, you don't-  mean
Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops
Would you please
turn off the fucking cameras
: (2 ) 91
We see a variety of international reporters covering a breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in multiple languages
Behind them are various shots of a huge hydroelectric dam in South Korea
-expected to burst at any moment- City officials blame the malfunctions on the terrorist bombing that occurred at the dam's control center last March
- Botched evacuation has left thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's residents trapped, with only one major roadway leading in or out roadway that has not been repaired in over ten years- Again, the scale here is just unprecedented
Our hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee tonight

-' Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s, as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle
Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room, crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down the camera
They're in the car, driving fast through town
All around we can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the road up ahead
They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped into gridlocked, dead-end traffic
Kim Hai-Su's father begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which triggers his younger brother crying again
Kim shouts to calm down
Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting out of their cars, hopelessly trapped
Someone screams, and Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away
92
Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which splits further
Kim yells in fear
The crack widens, an enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the side of the hills into the valley
Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange, when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead
All around them people  into cheers
It's not fear, but rather a kind of frantic ovation
The camera sweeps up, panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest on Matt Garrety
Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway
He pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder
" This gets the intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting " " He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the first time, mouths "Oh shit
" Points at the flood casually as it closes in: " should deal with this
" Another huge ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh
" and turns
There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing into the distance over the flood
After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane, embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars
Kim's father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his lungs
The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and down, screaming, smiling
