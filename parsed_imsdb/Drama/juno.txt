Written by Diablo Cody - MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision, facing the curb
It's
Juno is sixteen years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid
She winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun
The object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by its former owners
There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger
(
) It started with a chair
- -'-  - - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow
He's sitting in an overstuffed chair
She slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap
60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player
Do you know how long 've wanted this
Yeah
Wizard
- barks, jarring Juno back to reality
Quiet, Banana
Hey, shut your gob for a second, okay
We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set
The dog yaps again
(
) This is the most magnificent discarded living room set 've ever seen
She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand
: Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of juice
We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly on a mission
- Finally, a panting Juno arrives at    on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk
The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed serious face
She carelessly flings the empty juice container over her shoulder and onto the curb
group of with skateboards near the entrance glare at her
She enters the
- , the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from behind the counter
He wears a polyester uniform vest
Well, well
If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog
Back for another test
think the last one was defective
The plus sign looked more like a division sign
Rollo regards her with intense skepticism
remain unconvinced
Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach
This is your third test today, Mama Bear
Your eggo is preggo, no doubt about it
An eavesdropping   wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle
Three times
Oh girl, you are way pregnant
It's easy to tell
Is your nipples real brown
pile of stolen  falls out of the girl's jacket and clatters to the floor
Balls
Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping
It's obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently
Maybe you're having twins
Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice
Silencio
just drank my weight in Sunny
and  have to go, pronto
Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key
Juno races down one of the aisles
Well, you know where the lavatory is
(calling after her) You pay for that pee stick when you're done
Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine
Jesus,  didn't say it was
Well, it's not
You're not a lion in a pride
(to himself) These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights
-  - In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles
She clumsily tries to use the pregnancy test
We see the test box sitting on the sink
It's a TeenWave Discount Pregnancy Test
The accompanying outdated package photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression
The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz Lightening Hair Spritz
" -   - Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the open test box on the front counter
Rollo scans it and bags it indifferently
Oh, and this too
She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle
Minus or plus
(examining stick) don't know
It's not
seasoned yet
Wait
Huh
Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again
God, it's unholy
She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the results
Shake
Shake
Nothing
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch
This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet
- Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope
She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose
Juno trudges toward her
The yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wild flowers
- '  - Juno's  is decorated with punk posters: The Damned, The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc
She picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend, '  -  - 's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard
The  rings
(answering phone) Yo-yo-yiggity-yo
am a suicide risk
Is this Juno
No it's Morgan Freeman
Got any bones that need collecting
Only the one in my pants
(in low tones) Dude, 'm pregnant
Maybe it's just a food baby
Did you have a big lunch
It's not a food baby
took three pregnancy tests today
am definitely up the spout
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests
drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight
Anyway, yeah
'm pregnant
And you're shockingly cavalier
Is this for real
Like for real, for real
Unfortunately, yes
Oh my God
Oh shit
Phuket Thailand
That's the kind of emotion  was looking for in the first take
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion
You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke
know
Women Now,  guess
The commercial says they help women now
Want me to call for you
called for Becky last year
Eh, 'll call them myself
But  do need your help with something very urgent
- Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well manicured suburban lawn
They make a formidable team
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point
That is sick, man
Leah busts a gut laughing
It's a stunningly accurate portrayal of Bleeker's parents
So, you were bored
Is that how this blessed miracle came to be
Nah, it was a premeditated act
The sex,  mean, not getting pregnant
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class
-   -  - () Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a teacher lecturing about spanish
Bleeker discreetly pushes a to Juno with his foot
She picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently
- Aha
You love him
It's extremely complicated, and 'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state
She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands
She's wearing her father's
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod
It was magnificent, man
'  - of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed
of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands
of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide
- '  -  - of a   warming in the microwave
- steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice
He wears a cross country uniform that reads "
" He is eating some kind of microwaved snack gimmick
Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him
She has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously
Hey Bleek
Hey, cool tiger
Looks proud
Yeah,  swiped it from Ms
Rancick
Cool
Your shorts are looking especially gold today
My mom uses color-safe bleach
Go Carole
(a beat) So, guess what
(shrugs) don't know
'm pregnant
Stunned silence
Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner and leans back comfortably
guess so
(fidgeting) What are you going to do
The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of warm-ups
Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves
They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno
(
) When  see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts,  always picture them naked, even if  don't want to
have intrusive thoughts all the time
- 'm supposed to be running
know
There's an awkward silence
So, what do you think we should do
thought  might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse
Because  heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant
Yeah, typically
That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant
So that's cool with you, then
Yeah, wizard,  guess
mean do what you think is right
'm real sorry  had sex with you know it wasn't your idea
Whose idea was it
'll see you at school,
She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off
(to nobody in particular) Whose idea was it
- Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it
In the background, a group of 3  play a live-action
You did not
You don't have the armor
That Orc Armor you bought from the wizard doesn't have the power level to parry my hit
-  - Juno tries to push through the masses, but the throng of students is thick and unwielding
-  - Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop in his heyday
She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook
few pages slip out
(the same asshole who harassed her as she walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway
Hey, your book fell apart
Yeah
It must have looked at your face
He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along
(
) The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me
Jocks like him always want freaky girls
Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and Goth makeup
Girls who play the cello and wear Converse All-Stars and want to be children's librarians when they grow up
Oh yeah, jocks eat that shit up
We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings
(
) They just won't admit it, because they're supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like Leah
Who, incidentally, is into teachers
We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher,
(from a distance) Me too
love Woody Allen
-   - bustle in, as the teacher,
tries to maintain order
Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag
People
We're doing our photomagnetism lab today, so find your partner and break out into fours
Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: Bleeker
Sound the gong of awkwardness
Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab station and unpack their bags in silence
Well
Nothing like experimenting
did the prep questions for this lab last night
You can copy my answers if you need to
He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without looking at her
Oh,  couldn't copy your work
But you copy my work every week
Oh yeah
'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh
don't mind
You definitely bring something to the table
Charisma
Or something
The other two  , a humorless couple, join them at the station
So, who's ready for some photomagnificence
have a menstrual migraine, and can't look at bright lights today
Amanda,  told you to go to the infirmary and lie down
You never listen
No Josh,  don't take orders
Not from you and not from any man
You know, you've been acting like this ever since  went up to see my brother at Mankato
told you, nothing happened
Something happened
Because your eyes
Are very cold
They're very cold, Josh
They're cold, lying eyes
What
My eyes are not lying
Yes they are, Josh
Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes
Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple
Okay
'm going to set up the apparatus
Juno, want to get a clamp out of that drawer
'm going to the infirmary
Good
Call me when you're  the rag
Fine
Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's
Good, 'll be sure to do that, Amanda
'll make a note of it
He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook
Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor of Boone's
Right, Bleek
Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus
stalks off dramatically
Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook
- '  - Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a distraught   clutching her head in a moment of staged conflict
The ad reads: "Pregnant
Find the clinic that gives women choice
Women's Choice Health Center
" Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials
For a moment, she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad, checking herself out in the mirror
(talking along with voice prompt) "Para instruciones en Espanol, oprima numero dos
" She presses a few buttons in succession
Yes, hello,  need to procure a hasty abortion
What was that
'm sorry, 'm on my hamburger phone and it's kind of awkward to talk on
It's really more of a novelty than a functional appliance
She  the phone a couple of times
Better
Okay, good
Yeah, as  said, need an abortion, two
sixteen
Um, it was approximately two months and four days ago that  had the sex
That's a guestimate
Okay, next Saturday
Great
She hangs up the phone
(
) hate it when adults use the term "sexually active
" -  () in slo-mo puts a condom on a banana
(
) What does that even mean
Can deactivate someday, or is this a permanent state of being
guess Bleeker went live that night we did it
guess he hadn't done it before, and that's why he got that look on his face
'  - -'-  - () We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering: he's comically wide-eyed with shock
-   - Juno, her father , her stepmother , and sit at a very typical kitchen table, eating dinner shovels food while chatting about his day
You should have seen this octopus furnace
had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there
(
) My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average specialist
He and my mom got divorced when  was five
She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona
: (
) with her new husband and three replacement kids
Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day
- '  - festering in a corner of Juno's room
(
) And 'm like, "Thanks a heap, Coyote Ugly
This cactus-gram stings even worse than your abandonment
" -   - is cutting up ' food diligently
Her nails are brilliant, holding the silverware
(
) That's my stepmom, Bren
'  - Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog
(
) She's obsessed with dogs
'  - Bren's nail salon in all its glory
(
) owns a nail salon called Bren's Tens
'  - Bren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat
(
) and she always smells like methylmethacrylate
-   - Liberty Bell coughs pitifully as Bren leans over her plate
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night
Which maneuver, sir
The one in which moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which  cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes
Bren speaks in her strong city accent
Juno
Did you happen to barf in my urn
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one  got up in Stillwater
found some weird blue shit,  mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning
would never barf in your urn, Brenda
Maybe
did it
We see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her dinner
Liberty Bell, if  see one more Baco on that potato, 'm gonna kick your monkey ass
'   - Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic
There is a lone  , a teenager of Asian descent holding a hugely oversized sign that reads " " (chanting in extremely shy, accented voice) All babies want to get borned
All babies want to get borned
Juno recognizes the  as a classmate of hers
Uh, hi Su-Chin
- Oh, hi Juno
How are you
Good
'm good
(pause) Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet
- No, not yet
tried to work on it a little last night, but 'm having trouble concentrating
You should try Adderall
- No thanks
'm off pills
Wise move
know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once
She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah
'm a kraken from the sea
" - heard that was you
Well, it was nice seeing you
She continues on toward the clinic entrance
- (calling out) Juno
Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know
It can feel pain
And it has fingernails
Really
Fingernails
She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door
'   -  - The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass
The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant women, teens and ill-behaved children
Welcome to Women's Choice, where women are trusted friends
Please put your hands where  can see them and surrender any bombs
Juno flashes her best jazz hands
Hi
'm here for the big show
Your name, please
Juno MacGuff
The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some paperwork on a clipboard
(
) She thinks 'm using a fake name
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa
The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen
need you to fill these out, both sides
And don't skip the hairy details
We need to know about every score and every sore
The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's clinic  , and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers
Would you like some free condoms
They're boysenberry
No thank you
'm off sex
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse
They make his balls smell like pie
Congrats
She takes a seat in the   and rifles through a pile of old magazines
The magazine selection is lots of "mommy mags" and health related periodicals
She selects an issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few moments
Then she looks over and notices the  of a nearby teen, who looks as nervous as she does
The girl bites her thumbnail and spits it onto the floor
Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails
Suddenly, she sees fingernails
The receptionist clicks her nails on the front desk
Another woman blows on her fresh manicure
Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their fingers somehow
Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken
: Excuse me, Miss MacGoof
There's no answer
We see that Juno's chair is
The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door drift shut
Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she tears off down the street, running as fast as she can
'  - Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno standing sheepishly on the porch
Leah sighs
What are you doing here, dumbass thought  was supposed to pick you up at four
couldn't do it, Leah
It smelled like a dentist in there
They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub
And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails
Fingernails
Oh, gruesome
wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out
'm staying pregnant, Le
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere
She doesn't know we're sexually active
What does that even mean
Anyway, got to thinking on the way over was thinking maybe  could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing
You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something
Or some nice lesbos
But then you'll get huge
Your chest is going to milktate
And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant
know
Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break
Bleeker and  were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break
Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads
see them all the time in the Penny Saver
There are ads
For parents
Oh yeah
"Desperately Seeking Spawn
" They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment
It's totally legit
Come on, Leah
can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver
That's tacky
That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch
- Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park
They slurp giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers
Juno has her pipe with her
The Penny Saver sucks
Yeah, but it sucks for free
They turn the pages in silence for a moment
Their lips and teeth are Windex-blue
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other
" (checks to see that Juno is paying attention) "All that's missing is your bastard
" (reading a different page) There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano
Free for the hauling
We should put it in Bleeker's yard
You're not listening to me
No,  heard you
just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome
" 'm looking for something a little edgier
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest
was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass
But 'm trying to not be too particular
All right, how about this one
"Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five
You will be compensated
Help us complete the circle of love
" Yeesh, they sound like a cult
Besides, they're greedy bitches
They already have three kids
Hey, Juno
Juno
Look at this one
She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look
Juno scans the ad silently
We see the ad
It contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles
It reads "Educated, successful couple wishes to
" (
) They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white
- '  - We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish curtains -- and the light on inside
'  - '  - Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same  from when he and Juno went all the way
He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep yearbook
We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten message from Juno
We hear Juno's voice reading the message: (
) Hey Bleeker
Spank off to this with motion lotion
Just kidding (kind of
) Your best friend, Juno
Bleeker picks up the phone
It's the same Juno has
He reconsiders and puts it down
There's a knock on the bedroom door
'  pokes her dowdy head inside
' Paul
Are you coming downstairs to eat
don't think so
' You ran eight miles today, Puppy
'm not hungry, oddly
' But it's breakfast for supper
Your favorite, Paulie
made French toast and sausage
Patties, not linkies, just like you like it
Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach
' Juno MacGuff called while you were out running
She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday
Thanks for the message
' You know how  feel about her
You've mentioned it about fifty times
' just hope you don't consider her a close friend
Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door
We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of  in one hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends
-   - Bren and  are seated on the couch
Leah is standing nearby for reinforcements
Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out how to break the massive news
have no idea how to spit this out
Hon, did you get expelled
No
The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion
Well,  was just asking
It seemed plausible
Do you need a large sum of money
Legal counsel
No, no, 'm definitely not asking for anything
Except maybe mercy
Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me
What have you done, Junebug
Did you hit someone with the Previa
Best to just tell them, man
Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed
'm pregnant
Bren and Mac are predictably speechless
Oh, God
But 'm going to give it up for adoption
already found the perfect people
Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened
You're pregnant
'm so sorry, you guys
If it's any consolation,  have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and  haven't gone number two since Wednesday
Morning
(interrupting) didn't even know you were sexually active
Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term
Who is the kid
The baby
don't know anything about it yet
only know it's got fingernails, allegedly
Nails
Really
No,  mean the father
Who's the father, Juno
Oh
It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker
Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter
What
Paulie Bleeker
didn't know he had it in him
(giggling) He just doesn't look, well, virile
know, right
Okay, this is no laughing matter
(indignant) No, it's not
Paulie is virile, by the way
He was very good in
chair
Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno
Did you say you were thinking about adoption
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years
We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section
Bren looks understandably alarmed
Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate
But they have a real lawyer and everything
'm going to meet with them next weekend
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do
Probably tougher than you can understand right now
Well, 'm not ready to be a mom
Damn skippy, you're not
You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds
Once
And she didn't die, if you recall
Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative
Leah and Juno exchange glances
No
Well, you're a brave young lady
You're made of stronger stuff than thought
You're a little Viking
Cool it
First things first, we have to get you healthy
You need prenatal vitamins
Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus
Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment
Find out where you're going to deliver
The term "deliver" is so weird
Can we not say "deliver"
How does "crap it out" sound
Juno,  want to come with you to meet these adoption people
You're just a kid
don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts
Sure, Dad
Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally
thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when
have no idea what kind of girl am
(sensing tension) Why don't you girls go upstairs for a while
think Mac's gonna blow
Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs
Just tell it to me straight, Bren
Do you think this is my fault
Her mother's fault
think kids get bored and have intercourse
And  think Junebug was a dummy about it
But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out
'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop
And Juno's not going to be a ma
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation friggin' hope
(conspiratorially) Did you see it coming when she sat us down here
Oh God yeah
But  was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs
That was my first instinct too
Or Anything but this
And 'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time  see him
Oh Mac, no
He's a sweet kid
You know it wasn't his idea
Mac shrugs in agreement
- Music plays as we see     ' preparing the house for Juno's arrival -- Sprucing a vase of
Straightening a   of the Lorings
Dusting off a table with one of those  for furniture
Lining up a shelf of
-  - The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated community
Mac pulls over and parks on the curb
-   - Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic McMansion
The entire yard is unlandscaped soil
Mac presses the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably
Both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them
opens the door
She's a pretty, meticulous woman in her early thirties
Very Banana Republic
Hi
'm Vanessa
You must be Juno and Mr
MacGuff
'm Vanessa
Vanessa, right
Hello
Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home
Oh no
Thank you
Come on in
-  - Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home
Can  take your coats
Sure
She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way
Super classy
Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background
Like 'm really going to fall for that, you know
You found us in the Penny Saver
appears next to Vanessa
He's a boyishly attractive guy in his mid-thirties
He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno
Hi
'm Mark Loring
'm the husband
-   - Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious living room
woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss
(in exaggerated, growling German accent) Geeeerta Rauuuss
(straight) Nice to meet you
Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily
'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course, is my daughter Juno
Like the city in Alaska
No
Cool
Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit
'll get drinks
What would everyone like
've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water
Maker's Mark, please
Up
She's joking
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts
also have good teeth
No cavities
We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk
She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate
Vanessa stares, unflappable
We're fine, thank you
Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch
So, Juno
First off, how far along are you
'm a junior
No,  mean in your pregnancy
Oh
Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said  was twelve weeks
Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray
Oh, that's marvelous
So you're almost into your second trimester, then
Yeah, apparently
'm having it on May 4
The tough part's almost over for you
mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest
Yeah, but  hardly noticed it
'm more worried about the part where have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front
think pregnancy is beautiful
Well, you're lucky it's not you
Vanessa's looks to the ceiling
(clearing throat) So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this
thing
Well,  just have the baby and give it to you, right
Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption
(protective) Wait
What does that mean
It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up
Of course, Juno's legal rights would be terminated
Whoah
don't want to see pictures
don't need to be notified of anything
Can't we just kick it old school
could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way
You know, like Moses in the reeds
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament
Mark and Juno lock eyes
Yeah
Yeah
The way people used to do it
Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then
Shit, yeah
Close it up
Vanessa is clearly ecstatic
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses
Are you looking for any other compensation
Excuse me
Well, no
'm not going to sell the baby
just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents
'm in high school, dude
'm ill-equipped
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married
want to be a mommy so badly
Juno and Mac stare at her
You don't say
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something
Yes
Heating and air conditioning
Well,  was born to be a mother
Some of us are
Mark, are you looking forward to being a dad
Mark is caught off guard
Sure, why not
mean, every guy wants to be a father
Coach soccer, help with science projects and don't know
Fatherly stuff
Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork
Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents
Can  use the facilities first
Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit
Sure
The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs
Go up, then turn left and on your right
Room with a toilet, got it
- / - Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs
We see a posed photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell
Their house is beautiful, but frigid
Juno rubs her arms, shivering
-  - The Loring's bathroom is huge
Juno flushes and goes to the double sink to wash her hands
She opens the overhead cabinet and sees Vanessa's toiletries
She spritzes on some perfume and examines the more expensive grooming items
There's a crinkled tube of  in the cabinet
Juno picks it up, fascinated
She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs it through her hair like pomade
-   - Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly  into Mark
Whoops
Yikes,  didn't expect to see you up here
Sorry
was just getting something
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me
What
No
Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised
could be a total klepto, for all you know
don't get a klepto vibe from you
Evil genius
Maybe
Arsonist
Wouldn't rule it out
did steal a squirt of perfume
What do you think
It's Clinique Happy
She holds her  up to Mark's twitching nostrils
Smell those sparkling topnotes
Mark inhales
Am  supposed to feel happy now
You should be happy, Holmes
'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life
Sweet, screaming, pooping life
And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in
Viscera
Blood and guts
We'd better get back downstairs
Juno mocks his use of "" silently
(halting) Wait a minute
Is that a Les Paul
Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar
We see  mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters
Oh
That's, uh, my room
Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house
She's got you on a long leash there, Mark
Shut up
- ' ""  - The walls are plastered with   of early-90s alt rock bands
(Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc
) Mark removes his   from its moorings and hands it to Juno
It's beautiful
've always liked Gibson better than Fender
What do you play
rock a Harmony
(holding back a chuckle) Oh
What
'm a pawn shop rocker
Sorry
swear 'm not a gear snob
Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely
What is that, Mahogany
What happens if you crack the neck
Tell me about it
used to play in a really tight band back when  lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins
do you know who the Melvins are
(lying) Yeah
Well, we were playing with them and busted this guitar onstage
It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed
When was this, like '96
'93
'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll
Nuh-uh, 1977
Punk Volume 1
You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic
You weren't even alive
-   - Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence for Juno and Mark to return
Mac notices a brand new sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room
So
What's that thing
Pilates machine
What do you make with that
You don't make anything
It's for exercising
- '   - Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged
They play little riffs
He teaches her a couple chords
-   - My wife just ordered one of those Tony Little Gazelles off the , you know, from the guy with the ponytail
Vanessa and Gerta have no response
That guy just doesn't look right to me
Suddenly, a shriek of  , followed by loud, discordant   can be heard drifting down from upstairs
Vanessa's looks to the ceiling
(to her guests) Will you excuse me
- '   - Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing
"Doll Parts" by Hole
(quietly singing together) "Yeah, they really want you
they really want you
they really do
" Building together
(singing together and connecting) Yeah, they really want you
they really want you
and  do to
(both blush) appears in the doorway
Juno immediately puts down the guitar
Mark doesn't notice her immediately
(passionate singing) (notices Vanessa) Oh, sorry honey
Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up
You guys are playing music
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here
Your guitar is named Kimber
Yeah
That's all right
My axe is named Roosevelt
After Franklin, not Ted
Franklin was the hot one with the polio
think Gerta is waiting for us downstairs with some important stuff for us to go over
Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall
He and Juno exit the room, chastised
Vanessa looks to Mark in question
Didn't mean to interrupt the jam sessions
-  - Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving
Gerta hands Juno the
Vanessa and Mark trail behind
So, look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions
Juno, we'd really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, other things of that nature
Oh
Sure
Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this
Mac  at Juno gravely
Yeah
For sure
like you guys
Juno looks at Mark
How sure
Percentage-wise, would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure
Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor
'm going to say 'm 104% sure
Oh really
Look, if  could give it to you now, would
But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know
think that's a great idea
That's great, right
Stellar news
Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll hear from you soon, all right
All right, take care of yourselves
Juno and Mac exit
Mark shuts the door
All is silent in the foyer
Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless
Gerta pumps her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration
(overly aggressive) All
Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely
- It is now
The   jogs in formation, leaving tracks in the snow
Those bastards never stop running
-  - Bleeker is running alone on the track
His exhalations are icy puffs in the air
Bleeker's friend  jogs up alongside him
Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker
Hey man
Oh, hey Vijay
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant
Yup
Just like our moms and teachers
Yup
Did you hear it's yours
Yup
What a trip, man
don't really know anything about it
You should grow a moustache
You're a real man now
can't grow a moustache
It never comes in evenly
Me neither
But 'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count
See you
jogs off
Bleeker  and wipes away his sweat
-   - We're looking over Juno's now     to a school administrator filling out a slip
Juno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way out
-  - Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker
Hey Juno
couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids
Sorry, Bleek
Going for my ultrasound
Gotta note and everything
Okay, cool
'll try to drop by later
'  - We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's exposed pregnant belly
An   is using a Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump
Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image
The tech takes measurements and types them into her database
That's the feet
Oooh
And there's a hand
The monitor reveals the baby's head
(various) Check that out
No way
(dreamily) Would you look at that
Check out Baby Big-Head
That kid is scary
Hey, 'm a sacred vessel
All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell
Touche
(gazing at the monitor) It is really weird looking
It's like it's not even real
can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things
Juno and Leah look at , who is dabbing her eyes discreetly
What
'm not made of stone
Well, there we have it
Would you like to know the sex
Aw, please Junebug
No way
No,  definitely don't want to know
Planning to be surprised when you deliver
want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if  know,  won't be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing
(condescending) Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school
No, they're the people who are adopting the baby
Oh
Well, thank goodness for that
Wait, what's that supposed to mean
just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here
It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in
Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive
How do you know 'm so poisonous
Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters
Or stage parents
They could be utterly negligent
Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would
Have you considered that
No
guess not
What is your job title, exactly
Excuse me
said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy
'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am
Well 'm a nail technician, and think we both ought to stick to what we know
What are you talking about
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there
Bren gestures to the
My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed
So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade
The   exits in a huff
Bren, you're a dick
love it
'  - Juno lays in bed checking out the
-  - The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's exclusive community
sign on the gate reads "Glacial Valley
" -  - Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold
answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans
Juno
Wow,  didn't expect to see you here
've got something really cool to show you guys
Is Vanessa here
No, she's working late tonight
She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know
He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly
Right
hear they can be kind of a time-suck
Come on in
You wanna Ginseng Cooler
Sure
What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices
don't know
Something to do with the four-packs
(adding) They're not bad
-  - Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks
The  blares in the background
Why aren't you at work
mostly work from home
'm a composer
No shit
Like Johannes Brahms
No, more commercial stuff
Like what
Commercials
Oh
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant
(singing) Titanium Power
Get more snatch by the batch
wrote that
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you
What would the Melvins say
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home
She holds up a manila envelope
Come on, you're going to want to sit down for this
-  - As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions for Mark to join her on the couch
Park it, dude
Mark sits down
With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark, glossy sheet from the envelope
It's her
Behold, good sir
The very first photo of your future child
You're kidding
Mark  the ultrasound, baffled
think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie
(joking) Oh, is he bald and amorphous
No, he's the dad
Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered that her baby might have a father
He stands up and holds the photo up to the light critically
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl
The doctor can tell, but  decided not to know
want it to be a big surprise
Well, it can really only go two ways
That's what you think
drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk
Junk
You know
it's parts
know what junk is
(teasing) Yeah
We definitely want it to have junk
Well don't worry about it
My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy
She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red &Ms
Hope you're ready
Mark chuckles
Wait
do you hear that
new  has begun
Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo
Juno follows him toward the source of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is
What is it
It's only my favorite song
It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters
(excited) 've heard the Carpenters before
Chick drummer and freaky dude
Not unlike the White Stripes
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this
Listen
Mark grabs the   off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar
Mark and Juno stand in silence in the kitchen
Mark mouths along with the lyrics
(lipsynching) Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
Hey,  like this
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands
It's called If Were a Carpenter
It is God
'll rip a copy for you before you leave
You don't have to do that
It's the least  can do
What did you say your favorite band was
didn't
But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways
Yeah,  definitely need to make you some CDs
At least while my kid is hanging out in there
He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch
Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling 's
He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone
Juno spots a   on the coffee table and picks it up
(reading title) The Wizard of Gore
(distracted) Oh yeah
It's Herschel Gordon Lewis
He's the ultimate master of horror
Please
Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror
Mark   slowly on his desk chair, surprised
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented
We're talking buckets of goo
Red corn syrup everywhere
And fake brains up the yin-yang
(examining the tape box) Frankly, this looks kind of stupid
Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really
" -  - We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore
Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats
They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa
(watching movie) This is even better than Suspiria
You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark
Here's to dovetailing interests
He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet
Well, sort of
Vanessa likes Madison for a girl
(aghast) Madison
Isn't that kind of don't know, gay
God, pretentious much
guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology
He named me after Zeus's wife
mean, Zeus had other lays, but 'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife
She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean
Like Diana Ross
That suits you
Uh, thanks
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this
weighed my options
But after all this, 'm glad  didn't, you know, get rid of it
want to have it
For you guys
You're something else
door suddenly slams upstairs
Vanessa's home
Vanessa
Shit, you better get out of here
Why
What the big deal
Nothing
She just hates when  sit around watching movies and 'not contributing
' 'll handle this
'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage
Juno jumps up and rushes out
Wait
aww, crap
-  - Vanessa slides her  off her shoulder and ventures into the living room
She's struggling to carry some oversized shopping bags
Mark
Are you home
want to show you some things  picked up
Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the photo
Mark trails behind her
Hi Vanessa
Vanessa  and makes a strangled sound
Juno
God, you startled me
What are you doing here
What's wrong
Nothing
Then what's going on
went to the doctor today
Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios
Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled
Is the baby okay
Sure
It's the right size and everything
even saw its phalanges today
Check this
She holds the  up to show Vanessa and drapes her arm around her
What
This is the baby
Your baby
Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief
Oh my God
(kindly) Doesn't it look like it's waving
It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa
Will you be my mommy
" Yeah
Yeah, it kind of does
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us
came over as soon as  got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises
(distracted) Oh, that's great
She can't divert her gaze from the photo
See
Nothing to worry about
Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of emotion
-   - Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out
Juno peers at some shopping bags from various kids stores
Hey, what kind of swag did you score
Yeah
Mall madness, huh
Oh it's just some stuff  picked up
For, you know, the baby
Babies need a lot of things
want everything to be just right
thought people got all that stuff at baby showers
When my stepmom had my sister  remember she got about a million presents
They were all lame though, so  wasn't jealous
doubt anyone's throwing us a shower
Why
Um,  think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone
What do you mean
You mean
(aghast) Do you think 'm going to flake out on you
No, no,  don't think that, Juno
It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out
Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa
Vanessa looks embarrassed
Cold feet
You should have gone to China heard they give away babies like free iPods
They shoot 'em out of those -shirt guns at sports events
(abruptly) Right
Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are
You might want to head home
Naah
'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me
gotta bounce anyway
It was nice seeing you guys again
She waves and heads for the door
(to Juno) Hey, don't forget your bag
Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag
- Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters
-  - Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an issue of Dog Fancy
Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie
Where the hell have you been, Junebug
drove to St
Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound
And wound up staying for a couple of hours
couple of hours
Why are you going up there in the first place
They said they wanted to know about this stuff
They said to keep them updated, so  did
You could have sent it to them
Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere
don't know,  just did
And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and  watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music
He's kind of cool
beat as Bren absorbs this
That was a mistake, Juno
Mark is a married stranger
You overstepped a boundary
Listen, Bren-duhhh,  think you're the one overstepping boundaries
You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else
Besides, who cares if he's married
can have friends who are married
It doesn't work that way, kiddo
You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage
You don't know anything about me
know enough
Bren rises to leave, clutching the Dog Fancy magazine
(gesturing to the magazine) We don't even have a dog
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva
've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno
And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and 'm getting Weimaraners
Wow, dream big
Oh, go fly a kite
Bren  out
Juno heads to the  by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it
- Juno parks her  on the street
She walks up to the house and rings the doorbell
'  answers, visibly annoyed
Her eyes drift down to Juno's middle
(
) Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once
But now she looks a hobbit
The fat one that was in The Goonies
' Hi Juno
What can  do for you
borrowed Paulie's physics notes in school today
'm pretty sure he needs them back, or his grade could plummet to an  minus
' Fine
Come in
She steals another glance at Juno's belly
-  - Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down the hallway to Paulie's bedroom
Juno discreetly tries to charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her from getting past Bleeker's mom
They share an extremely awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway
Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's bedroom door
The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration hanging on it that says '
It looks like something a 5-year old might have
- '  - Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying like the tortured brainiac he is
Mrs
Bleeker opens the bedroom door
Juno appears
Paulie jumps, startled
Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man
think  smell hair burning
Bleeker smiles faintly
' Ten minutes
She closes the door halfway and leaves
Juno rolls her eyes and pulls the door shut entirely
What's up
just wanted to come over
You know, say hi
miss hanging out with you on school nights
miss it too
He nervously cracks open a container of  - and pours them into his mouth
(
) Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice
When we made out, the day  got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious
- "-'-"  - ' - '  - Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days
Yeah
Um,  hooked up a whole private adoption thing
These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents
Bleeker is visibly relieved
Really
What are they like
The guy is super cool
His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar
actually hung out with him today
Is that normal
asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe
Oh
That's a relief
Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker
'm going to really start looking like a dork soon
Will you still think 'm cute if 'm huge
always think you're cute
think you're beautiful
Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity
Jesus, Bleek
Well,  do
The song playing ends, and another one begins
It's "the song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from the infamous night in the basement
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again
Yeah
Sure
Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go
We could get back together too
Were we together
Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected
Well, we were once
You know, that time
What about Katrina De Voort
You could go out with Katrina De Voort
don't like Katrina
totally heard you did
don't
Katrina smells like soup
Her whole house smells of soup
- The house is covered in fresh snow
-  - Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery
The walls are primed slate gray
single    sits in the corner
Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint samples up near the wall
What do you think
Custard or Cheesecake
They're yellow
Well,  wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now
Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral
don't know one man with a yellow bedroom
think 'm leaning toward Custard in this light
don't know
should paint a small area
Or you could just wait a couple months
It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women
It's called "nesting
" Nesting, huh
Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva
You should read the book
even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you
just think it's too early to paint
That's my opinion
And  disagree
Mark shrugs, resigned
Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall
That wall is going to need something
Maybe we could put our first family picture there
Hm
Can you see it
Mark stares at the wall, looking lost
- Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored
Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear
Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel
Yum
This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut
Share the love, Tits
She wrestles Leah for the pretzel
Onlookers stare at them, appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson
(to eavesdroppers) She's assaulting me
She's denying me fresh-baked goodness
Leah claps a hand over Juno's mouth
(muffled) Hly shht
What
Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind it
They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse
One of the women is pushing a toddler in an ultramodern stroller
And one of the women is , looking vaguely detached
(hushed) That's her
That's Vanessa Loring
Of the Penny Saver Lorings
Juno nods
No way
She's pretty
You sound shocked or something
just thought she'd look really old in real life
The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly discuss their outfits for an upcoming party
#1 And  was like, "No offense, sweetie, but nobody looks good in gauchos
" #2 Especially not with her build
(mimicking the women, Peanuts-style) Wah-wah-waaah
One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve
Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her
Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection
Right, seriously
They watch Vanessa for a few more moments
The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them
Vanessa continues to entertain the children
Bo-ring
Leah stands up
Juno lingers for a moment
-   - Leah and Juno approach the elevator
want a huge cookie
And like, a lamb kebob
Simultaneously
God, Spermy
Must you always feed
The elevator door opens, revealing
Vanessa
Juno
Juno tries her best to look enthused
Well hi Vanessa
What brings you to the mall today
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends
You're gay
Juno glares at Leah
(confused) No
Please excuse Leah
She's mentally challenged
Oh, okay
So
how are you feeling
Happy
Oh, you mean like, physically
'm good
Look,  have a snooze button now
She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out
That's great
Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces
Dude, it's moshing all over
Vanessa looks confused
(explains) It's kicking
Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the courage for an unusual request
Um
Juno, can  -- Can  touch it
Are you kidding
Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly
'm like a legend
They call me the Cautionary Whale
She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach
can't feel anything
Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby
It's not moving for me
She says this as though it's an admission of failure
Oh, you should try talking to it
They can apparently hear speech in there, even though it sounds all ten thousands leagues under the sea
Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly
Hi
Hi, baby
It's me
My name is Vanessa
can't wait to meet you
Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf
Can you hear me sweet angel
Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope
Then suddenly, Oh my God -- It moved
felt it
(nods) Elbow
Wow
It's magical
Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection
- The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow
The mud is instantly  underfoot by the collective feet of the Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run
- '  - Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans
Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic waistband
-  - We're behind that same , as Juno walks through the students
Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly
- ' " " - Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards of an awful commercial
-   (storyboards)
kitchen scene with a kid eating a new breakfast product called --
Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song
' , Mark drops his head, dejected
Then, the phone rings
(picks up) Hello
: -   - So, 've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird  you made me
Mark instantly smiles
Oh really
What's the verdict
sort of like it
mean, it's cute
Cute
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison
imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point
Consider it your musical education
'm dying to see what you've got to teach me
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work
Just wanted to say hi
Go learn something
Mark hangs up
Smiles
-  - on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food
Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table
God, you're getting huge
How many months has it been now
Almost eight
You wouldn't believe how weird  look naked
wish my funbags would get bigger
Trust me, you don't
actually have to wear a bra now
And  have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode
Hot
-  - Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch
Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way
Some look derisive, others are amused
God, why is everyone always staring at me
Well, you are kind of
convex
She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once
don't have a choice
Keith's been grading me really hard lately
Please do not refer to Mr
Conyers as "Keith," okay
My barf reflex is already heightened these days
Keith's hot
Eww, he's all beardy
We see  the teacher talking to some science kids in the background
He has a Wild America beard
He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily
: Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort
Katrina
Pfft, no way
He doesn't like Katrina
It must be a pity date
(shrugging) He asked her
heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup
Oh, it totally does
was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing
But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands
wouldn't be so sure about that
He did it with you
He's a man now
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me
We're best friends
Are you jealous
thought you said you didn't care what he did
'm not jealous, and  don't care just know he doesn't like Katrina and  don't think he should toy with her emotions like that
She seems so nice and all
Okay Juno, 'm really convinced
Prom is for wenises, anyway
Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore
- '  - Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker
Juno marches up to him, belly leading the way
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort
Um, hi
Leah just told me you were going with her
Yeah,  did ask her if she wanted to go
bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin
Juno is clearly
(meekly) We're getting a stretch limo
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me
You're mad
Why are you mad
'm not mad
'm in a fucking great mood
Despite the fact that 'm trapped in a fat suit  can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday
Katrina's not my girlfriend
And doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye
She just looks like that all the time
strides past (obviously ) with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno
Whatever
Have fun at the prom with Soupy Sales
'm sure  can think of something way more cool to do that night
Like  could pumice my feet, or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, or get hit by a ten-ton truck full of hot garbage juice
All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you
She starts to walk away
Bleeker takes a deep breath
You're being really immature
(turning around) What
Bleeker  himself and pushes up his lab goggles
That's not how our thing works hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember
Not this time
You don't have any reason to be mad at me
You broke my heart
should be royally ticked at you, man
should be really cheesed off
shouldn't want to talk to you anymore
Why
Because  got bored and had sex with you one day, and then  didn't, like, marry you
Like 'd marry you
You would be the meanest wife of all time
And anyway, know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, want to watch this, but we should make out instead
La la la
" Forget it, Bleek
Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom
'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time
(searching for a comeback) Yeah, well
still have your underwear
still have your virginity
(looking around, panicked) Oh my God,
What
Are you ashamed that we did it
No
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater
'm a planet
Juno picks up her  dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder
She's about to walk away, when
Wait, let me take that
Huh
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag
'll take it
Oh
It's fine
What's another ten pounds
She turns around, wipes  off her cheek (making sure no one sees) and continues down the hallway
-  - Juno climbs ungracefully into the van
She starts the engine, then pauses to dig through her backpack for something
She produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview mirror, examining herself self-consciously
She puts on some Dr
Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway
- '   - Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website
He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive
The doorbell rings
-  - Mark opens the door
Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up
She holds a stack of CDs
Mark breaks into a grin
Wow
That shirt is working hard
(furtive) Is Vanessa here
Nope
We're safe
He and Juno smile conspiratorially
Cool
Come on,  have something for you
He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house
-  - The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's
Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb
Oh, Mark
Is this the baby's room
It's beautiful
Hilarious
No,  just keep all of my old comics down here, and  want to show you one of them
Oh God, you're one of those guys
You're gonna like this,  promise
Mark  through a cardboard box in the corner
(extracting a bagged from the box) Here it is
He shows the  to Juno
It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki
" It depicts a pregnant   kicking ass and taking names
"Most Fruitful Yuki"
What is
Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero
Isn't that great
got it when was in Japan with my band
She reminds me of you
Juno examines the comic
"Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble her
Wow,  actually feel like less of a fat dork now
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man
You should be proud to be the same condition
She throws a   in Mark's direction with a -
Juno is sincerely pleased
Okay, how about some tunes
There's a battered portable  player in the corner
Juno kneels down and pops in one of the discs
Now this first one is kinda slow
But it's Mott the Hoople so it's still totally rad and hardcore
Juno puts in the  and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room
Mark Laughs
What
actually know this one
You do
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that
danced to it at my senior prom
That's almost interesting, Mark
Who did you dance with
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner
Even let me put my hands on her butt
Oh man,  can just picture you slow dancing like a dork
She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly
No,  put my hands on your waist
Then you put your arms around my neck
That's how we did it in '88
Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist
She drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously
Oh, okay
Like this
You've never been to a dance, have you
(casually defensive) Only squares and nerds go to dances
What are you
don't know
They  slowly to the music
Juno's belly bumps up against Mark
feel like there's something between us
They laugh
Juno rests her head on Mark's chest
They dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving
Mark pulls Juno as close as he possibly can, given her expanding girth
'm leaving Vanessa
(quiet at first) What
It's just not working out, but 'm getting my own place in the city
and 've got it all planned out
It's something 've wanted to do for a long time
Juno backs away
(growing) No
No
No
No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark
That's a big, fat sack of no
What's the matter
This isn't what we agreed on
You guys have to take care of
this
You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump
She  wildly to her belly
Suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy
But  thought you'd be cool if
(interrupting) want you guys to adopt the Buglet
wanted everything to be perfect
Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family
Listen, once  have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right
Believe me on this one
baby is not going to fix everything
Besides,  don't know if 'm ready to be a father
(aghast) But you're old
How do you think of me, Juno
Why are you here
don't know
just liked being your friend
sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life
This
(he gestures to the dank surrounding room) this is what my life has become
Stuff in boxes
Stuff underground
Is that so appealing to you
Yeah,  guess
Is this my fault
Is Vanessa mad at you because of me
That's not the point
We're just not in love anymore
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her
If you love someone once, you can love them again, know it
My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times
You're just not trying
Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl
'm such an idiot
can't believe what an idiot  am
He paces over to the wall and  it softly
Please don't get a divorce
God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife
God, you're so young
Not really
'm sixteen
'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes
Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark
Oh and by the way,  bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing 've ever heard
It's just noise, man
She bolts up the stairs, sobbing
-   - Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased They nearly collide
Juno
What's going on
Nothing
It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying
Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno
(pretending to be calm) Mark
Why is Juno crying
'm not crying
'm allergic to fine home furnishings
See you later
She rushes toward the door
Hold on
Juno halts
Juno, what's the matter
She's hormonal
Right, June
It's just part of the whole process
Juno looks totally betrayed
She doesn't respond
Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying
What did you do
didn't do anything
just
've just been thinking
(you've been thinking
) What
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us
What are you referring to
She knows exactly to what he's referring
've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready
Of course we're ready
We've taken all the classes
The nursery
The books -- know we're prepared
just don't know if
'm ready
Juno's face continues to fall
Vanessa notices
(to Juno) Juno, don't worry about this
He just has cold feet
That's how boys are
The books all say the same thing
woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant
man becomes a father when he sees his baby
He's going to get there
He'll get there
Juno ain't buying it
(to Mark) Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay
It all just happened so fast
We put that ad in the paper
thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room
(quietly) She answered our prayers
(ignores the comment) Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock
This stops Vanessa
Juno looks offended
What are you saying
long hideous beat
It just feels a little like bad timing
Another hideous beat
What would be a good time for you
don't know
There's just things still want to do
Like what
Be a rock star
Don't mock me
Vanessa sighs
It's done
You're trying to do something that's never going to happen
And you know what
Your shirt is stupid
Grow up
If  have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, 'm never going to be a mother
Vanessa looks defeated
never said 'd be a great father
We hear the front door closing
Vanessa and Mark look over and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict
- Juno runs up to her car sobbing
She struggles with the keys, but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off
- The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the shoulder
- Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant
After a beat, she begins to gather herself
'  - Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar
He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise
- Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future
We push in close
when she gets an idea
She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt
She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something
a note
- It's quiet after the storm
Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine
-   - Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in
After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her
called Gerta Rauss
She says she can represent both of us
They call it "collaborative divorce
" It's apparently all the rage right now
And it's easy because we don't have children
No, it's fine
Thanks for making the call,  guess
Mark nods and sits down
We're actually, finally doing this
Looks like it, yeah
Have you found a place to stay
Yeah, downtown
hotel
It's a loft
(lightly teasing) Aren't you the cool guy
They  at the wall, speechless and defeated
wanted a baby so bad
So bad
She buries her head in her hands
know you did
There's a   on the front door
-  - Mark opens the door
There's a folded piece of paper sitting on the doormat
He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van
Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami
" He holds it up
We can see there's  on the back
It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube
Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it
It's for me
- Juno parks her car and walks up to her house
porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting
(
) never realize how much  like being home unless 've been somewhere really different for a while
She picks a  from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it
She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it
Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair
-  - Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes
Juno enters
Hi Dad
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug
Where have you been
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level
Where is everyone
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class
Tot ice skating
Tots can't ice skate
Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs
No, but you know Bren
She dreams big
Yeah, she does
You look a little morose, honey
What's eating you
'm losing my faith in humanity
Think you can narrow it down for me
guess  wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good
You mean like couples
Yeah, like people in love
Are you having boy trouble
gotta be honest;  don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause
well, that's kind of messed up
Dad, no
Well, it's kind of skanky
Isn't that what you girls call it
Skanky
Skeevy
Please stop now
(persisting) Tore up from the floor up
Dad, it's not about that
just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever
Or at least for a few years
It's not easy, that's for sure
Now, may not have the best track record in the world, but  have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and 'm proud to say that we're very happy
Juno nods in agreement
In my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you, the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass
That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with
wave of  crosses Juno's face
sort of already have
Well, of course
Your old --
You know 'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in
He nods toward her belly
Obviously
Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his cheek
need to go out somewhere for just a little while
don't have any homework, and  swear 'll be back by ten
She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen
You were talking about me, right
: - '  - We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the window
We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off
- Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning run
He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the stoop: " --
" He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch on the mailbox
At least one hundred containers of    come pouring out in an colorful deluge
They spill out onto the driveway
Bleeker smiles
-  - Juno waddles toward the field
The guys on the track team, ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches
They stare at her quizzically
Bleeker spots Juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox
Yeah
That was me
Why
(blushes) Because they're your fave
And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint
Well
thanks
think 'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front
You know, 've been thinking
'm really sorry  was such a huge bitch to you
You didn't deserve that
You never deserve any of the poo  unload on you
You know it's okay
Also,  think 'm in love with you
What, you mean as friends
No, for real
think you are the coolest person 've ever met
And you don't even have to try
try really hard, actually
No, you're naturally smart
You always think of the funniest things to do
Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"
And it said, "'m having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"
That was hilarious
was just bored
only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time
You actually look at my face
And every time  look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard
It does
Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly
Wizard
think it's because my heart starts pounding when  see you
Mine too
Basically, 'm completely smitten with you, and  don't care if 'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend
Well, yeah
You're the best friend 've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil
That's all  need from you
That's more than  could ever ask for
You're just golden, dude
Can we make out now
Okay
Bleeker and Juno , oblivious to the gawking track team guys in the background
In the distance, near the school entrance, we see (the kid who always  Juno) regarding the makeout session with a sad, envious expression
passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the fence, rolling her eyes
(disgusted) You know, you can go into early labor sucking face like that
Juno gives her the , not breaking the clinch with Bleeker
- '  - Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling
She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her
She revs a Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll
Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked
She pats her lap frantically and jumps off the bed
Dad
: - '   - Mac looks up from the lure he's working on
(
) What
Either  just pissed my pants or
(
) Or
Thundercats are go
- Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house
They pile into the Previa at breakneck speed
Juno waddles behind them, protesting
- of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap
She's being pushed down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair
She bursts into giggles
Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her rather aggressively
Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair into a wall
Juno feigns whiplash
Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the wheelchair, exasperated
She pulls off Juno's surgical cap
Leah and Juno snicker
-   - We see Juno is in a   at the hospital, pacing impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort
She's wearing her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown
Leah and Bren stand nearby
Juno doubles over in pain
(panicked) Ow, ow, fuckity-ow
Bren, when do get that Spinal Tap thing
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey
The doctor said you're not dilated enough
You mean  have to wait for it to get even worse
Why can't they just give it to me now
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream
Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain
(checking her watch) Shit
(To the doctor) Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already
-   - (
) It really didn't hurt that bad having him
We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her
Leah holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other
(
) The best part was when  peed on Leah during labor
We see Leah holding Juno's , which is shaking
Leah's shirt is soaked
She rolls her eyes and mouths "Fuck you" at Juno
Juno's raised   enters the frame
(
) And then, out of nowhere, there it was
The doctor reveals '   above the sheet
(
) There he was
Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter
and she passes out
-  - Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track
There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers
As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on
Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding a video camera
(
) decided to not call Bleeker to tell him that  was having the baby
He had a big meet against Manteno and  didn't want him to get all worried about me and choke
Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race
The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer
(admiringly) His legs are as swift as his seed
What did you say
Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat
Bleeker has just broken a district record in the 400
Bleeker looks out at the , scanning them for Juno
She's not there
(
) But he figured it out anyway
Bleek takes off  toward the parking lot without stopping to explain
His mother stands up, confused
-   - reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby
The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator
Would you like to meet your son
Pull back to reveal she's speaking to , who stands, paralyzed, several feet away
have a son
(amused) You are the adoptive mother
have a son
Healthy kid, too
Didn't waste any time getting out
Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in her eyes
She spends a few moments just looking at him
She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren leaning against the doorway
Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously
How do  look
(gently) Like a mom
Scared shitless
Vanessa laughs
-   - Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room
The birth is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and accomplishment, a task completed
The doctors have cleared out
Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's not sure what to say
He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, but Juno gently pushes his hand away
Their eyes meet
His expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained
Someday, you'll be back here, honey
On your terms
Juno nods and swallows
Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway
It's Bleeker in his track uniform
Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs
Mac glances at her, alarmed
Paulie moves toward the bed
Mac clears his throat, gets up and leaves the room
Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his arm around Juno
She leans into him, letting herself go for the first time in months
-   - Juno lies on the bed
She looks rested and relaxed compared to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and swollen
Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track uniform and spikes
(
) Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby
Neither did , really
He didn't feel like ours
-   - We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently
(
) think he was always hers
-  - The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate taste
Nothing looks as though it's been touched
We see the antique   sitting empty
(
) It ended with a chair
We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something
" There's a framed note on the wall
It looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill
We see that it says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, 'm still in
Juno
" We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom
We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby
For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy
There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed
Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment
The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb
Vanessa glows with an expression of pure bliss
- It's a sparkling summer afternoon
Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage
She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two
She looks almost as happy with her dogs as  looked with her baby
- Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street
Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag
She's obviously not pregnant anymore
She looks happy, but older
(
) As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss
He is the cheese to my macaroni
know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but normalcy's not really our style
As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she passes the Dancing Elk  , still running in outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas
Juno  up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning his guitar
- Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop
She smiles and takes out her guitar
She sits across from Bleeker and pulls the pick out of the strings
Ready
Bleeker nods
Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else But You," by the Moldy Peaches
Bleeker joins in
At first their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans,  want more stage
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
You are always trying to keep it real
'm in love with how you feel
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu
don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you
She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play
They smile ambiguously
Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek
Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity
