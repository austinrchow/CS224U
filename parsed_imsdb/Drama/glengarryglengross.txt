You work too hard
We all,  remember when we were at Platt

" They came in and they, you know
Well, they fucked it up
16
They did
They killed the goose
They did
And now

We're stuck with this fucking shit
this shit
It's too
It is
Eh
It's too
You get a bad month, all of a
You're on this
All of, they got you on this "board
" ,
Some contest board
It's not right
17
It's not
No
Pause
And it's not right to the customers

'll tell you, you got, you know, you got
what did  learn as a kid on Western
Don't sell a guy one car
Sell him five cars over fifteen years
That's right
Eh
That's right
Goddamn right, that's right
Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, know what 'll do: 'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before
" that's right
Eh
No
That's absolutely right
And so they kill the goose
, , 'll
and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to
that's right
cower in his boots
18
(simultaneously with "boots") Shoes, boots, yes
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives
" For some sales pro
sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your
" No
It's medieval
it's wrong
"Or we're going to fire your ass
" It's wrong
Yes
Yes, it is
And you know who's responsible
Who
You know who it is
It's Mitch
And Murray
'Cause it doesn't have to be this way
No
Look at Jerry Graff
He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses
see
You see
That's thinking
Why take ten percent ten percent comm
why are we giving the rest away
What are we giving ninety per
for nothing
For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close
" "Go win the Cadillac
" Graff
He goes out and buys
He pays top dollar for the
you see
Yes
19
That's thinking
Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself
He's
that's what
that's thinking
"Who
Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who
" Nurses
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two 'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild
He is
He's doing very well
heard that they were running cold
The nurses
Yes
You hear a lot of things
He's doing very well
He's doing very well
With River Oaks
River Oaks, Brook Farms
All of that shit
Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself
Fourteen, fifteen grand a week
Himself
20
That's what 'm saying
Why
The leads
He's got the good leads
what are we, we're sitting in the shit here
Why
We have to go to them to get them
Huh
Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things
What do you need
telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing
nothing
No, it's not that simple, Dave
Yes
It is
It is simple, and you know what the hard part is
What
Starting up
What hard part
Of doing the thing
The dif
the difference
Between me and Jerry Graff
Going to business for yourself
The hard part is
you know what it is
What
Just the act
What act
21
To say "'m going on my own
" 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else
And we enslave ourselves
To please
To win some fucking toaster
to
to
and the guy who got there first made up those
That's right
He made up those rules, and we're working for him
That's the truth
That's the God's truth
And it gets me depressed
swear that it does
At
To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month
Two guys get fucked
" Huh
You don't ax your sales force
No
You
You
You build it
That's what
You fucking build it
Men come
Men come work for you
22
you're absolutely right
They
They have
When they
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves
no
(pause) No
(pause) You're absolutely right, and  want to tell you something
What
want to tell you what somebody should do
What
Someone should stand up and strike back
What do you mean
Somebody
Yes
Should do something to them
What
23
Something
To pay them back
(pause) Someone, someone should hurt them
Murray and Mitch
Someone should hurt them
Yes
(pause) How
How
Do something to hurt them
Where they live
What
(pause) Someone should rob the office
Huh
That's what 'm saying
We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files
go to Jerry Graff
Long pause
What could somebody get for them
What could we get for them don't know
Buck a throw
buck-a- half a throw
don't know
Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them
All told
must be, 'd

don't know
24
How many leads have we got
The Glengarry
the premium leads
'd say we got five thousand
Five
Five thousand leads
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff
Yes
How do you know he'd buy them
Graff
Because  worked for him
You haven't talked to him
No
What do you mean
Have talked to him about this
Pause
Yes
mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just
No, we're just
We're just "talking" about it
We're just speaking about it
(pause) As an idea
As an idea
Yes
We're not actually talking about it
25
No
Talking about it as a
No
As a robbery
As a "robbery"
No
Well
Well
Hey
Pause
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff
Not actually, no
Pause
You didn't
No
Not actually
Did you
What did you say
Yes
(pause) said, "Not actually
" The fuck you care, George
We're just talking
We are
26
Yes
Pause
Because, because, you know, it's a crime
That's right
It's a crime
It is a crime
It's also very safe
You're actually talking about this
That's right
Pause
You're going to steal the leads
Have  said that
Pause
Are you
Pause
Did  say that
Did you talk to Graff
Is that what  said
What did he say
What did he say
He'd buy them
Pause
You're going to steal the leads and sell the leads to him
27
Pause
Yes
What will he pay
buck a shot
For five thousand
However they are, that's the deal
buck a throw
Five thousand dollars
Split it half and half
You're saying "me

(pause) Twenty-five hundred apiece
One night's work, and the job with Graff
Working the premium leads
Pause
job with Graff
Is that what  said
He'd give me a job
He would take you on
Yes
Pause
Is that the truth
28
Yes
It is, George
(pause) Yes
It's a big decision
(pause) And it's a big reward
(pause) It's a big reward
For one night's work
(pause) But it's got to be tonight
What
What
What
The leads
You have to steal the leads tonight
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown
After the thirtieth
Murray and Mitch
After the contest
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and
You
'm sorry
You
Pause
Me
You have to go in
(pause) You have to get the leads
Pause
do
29
Yes
It's not something for nothing, George,  took you in on this, you have to go
That's your thing
've made the deal with Graff can't go
can't go in, 've spoken on this too much
've got a big mouth
(pause) "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "
the fucking tight ass company
" They'll know when you go over to Graff
What will they know
That  stole the leads
didn't steal the leads, 'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then 'm going to the Como Inn
Why did go to Graff
got a better deal
Period
Let 'em prove something
They can't prove anything that's not the case
Pause
Dave
Yes
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads
Yes
Pause
No
30
Oh, yes, George
What does that mean
Listen to this
have an alibi, 'm going to the Como Inn, why
Why
The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me
Why
Because  probably did it
Are you going to turn me in
(pause) George
Are you going to turn me in
What if you don't get caught
They come to you, you going to turn me in
Why would they come to me
They're going to come to everyone
Why would  do it
You wouldn't, George, that's why 'm talking to you
Answer me
They come to you
You going to turn me in
No
Are you sure
Yes
'm sure
Then listen to this:  have to get those leads tonight
That's something  have to do
If 'm not at the movies
if 'm not eating over at the inn
If you don't do this, then  have to come in here
31
you don't have to come in
and rob the place
thought that we were only talking
they take me, then
They're going to ask me who were my accomplices
Me
Absolutely
That's ridiculous
Well, to the law, you're an accessory
Before the fact
didn't ask to be
Then tough luck, George, because you are
Why
Why, because you only told me about it
That's right
Why are you doing this to me, Dave
Why are you talking this way to me
don't understand
Why are you doing this at all
That's none of your fucking business
32
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here 'm a criminal
You went for it
In the abstract
So 'm making it concrete
Why
Why
Why you going to give me five grand
Do you need five grand
Is that what  just said
You need money
Is that the
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what  need is not the
what do you need
What is the five grand
(pause) What is the, you said that we were going to split five
lied
(pause) Alright
My end is my business
Your end's twenty-five
In or out
You tell me, you're out you take the consequences
do
Yes
33
Pause
And why is that
Because you listened
The restaurant
Roma is seated alone at the booth
Lingk is at the booth next to him
Roma is talking to him
all train compartments smell vaguely of shit
It gets so you don't mind it
That's the worst thing that  can confess
You know how long it took me to get there
long time
When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do
You think you're queer
'm going to tell you something: we're all queer
You think that you're a thief
So what
You get befuddled by a middle-class morality
Get shut of it
Shut it out
You cheated on your wife
You did it, live with it
(pause) You fuck little girls, so be it
There's an absolute morality
May be
And then what
If you think there is, then be that thing
Bad people go to hell
don't think so
If you think that, act that way
hell exists on earth
Yes
won't live in it
That's me
You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours
Did
Yes
don't know
34
Or a piss
great meal fades in reflection
Everything else gains
You know why
'Cause it's only food
This shit we eat, it keeps us going
But it's only food
The great fucks that you may have had
What do you remember about them
What do
Yes
Mmmm
don't know
For me, 'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm
Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did
There was a sound she made
or, me, lying, in the, 'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me cafe au lait
She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete
Eh
What 'm saying, what is our life
(pause) It's looking forward or it's looking back
And that's our life
That's it
Where is the moment
(pause) And what is it that we're afraid of
Loss
What else
(pause) The bank closes
We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed
the house burnt down
what of these happen
None on 'em
We worry anyway
What does this mean
'm not secure
How can  be secure
(pause) Through amassing wealth beyond all measure
No
And what's beyond all measure
That's a sickness
That's a trap
There is no measure
Only greed
How can we act
() 35
(') The right way, we would say, to deal with this: "There is a one-in- a-million chance that so and so will happen
Fuck it, it won't happen to me
" No
We know that's not the right way  think
(pause) We say the correct way to deal with this is "There is a one-in-so-and- so chance this will happen
God protect me
am powerless, let it not happen to me
" But no to that
say
There's something else
What is it
"If it happens, for that is not within our powers,  will deal with it, just as  do today with what draws my concern today
"  say this is how we must act
do those things which seem correct to me today trust myself
And if security concerns me,  do that which today think will make me secure
And every day  do that, when that day arrives that  need a reserve, [a] odds are that  have it, and [b] the true reserve that  have is the strength that  have of acting each day without fear
(pause) According to the dictates of my mind
(pause) Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate
Now: what are they

To what
To make money
Perhaps
To lose money
Perhaps
To "indulge" and to "learn" about ourselves
Perhaps
So fucking what

You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that

And you'd be right
Who said "Fuck the Machine"

Courtesy class
You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts
You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place

Come on, you got them in the kitchen, you got the stats spread out, you're in your shirt- sleeves, you can smell it
Huh
Snap out of it, you're eating her crumb cake
Pause
'm eating her crumb cake
57
How was it
From the store
Fuck her
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity
and take it
(pause) And that's it
" And we sit there

"Always be closing
" That's what 'm saying
The old ways
The old ways

Bruce, Harriet
the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds
say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route

Eighty- two grand
tell them
"This is now
This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money
This is it, Harriett

Bruce
" don't want to fuck around with you
don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this
do, too
came here to do good for you and me
For both of us
Why take an interim position
() 58
(') The only arrangement 'll accept is full investment
Period
The whole eight units
know that you're saying 'be safe,'  know what you're saying
know if left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee
you'd sit down
and you'd think 'let's be safe
' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility
But this won't do, and that's not the subject
" Listen to this,  actually said this
"That's not the subject of our evening together
" Now  handed them the pen
held it in my hand
turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand
"Now  want you to sign
" (pause) sat there
Five minutes
Then, sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock
(pause) Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock
Not a word, not a motion
What am  thinking
"My arm's getting tired
" No
did it did it
Like in the old says, Ricky
Like  was taught
Like, like, like  used to do
did it
Like you taught me
Bullshit, you're
No
That's raw
well, if  did, then 'm glad  did
, well
locked on them
All on them, nothing on me
All my thoughts are on them
'm holding the last thought that spoke: "Now is the time
" (pause) They signed, Ricky
It was great
It was fucking great
It was like they wilted all at once
No gesture
nothing
Like together
() 59
(') They,  swear to God, they both kind of imperceptibly slumped
And he reaches and takes the pen and signs, he passes it to her, she signs
It was so fucking solemn
just let it sit
nod like this
nod again
grasp his hands shake his hands
grasp her hands
nod at her like this
"Bruce
Harriet
" 'm beaming at them
'm nodding like this point back in the living room, back to the sideboard
(pause) didn't fucking know there was a sideboard there
He goes back, he brings us a drink
Little shot glasses
pattern in 'em
And we toast
In silence
Pause
That was a great sale, Shelly

You made a good sale
Fine
It's better than a good sale
It's a
Look:  have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, 'm trying to make some sense
All that 'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to
What does that fucking mean
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle
Why should the sale not stick
Hey, fuck you
That's what 'm saying
You have no idea of your job
man's his job and you're fucked at yours
You hear what 'm saying to you
Your "end of month board
" You can't run an office
don't care
You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls
You ever been on a sit
Ever

It's not impossible
On an eighty-thousand dollar day
And it ain't even noon
You closed 'em today
Yes

This morning
(to Williamson) What 'm saying to you: things can change
You see
This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know
You can't look down the road
And see what's coming
Might be someone else, John
It might be someone new, eh
Someone new
And you can't look back
'Cause you don't know history
You ask them
When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man
month
Two months
Eight months in twelve for three years in a row
You know what that means
You know what that means
Is that luck
Is that some, some, some purloined leads
That's skill
That's talent, that's, that's
yes
and you don't remember
'Cause you weren't around
That's cold calling
Walk up to the door don't even know their name
'm selling something they don't even want
You talk about soft sell
before we had a name for it
before we called it anything, we did it
That's right, Shel
62
And, and, and,  did it
And  put a kid through school
She
and
Cold calling, fella
Door to door
But you don't know
You don't know
You never heard of a streak
You never heard of "marshaling your sales force
" What are you, you're a secretary, John
Fuck you
That's my message for you
Fuck you and kiss my ass
You don't like it, 'll go talk to Jerry Graff
Period
Fuck you
Put me on the board
And  want three worthwhile leads today and don't want any bullshit about them and  want 'em close together 'cause 'm going to hit them all today
That's all  have to say to you
He's right, Williamson
Williamson goes into a side office
Pause
It's not right
'm sorry, and 'll tell you who's to blame is Mitch and Murray
Roma sees something outside the window

Sure
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex

Ray: what time do you have
Twelve-fifteen
Oh
My God

(starts for the door) My wife said  have to cancel the deal
It's a common reaction, Jim
'll tell you what it is, and  know that that's why you married her
One of the reasons is prudence
It's a sizable investment
One thinks twice
it's also something women have
It's just a reaction to the size of the investment
Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again
(to Levene) This woman can cook
(simultaneously) 'm sure she can
68
(to Lingk) We're going to talk

What did you do with the leads
If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk

For me
