Johnna is cutting off sprigs of wild mint entangled in the fence, standing in what was once a vegetable garden
Hello

like your necklace
beaded pouch in the shape of a turtle

Saturday morning
The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy
We ate some, he walked out the door, this door right there
Got into his truck
And that was it
Johnna enters with her mint, crosses into the kitchen
He just left
went to bed Saturday night, got up Sunday
still no Beverly
didn't make much of it, thought he'd gone out on a bender
Why would he do that

Oblivion
So Sunday, still no sign of him
Yes, Sunday
No sign
started getting worried, don'tcha know
That's when  got worked up about that safety deposit box
We kept an awful lot of cash in that box, some expensive jewelry
had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars -- Johnna returns with glasses of iced tea, each with a sprig of mint, delivers them to Bill and Barbara
Wait, wait, wait, 'm missing something
Why do you care about a safety deposit box
Well,  know what you'll say about this, but, your father and  had an urge-ment
arrangement
If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box
Because
The money and jewelry gets rolled into the estate, bank seals the box until probate is settled

Okay, what about the safety deposit box
had to wait for the bank to open on Monday
And after  emptied that box, called the police and reported him missing
Monday morning
And you only had Ivy call me today
didn't want to worry you, honey -- Jesus Christ
Vi, you sure there wasn't some event that triggered his leaving, some incident

Johnna places pieces of pie in front of Bill and Barb
Yes
No

Outside, her mother, sister, and Bill on the back porch
You can't think of anything unusual -- Johnna sits at the kitchen table behind Ivy
Johnna stands, joins Ivy at the sink
Ivy hadn't seen her there
He hired this woman
He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house
Few days before he left
You don't want her here
She's a stranger in my house
There's an Indian in my house
Ivy looks to Johnna, embarrassed
But Johnna just takes Ivy's cup from her, finishes cleaning it

What's wrong with Indian
Why's it so hard to call people -- Let's just call the dinosaurs "Native Americans" while we're at it
She may be an Indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie  ever ate
Johnna smiles, nods to Ivy
Leaves the kitchen
He hired a cook
It doesn't make any sense
We don't eat
And now you get biscuits and gravy
Kind of nice, huh
Nice for you, now
But you'll be gone soon enough, never to return

Because you're "dutiful

You broke his heart when you moved away
