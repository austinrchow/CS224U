by Paddy Chayefsky --
Under the credits, the   slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses
Seven o'clock in the morning
: ' The bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing project
It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark
moves slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping
They are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other
One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under the light covers
We close in on Charlie's sleeping face
The alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz
Charlie's eyes open
There is a muffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow
Then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and turns it off
Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her
She pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot, looking down at her husband
She produces a smile, then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch
shaft of light now pours into the bedroom
Charlie sits up in bed
His shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet
He reaches down and starts to put them on
Suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song
Then it stops as abruptly as it began
Charlie's head slowly turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of putting on his socks
His face is expressionless, but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today
He just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, his head hanging, his shoulders slumped
Behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off
Then his wife comes back into the bedroom
She is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face
Finished, she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress
moment later, she pads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front
She is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has exchanged the trousers for a half-slip
Charlie hasn't moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor
You think it's too early to call my mother
don't know
Charlie shrugs without looking up
Helen goes out of the bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it
She dials, waits
In the bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers
(on phone) Hello, Ma, did  wake you up
This is Helen
Well, 'll be going to work, and  wanted to get ahold of you before  left
called you last night
Where were you and Pop anyway
kept calling you every half hour up till one o'clock
Oh, yeah
Did you have a nice time
of Charlie in bedroom
' Well, listen, Ma,  got something to tell you
'm pregnant
Yeah, pregnant
Of course 'm sure
've got the report back from the laboratory
No, you wouldn't know him, Doctor Axelrod
Second month
He says  can expect the baby in February
Well, Grandma, act a little excited, will you
You bet 'm excited
He is not excited
If anything he is miserable
His bowed head rises slowly
The eyes open
He stares abstractedly ahead for a moment
Then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation
Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection
: -- Helen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two cups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups
The toaster is ticking
packaged loaf of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf
Finished with pouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove and comes out into the dining area
The dinette table is covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray glutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer
(calling to the bedroom) Do you need any of this or can take them off the table
Charlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed now, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly knotted tie
'll clean that up in a minute
He disappears back into the bedroom
Helen picks up the ash tray and the cup and saucer
How late were you up last night
' About two
Charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc
, from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets
The blinds of the bedroom window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, whitening Charlie's face
After he has pocketed his odds and ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an opened notebook
He stands a moment looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits some of his notes to memory
He turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page
Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers
The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings and other feminine things
He finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer
'm taking five bucks from your drawer
He pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining area
Helen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and reading yesterday's newspaper
There are two cups of coffee on the table
guy in my office is getting married, and  got clipped four bucks for his wedding present
He begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the table
Who's getting married
Arnold
told you about him
The guy with the sick mother
Oh, yeah
(trying to decide whether he needs a certain worksheet) The rest of the guys are giving him a bachelor party tonight
Do you want to go, Charlie
got class tonight
What have you got -- cost accounting
Yes
think you ought to take off a night
You ought to go, have a little fun for yourself
think you need that
You go to work all day, you go to school all night
You can miss one night, Charlie
No, these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes
The whole philosophy is: it's the groom's last night of freedom
So it gets kind of wild sometimes
That's a good philosophy to start a marriage with
Well, a bunch of guys get together, they like to tear up the town a little
He has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile on the table, ready to take with him
He sits down and begins sipping his coffee
Helen looks back to her newspaper, frowning a little, then looks up at Charlie again
think you oughta go, Charlie know you're upset about the baby
'm not upset about the baby
Come on, Charlie
know how you feel
Listen, you don't have to pretend you're excited about the baby
We weren't exactly planning on a baby right now
'm not upset about the baby
It's a shock
had some bad days before  told you
said: "Oh, boy, that's all we need
baby
" Then said to myself: "If 'm having a baby, 'm having a baby
That's all there is to it
" And  like the idea
We're going to have a family, Charlie
like the idea
Well, give me a couple of days to get used to the idea
'll be all right
know you will, Charlie
That's why think you ought to go to this bachelor party tonight
(bursting out) don't want to go to this bachelor party
He looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst
'm sorry  yelled
Don't be silly
better get going
Kenny's probably waiting for me now
'm sorry yelled like that
What are you sorry about
Don't yell at you all the time
, as she reads her newspaper, but there is a faint frown on her face
: An express train hurtles southward
We see it flashing by through the concrete pillars of the subway
: Charlie and another young man, named Kenneth, are seated in a crowded subway car
People are standing tightly in the aisles
Kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty-odd
He has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to the August heat
Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed
He has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap
He is reading the text
Two young white-collar workers on their way to work
They ride along silently for a moment
Kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a full-busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on to a strap
It is summertime, and the girls all wear light summer frocks
There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene
You going to Arnold's bachelor party
don't think so, Kennie
What
got two classes tonight
Yeah,  was going to go, but  think better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she's been acting up again lately
She's got some kind of allergy, the doctors don't know what
These bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes
Eddie Watkins is making all the arrangements
He's probably got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls
Yeah, do you think so
You know Eddie
Yeah, boy, he really lives it up, don't he
Did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week
Boy, sometimes  wish  was a bachelor
Well, you know what  mean
never seem to get out of the house any more, you know what  mean
About once a week,  go to the movies
We never even see the whole picture
My wife starts worrying about the kids
My youngest kid, the girl, she's got some kind of rash
We don't know what it is
never seem to see anybody any more
Do you know how long it is since 've seen Willie Duff
haven't seen Willie in about six months
My wife can't stand his wife
You ever seen her, Willie's wife
No,  didn't know Willie too well
Boy, wait'll you have kids, boy
You'll never get out of the house
Helen's pregnant now
No kidding
Yeah
Oh, that's wonderful, Charlie, that's wonderful
The two young husbands look down again at their hands and ride along silently
Kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention drift down the length of the car
Hey, there's a guy down there, trying to pick up a girl down there
He is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down from Kenneth
The Girl is reading a newspaper
The Young Fellow stares at her
The Girl, aware of this sudden attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper
The Young Fellow smiles pleasantly
The Girl, with a show of annoyance, looks back to her newspaper
Were you with us about eight years ago when  picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in Paterson, New Jersey
When was this
Yeah, you were there
You were with that girl from Brooklyn
We just came from Palisades Amusement Park, and we were driving Frankie Klein's girl home, and the car broke down right in the middle of Route One
(beginning to laugh) Oh, yeah
(laughing) And Frankie opened up the hood and the water cap blew right up in the air
And the cop came over
That's right, the cop
He thought Frankie shot off a gun
They are both laughing audibly now at the memory
He was going to pull us all in
Oh, man
Frankie, he was funny
Oh, that was a lot of fun, those days
Yeah, they were
The little spasm of laughter is over
sort of ruefulness settles down on the two young husbands
Kenneth looks lazily down the aisle to see how the Young Fellow is making out with The Girl
He seems to be making out all right
They are looking steadily at each other now
Kenneth turns back to Charlie
Hey, this guy's making out all right
She's giving him the eye now
Charlie leans forward to see this progress
(looking out the window at the passing local station) Where are we now, Prince Street bet you he picks her up before we hit Chambers Street
Somehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands
Again they sit silently as the train buckets along
Boy, 'm bushed today
was up till two o'clock last night on this thing here
'm getting to be a nervous wreck
snarled at Helen this morning
think this whole night school business is getting me down
don't see how you do it
Neither do
thought  was through with it
The plan was for me to quit work and go to college full time and cram through in a year or so
But now we got this kid coming, and Helen's going to have to quit her job, and that sets me back where started from
Another five years of this, summers included
couldn't do it, man, 'll tell you that
wish  could, but  couldn't
Oh, what am  griping about
This is the life  picked out for myself
But it's a grind, boy,  tell you
They sit silently again
The train hurtles along and then suddenly slows as it approaches a stop
There is a rustle of movement among the passengers in the subway car
few people start edging toward the doors
The Girl reading the newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly in the Young Fellow's face
They regard each other
(to the girl) Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the Nassau Street exit
Well
well, at the top of the stairs, you'll see all the signs
Are you getting off here
Yes
Well, 'll follow you then
That'll be easier, if you don't mind
No, not at all
They start to crowd down the aisle
The train is chugging into the Chambers Street station, and we can see the yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces
The two young husbands, who had been following the byplay between The Girl and the Young Fellow, now watch them slowly exit
There is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both their faces
: We look down on the bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown Manhattan area around Pine Street
It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold eleven desks
But you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller offices on the floor
You get the feeling that this company occupies three or four floors of this building
Despite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look
Each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta of the bookkeeper -- the pens and pencils, the adding machine, the telephone
Some of the desks have typewriters
Along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers
At the far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights on all day
They are on now
There are two middle-aged women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty
Kenneth and Charlie enter
Ad lib hellos between them and the two middle-aged women
Charlie moves to the coat rack to hang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts for the coat rack
Behind Charlie, we see Kenneth, carrying his jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle-aged man is working
Hiya, Walter
Hiya, Walter
Walter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings
(poking in his desk drawer; amiably) Walter, what time do you come in in the mornings
You're making us all look lousy, you know that
get the feeling sometimes, you stay here overnight
Walter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work
Kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it
Two more women, gray-haired and bespectacled, come into the office
There is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background
Charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack
Arnold in yet
He starts his vacation today
He's getting married Sunday, you know
of Charlie looking out the window into the bright August morning
His face is just a little ruffled by a frown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes
Behind him, Walter and Kenneth
(a nervous, anxious man) Well, the doctor was over last night
Brought over the  rays; brought over the allergy tests
Brought over a bill for sixty-eight dollars said to him: "Doctor, you're a young man, professional, highly educated, four years of college, two years of premedical training, several years of interning, of residency
If you're so smart, how can you charge me sixty-eight dollars
One thing they apparently didn't teach you in medical school
You can't get blood from a stone
" So what's wrong with you, Walter
What's wrong
have to go to Arizona, that's what's wrong
have asthma
When  was a kid, they called it hay fever, and you carried a bag around your neck
Asafetida
Now, they call it asthma, and you have to go to Arizona
said to him: "Doctor, you're a professional man, four years of college, premedical school, Bellevue, several diplomas
Answer me a question
Who's going to pay for Arizona
"  said to him: "Doctor,"  said, "perhaps you have the illusion  am the Aga Khan have a bearing about me, perhaps, that misleads you to believe  have blood ties with the Whitneys and the Rockefellers
This isn't true
" Arizona
Did you ever hear of such nonsense
How serious is it, Walter
Serious
Nothing serious
have hay fever,  sneeze a couple of times
The idiot told my wife  have to go to Arizona, and she wouldn't leave me alone all night
She's already packing the bags
said: "For heaven's sakes, you listen to doctors, we'll all be dead
" My son, Harold, believe me, he's going to be a doctor
That's some racket, boy
Sixty-eight dollars
of Charlie, still at the window, when a bell suddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday
The sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise
Walter, in background, who had risen and was bent over Kenneth's desk, darts nervously back to his own desk
You better get to work
Hey, Charlie, that was the bell
think Flaherty is here this morning
We'll all be fired today
have a feeling
He hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration
Several other women have come into the office by now, and there is a general movement to the desks
There is the click of a typewriter, and Walter runs his fingers glibly over the adding machine on his desk
The day has started
After a moment, Charlie turns from the window and comes back to his desk, sinks down onto his chair
: -- We look down on the bookkeeping department
All the desks are occupied but two
There are six women and our three men
The office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent over his desk
There is the occasional punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing
Our three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, and ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate something on the adding machine
After a moment, Walter says: (without looking up from his work) You fellows going to Arnold's party tonight
(without looking up) No, 'm not going, are you
No
Eddie already hooked me for four bucks for Arnold's present
This dinner is going to cost another couple of good dollars
It looks like nobody's going to Arnold's bachelor party
You ain't going
No, 'm not going
Eddie's going to be mad
told Eddie last week  couldn't make it
've got school
Eddie's a bachelor
It's all right for him to go rooting around town, picking up girls
Yeah, you get married you give that kind of thing up
Yeah, Charlie says Eddie has a whole bunch of chorus girls lined up for us tonight
Walter's head comes up for the first time
No kidding
didn't say that
just said that if  knew Eddie, we'd probably wind up with some of his crazy girl friends
Walter looks back down to his work again
don't know where he gets all these girls
He's a screwy looking jerk
Did you see that blonde who was up here looking for him last week
Yeah
He told me she was a television actress
think  saw her once on "Studio One
" She was in a coal mine with some stir-crazy coalminer who was trying to strangle her with a necktie
'd like to strangle her with a necktie
Now, Walter, an old married man like you, with asthma and everything
Walter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of pain crossing his face
get real jealous of Eddie sometimes
He's as free as a bird
Did you see that convertible he's got
Yeah, he really banged it up  hear
You ought to see the old heap 've got
He walks out of here on payday, he can spend the whole works on having himself a good time
walk out of here, and  got three kids and a wife, all of them with their palms out
lost two bucks playing poker at my house last week
It was an economic catastrophe
My wife didn't sleep all night
He's late again
He'll be twenty minutes late again
If Flaherty walked in now, he'd fire him
If that ever happened to me, think 'd kill myself
What does Eddie care
So he scrambles around for another job
Flaherty told me last week  had too many days off
told him  was sick in bed
What do you want me to do
He turns back again to his work, his face creased with anxiety
The three men work silently for a moment
Then the office door opens, and a man of about thirty-five, a little stout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel-rimmed glasses, enters
This is Eddie Watkins, the office bachelor
He seems to have had very little sleep the night before
His eyes, behind the wire-rimmed glasses, are heavy-lidded cigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth
There is something of the bacchanalian libertine about Eddie
There is a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, establishing that this is Eddie
He shuffles with ineffable weariness to his desk
Hi, Eddie, you're early today, only twenty minutes late, what happened
(muttering through reluctant lips) Flaherty come in yet
No
Eddie sits down at his desk, pulls his cigarette automatically for a moment
Then he reaches over to a pile of telephone directories on the floor beside his desk, pulls up the Manhattan one, flips through the pages, finding the number he wants
He picks up the phone
Mary, give me an outside line
(he pauses, checks the number in the phone book again, dials, waits) Hello, is this Leathercraft on Madison Avenue
This is Mr
Watkins
was in about a week ago
ordered a military set and a wallet
They were supposed to be ready yesterday
Yes, please, would you
(he is searching his pockets while he waits, finds a piece of paper, pulls it out) Yeah, a military set and a wallet
Is that what we bought poor Arnold
(on phone) That's right
The following inscriptions should be on them: (reads from the paper) On the military set: "To Arnold: Best wishes on your marriage from Alice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn, Jeanette with two t's, Kenneth, Lucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and Flaherty
" Now on the wallet
Yeah, what
Yeah, that's right -- Flaherty
Now, on the wallet, the following inscription: "To my Best Friend Arnold from his Best Man Eddie
"
No, to my best friend Arnold
That's right
"From his best man Eddie"
Now, can  come in at lunch and pick them up
young woman comes into the office, goes to Walter's desk and drops some papers before him
What's this, Jeanette
It's from finance, don't ask me
This is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler three times a morning and all the men covertly watch her
She is cute, but attractive more by comparison to the other women in the office
Nevertheless, all the men, including Eddie and Charlie, let their eyes cautiously watch her as she leaves, her sheath dress tight on her hips
Eddie, who has hung up, now rubs his eyes with two fingers to clear his head and picks up the phone again
(on phone) Mary, give me the Hotel Westmore
Circle 7-0598
(hands Kennie paper) This isn't for me -- it's for you
(to the others) Now who owes me on the presents
Charlie, you owe me
gave you four bucks yesterday
owe you, Eddie
'll pay you tomorrow, payday
(on phone) Miss Frances Kelley, please think it's room 417
The three heads around him look slowly up from their respective work, naked interest manifest on their faces
(calling to one of the women in the office) Hey, Evelyn, you owe me four bucks
(calling back) All right
know
(on phone) Hello, Frances, this is Eddie
All right, wait a minute
Give me a chance to explain
know  woke you up
All right, let me tell you
You know 'm supposed to be the best man at this fellow Arnold's wedding
So  called him up last night because  didn't know whether was supposed to wear tuxedo or tails
Well, he didn't know either, so he said: "Come on over to my girl's house with me tonight
They're making all the arrangements for the wedding now
" So  called you and left a message at the desk saying  couldn't get over till about ten o'clock
All right
That's what 'm going to explain
Thank you
(holds receiver against his chest and looks at his colleagues with air of a man being tried just a little too much
Returns receiver to his ear, listens for a moment) All right, so  had to go over to Arnold's girl's house with Arnold last night
Well, there was about thirty people there, and, man, you never saw such a crazy mess
There was this little bald-headed guy there
He's the bride's uncle
He's come all the way down from Boston with his whole family to go to the wedding
The only trouble was, he wasn't invited
Well, this crazy uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he starts shaking me by the lapels
So said: "What do you want from me
ain't the groom
'm just trying to find out whether 'm supposed to wear tuxedo or tails
" (apparently this got a laugh
Eddie breaks into a smile) Funny, huh
Look, Frances have to go to work now
'm calling you from the office
How about letting me make this up to you
'll take you out to dinner Saturday night
can't make it tonight
The bachelor party's tonight
All right, Saturday night
It's a date
'help me
swear, right on time
Eight-thirty, okay
Okay, we'll have a ball
Goodbye, go back to sleep
He hangs up
The three married men look down again to their ledgers and tap away again on their adding machines
Eddie sits slumped in his seat for a moment
What did  just tell that girl, Saturday night
Yeah
(picks up phone) Mary, give me Columbus 5-1098
What do you mean personal calls
These are business calls
Well, stop listening to other people's conversations
What have you got, stock in the company
Columbus 5-1098
(waits) Listen, Eddie,  don't think  can go tonight
My father-in-law's in from Akron, Ohio, and---- (all sweetness) Hello, who is this, Mrs
Stebbins
This is Eddie, Mrs
Stebbins wonder if  can talk to Muriel
Could  speak to her
Thank you
The three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy on each face
(on phone) Muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, can't make it Saturday night
'm all loused up with this wedding 'm supposed to be the best man at
We have to rehearse the ceremony
You'd think they were getting married on television
Yes, sweetie, why don't  call you Monday
Maybe, we'll work out something before you go back to California
All right, sweetie, good-bye
He hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the cigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and turns to the others
Well, what do you say
'm going to call Louie and make a reservation for a table for tonight
Who's coming and who isn't
Walter, you're coming, right
It won't cost you more than three-fifty for the whole meal
What do you say, Walter
You only live once
(strangely sad) That's right
You only live once
Well, yes or no
All right, 'll come
Kennie
Yeah, 'll get out of the house for a change
How about you, Charlie
Charlie is frowning down at a sheaf of adding machine totals in front of him
don't think so, Eddie
Ah, come on, Charlie, you got to bust loose every now and then
We'll have a couple of drinks
(picks up phone) Mary, give me an outside line and don't give me no trouble
Chickering 4-5099
Come on, Charlie, it's a short life, believe me
Move in for  of Charlie, frowning
Over this, Eddie's voice
' Hello, hello, Louie
Is this Louie
Louie, this is Eddie Watkins
'd like to reserve a table for four for tonight
For four
Hey, Eddie
' What
Count me in
He immediately bends back to his work, takes his pencil up again
until we have an looking down at their desks in various positions of work
(on phone) Louie, make that five
Five guys Yeah, a bachelor party
-- with a big loud blare on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village on a warm August night
Packed sidewalks, jammed traffic, taxis, trucks, buses, honking of horns, etc
Man-we're-going-to-have-a-ball type feeling
: -- Thirteenth Street off Sixth Avenue not so blary and lit up as the main drags, but traffic is heavy, and there are lots of people on the sidewalks
There are a number of restaurants dotting the street with their little striped awnings and modest neons
If we are on our toes, we notice one neon that reads: "'
" : ' The entire interior isn't too much to show, really
It's a small restaurant, but it is packed
Waiters scurry here and there
People jammer and jab
Hustle and bustle
In background, we can pick out our bachelor party, five men now, clustered around a table, yakking it up
of our bachelor party, showing all five
They all seem to be in the best of spirits
The new member of the cast is Arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant-looking young man of thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable
Of all the men at the party, he is the quietest
He sits, a smile nailed onto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as they talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked
The dinner is over
During the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues to remove the used dishes
Several large bottles of beer and two fifths of Scotch are on the table
There is a welter of variously assorted glasses
Eddie, Walter, and Kenneth are smoking cigars, Charlie a cigarette
The Groom is not smoking
We have cut into the scene during a jumble of conversation
Walter is talking to Charlie, whose head is bent toward the older man
Kenneth is trying to tell the Groom a joke, but the Groom's attention is being distracted by Eddie, who is leaning across the table trying to get Charlie's attention
Ad libs
(finishing story) Three hundred pounds
Isn't she kind of fat
No, man, tall
Hey, waiter
Waiter
Hey, Charlie
(to Charlie) so we were stationed right outside Paris, about eight miles, a town called Chatou
hey, Charlie
(to Charlie) so the first night, a whole bunch of us swiped a jeep out of the motor court
We had a feller there who was a tech sergeant in the motor court
Oh, what a character he was
He used to get loaded every night on that vanilla extract
Hey, Charlie
What do you want, Eddie
Hey, Charlie, did  ever tell you about the time  was stationed at Buckley Field in Denver, and picked up this girl in Lakeside Amusement Park
Hey, Eddie, listen to this story 'm telling Charlie
Hey, Arnold, 'm telling Charlie about the time me and that crazy tech sergeant from the motor court got loaded on vanilla extract and went to Paris Hey, Kenneth
When do the Giants come back from their road trip, does anybody know
Hey, let's give out the presents now
Hey, Kenneth, listen to this story

What
Oh, that Paris

Clubs
You had to beat the women off with clubs
(to people at another table) What
Oh, it's a bachelor party -- this guy's getting married
Listen,  want to give the presents
Well, let me tell you what happened
Hey, you know what was a great town for women, Hamburg
Hamburg
Clubs
Clubs
You had to beat them off with clubs
Hey, waiter -- who's our waiter
Hey, Arnold, enjoying yourself
The first night  was in Hamburg, two Frauleins come walking right in the barracks
So  said to the lieutenant
Walter, who is pretty lit, suddenly stands and bangs the table mightily with his fist
(bellowing out) The best fighting outfit in the whole fighting army was the fighting Hundred and Fourth Infantry Division, General Terry Allen commanding
This brings the jumbled conversation to a halt
Walter surveys the other four, looking for possible challenges, then sits heavily down
(standing) Well, now that we got that settled
'm with you, Walter
We believe you, Walter
'd like to make a little speech to our guest of honor and mutual friend, Arnold Craig
Arnold, a bunch of us down the office, the girls too, all chipped in, and we got you a couple of small gifts
Eddie crosses to extra chair, picks up wrapped gifts, crosses back to his place
(whispering to Kenneth) These are the gag gifts
Let's see, what's this one
Oh, yeah
Arnold, we figured Louise might be very sleepy on your wedding night, so we thought you might want something to keep you warm
Walter leans forward to see what the tissue-wrapped parcel Arnold is now unwrapping is
What is it
What is it
Arnold holds a hot-water bottle aloft
Walter is seized with a paroxysm of laughter at this immensely Rabelaisian gift
It's a hot-water bottle
Okay, Walter, okay
Hey, did you see that
Hey, he bought him a hot-water bottle for his wedding night
Hey, that's funny
Hey, Eddie, you should have bought him an ice pack for after tonight
(holding a second parcel) Walter, take it easy
Now, this one, Arnold, this one is something to keep you busy on cold winter nights
(crosses to Arnold; to the others) This ought to be good
Look at Walter
Walter has come around behind Arnold's chair and can hardly wait to see what the next joke is
Hey, these are funny
Who bought these
You buy these, Eddie
These are funny
You got a good sense of humor
Arnold unwraps the parcel, holds out a miniature baby bottle
This is too much for Walter; how funny can you get
He clutches his sides
Hey, did you guys see that
Hey, did you guys see that
Come on, Walter, sit down
Charlie and Kenneth are smiling appreciatively
Walter crosses with bottle, sits, starts pouring whisky into baby bottle
Eddie got a good sense of humor, you know
(to Charlie) Boy, old Walter is crocked
(smiling, rising halfway in his chair) Listen,  want to thank you
Really
really want to thank you fellows
We haven't got to the serious presents yet, Arnold
hush falls over the assembled guests
Arnold composes his face into a solemn expression and looks down at the cluttered table
(solemnly) Well, in all seriousness, Arnold, seriously,  don't know why you picked me to be your best man, but am deeply honored
guess it's because we're both Dodger fans, and 'm going to miss you at next Tuesday's night game when the Pittsburgh Pirates invade Ebbets Field
We always had a lot of fun together, and, seriously, Arnold, in all seriousness, good luck on your wedding, but see if you can't get out of the house occasionally, see a night game or even a Sunday doubleheader with your old buddy, Eddie
This touching address has brought a note of sadness to the gathering
Indeed, there are tears in Walter's and Arnold's eyes
(handing Arnold two neatly wrapped packages) Well, anyway, in all seriousness, here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office and good luck
Arnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed
Eddie sits and all faces turn to Arnold
Well,  just want to thank you fellows
don't know what to say
just want to thank you
Open the presents, Arnold
will
just want to say, Eddie, that when the Pirates invade Ebbets Field next Tuesday night, 'm going to be sitting right there in Section 37 there right with you
You'll be on your honeymoon next Tuesday, Arnold
This interesting information gives Arnold pause
Gee, that's right
(smiling) Arnold, you're getting married Sunday, did you forget
Look at him blush
(frowning fuzzily) No,  didn't forget
It's just that Gee, that's right
Sunday
What's today, Thursday
and All day
Boy, it's here, isn't it
guess 've been running around so much the last couple of weeks,  guess the wedding snuck up on me
think Arnold's having a little buck fever
Does anyone know what our waiter looks like
(to Kenneth) You know who didn't want to chip in for Arnold's presents
Arnold'll be all right
Have a drink, Arnold
had my basic training in Camp Croft, South Carolina, near Spartanburg
was at Maxwell Field, what a desert
Walter, what ever happened when you and that tech sergeant from the motor pool got loaded on vanilla extract
What tech sergeant
Walter, you're crocked
(to Arnold) Open up the presents -- see what you got
Hey, are you our waiter
Bring us some ice
got him --  got our waiter
It was sure nice of you fellows
The voices have risen again into the jumbled high spirits that opened the scene
Hey, man, we're having a ball
: -- We look down on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village
It is eight thirty at night
It is a fairly active and well-lit street, bright with neons and movie marquees and lit-up shops
Our five carousers are marching down the sidewalk, that is four of them are on the sidewalk
Walter can't quite decide whether he wants to walk on the sidewalk or in the street
He keeps hopping in and out between the parked cars, running to catch up when he falls behind
They are all feeling pretty good
Arnold is singing in a wavering baritone: De-Witt -l-i-n-t-o-n Boom
Clinton
Oh, Cli-inton
Ever to theeeee
of the five carousers
(singing) Fairest of high schools
How did he ever get on this alma mater kick
(singing) Give her three times three Oh, fellows
Rah
Rah
Rah
of the five carousers, Walter whistling at two passing girls
Long may we cherish thee Faithful we'll be
Clinton, oh, Clinton For you and me
Da-da-da-da-da
Crash through that line of blue And send the backs around the end
There he goes with those fullbacks again
Rah
Rah
Rah
: -- of our five carousers paused on the curb, waiting for the lights to change in their favor
Greenwich Avenue traffic is pretty heavy, going in both directions
The five men are kind of strung out along the curb with Charlie being the last in line
Standing beside him, also waiting for the light to change, is a good-looking, well-dressed, chic young woman of twenty-four or five
Where we going
Eddie's place to see movies
What movies
Boy, just wait till you see these movies
Hey, Charlie, hey Charlie
What
(indicating the young woman) Who's your beautiful friend, Charlie
Charlie turns and regards the pretty young woman
(to the girl) Excuse me
My friend down there wants to know who you are
The young woman, who for our own mysterious purposes we shall refer to as The Existentialist, regards the five reasonably tight young men all staring at her
Kenneth has already begun to giggle
(with a Mona Lisa smile) Where are you all from, out-of-town
Indiana
(turning to the others) Isn't that right, fellers
We're from Indiana, right
Indiana
Indiana, man
Kenneth and Arnold, to whom this incident is already unbearably funny, have turned away and are clutching their sides, trying to suppress a fit of giggles
(to The Existentialist) We're from the Hoosier State, ma'am
Terre Haute
We're from Terre Haute
(to The Existentialist) We're from Terre Haute, and we've come to the big city looking for a good time, and we just don't know what to do with ourselves, ma'am
(to Walter) Look at that Charlie operate
Must be a convention in town
We've just come off the ranch there, honey, and we're just raring
Is that right, men
Are we raring
We're raring, boy, we're raring
(beside himself with laughter) Hey, Charlie, cut it out, will you
The lights change and The Existentialist starts off across Greenwich Avenue to the west side of the street
The five carousers follow right along after her
That is, Charlie dogs along behind The Existentialist as they cross the street
Walter and Eddie are close behind him, listening to Charlie's pitch
Kenneth and Arnold, embarrassed and giggling, stagger along behind
(chugging along behind The Existentialist) We're down here in Greenwich Village looking for some wild bohemians
Do you happen to know any wild bohemians
All right, fellows, enough's enough, huh
She steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of Greenwich Avenue and hurries along down Tenth Street to a little house about four doors down, the five carousers on her heels like a pack of puppies
(hurrying along after The Existentialist) 'm something of a poet myself, ma'am
Many's the long night in the bunkhouse where  sat by myself and wrote by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp
Could  read you some of my poems, ma'am
know they ain't much, but they're from the heart, ma'am
The Existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down Tenth Street to examine Charlie with some interest
You have a sense of humor, don't you
(to Charlie) You're going great, man, don't stop now
The Existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front door of the house and rings the bell
(to The Existentialist) Where are you going, honey
The Existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to answer her ring
Charlie has wandered back to Arnold and Kenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with laughter
Kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are coming out of his eyes
He walks around in little circles clutching his sides
Several passersby hurry by, noting the strange little group on the sidewalk
(to The Existentialist) What's going on in there, honey
(patiently bored) There's a party going on
'm not sure 'm invited myself, so  can't really invite you
Sure you can
The door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there looking at The Existentialist and then at the five men on the sidewalk
Behind her, there is evidence of a party going on
How nice to see you, darling
Who are your friends
haven't the vaguest idea
was ambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue by a tribe of the Terre Haute Kiwanis
(she waves a vague hand in a sort of shooing motion at the five men on the sidewalk) Go away, you men
Go back to the Biltmore Hotel and put on your red caps
always thought you city people were more hospitable to us poor farm boys
The other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk
Charlie has ambled up to The Existentialist, who is peering over her hostess into the room behind her
(to The Existentialist, smiling amiably) 'm sorry, miss
friend of ours is getting married here, and we're just horsing around
The Existentialist looks into the young man's smiling, rather winning face
Why don't you come back after you get rid of your friends
He'll be back
She turns abruptly and disappears past the hostess into the room
(to Charlie) Man, she likes you, man
Now, you boys go away
She backs into her house and closes the door
Eddie starts up the steps to the door
The other four just roar with laughter, clutch their sides, and giggle and snort
Well, what do you say, men, are we going to this party, or aren't we
(laughing) Come on, Eddie
thought you had some movies you want to show us
What do you want to see movies for
You got the real thing right here
(laughing) Eddie, we're married men here
Come on, let's crash this party
've been to these Greenwich Village parties
Man, they're wild
Come on, Eddie, let's go up to your place, see these movies
(coming reluctantly back to the others, says to Charlie) Man, you were going strong with that girl
You could have scored
She's just waiting for you
Go in after her
Come on, Eddie
Let's go see the movies
(to the others) All right,  live about three blocks down
You guys want to see movies, all right, let's go see movies
: ' Eddie is scowling over a home-style movie projector, muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets
Arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing away at him
during the scene so that we can see into the living room of the apartment, appointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the other three men move in and out of view
Right now, we are concerned only with Arnold and Eddie
we're moving in with her mother and father
don't know if that's such a good idea
What do you think
We haven't got an apartment yet, and we figure we'll live a year with her folks, save on the rent, see
Kenneth comes back from the kitchen with three open bottles of beer
Anybody want a bottle of beer
(to Eddie) She's a widow, and that bothers me a little
don't know why
She's two years older than me
don't know if you know that
Her husband got killed in Korea
She's a cousin of mine, you know
(moving into the living room) Who wants a bottle of beer
'll take a bottle
Yeah, give me one
third cousin, something like that
It's not good for cousins to marry, is it
What do you think of her know she's not terribly pretty, but mean
(muttering imprecations at the projector) Arnold, leave me alone a minute, will you
Sure
(turns to the others in living room, plants a huge smile on his face) Well, 'm getting married Sunday
Having fun, Walter
Fun
bunch of grown men sitting around waiting to look at college boy pictures
swear,  never thought two months ago  was ever going to get married
still don't know how it happened
Hey, somebody turn off the lights
Walter is promptly up to turn off the lights
Hey, you know, you've got a nice place here
The room is abruptly flooded in darkness
beam of light shoots out from the projector
It seems pointed at the window
Arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light
was just taking her out
didn't know it was so serious
Arnold, get out of the way, will you
Oh, sure
Arnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow huge on the wall
Eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector around trying to focus it on the screen
The square of light and some flickering images wander up and down a wall
We're sitting in the car, so she says: "Well, Arnold, we've been going together six months now think it's time we decided whether we were being serious
" Hey, Eddie, you got it on the window
didn't know it was so serious didn't even know we were going together
just took her out every now and then
Arnold, you're funny
Turn on the lights again, will you, Walter
What's the matter
forgot to loop it over this loop thing
Walter crosses to light switch
The room is flooded in light again
Oh, for crying out loud
(small panic) can't even remember what she looks like
just saw her this afternoon
Arnold, have a bottle of beer
It's not so terrible
Boy,  tell you
It's for the rest of your life when you get married
This is a big decision to make
Does anybody seriously want to see these movies
Eddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools so that we are looking back up the living room toward the projector and the men
could be making a serious mistake
Arnold, you're in the way again
Come on now
All right, put off the lights
The room is flooded in darkness again
Walter hurries to a chair
The square of light is reasonably focused, just an edge trailing off onto the drapes of the window
Numbers flicker quickly on on the screen
The rest of the scene we see looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their various posts
Arnold crosses, stands back of Walter
Here we go
Hey, Arnold, if this is the one think it is, there's one part here want you to see
(a picture of determined boredom, but putting on his glasses) This is for kids
Says he -- putting on his glasses
"The Baseball Game
" That's a nice title, don't you think
This is the one, Arnold
There's a guy in here who looks just like Arnold
Hey, she's not bad
Usually, the girls in these things look like dinosaurs
(his eyes glued to the screen) bunch of grown men
He breaks off as apparently some interesting action has started on screen
An involuntary grunt of acknowledgment escapes him
got these pictures off my dentist
don't know where be got them
There you are, Arnold, that's you
Yeah, it does look like Arnold
Doesn't that look like Arnold
Who's looking at the guy
Arnold, you've got a great career ahead of you
That girl looks like the girl Charlie picked up just before
Probably is
That fellow there is not a bad actor
Actor
You could play that part pretty easy yourself
think the Daily News gave this one four stars
'd like to see this in Three-
The side comments drift off for a moment, and a sort of frozen attention settles on the white faces
Each face is sort of set in a mold of determined disinterest, but the eyes are all watching
Well, 'll just watch one of them
Then,  think 'll just go home
He wets his lips, lifts the bottle of beer to his mouth and takes a swallow
His eyes never leave the screen
: ' Helen standing in front of the laundry part of the sink, doing her private laundry
She has on a house smock and her sleeves are rolled up
The doorbell rings
Helen takes a towel off the doorknob behind her and, wiping her hands, comes down across the dining area to the front door
She opens the door to admit a young woman, about eight years older than Helen
Hiya, Julie
was beginning to think you weren't coming
(coming in) was at my mother's house
Did they call you
They said they were going to call you
Yeah, your mother was very sweet
You should have seen my father said, "Pa, you have another grandchild coming
" So he said, "Who
" So  said, "Charlie
" So he said, "That little Helen
" So  said, "If it isn't that little Helen, Charlie better leave town
" So out came the beer
Well, they've been after Charlie to have a baby for a long time now
said, "Pa, leave him alone
Let him get established before he saddles himself with a baby
" Anyway,  want you to know joy reigns supreme in your in-laws' house
(she moves into the kitchen) How's Charlie taking it
(following her into the kitchen) Listen, let me make you a cup of tea or something
No, no, 've been drinking beer for the last two hours, celebrating your baby
Soda, anything like that
No, honey, you go on with your wash
Is that what you're doing
(she sits) When  had my first baby, Mike was ashamed to be seen on the streets with me
Well, listen, he was interning at the time
We needed a baby like a hole in the head
That's why he's a general practitioner now, because of that baby
He was studying to be a surgeon
He absolutely refused to admit  was pregnant
Even in my ninth month, and  was as big as a house
He used to walk ten paces in front of me in the street like he didn't know who that woman with the belly was
Where is Charlie anyway
told you he-- Oh, yeah
wouldn't let my Mike go on a bachelor party
(turning back to her wash) What are they going to do, get a little drunk
Are you kidding
What do you think these bachelor parties are for, bachelors
This is for the married men
It's a good excuse to get drunk and find some girls
Can you picture Charlie getting drunk and picking up a girl
Charlie's old sobersides
You should have seen what  went through to get him to make a pass at me
He's so sweet
Nobody knows how really sweet he is, he's so quiet all the time
My brother died in September, he used to stay up with me till three, four o'clock every night
used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me
used to look at him talking there, and  used to think: "What would  do without this sweet man here
'd go crazy
" You know, you like to be a little cynical sometimes, Julie
Wait'll you've been married eleven years
You like to talk about all the affairs everybody's husband is having
Do you know actually one woman whose husband is actually playing around
An abrupt, sad expression, tinged with pain, has come over Julie's face
She looks down at the table
Wait'll you've been married eleven years
Helen, aware that she has perhaps touched on a sensitive subject, frowns and turns back to her washing
quick, thick silence dips into the room
(looking down) Wait'll Charlie gets to be forty-two
My Mike's having an affair right now with one of his patients right now
We don't talk about it -- don't you, either, not even to Charlie
But Mike knows  know about it
even know the patient
married woman with a hyperthyroid problem
My Mike's a good doctor with a pretty good practice
The kids are crazy about him
But every now and then he has to go out and get involved with a woman
She looks down at her hands in her lap
Listen,  will take a cup of tea if you've got one
She stands, opens the pantry, looks around among the cans and packages for a box of tea bags
(quite shocked) You're kidding, aren't you
(finds the box of tea bags) Would  kid about something like that
She puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a saucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills it with water
Helen regards her, not quite knowing what to say
Julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at it
don't know why  told you
Don't tell anybody, not even Charlie don't want the family to know
But this woman isn't the first one know that much
About three years ago, the doorbell rings
open the door
There's a man there
He says: "Tell your husband to stay away from my sister
" How would you like to open the door and have somebody say that to you
cried for two weeks
don't know what to do about it, Helen
Should  bring it out in the open with Mike or should  just keep my mouth shut like the other time
Because he's not going to leave me
Even if he doesn't care about me, he has his kids to think about
We married too young
That was our big mistake
We married too young
Her face, her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any possibility of breaking into tears, and she sits down abruptly on the kitchen stool, her eyes clenched tight and her face rigidly impassive
Helen remains nervously silent
(her voice rising just a little from the suppressed emotion within her) We should have waited till he finished his internship
What kind of married life is that
Twenty-two dollars a month he was earning
Every other day, he had to sleep in the hospital
The first two years of our marriage, we didn't even see each other
And then 'm pregnant
He had to quit, what do you think
He wanted to be a surgeon, he wound up being a
From that day he hated me
had two other children by him, but he hated me
He told me in just so many words
Why do you think  kept telling you, Helen, why do you think  kept telling you: "Don't have a baby till Charlie finds himself
" (suddenly cries out) It hurts
Even after eleven years, it hurts
She stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen
After a moment, Helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the dining area
She looks through the dark living room to the gray silhouette of Julie standing by the living room window, her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight
Are you all right, Julie
(muttering) 'm all right
'm all right
: '  (45  ) We are looking back up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this apartment
The room is absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer
In this shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights
The room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden glare
They have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their ties
They are lolling about to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an opened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of cigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair
Over this we hear Walter's voice: Is that the last one
Yeah
thick silence fills the room
There is a kind of sodden feeling to this scene
After a long moment, Walter's voice again: Ah, you've seen one, you've seen them all
Yeah, they're all alike
don't know --  think the first one was all right
Yeah,  was so bored by the rest of them
nearly fell asleep during the last one
You in the habit of sleeping with your eyes open
We look down on the room now, at all five of the men, Eddie rewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector humming
The others loll about, their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas
There is a heavy, dense mood that no one seems willing to break
What time's it about, anybody know
(glancing at his watch) got a quarter to nine
No, it's later than that, about a quarter after
Again the silence falls upon the five men
Only the humming little motor interrupts the thick silence
Nobody moves
(after a moment) Ah, you see one, you've seen them all
Again the silence
Charlie stretches over for his bottle of beer on the floor beside his chair
He pours what's left of the bottle into the glass standing beside it
Otherwise nobody moves
(after a moment) So that's the last one you've got to show us, Eddie
Yeah
You want to run them backwards
wonder where they get the girls to make these movies
Might as well go home,  guess
Yeah
The idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive movement
Walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches out his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness
(after a moment) Life is short
This gives everybody something to think about for a moment
(hunched over the projector, dismantling it) You guys feel like going down to have a drink for Arnold
This brings a reaction
Walter stands
Yeah
What do you say
One last drink for Arnold
Okay with me
Suddenly life is back in the room, the men ad-lib: "Where's my coat
" "Let's get out of here," etc
(unwinding himself from his slouched position on a chair) You can say what you want to about these pictures -- they're really pretty bad -- but they get you
Don't you think we ought to clean up the place
No,  got a woman comes in
(grabbing up his jacket) almost fell asleep during the last one
(he looks at the others) Well, what do you say, huh
Let's go
One last drink
Ad libs on exit
: ' Helen and Julie
corner lamp in the living room is lit, lending a soft but not too effective light to the room
The two young women are on the couch
Helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five minutes ago
Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch
She is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over with
He's a boy, my Mike
Till the day he dies, he'll never be more than fifteen
Perpetual adolescence, that's the curse of the professional man
He spends his whole youth trying to be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant
Then he spends the rest of his life looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy
Oh,  know
Charlie and  hardly even see each other
It's very hard on the wife, Helen
These are the years when you should be building your marriage
Instead, you grow away from each other
've seen it happen with my friends
In the end, they have nice homes in New Rochelle, and a maid, and their maids are happier than they are
But sometimes it does work
It can be done, Helen
Encourage Charlie to stay with his school because
Oh,  will, Julie
he's an ambitious boy
oh, it's not just he's ambitious
and if he doesn't fulfill himself, he'll resent you and your baby the rest of his life
Oh,  don't want him to quit
He loves accounting, Julie
see him sometimes, sitting over his homework
He's got his ledgers out, and he's adding up columns of figures as long as his arm
And he's chuckling
You'd think he was reading the comics
He has a book there, Business Law
How he can read it don't know
But 'll be watching television or something, and he'll come over, and he'll start telling me about some fine legal point don't know what he's talking about, but it's enough for me to see how excited it makes him
He loves it, Julie
You can't take something like that away from him
It's just -- it's just  feel we're not really close any more
mean, he comes home from school, lots of times 'm asleep already
And, when  do see him, he seems all involved with himself
He looks at me sometimes as if  were a stranger to him, and feel sometimes  am
'm afraid of that, Julie
Then get rid of the baby
It is said simply, inevitably, even innocently
It brings only a frown to Helen's face and a short silence
If  had it to do again, believe me, that's what  would do
(slowly becoming aware of the depth of what they are talking about) You don't mean that, Julie
Yes,  do
My children are the only things in my life now, but  would rather have a husband
wouldn't even think about it
That's what  said, too
Let's not even think about it
If even mentioned it, he'd -- he'd hit me,  think
All right
Now, the thick, tense silence falls between them
They both occupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts
want this baby, Julie
've wanted this baby for a long time
It's the only thing 've ever asked of Charlie
If  mentioned that to him --  don't know what he'd do
Again, they sink into silence
Then in the thick silence, the telephone rings
The two young women are so deep within their thoughts that neither of them moves
It rings again, and Helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone
It rings again
She picks it up
(on phone) Hello
Hello, Charlie, where are you calling from
You sound like you're having a nice time
Oh, you're having a ball, huh
Well, what time do you think you'll be coming home
Charlie in the phone booth, smiling broadly
He seems in wonderful spirits
Through the glass of the phone booth we can see part of the bar and some of the barflies
(on phone) Well, that's what  wanted to call you about, honey
think a couple of the guys are cutting out now think Kennie's going home
But  was wondering if you wanted me home for any special reason
(on phone) Just a minute, Charlie
She rises, goes to kitchen door, still holding the phone
(to Julie) Excuse me a minute, Julie
It's Charlie
She goes into the kitchen
little embarrassed, she closes the kitchen door
(on phone) Charlie
(sits) Charlie, come on home now
No, feel all right
just miss you
Julie's here, and we were talking about you, and  just miss you
Ah, come on
(frowns a little) Well, no, if you're having such a good time, stay out and enjoy yourself
No, Charlie,  don't want you to come home if you're having a good time
'm not lonely
Julie's here
We're talking
was washing some things know, that's what  told you this morning
You've finally got a night off for yourself
don't want you to feel guilty about it
Charlie, do you love me
You sound angry
No, come home any time you want
(she wets her lips nervously) Charlie
(she lets her head sink down onto the palm of her free hand) Charlie, there's no girls at this party, are there
'm not checking up on you, Charlie
just miss you, that's all
All right, Charlie, please,  don't want to argue with you
Julie's in the living room
All right, have a good time, stay out as long as you want
All right, Charlie, good- bye
She slowly hangs up the receiver, sits slumped and abject
Charlie in booth
The broad grin has disappeared from his face
As seen through the closed glass doors of the booth, he is a very sullen and despondent young man
He stands now, pushes the doors open, and comes out
so that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone booths
Next to the phone booth are two doors marked and
Kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of the bar where the other members of the bachelor party are grouped in a booth
He is headed for the door marked
Charlie regards Kenneth bleakly as he approaches
The party breaking up
(pushing into the men's room) don't know
'm going home
You going home
Yeah,  think so
He pushes into the men's room after Kenneth
' small, white-tiled, yet somehow not too clean, men's room, two-urinal size
There is one washbowl with a small mirror over it, and two water closets with doors, separated from each other by a steel partition
Charlie perches on the edge of the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk
Kenneth moves off camera for more practical use of the room stays on Charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad
Stay on him for a long moment
Then
(frowning) You love your wife, Kennie
' (off) Well, 've been married six years
've got two kids that keep me awake all night long
Every Sunday, we go out driving in Long Island looking for a house that's going to take one, probably two mortgages
better love my wife
Kenneth appears now, edges Charlie away from the wash basin, so he can wash his hands
don't feel like going home
Are you going
Hang around, Kennie
It's only about nine thirty, ten
It's after ten
It's about ten after ten
Kenneth rips off a paper towel
The only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as Kenneth dries his hands
The party's getting a little wild in there anyway
Eddie and Walter got poor Arnold nailed in there, they're trying to talk him into getting a girl
This party's going to wind up in a joint, let me tell you
This is a good time to blow
(frowning) Yeah
should have gone to class tonight
'm paying twenty bucks a credit
The least  can do is go to class
He breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown
take one night off,  can't even enjoy myself
Did you know Eddie went back to Europe
No,  didn't know that
He was telling me he lived in Paris for three months
'd like to do that
He ambles around the men's room, studying himself with unseeing eyes in the little mirror, poking the trash can into which Kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel
He suddenly turns to Kenneth, stares at him
Kenneth looks at him in mirror
What's the matter
'm going to quit
What am killing myself for
Quit what
Quit night school
Tonight was the first laughs 've had in years can't remember the last time  had so much fun
Look what 'm missing
'm making a pretty good living can support a wife and baby on what make
'm going to quit
mean it
'm going to quit
Boy, what a time to have a baby
You don't have to quit school because you're having a baby, Charlie
There are lots of guys go to night school with two, three kids
You ought to meet some of these guys
They're just grinding their lives away
It's an obsession with some of these guys
mean, what's the point
So 'll go five more years to night school
So 'll get my degree
So 'll get a job as a junior accountant for three years at seventy-five bucks a week
'm making better than that now
And then it just starts
The exams
By the time 'm fifty, can start living
At this point, get a heart attack and an ulcer, and they bury me in the ground, and they say: "That was Charlie Samson, the man who didn't see a movie in fifty years
" Why go through all that
'll quit
feel so mad right now, you better keep an eye on me, Kennie, because 'm going to wind up punching somebody
The door opens
Man enters to clean a spot off his tie
Come on, let's go home
What do  want to go home for
You're in a lousy mood
The man, finished with his tie, exits
(after a moment) Charlie, go home
can see you're going to get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and you're going to wake up in the morning feeling like two-bits
It'd be a profit
Charlie, about five years ago, went without a job for seven months
Alice was carrying our first baby
We were living on money  borrowed from my brother
don't know if you remember me in those days, but it was rough
used to go out every night, put a load on, and make a pass at any girl who looked at me
And  mean any
Big, tall, short, fat, anything
Well, one night picked up some tomato somewheres, and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres, and  kept calling her Alice all night
So she says to me: "My name ain't Alice
Who's Alice
" So  said: "Alice is my wife," and got up and  went home
Charlie waits a moment for Kenneth to continue, but apparently this is all Kenneth has to offer at the moment
What does that mean
don't know
had a point when started telling that story
'm not looking for another woman
Yes, you are, Charlie
You may not know it, but you are
So go on home, Charlie, before you get any drunker than you are
Charlie, you start messing with other women, something goes
It'll kill your marriage
It'll kill your wife
It'll just kill her
What my wife went through -- well,  don't even want to remember it
It's never the same with your wife again, Charlie
'm not looking for any woman
think what  was trying to say was you stick with your night school
Some guys have to make peace with themselves that they're never going to amount to too much
guy like me
Once  made that peace with myself, found out it doesn't really matter what you amount to
got a nice wife and two children  complain about all the time, but if anything ever happened to either one of them, think 'd die
But you don't have to make that kind of peace, and you'd be crazy to settle for less than what you want
You want something, Charlie
think that's wonderful
(Charlie's eyes go toward Kenneth) You're a little drunk now, and you're fed up to the teeth
Everybody gets fed up, Charlie
You stick with it
You're going to be all right
(touched) You're a nice guy, Kennie
Sure
You're a nice guy too
The door to the men's room opens, and a Young Man comes in, looks around quickly at Kenneth and Charlie -- bumps into Kennie
Watch it -- will you, Mac
Charlie regards this statement a moment
Then advances to the Young Man
Wait a minute
What are you, a wise guy
He is all set to bust the Young Man one in the nose, but Kenneth takes him by the arm
Come on, Charlie, let's go home
Charlie allows himself to be led to the door
'm just about drunk enough right now to bust somebody right in the nose
Kenneth reaches for the knob of the door, opens it, and the two men go out
They find themselves in the crowded, noisy bar
jagged kind of intensity to the atmosphere as if some of the men at the bar might be gangsters
Booths filled with men and women and some mixed-up types
Kenneth and Charlie make their way through the bodies down to one of the booths where Eddie and Arnold are sitting and Walter is standing, heavily drunk
Eddie is expostulating to Walter: (to Walter) Come on, will you
Look Walter, it's just the shank of the evening
What's so special in your home
You got a floor show every night
Who are you married to, Jayne Mansfield
Come on, it's not even half past ten
Walter sits heavily down
(smiling amiably) We got to get up tomorrow, go to work, Eddie
We're just starting
We got to get Arnold a girl yet
Eddie, please
That's the whole point to a bachelor party
You got to get the guy a girl
Look, fellows, it's been a nice clean party
Well, Arnold, since 'm not going to see you again before the wedding, congratulations and best wishes in the coming future to both you and the bride
Thanks a lot, Kennie
Eddie turns to Charlie, who is still glowering
You're not going, are you, Charlie
We're just starting
We got to get Arnold a girl yet
(to Kenneth) want to thank you for the presents, Kennie
No, 'll stick around another hour or so
That's my boy
(to Kenneth, who is looking at Charlie) Honestly,  never expected any presents
(to Charlie) Aren't you coming home
What for
Sit around talking to my sister Julie
(standing) want to thank all you fellows
All right, stop thanking them, Arnold
They just gave you a party, they didn't elect you President
This has been one of the nicest nights of my life
Let's go someplace
let's go to a nightclub
That's great with me
Come on, Ken
Thanks a lot
Well, listen, fellows, 'm cutting out
Good night, Walter, Eddie
(to Charlie) You coming, Charlie
No, 'll kill another hour
Come on, Kennie
No, you go ahead
'll see you in the morning, Charlie
Okay, 'll see you
: The little stretch of strip-joints on Third Street
Bright little cluster of honky-tonks
Our bachelor party, now down to four carousers, ambles along the rather filled sidewalk, looking at the cardboard cutouts of the strippers in the windows of the night clubs
The four men pause before one of the strip-joints, examining the cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first-rate entertainment inside
: We look down on the whole night club, showing the dark, dingy, crowded, smallness of it
There is a strip going on
It doesn't look very interesting
Our four men are huddled over a very small table in one of those Third Street clip-joints
It is a dark little hovel, but a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely illuminating our four celebrators
Behind them, a strip tease is in progress
Every now and then, an almost stout woman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed in a white satin ill-fitting gown, moves in and out of our view
Half the tables and wall booths are occupied
There is a horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club
three- piece band is playing spiritlessly
Walter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his own
Charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake
Arnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward Eddie, who alone of the four men is giving any attention to the show
So what do you think of my girl, Eddie
You met her
Be honest with me
Tell me the truth
had the feeling you didn't like her
Come on, come on, Arnold
What do you want from me
Arnold turns to Charlie
Listen, Charlie, 'd like to ask you a little advice
mean, you're a married man
This girl, 'm supposed to marry, she's all right, but 'm not really attracted to her, you know what  mean
That's important, isn't it
kissed her a couple of times, but
don't know why 'm getting married, Charlie
What did you say, Arnold
said,  don't know why 'm getting married
did pretty good for thirty-two years without getting married
get along fine at home
My mother's a good cook
have a nice life
What do  want to break it all up for
Well, Arnold, everybody feels that way before they get married
Yeah
Did  ever show you a picture of my girl
No, you didn't, Arnold
Do you want to see a picture
Sure
Arnold clumsily hauls out his wallet and extracts a picture
He gives it to Charlie who twists at an angle in order to get some light on it
want you to give me your honest impression, Charlie
She isn't much, is she
can't see much in this light, but she looks like a nice pretty girl
Well,  wouldn't say that
We were matched up, you know
The families kind of agreed on it
was brought over to her by my mother and father
That's how  met her
She's some kind of tenth cousin
She's all right
She's quiet
kissed her a couple of times
She just sat there and  kissed her
think she expected more
She even asked me that
She said to me: "Are you afraid of me
"  really don't go out with women much
You know
Don't tell nobody this, Charlie, but you aren't going to believe this, but never
mean, you wouldn't believe that a guy of my age, never
Don't tell anybody  ever told you this, but  never--  mean, Charlie, she's a widow
She's been married already -- she's going to expect a lot -- and  never ---- What do you think  ought to do
What do you mean, Arnold
mean, you think  ought to marry her
Well, Arnold, even if  knew the girl,  wouldn't answer that question
may not like her, but she may be fine for you
Because 'm thinking of calling the whole thing off
It's kind of late for that, isn't it
'm scared stiff, Charlie
What are you scared about
'm not much of a talker, and she's one of those quiet ones
What are you supposed to do with your wife
mean, most of the time
(has to think) Most of the time, Arnold, you don't even see her
You're away working
You come home, she fixes you supper
Then one of you washes the dishes
Then if you're not tired, you can go to the movies or visit somebody
Or you watch teevee
do that now with my mother
This gives Charlie pause
(scowling) don't know what there is to marriage
suppose it's to have kids
So what do you think  ought to do
You think  ought to go through with this marriage
(angry) Arnold,  can't answer that
He stands abruptly
: -- Our four amble along Washington Square North, headed west
In the background, the high apartment houses
It is about midnight now, and there are a number of people around, and there are lots of lights in the windows
There is still the feeling of life
However, some of the wind has gone out of our bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on Lexington Avenue
Now, of course, there are only four of them, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about them
-- The four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh Avenue
This is a dark little street
Off at the intersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional car moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems an empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment houses
The houses sometimes have little stoops
On one of the stoops, there is a woman sitting
She is in her thirties, not attractive nor unattractive
She wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too
As the four men approach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half questioningly
The four men note her in passing and seem to continue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten paces down
think we've got one for you, Arnold
One what
Eddie looks back to the woman on the stoop
They all turn to look
Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further down and doesn't know quite why they've stopped
They look at the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily
Rest of the scene from her point of view
Ah, come on, Eddie
She ain't bad
(calling from a few paces down) What's the matter
We've got a live one
(starting to walk) Come on, let's go
Arnold, for Pete's sake
Ah, leave him alone
He doesn't want to
Come on
We've been walking around all night here -- are you a man, or ain't you
Arnold frowns
All right, all right
With a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man
The four men, Charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward The Woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling her bare foot back into the unused shoe
(not looking up) don't know who you fellows think am, but you fellows have the wrong idea about me
Yeah,  know
Arnold, see that bar down the corner
That's where we'll be
'm afraid you fellows have the wrong idea about me
She says we have the wrong idea
Ah, leave him alone
You fellows are working under a misconception
Eddie and Walter have already started down the street to the bar
We'll be in the bar, Arnold
You all right, Arnold
Yeah, 'm all right, it's just
Look, 'm just sitting here, fellows
Did  say anything
was just sitting here
You want to come with me, Charlie
No, Arnold
Charlie scowls at the suggestion, but there is something pleading in Arnold's face
You want me to
All right
'll go up with you
(from halfway down the street) Where you going, Charlie
'll go up with him
Moral support
What the---- we'll all go with you
Charlie waves him away
(walks back to fellows) We'll be down at the bar
Charlie nods
Arnold looks briefly at The Woman and then away again
She turns and goes up the steps into the building, her leather heels clicking on the stone steps
Arnold, head down, and Charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her
dark, ill-lit hallway
flight of stairs going up, wooden railings, worn carpeting
The Woman starts up the stairs, the two men following her
(as she goes) Ssshhh
Arnold, wetting his lips, nods
The Woman reaches the first landing
The Woman has come around to one of the three doors on the landing and is inserting a key into a lock
Arnold and Charlie appear now at the head of the stairway
The Woman goes into her room, leaving the door open
moment later, a shaft of light streams out into the landing
For a moment, nothing happens
Then Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down the landing to the open doorway and shaft of light
Hey, Arnold, you don't have to go through with this
think  should
'll wait out here for you, okay
Arnold nods and goes into the room
He closes the door
Charlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales deeply
He feels a little sordid
There is the sound of steps, muffled by the carpeting, coming down the stairs man appears coming down from the floor above
He gives Charlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to the stairs and down again
Charlie scowls at the floor
He smokes his cigarette
' It is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven dollars a week
It is not particularly unkempt or tarty
There is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on an end table
There is a studio couch with a neat spread and throw pillows on it
The Woman stands expressionlessly in front of the old chest of drawers
She has kicked off one shoe and she is now kicking off the other
She starts to say something: Listen,  don't want you to think don't have a job
got a job work
She stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, on a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and moves toward the door
What's the matter
Arnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and he clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and wretched
His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary gesture, and he quickly clenches his fist
Beads of sweat are on his forehead
Are you afraid of me
Arnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens the door and steps out into the landing
The Woman, beginning to get angry, follows him
Charlie looks up at the opening of the door and Arnold's entrance
The Woman stands in the doorway
Arnold moves quickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white- faced and trembling
(getting a little shrill) What's the matter
Hey
Hey, you
Hey, you, what's the matter
Let's go
(to The Woman) What's the trouble
don't know
Ask him
What's the matter
Hey, you
You, what's the matter
Go back inside
All right, all right
How about that, huh
She turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as she crosses) and slams the door
Charlie moves down the landing to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in terror
What happened, Arnold
don't know
'm just scared
Yeah,  don't blame you, 'd be scared too like this
don't know why we dragged you up here in the first place
It's a barbaric custom
Come on
He has taken Arnold's arm and would lead him down the stairs, but Arnold pauses again at the first step
Don't tell Eddie
No  won't, Arnold
Why don't we just sit here for ten minutes or so
Charlie frowns, then shrugs
All right, Arnold
They both sit slowly on the steps
Arnold is still trembling from the whole terrifying experience
Don't ever tell anybody
It's nothing to be ashamed of
Please, Charlie
won't tell anybody
man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor
' Anything wrong down there
(calling back) No
No
Nothing wrong
Charlie sits
to both men
The whole experience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face
so that we get the small, sordid feeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty ill-lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom
Neighborhood bar with about ten people in it
Eddie and Walter are two of them
Eddie is playing on one of those bowling machines
He seems surly, ill-tempered, restless
Hey Walter -- you know what we ought to do, don't you
We ought to go to that party
Remember that girl Charlie picked up on Tenth Street
Walter, who is so drunk he is sober, looks up at Eddie with blurred eyes
'm going to die, do you know that
Not tonight, Walter
Tonight you're going to live
Ah, these things are fixed
(crosses to bar) 'm down to my last buck
Got any money on you
He turns as the door to the bar opens and Charlie and Arnold come in
(to Charlie) Hey
(to Arnold) How'd it go, lover
(Arnold smiles a mysterious smile, pregnant with sensual meaning) Hey, Charlie, let's go to this party
It's only twelve o'clock
Oh, these parties are mad, man
All the women wear pajamas, and all the men wear beards
Everybody sits on the floor
Arnold, you got any money
spent my last buck on those drinks
How about you, Charlie
(assessing his assets) got a little over a buck
What are we, all out
So let's go to this party then
(punches Charlie's arm) Hey, Charlie, come on
(himself sullen and angry) Cut it out
You can have that girl you picked up on Tenth Street
Come on
All right, you married men want to be so married that's all right with me
But 'd like to see some women tonight
(punching Charlie's arm with more hostility than he knows) Come on
Lay off
'd like to see some women tonight, you know
Do you mind
Cut it out, Eddie
You keep punching me,  swear 'm going to belt you one
What's the matter with you
Charlie is off his seat and ready to belt Eddie one right on the spot
There is abruptly the imminent reality of a fist fight
The two men are just sullen enough
Arnold hurriedly intercedes
All right, all right, fellows
Look, don't get so tough with me, Charlie
All right, all right, come on
(angry) don't want to see any other women
(just as angry) All right
Go on home
Who's holding you
You want to call it a night
Because 'm tired of grousing from one bar to another
You guys go home, and 'll go about my merry way
All right
And don't get so tough with me
Well, don't poke me
(turning Charlie back to his seat) Come on, let's go
gee
For a moment, the sudden, thick hostility fills the silence in the room
Nobody says anything
Walter is soddenly preoccupied with his own thoughts
Arnold is shaken from his recent experience with The Woman and from the flaring of tempers
Charlie just sits bleakly examining a book of matches he is toying with, trying to bring his temper down
After a moment, he mutters: (mutters) You mess around with other women, it kills your wife and it kills your marriage
Eddie suddenly, sulkily strides for the door of the bar
All right, you guys go home, and 'll go on my merry way
(gets to the door, pauses, then turns, his sudden hot temper gone as quickly as it had come) Hey, you guys, you guys want to go to a nutty night club, look at the nuts
There's a nutty night club over on Second Avenue
You know what we can do
Charlie, you live in Stuyvesant Town, don't you
Yeah
You know what we can do
We'll take the crosstown
We'll go over to Charlie's house, he'll get some money, and we'll go to this nutty night club
It's right down on Second Avenue
You got any money home, Charlie
What do you say, Arnold
You want to go
Arnold shrugs
Eddie has started for the door already
Charlie wearily gets off his stool, starts to follow Eddie out
Walter takes his arm
Charlie, get Walter
Come on, Walter
of Walter 'm going to die, you know what mean
The sad little party files wearily out of the bar, Arnold pausing at the bar to pay for the drinks
: looking down through the length of one almost empty car, through the open door at the end of the car, down into the next almost empty car
Just a few people riding the subway at this hour, half past eleven on a week-day
But down in the second car, we can see our four cavaliers
Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie are sitting
Our attention is most caught by Walter, who is heavily drunk and weaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car
We cannot hear if he is saying anything
Walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car
He stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker, sitting in the car
(mumbling) Excuse me
excuse me
(turns his blurred attention to Charlie, who, alone of the three, seems painfully interested in what Walter is talking about) So what'll  do
mean, he says, 'm going to die
mean, the man's a specialist
He says: "Go to Arizona, go to Colorado," he says
"You got to get out of New York or you're going to die
" He tells my wife, the stupid idiot
My wife cried all night
'm going to die, you know that
You understand that
'm going to die
You know what an asthma attack is like
Your heart starts beating like a drum
passed out the last time
(deeply compassionate) Walter, why don't you just quit the job and pack your bags and get out of here
Walter stands in front of Charlie, his lips moving, but no words coming out for a moment
There are tears in his eyes, and all the pain and anguish of the man's forty-eight years are clear on his face
(getting the words out) can't quit
Don't you understand
You don't understand
can't quit
got a fourteen-year-old girl, don't know what time she comes in at night any more
She's so wild, these kids
got a nineteen-year-old boy in college; he's going to be a doctor if  have to die
He's not going to quit school
You hear me
worked hard to put that kid in school
don't care if  die don't care
What am  going to do in Arizona
Who wants me
Who's going to give me a job
What kind of a job am  going to get
'm forty-eight years old
They don't want no forty-eight-year-old bookkeeper
They got machines from You ever been up on the ninth floor
You ever see all those machines
What am  going to do out in Arizona
You look in the Help Wanted lately
You see any jobs listed for Bookkeeper, Male
What are you talking about
Do you know what you're talking about
Charlie reaches up to steady Walter, who has worked himself up into a lurching fury
Easy, Walter
(flinging Charlie's hand aside) Take your hand off me
You don't know nothing
You're just a kid
You don't know
've seen death, kid
've seen it, boy
know what it looks like
(he staggers away a few paces down the aisle, stumbles over the man's toe again) Excuse me
Forty-eight years old and so what
What does it mean
What happened
What have  got
What did make
Who needs me
So this is it
man's life, nothing
Worry about being sick, worry about making money, worry about your wife, worry about your kids, and you're on your way to the grave from the day you're born
The days drag on, and the years fly by, and so what
(cries out to the whole world) What is it all about
Will you tell me
The train is slowing up for a station now
Life is nothing
It's a gag
It's a joke
It's a mortgage
It's a bankrupt
It's a lot of noise over nothing
Sound and fury
Isn't that what the man said
What do you think,  never read a book
read a book
Don't worry
was a bright kid
Everybody thought  was going to be the first Catholic to be President
Where did it all go
He turns to look at the station they are edging into, the yellow lights, the dark shadows, the few blurred faces
His face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears
(mumbling) Where did it all go
The train stops, the green doors slide open
(looking out, in a low voice) Where are we, Third Avenue
(low voice) Where are we getting off
Next stop
(low voice) Yeah
few people come into the car
Walter stands, shoulders hunched and sagging, in front of the open doors
(muttering) 'm going home
(looking up) What did you say, Walter
'm going home
Walter steps out onto the platform
Just in time, because the doors are beginning to slide closed again
(standing) Walter, where are you going
Come here
On the platform, Walter has started to weave slowly up the platform toward the stairway
(standing) What, did Walter get out
(calling through the open window) Walter, stay there, we'll come back on the next train
Stay there
But Walter has already reached the stairway and, clinging to the handrail, has started slowly climbing the steps
The train starts slowly up
Arnold has stood now too
He is pretty soggy himself
Poor Walter, huh
(bellowing through the window) Walter
(standing) He'll be all right, Charlie
God protects drunks and fools
The train is sweeping by the stairway now
Charlie bellows out: Walter
Grab a cab if you're going home
The train has swept by, and in a moment they have been plunged into the tunnel of the subway, the bleak dirty white walls, and the small yellow lights flashing by
Charlie sits down, somehow greatly shaken and disturbed
(sits) Poor Walter,  didn't know he was so sick
thought there was something wrong with him, though
He's been out so much
(sitting drunkenly down) didn't know he was so sick
on Charlie
That's me in fifteen years
of Charlie
Hold for a moment
: We look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of three comes up the stairs to the sidewalk
It is midnight, and the street is occasionally patrolled by a taxicab
The sidewalks are pretty empty, just a few people walking
Perhaps a drugstore is still open, and its lonely lit store front catches the eye
Our three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway kiosk, drained, tired, a little despondent
Charlie looks up at the dim silhouettes of the endless apartment houses of Stuyvesant Town
That's where  live
Which one
In the back there
You can't see it from here
of Stuyvesant Town as seen from their point of view
, capturing the silent monotony of the dark buildings
Only a few of the windows are still lit
It looks like a state hospital
It looks like a prison
Yeah, it does look a little like a prison
The three men just stand, worn out, tired
(suddenly) 'm going home
He starts to walk to the buildings, across the little street that separates the corner of Fourteenth Street and First Avenue from the parallel corner of the housing project
(calling after him) Hey, Charlie
Charlie turns
Hey, Charlie
What about the money
Have you got ten bucks
(after a moment) All right, if you want to walk me to the house, 'll get you ten bucks
Eddie has to take a moment to consider this
Then he shuffles across the little street toward Charlie
Charlie doesn't quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and leads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward the promenade that leads to the heart of the project
Arnold, after a moment, follows Eddie
The three men disappear single-file into the darkness of Stuyvesant Town
: ' We are looking at the twin elevator doors
The light of an elevator climbs into the little square window of one of the elevator doors
The door opens, and Charlie, Eddie, and Arnold shuffle out into the landing
They are all a little soggy
(mutters) 'll be right out
He moves around the turn of the wall, fishes in his pocket for the key to his apartment
He finds it, brings it out, opens the door carefully, goes into his apartment
' Charlie comes in
The dining area is lit, and there is the lamp lit in the living room
As Charlie moves to the living room, we can see that Helen is seated on the couch, watching television
The gray-white light of the television set drifts out into the room
Helen is in her pajamas and she has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up
She is half-watching television; the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of manicure
She looks up as Charlie comes into the living room, smiles
Hiya, have a nice time
Charlie shrugs
He is depressed and can't conceal it
'm taking ten bucks
couple of the guys are waiting outside promised them 'd loan them ten bucks
Sure
He stands by the couch now, without interest, automatically watching the television set
(looking at the set) Tomorrow's payday
'll get it back tomorrow
It's in the drawer
kind of ennui has engulfed him
He stands, watching the television set out of which is now pouring the end of an animated cartoon commercial
Then the familiar tinkling music sets in, the inscription, "The Late Show" appears on the screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are now going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in "Strictly Dishonorable
" The whole thing brings a wince of pain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom
Enough light flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a ten-dollar bill
He returns the other bills, closes the drawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of drawers
Back in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood her husband is in
She continues with her nails for a moment
Then, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and goes to the bedroom doorway and looks in
Charlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression
He is holding the ten-dollar bill
His eyes are open, but there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face
Helen moves quietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him
What's the matter, Charlie
He shrugs, even smiles briefly
don't know
She puts out her hand as if to take his head and press it against her, but he takes her in his arms almost desperately, and they lie back on the bed, clutching each other, their faces pressed against each other, seeking some kind of strength just from the sheer physical closeness of each other
It's not so bad, Charlie
know
know
They lie quietly, even stiffly, holding each other
(eyes wide open but unseeing) don't know what's the matter with me,  keep getting so depressed
'm going to quit night school, Helen
My nerves are shot
He releases himself from his wife's embrace and sits up
Those guys are waiting outside better give them their money
He stands and starts out the bedroom
Charlie
Maybe  shouldn't have the baby
What do you mean
She doesn't answer
She doesn't have to
They both know what she means
Isn't that dangerous
Well, don't know
maybe
Well, you brought it up
(shocked -- after a moment) You really don't want this baby
She turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears
You're my husband, Charlie
This is your baby too
That doesn't mean anything to you
For the first time in our marriage  feel  can't depend on you, Charlie -- 'm not important to you
(she has to stop because she can no longer trust her voice
After a moment she continues) could make my life sound hard, too, Charlie
work all day,  rush home, make you dinner
sit home alone four nights a week, 'm even alone when you're here because when do see you
But it was easy for me because  loved you
Do you think care whether you're an accountant or a ditch digger, or even out of work
All  ever wanted was you
And this baby because it's you, too
She closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in her eyes and stops talking rather than cry
Charlie sits, unmoved and wretched, his shoulders hunched, his head slumped forward
After a moment, he turns and reaches forward, quite frightened, to touch her arm
(dully) Leave me alone, Charlie
He stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out
Helen turns on her side so that her back is to him
At the sound of her moving, Charlie turns his head, but sensing the rejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the window again
The silence is thick between them
(looking out the window) decided 'd quit school and
don't care
decided 'd quit school and come home in the evenings like everybody else and live a normal life
(staring at the wall ahead of her) don't care what you do, Charlie
He stands another moment
don't care what  do either
Helen neither moves nor makes a response
Charlie goes on into the living room and shuffles to the front door, his long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown terrors
He opens the door and goes out onto the landing
Eddie and Arnold, looking up as the door opens and Charlie comes out
What took you so long
What did you do, blow open the safe
(giving Eddie the ten-dollar bill) Here
(taking it) 'll give it to you tomorrow
'll see you in the morning, Charlie
'll see you
Eddie takes Arnold's arm and guides him back around the turn of the wall to the elevators
Charlie follows a few paces behind
Eddie pushes both elevator buttons
Charlie nods, looks down at the tiling at his feet, fairly sick within himself, oppressed and guilty
The light in the elevator window shows, and Eddie opens the door
Wait a minute
'll go with you
Let's go to that party -- we'll have a ball
Charlie shuffles the few paces forward and follows Eddie and Arnold into the elevator
The door closes, and, a moment later, the light of the elevator cage disappears downward
: This is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street which consists of one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the books on the upper shelves of the built-in bookcases
There is a little wrought-iron stairway that leads to the second floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms
Apartments like these, as is the case in this one, are usually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in an advertising agency and the other a model for a garment manufacturing firm
Both girls are in their early thirties and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the living room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing at the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase
They rather think of themselves as Madame de Staels with their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men and women at the party are in some way connected with the arts, probably in an avant garde way
It is a little difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like businessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get the point fast enough
We pick up phrases like: " really find it difficult to think of Tennessee Williams as a serious artist," or "My teacher thinks all tenors are frogs except Gigli," or " don't see how you can say that; his designs fairly throb with sex
" There are, as Eddie predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly girls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the wrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar
There is someone at the piano banging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely inaudible five feet away
few people lean over the piano, apparently exhilarated by the songs
Thin blankets of smoke wreathe their way up to the two-story-high ceiling
We catch some more phrases: " thought Truman Capote was supposed to be here
" -- "Truman's in Russia,  think
" -- "Good heavens, what can the Russians want with Truman Capote
" -- "Oh,  never read anything published in this country
" "Oh, mean, the paper-bound Paris edition
" In short, this is a real chi-chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table is made out of an orange crate
Somewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the doorbell chime
young woman, at one of the little knots of people, perks her ears and says: 'm sure that's the police again
She's very proud of this
She turns and weaves her way through the crowded room, carrying her drink
She goes up the step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her way over two middle-aged men who are both throwing a pitch at a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late thirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men who have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of the apartment
She opens the door
of Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie from the Hostess's point of view
Not exactly a heartening sight to most hostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling
(beaming) Are you coming to complain about the noise
Do we look like complainers
don't know who you are, but come in, come in
don't know half the people who are here tonight
They enter a little warily and ill-at-ease, peering into the jammed room
The police have been here twice
The first fellow was just adorable
We gave him a drink, and he's upstairs in a bedroom now, for all  know
Is that right
If you want something to drink, you'll just have to go into the kitchen and get it yourself
The place is just mad
Do you write, paint or sing
Eddie spreads his arms in all-inclusive expansiveness
Everything
But the hostess has already bent to chat with two women, one old, one young, sitting on the floor
Our three cavaliers look at each other and then look out over the wild, jumbled room
Boy, do you get invited to a party like this or do you get committed
passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into the group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile: heard that
It's awfully funny
Charlie regards the smiling young chap
Beat it
The chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away
Eddie rubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room with a measuring eye
This is going to be like shooting ducks
Pick out your duck, men
Wetting his lips, he starts out for some girl he has decided on across the room
-- showing progress of party, still crowded, still high
If we look sharp we can see Charlie seated on the floor in the rear of the shot, his back against the wall
of Charlie sitting morosely, back against the wall, regarding his drink with sodden eyes
The chatter of the party, an occasional shrill laugh
of Eddie coming out of the kitchen, carrying two drinks
He picks his way through the people to the living room with the general intention of getting to the arrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots Charlie and moves across to him
Hey, what's the matter, Charlie
(squats down beside Charlie) (without looking up) Let's get out of here, Eddie
The last time  saw you, you was with that girl you picked up
What happened
She's over there talking to that old guy with the glasses
Their point of view, The Existentialist on steps with landlord
didn't like her
She's one of these real Greenwich Village phonies
If  added up all the guys she told me about, she must have had her first boy friend when she was two years old
Where are you going, Eddie
Stick around a minute
(who has stood) 'm with that one over there -- not bad, huh
think she's a Communist
think she's trying to talk me into joining the Party
How are you making out
Not so hot
may have to join
Hang around
Let's talk a bit
better get back
She's liable to recruit somebody else
Where's Arnold
He's in the kitchen
think he's out cold
'll see you
Charlie nods as Eddie moves off
He returns his morose attention back to his glass of liquor
Then his eyes close, and his face, though impassive, shows pain
After a moment, he opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes his way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the direction of the kitchen
In the background we can hear the piano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics
Charlie gets to the kitchen door and looks in
Arnold is at the tiny kitchen table, head on the table, out cold
The kitchen is in a state of havoc
Hey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold
Arnold makes no answer
Charlie regards his prostrated friend expressionlessly for a moment
Then turns and shuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the living room
He looks over to the stairway again
The Existentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for the moment
She is looking at Charlie, and he drops his eyes
He turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into the middle of the living room
He moves to the stairway
The Existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, Charlie kind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he just stands
Then
That old man  was talking to before
That's my landlord
About ten thirty last night, someone began pounding on my door
So  got up and opened the door, and there was this white-haired man with  a pince-nez standing there
said: "What do you want
" So he said: "'m the landlord, and  want the rent
" Well,  just looked at him because the landlord  knew was a Hungarian man named Frank, who was crazy about me, and the issue of rent never came up, you see
Well, it turned out that this man with the pince-nez had just bought the building the day before and he kept grabbing my arm and saying he wanted the rent
Well, then  got the point, of course
Well, meanwhile, a boy named Bob  knew had come over
He's engaged to a Javanese girl with wonderful planes in her face who lives at the International House
But he's crazy about me and he drops in about twice a week
Well, meanwhile, my new landlord was grabbing my arm and kept quoting poetry to me which he was trying to pass off as his own
He was an absolute fraud
He scotched the whole thing from Baudelaire
"Tu mettrais
" You know that one
Well, he kept screaming about the rent -- didn't like him, you know -- and called this boy named George who used to live in Poughkeepsie when was going to Vassar, and he's crazy about me
He lives in St
Luke's place now, but he goes to Poughkeepsie every Wednesday to see his mother, he's got an Oedipus, so that was out
Well, my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me
said: "How existentialist can you get
You just met me five minutes ago
" He was absolutely crazy about me
Charlie has been sort of half-listening to all this
His attention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the girl's bare arms, the lines of her body
(resigned) You have an apartment around here somewheres
(looks up to second floor) What's up there
What kind of rooms are up there
So,  finally got to sleep around six thirty
Charlie bends down to her, takes her arm
Come on, let's go
(wrenching her arm away) No
Oh, stop trying to be so primitive
Charlie straightens with an irritated sigh
find you very unpleasant
He stands, she sits in sullen silence
There's nothing upstairs
(suddenly rises, mumbles) Oh,  don't care
She starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her
They pick their way past the other people sitting on the stairs to the second-floor landing
They walk in hostile silence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she opens
It is a tiny bedroom
The bed is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things
An uncovered, improvised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and things, gives the room an overburdened look
Charlie comes into the room after her, closes the door, looks for the latch
She pushes some of the things on the bed aside and sits down and waits while Charlie latches the door, a matter of turning a bent nail into locking position
She begins to prattle again
So  finally got to sleep around six thirty this morning
At nine thirty, someone began pounding on my door again
got out of bed and opened the door, and there was my landlord with the pince-nez wearing a blue silk kimono
"Oh, for heaven's sakes,"  said, "what do you want now
" He said: "'m the landlord, and  want the rent
"  said: "You're an old man, go to sleep
" Then the phone rang
It was a boy named Andrew  know who teaches physics at Columbia University, and he's insanely jealous
He's married and has four children, but he keeps badgering me to run away with him to Nicaragua, throw up his professorship and all that
Well, my landlord began shouting some garbled Baudelaire at the top of his lungs, and a little Verlaine, and a little Huysmans
He apparently has some kind of fetish about French decadents
And naturally, Andrew heard him, and he got furious, and he said: "Who's that hear
"  said, "That's the landlord
" He said: "What does he want
"  said: "He wants the rent
" Well, at this point,  felt like chucking the whole business and going back to Bessemer City and going to work in my father's hardware store
Charlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story
Then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The Existentialist on the bed
He brings an end to the rococo narration by putting his arms around The Existentialist and in a moment, she responds hungrily
of Charlie and The Existentialist in a desperate embrace
(muttering) Just say you love me
What
Just say you love me
You don't have to mean it
He tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the moment, but she turns her face away from him
The dialogue is intense, whispered, hungry
No, don't
What's the matter
Say you love me
Come on
Say you love me
Come on
No
love you
love you
(content) Look, maybe we ought to go someplace else
'm having a very tricky thing going with my landlord and  don't want him to see us leaving together
So you know what you do
There's a bar down the street
You go out the door and turn to your right
You know the one  mean
Yes,  know
Well, you go there and 'll be there as fast as  can
Now, wait for me now, because  can't stand being alone at night
You'll like me
'm supposed to be very amusing
All right
She turns abruptly and goes out the door
He stands for a moment and then follows
He stands on the upper landing, watching her pick her way down the stairs into the living room
She looks quickly around the room, apparently finds whom she is looking for, and moves quickly to a little group of men, one of whom is about sixty years old with a thin elegance and a cruel face, the landlord
He has several young men around him, all rather frail, Ivy-Leagueish
She joins the group, to the distaste of the young men, and is immediately voluble and gesticulatory
After a moment, Charlie lets his eyes wander over the room, apparently sees Eddie
(calling down) Hey, Eddie
Apparently, Eddie doesn't hear him
Charlie frowns and begins making his own way down the stairs to the living room
-- Charlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper
He makes his way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back of the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking quickly, smiling, gesturing
(muttering) Eddie, 'm cutting out
(standing, low voice) Wait a minute, 'll go with you
don't want to take you away from your girl, Eddie
Aah, this one lives out in Long Island with her mother
What kind of Communist is that
It'll take me a half hour on the subway there and a half hour back
(shrugs) Where's Arnold
Still in the kitchen
guess so
(to the girl) 'll see you, next time  get to Long Island
He starts off after Charlie who is already wandering through the living room in the general direction of the kitchen, looking about for Arnold
They pass The Existentialist en route
She is saying: "
this boy named Charlie,  never saw him before in my life, has been clutching at me all evening
He's absolutely insane about me
" Charlie leans into the kitchen where Arnold is awake now, seated at the small kitchen table, staring gauntly, unseeingly at his fingers on the white porcelain-topped table
There are two men, one middle-aged, one young, having a whispered chat over the sink
(over Charlie's shoulder) Hey, Arnold, come on
Arnold stands obediently, almost dumbly
He squeezes around the table, his face soddenly expressionless, to join Eddie and Charlie in the kitchen doorway
Eddie is saying to Charlie: Well, it wasn't a bad party
We killed a couple of hours anyway
The three men push their way past three women in their thirties, who are standing in the little hallway before the front door, in earnest brow-furrowed conversation with each other
Charlie opens the door, and the three morose carousers go out into the dark street
: -- The three carousers come out into the street
The door closes behind them
The night air is hot and muggy
They walk down the street toward the corner where only the light of the corner bar gives any indication of life
There is a newspaper on the sidewalk which Eddie bends down to pick up, and the three men straggle to a halt
Eddie opens the paper to the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the street lamp
Arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans against it
Charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk, a melancholy, pondering young man
The evening seems to have come to a dead halt
After a moment, Eddie starts walking again, reading the paper as he does
The others slowly gather themselves and follow him
: wall clock reading twenty-five minutes to three the wall
We are in the bar on the corner of Tenth and Sixth, almost entirely empty except for Charlie, Eddie, Arnold, and the bartender
The three carousers are leaning wearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person in the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a woman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar stool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a newspaper
and  on Charlie, Eddie, and Arnold
mean, you can't compare the two
This kid the Yankees have in centerfield
Are you trying to tell me he's a natural
368 hitter
What's he normally hit,
310,
315
Musial led the National League in hitting six times
He's only having a fair year, this year -- and he's still hitting
320
Musial is an all-time great
Yeah
guess so
(stiff with liquor) Eddie -- Eddie
So what do you think, Eddie
You think  ought to go through with this marriage
don't know about you, Arnold, but if it was me, boy, 'd be in China by now
(back to Charlie) Who have the Yankees got on first
Skowron
Boy, how they touted Skowron
All right, he's having a lucky year
Yeah
(continuing) Well,  mean, is there any argument
Hodges is the best first baseman in both leagues
So, Eddie, what do you think
You think  ought to marry her, go to China, or what
Arnold, if it bothers you so much, call her up and tell her to forget the whole deal
(back to Charlie) All right Hodges is having a bad year -- but how about last year
He hit over
300
He only hit thirty- five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs---- So, Eddie
Arnold
Get rid of her
You're driving me crazy
Arnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps
(continuing) All right, who's on second
We got Charlie Neal or Gilliam, for that matter, and this isn't even counting Jackie Robinson, head and shoulders, even with a trick knee, the best second baseman in both leagues if they'd let him play there
We got three guys, for Pete's sake, who can outplay anybody the Yankees put on second
Arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter
Then walks out of shot
(continuing) Ever see Charlie Neal go to his right
That Yankee guy, what's his name -- he can't go to his right
And don't forget Neal gets a lot of bases on balls, and once he's on the bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher
The bartender decides to take issue
What's Brooklyn going to do for pitching
Never heard of Newcombe
Never heard of Erskine
What have you got to compare with Ford, Kucks, McDermott, Turley--- McDermott -- McDermott hasn't pitched a full game since last year
The best relief pitcher in both leagues
What's the matter with Eddie Roebuck
How do you compare Eddie Roebuck with McDermott
What are you, a Yankee fan
Yeah
Well, drop dead
(turns angrily back to Charlie) Yankee fan
There is a sudden bellow off
' Hey
Eddie and Charlie slowly turn to look in Arnold's direction
to see Arnold from their point of view, a wavering, drunken young man standing in front of the phone booths
did it
You did what
Arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar
just woke her up
called her said: "'m not going to marry you
What do  want to marry you for
'm having a ball
What am  going to marry you for
" What is he talking about
Then, suddenly, effortlessly, Arnold sinks down onto the floor -- out cold
For a moment, Eddie and Charlie regard the prostrate form
Boy, he's gone
Eddie and Charlie move to Arnold, lying curled stiffly on the floor
think he's just called his girl, broke his engagement
Is that what he was yelling about
(trying to raise Arnold's head) Wake up, kid
Help me get him up, Eddie
You think he did it because  was needling him there before
was just needling him
The two men contrive to lift Arnold and get him onto a stool
You better get him out of here because 'm closing up now
We better get him home
Ah, let's not break it up yet thought you were waiting for this girl
It's three o'clock in the morning, for Pete's sake
Take him out in the air
He'll be all right
What a bachelor party
We start out celebrating the guy's wedding; we wind up breaking his engagement
(moves to bar) What do we owe you here
(he puts some change on the counter) Eddie, pay it, will you
gave you the ten bucks
(following him to the bar) What do you want to go home for
It's going to take us an hour to get him home
He lives in Queens somewheres
By the time  get back to Fourteenth Street, it'll be daybreak
What are you going to do, stay up all night
Don't you want to go home sometimes
What am  going to do home
read all the papers
(crosses to Arnold) Well, go to sleep then
Ah, don't go home, Charlie
feel like doing something
Charlie turns to him, a cold fury in him
What
Stand around this bar and argue about the Yankees and the Dodgers
Wind up with some miserable, lonely girl who begs you to say, " love you"
Go home, Eddie
Go to bed
You got to go home sometimes
'll take Arnold home
Come on, Arnold, kid
'm going to take you home
Arnold manages, with Charlie's arm, to get out of the booth and stand
Charlie's firm arm holds him, and they start for the exit
Eddie watches the two figures making their way down the length of the bar to the door
They exit
The door shuts behind them
For a moment, Eddie regards the closed door
Then he shuffles to the bar, back to his schooner of beer and looks at it without taking it up
He is profoundly weary
His shoulders slump, his face sags
He runs his hand down his face and shakes his head as if to clear it
He turns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the Bar Hag sits engrossed in her newspaper
He watches her for a moment
(spiritlessly) Hey, honey, what are you, a Yankee fan or a Dodger fan
The Bar Hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her glasses
Hiya
Bleakly, Eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the bar to where the battered old woman sits
: -- looking down on the sidewalk immediately outside the bar Arnold and Charlie have just come out of
There is a house with a small stoop, and Arnold is standing slumped by the stoop, holding himself up by the iron railing
He is being sick, quietly retching
Charlie is standing a few paces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply unhappy figure in his own right
From our angle, we may or may not be able to tell that Charlie is crying
of Charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk of Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street, the whole dark world around him, silent and empty
He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his shoulders shaking ever so little
Behind him, Arnold is bent over the railing of the stoop, weak and spent
of the two men
Charlie stops crying, sighs, and starts toward Arnold
(gently) Are you all right, Arnold
Arnold nods weakly
Charlie gets out a handkerchief and gives it to Arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and spots on his suit
Would you like to go back in and sit down
Arnold shakes his head weakly "no
" What subway do you take, Arnold, the
Can you make it
Arnold nods weakly
Charlie puts his arm supportively around his friend's back, but Arnold makes no move yet, being thoroughly drained
Come on, Arnold, 'll take you home
There is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement, and Charlie looks up
The Existentialist has just come out of the party several houses down and has come up a few steps and is standing watching them
She has her bag and her light summer stole
She nods to Charlie, sort of smiles, moves a few steps closer to them
Is he all right
(nods) Yeah, he's all right
Look, 've got to take my friend home
The two men start slowly down the street to the corner
Arnold leaning heavily on his friend
The Existentialist stands, watching them a moment
(calling lightly) Are you coming back
Where does he live
How long will you be
Charlie and Arnold just about getting to the corner
Charlie hasn't heard her
of The Existentialist watching them disappear around the corner
Then she turns, and, wetting her lips, she hurries back to the house where the party is
-- Half past three, and the car is absolutely empty except for Charlie and Arnold
Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, one leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor
He is sleeping heavily
Charlie sits expressionlessly, obviously involved in deep introspection
The car buckets along into the night
: Arnold and Charlie coming up to a landing
It is the third floor; we can see enough of the corridor to see two apartment doors, lettered "3D" and "3C
"  small overhead bulb provides a thin sketchy light
Charlie and Arnold shuffle down the landing to apartment 3D
They pause outside the door
The scene is played in low mutters and whispers
Well, thanks a lot, Charlie
You all right
Yeah, 'm all right
'm a little groggy, but 'm awake anyway
You don't want to come in, do you
No,  don't think so
think my father and mother are up
hear voices
My girl must have called them because they wouldn't be up at this hour
Well, you just go in and explain to them that you were drunk, and you're sorry, and you'll call your girl the first thing in the morning because she must really be upset about this
(who has been listening at his door) think she's here
Who
My girl
think  hear her voice in there
Well, be nice to her, Arnold
Remember, you woke her up in the middle of the night and probably scared her to death
What'll  say to her, Charlie
don't know, Arnold
What do you feel like saying to her
Do you really love this girl
Do you want to marry her
Are you marrying this girl because your family wants you to marry her, or why
think  like her, Charlie
It's just that 'm afraid  won't make a good husband
Well, tell her what you told me, Arnold
Tell her you're scared, and that you don't think you'll make a good husband
If she's a halfway decent girl, she'll try to understand how you feel, and, if she loves you, she's going to make it her job to make you happy
That's what love is, Arnold, when you have somebody else in the world you want to be happy
My wife, Arnold,  don't know what 'd do without her
Arnold, 've got a tough grind ahead of me
Work all day, 'll go to night school at night
But my wife knows that  need this to be happy, and she does everything she knows to help me
And we've got a baby coming
But if you love that baby and you love your wife, then it's easy
Everything seems so easy to me now --  don't know why  even thought of quitting
(tears have welled in his eyes, and he hurriedly puts his hand to his face shading his reddening eyes) Arnold,  want my wife so much right now
want her to be happy
want to just go home and hold her and tell her how much she means to me
mean, even Walter, he's going to die, but don't you think he'll be in tomorrow morning, same old Walter, jokes and laughs
He's got somebody to live for
He's even got somebody to die for
mean, how rich can a man be
And poor Eddie --  used to be so jealous of him
used to think he was so free
Free from what
From loving a woman, from really wanting a woman
Arnold, what 'm trying to tell you is life is nothing if you don't love somebody but life is wonderful if you do love somebody
Arnold,  want my wife so much right now
Arnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of emotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word Charlie was talking about
'm going to tell her about that woman tonight and everything
'll tell her about that woman
Arnold,  want to get home so much to my wife right now 'm going to bust
'll see you, Charlie
Good-bye, Arnold, have a nice honeymoon
'll see you when you get back
'll see you, Charlie
But he is talking to an empty staircase
Charlie has plunged down into the darkness of the floor below
Arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment
He rings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath
moment, and the door opens
girl of about thirty-five, bespectacled, rather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway
Arnold stands, his head down in shame
Hello, Louise
'm very sorry, honest
Sure, Arnold,  know
She looks anxiously over Arnold's shoulder to see if anyone else is there
Arnold lumbers past her into the apartment
Voices, both male and female, pop out at him
"What's the matter with you, are you crazy
" "What's the matter with you
" "For heaven's sakes, where have you been
"
The door closes
: looking down the wide courtyard of Stuyvesant Town, its endless little pathways winding from the various apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to a stairway to the street
It is half past five in the morning
The sky is gray and desolate
The courtyard and any other street we see is absolutely empty
this empty expanse to the stairway where Charlie appears now, coming quickly up the steps
He moves down the central sidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running
with him as he hurries to one of the winding side lanes leading to a particular apartment house
: ' looking from the foyer of the apartment across the dining area to the front door
The apartment is dark
The door opens and Charlie comes in
He closes the door quietly after himself and moves a few steps into the apartment
He stops when he sees Helen seated on the couch, wearing a kimono over her pajamas
She stands; she has been crying
love you, Helen
She moves slowly to him and puts her head on his chest and cries quietly
He holds her tightly
(crying softly) love you so much, Charlie
love you so much
love you
love you, Charlie,  love you, Charlie
love you, Charlie
from the young couple, holding each other closely and tightly, murmuring to each other in the dark living room of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in a housing project
