Young lawyer   darts through the crowd, carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football
Jamey elbows his way through a
Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time : , making a racket
Jamey rushes toward a door marked "
" from inside Judge Tate's chambers: () This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public
() My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor
Jamey shoves open the door,    ( )     : (in conservative gray) and   (in pinstripes)
One at a time
Mr
Miller
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp
began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust
My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily
Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage
Your Honor,  submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business
And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions
Each time it has been examined and the results
Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers
Jamey stuffs a document into Andrew's hand
(
) Limestone
Messy, but innocuous
Andrew submits the report to the Judge
Innocuous
Defined by Webster's as harmless
know what it means
Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel
The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs
And Counselor calls it harmless
His back turned momentarily to the , Andrew mouths to Jamey: "Not bad
" But he whips around, serious again: Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption
But nothing could be further from the truth
Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers
Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society
Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers
Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen
thought we were talking about some dust

As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro- cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing plaintiff seeks to re-

Great

Andy
This is a nice surprise
How are you, hon

What's Dr
Gillman say
Hold on, Mom
(punching into the conference call) There's no way my client will go along with that
Who's this
Andrew Beckett
Hi, Karen

He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut )
(
) Gillman says 'm fine
My blood work is excellent

Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from the computer
opens a reference book
grabs a carton of Chinese food

He and Kenton wear tuxedos
Are we interrupting, Andy
In a word, Bob
Charles is right behind me
This image has a horror-film feeling to it
Andrew   to face them
was just about to take a break
Good evening, Charles
, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow
Andy
Could you step into my office for a sec
(deadpan) feel like firing someone tonight
Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder
We're gonna miss you around here, Bob
: (
/):  ' , waiting for clearance from a  , on Andrew's dim and quiet floor,
Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide, carpeted staircase
Wheeler finishes a story and everyone : (
/)
Andy's expressed a keen interest in the Kronos Inc
situation, Charles
Is that correct, Andy
The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline
The fate of the participants interests me, yes sir
Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the cigars in and out of their rounded mouths
Andrew, holding a cigar but  preparing to light it, watches with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye
Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter
He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure
It's good to be King, hey Charles
Kings are out of fashion
'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant
(prompting Andrew) It's an anti-trust action
It is, and it isn't, Charles
Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program
If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business
For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine
which side of this mess would you desire to be on, Andy
And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way
Andrew knows this is a test
And he loves it
Sorry, Charles, but
Andrew is distracted --
(
) 'd like to see Kronos win
Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its ' , : a faint purple blotch about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw on the   in Andrew's doctor's office
Why, Beckett
Because they deserve to, Walter
Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed back, revealing the blotch
He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover the blotch
(
) If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work
Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc
Bailey, Brackman
Get with the program, Andy
As of this evening, about 8:05 this evening, right after the soup course
Kronos Incorporated is represented by Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown
Or, more specifically, senior associate Andrew Beckett
moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist in a victory salute
Yes
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations

Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton
Thanks, Walter
What's that on your forehead, pal
Whacked with a racquetball
(taking Wheeler's hand) appreciate your faith in my abilities
Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence
It doesn't apply to this situation
(slapping his shoulder) Go home
mean, get back to work
Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment
(warmly, softly) Thanks, Charles
(with a father's affection) No sweat, buddy
Smiling, Andrew exits the office

(searching for something) Okay
Check this out
Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames, meant to help conceal the blotches
(
) Hides everything, right
What do you think
You know who you look like, Andy
That actor, in that movie
Not the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera
Dustin Hoffman
(horrified) Tootsie
Right
You want to try Light Egyptian
Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut
(
) What
(clearly in pain) Excuse me a sec
Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly
Just like my cousin Fredo
Chandra, Alan and Bruno slamming shut
Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door
You okay, Andy

He hustles up the ramp toward the Emergency Entrance

Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew
They exchange quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and goodbyes
Thanks, you guys
Yeah
Thanks, guys
Miguel puts his arms around Andrew
Gillman's out of her office today
told her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it
Did you get someone to cover your class
Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever
Don't worry about it
They took blood

Andrew holds an empty specimen cup
Aren't you giving an exam
said, don't worry about it
Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead
(
) You got a fever, baby
Suddenly, the facade cracks and   Andrew's eyes
almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel
almost lost control right in front of everybody
(holding him) So what
It's nothing to be ashamed of
You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay
Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in control of his emotions once more
Wait, here's my guy
Hey
Andrew catches the attention of a harried , whose surgeon's greens are covered with blood
Mr
Beckett, 'm sorry
About my blood work
We're waiting
Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes
meanwhile, 'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside
Sounds delightful
Why do you need to do this
Who are you

Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important

Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard

Jamey types the file name

Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor

Andrew closes his eyes
He can't believe this
You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now
Or they are fucking dead You tell them that comes from me

) Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and

Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall

Rachel comes into his office

Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his computer, bringing up each disc's directory
(
) No
He throws the disc to the floor
Shoves in another
Shoves in another, bending it in half

Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare
He switches off the overhead light
He slants the window blinds, filling the room with shadow Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful
'mon, Andy, you didn't lose anything

Felt like everyone was staring
' Hell, they are staring
What's that shit on your face
Makeup
' :    ,  "
" (
) The partners were waiting for me in the main conference room
: ,   ' as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Bob Seidman are waiting (
/)
Sit down, Andy
Wheeler's secretary, , takes notes
(
) Thanks for coming in
Of course
Bob Seidman  look directly at Andrew
Andy
Before we begin, 'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend
You're in trouble
(: Joe     , or whenever he speaks
) know that, Charles
More than your friend
Family
Big trouble
Charles,  must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap
(smiling) It was a scary few minutes around here
Wow
But thank God, the complaint was found
And no damage was done
This time
What about next time
There won't be a next time, guarantee it
Andy
It seems that something has come over you, lately: kind of
stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus
Earth to Andy
Anybody home
Helloooo
That's right, Andy
The last four, five months you've seemed really out of it
At least
different, somehow
(keeping it positive) Perhaps
you're right
've certainly been busy
With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett
Really
Who thinks that, sir
do
Wheeler seems very grave
had no idea there was a concern in that area
Hey: (a smile) 'll get to work on it right away
else smiles
We've been talking it over, Andy
Your future that is
We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you
Honesty is always best
Do you really think so, Andy
Yes, Bob,  do
(to the group) Excuse me
Am  being fired
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure
In a word, yes
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited
But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world
Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile
(
) And  hate to rush you out of here, but
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin
we've got a committee meeting
Excuse me, Charles
With all due respect
this is
preposterous
It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else
Pardon the lack of humility, but 've had the distinct impression was kind of
one of the rising stars around here
And feel that wasn't just my imagination
And  also think deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem
Take it easy, Walter
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit
hoped the challenge would improve your performance
You could say it was a carrot
carrot
buy that
As in, the vegetable
(suddenly emotional) Andy, you nearly blew the case, for God's sake
That alone is inexcusable
It would have been catastrophic for us
Put yourself in our shoes, Andy
There's no coming back from an error like that, regardless of who you are
(softer) 'm sorry, Andy
Andrew  -- the full nature of this situation hitting home
He looks each of the  in the eye
Uh huh
Okay
see
at last    Wheeler's secretary Lydia, whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone to say something
Wheeler breaks the silence
Good luck, Andy
Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out
Andrew doesn't move
enters the room
Who are you
'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings
: , '  '  ()
Okay
Explain to me like 'm a two year old, because there's an element to this  can't get through my thick head: Didn't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, infectious disease
Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to disguise the effects of chemo
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position
Okay, okay
They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons
They're frightened for themselves, their families
Maybe it's the homo angle
Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne
And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake
Joe, from the day  arrived to the day they fired me, performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence
And if they hadn't fired me, that's what 'd be doing today
Okay
They want you out
It's against the law to fire you for having , so they make you look like a fuck up
Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file
They sabotaged me
knew you were going to say that
don't buy it, and don't see a case
Look
know  have a case
If you don't want to take it for personal reasons
Correct
don't
Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like
Thanks for your time
Beckett
'm sorry about
what's happened to you
It's a fucking kick in the head
(a smile) Don't send flowers, Joe
'm not dead yet
Andrew exits
: ' , ()
(still uncomfortable, as Andrew's leaving) Have a nice day
Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler named , who
Joe approaches Iris's desk
Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon

The  wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm

What do you consider "contact
" We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet
What if you shake hands
Wait
know the answer
Only sex, or sharing needles
know that
We didn't shake hands, anyway
Dr
Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump, The  virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen
Right
Joe begins rolling down his sleeve
Leave that
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease
So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and  go home, and  hold my baby, and six months from now  hear on the news: "whoops
We were wrong
' You can carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now 've got to worry about my kid
What are you doing
Dr
Armbruster has been preparing a syringe
We're going to draw blood
Why are we going to do that
Joe
don't care a whit about your private life
You want to give me an test Joe  off the table
(
) The guy sat in my office
You can't get  that way, right
Right
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet
Even kissing someone with  is safe
But it there's something in your past you're worried about
Thanks, Doc, but  don't need an test
Are you crazy
But thanks for the information

No

Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve

Eddie Meyers from the office
Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners
His lover, Greg
Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets
For a moment, Joe is struck dumb
Then he says: Your Aunt Teresa is gay
That beautiful, sensuous woman is a
lesbian Duh
Since when
Probably since she was born
Allright
admit it: 'm prejudiced
don't want to work with a homosexual
You got me
Okay, Joe
mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing
don't get it
Don't they get confused
"Is that mine
thought it was yours
" Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative
think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is
Fine, Joe
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time can't stand that shit
Now 'm being totally honest with you
That's perfectly clear
,    : Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: " hope this guy doesn't touch me

Andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase
He takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose

Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight    in front of him

Rubs his eyes
Writes something
Sneezes
delivers a book to Andrew
This is the supplement
You're right, there is a section on

Thank you
Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains
We have a private research room available

Andrew
Now other  are watching
Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room
(pleasantly) No
But would it make you more comfortable
Whatever, sir
The  turns away, shrugging to a , indicating she's done all she can do
As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's  picks up his books and moves away
Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, who concentrates on his work
Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by
Suddenly he "notices" Andrew
Oh, Beckett
How's it goin'
Fine
Andrew goes back to his work
Who'd you get
What
Find a lawyer

Oh
Great
She's great

Andrew focuses on his work
Joe steps away
Joe comes back
How did they find out
(a second, then:) One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead
Nearby, a   looks up, startled, when she hears the word "lesion
" Uh huh
Andrew concentrates on his work once more
(
) How do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion, which could have been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had and basing a decision to terminate you on that conclusion
The   moves away
Good point
Andrew removes a legal pad with "" written in big letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath
(
) The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in
There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres
She's had lesions on and off for three years
She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by
They didn't fire her
No
They didn't fire her
Andrew goes back to his work
Joe stands there
So Kenton connected the
lesion, and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life
to this woman, Maria
and blew the whistle on you
Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go
But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star
Their behavior is
inconsistent
Thank you
Andrew goes back to work

How did they know
Did he tell them
Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance
None of this information got to the managing partners
We know that
Make sure everyone else does too

Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us

Andrew brought  into our offices, into our men's room
He brought  to our annual goddamn family picnic

For Christ's sake, where's your compassion

Did Andrew Beckett say " might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability " He said nothing
And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment

Beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty settlement

Attorney for the plaintiff
Joseph Miller, Your Honor

On behalf of the defendants

(to Joe) You're outnumbered four to one
(to the others) Whom do  address
can't talk to four lawyers at once
'm chief litigator, Your Honor
Fine
've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves
There is nothing  hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other
If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr
John
Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them
Where are the lawyers
Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers
If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list
And when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law
And when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages
If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter
By God you will settle it
If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days
Now, Joseph
What would you require to settle this matter today
Reinstatement at full salary
Back pay covering the period of unemployment and
Hold it, Joe
(to Wheeler) He wants to come back to work, Chuck
That's impossible, Your Honor
That's impossible, Joe
If it please Your Honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars
Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago
Give me a break, Joe
Let's cut through these false attitudes
Give them a figure
How much do you want
want to go back to work, Your Honor
You're here at my indulgence, young man
'm waiting for a figure, Joe
Andrew and Joe confer with each other
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars
Very good, Joe
Now, Belinda, 've got a figure over here, of one million, five
Andrew  to Joe, who interrupts the Judge: One more thing, Your Honor
(jumping in) Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work
Charles Wheeler  to Belinda Conine
Your Honor, Mr
Beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit
was the one who was sabotaged
We have complaints about Mr
Beckett's lack of preparation, his disorganization, his arrogant, defensive attitude
The list goes on
We have letters
Why haven't you produced these letters
Take it easy
(to Wheeler) What's the big deal, Chuck
The boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone
Why are you being hard- assed about this
wish  could exonerate you, Andy
But 'd have to lie to do it
(very calm) You can save it for the jury, Charles
want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, 'm a bad lawyer

Don't do this, Andy
Whoa, whoa
(to Andrew) What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz

Do you know what 'm saying

Andrew saunters out
You'll be sorry, Beckett
Andy, you don't want this

You will hear two explanations for why he was fired
Ours
And theirs
Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of
, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've ever seen him, some blisters on his lips
But the most disturbing thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a much older man
He's taking notes (which he will do relentlessly throughout the trial
) And he has a cane at his side, which he'll use throughout the trial
(
) It's up to you, to sift through layer and layer of truth, and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most true
Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Bob Seidman, Kenneth Killcoyne sit  their lawyers, Belinda Conine and Jerome Green, and at the defense table
presides from his bench
Among the spectators, Miguel sits next to Sarah, and Andrew's sister Jill
in the background
(
) There are certain points in our version, that  must prove to you
Point number one: Andrew Beckett was
is a brilliant lawyer
great lawyer
Point number two
Andrew Beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made the legal, understandable, personal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself
Point number three: His employers discovered his illness
And ladies and gentlemen, the illness 'm referring to, is Joe pauses, letting that sink in
(
) Point number four
They panicked
And, in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with Get it, and the people who have it, as far away from us as possible
Joe walks away from Andrew
(
) The behavior of Andrew Beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you
It does to me
After all, is a deadly, incurable, disease
(
) But however you come to judge the behavior of Charles Wheeler and his partners in moral, ethical, human terms
When they fired Andrew Beckett because he had , they broke the law With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with considerable power and emotion: (
) And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages

Fact
Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level
Fact
He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit
Fact
He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit
Fact
Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them
Fact
He was successful in his duplicity
The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had  when they fired him
Belinda pauses in front of the plaintiff's table (
) Fact
is a tragedy
Andrew looks directly at Belinda
(
) Fact
Andrew Beckett is dying
Joe watches Andrew for his reaction
(
) Fact
Andrew Beckett is angry
Because his "lifestyle," his reckless behavior, has cut short his life
And in his anger, his rage, he's lashing out
And he wants someone to pay : : large insurance company,

Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct
Wyant Wheeler represented us
Andrew glances toward the jury box: the   writes in a tiny notebook
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit
That's correct
Were you pleased with his work
We were satisfied
Joe and Andrew exchange a  -- Laird's response surprises and disappoints them
Were you satisfied, or were you pleased
Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering
We were satisfied
Joe refers to legal documents
Mr
Laird, when  approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition
Is that correct
That's correct
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work
Do you remember saying that
may have said something like that
But that's not how  feel at this moment
Joe takes on a street-tough tone: Okay, Mr
Laird
Explain this to me like 'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not
We won
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you
It satisfied me
Joe  at the guy
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied
cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming
Do you agree
might
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger
Your standards have shifted a great deal, and 'd like to know why you've changed your mind
Since that time 've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how  feel now

Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit
That's right
Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial
Often, he does
As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders
That's a fair assessment of the situation
Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets his gaze

He was losing weight
He looked kind of tired sometimes
But he was working so hard
Still, felt something was wrong
(looking at Wheeler) And  can't believe they're saying they didn't notice anything
Objection
Just answer the question
Sorry
Ms
Burton
You're black
Is that a question
No
Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler
Yes
Wheeler shakes his head, disgusted
Kenton fumes, outraged
Seidman looks surprised
In what way
Well
One time, Mr
Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr
Wheeler had a problem with my earrings
Your earrings
Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings
Apparently, Mr
Wheeler felt they were too
"ethnic" is the word she used
She said he would like it if  wore something smaller, less garish, and
more "American

said my earrings are American
They're African-American
Thank you
No more questions

One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth
It's disgusting
They lie in silence for a moment

Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth

Has a file ever disappeared like that before
Vanished into thin air, all of a sudden, only to reappear in the nick of time
Jamey answers nervously: 've never known that to happen before
No

Andrew takes in the commotion, as the
Hold it, hold it
Andrew trains his attention on Joe
Objection
Where has this come from
Suddenly Counsel is attacking his own witness
Mr
Collins' sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case
said,
(the courtroom ) Mr
Miller
Could you kindly share with me exactly what's going on in your brain, because  don't have a clue at the moment
Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to
Your Honor, everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference, sexual orientation, whatever you want to call it
They're looking at me, and wondering about it
(looking at Andrew) They're looking at Mr
Beckett, and wondering about it
They're looking at Mr
Wheeler and wondering about it
They might even be looking at you and wondering about it
So, let's get it out in the open
Let's talk about what this case is really about: the general public's hatred
our loathing, our fear of homosexuals
while the Judge thinks it over
(to himself) Very good
, sweating bullets on the stand
In this courtroom, Mr
Miller, justice is blind
To matters of race, creed, color, religion
And sexual orientation
With all due respect, Your Honor

We don't

Let me tell you something, okay
When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about
homosexuals
As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint
And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe

What impressed you about him
He was
the kind of person thought  wanted to be
What kind of person is that
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law
razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others
An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street

Relieved
That 'd never told him  was gay
Very relieved
: shakes his head, a denial
Are you a good lawyer
'm an excellent lawyer
What makes you an excellent lawyer
love the law
know the law
excel at practicing it
It's the only thing 've ever wanted to do
What do you love about it
Well
many things
But think the thing  love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally
you get to be part of justice being done
It's really quite a thrill when that happens
: (
/)
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit
" Is that correct
Something like that
Do you take risks
In my work
Yes
Calculated risks
You have to
In general
Do you take risks in other areas of your life
Not unnecessary ones
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street
Joe cringes a little with discomfort
(looking Belinda right in the eye) few times

() What kind of movies do they show there
() Gay movies
(

Yes
Do men have sex with each other in that theater
Yes

Beckett

Andrew
Andrew steps into the booth
(
) Now what do we do
Robert laughs, closing the door of the booth
think we'll figure it out
(
/): Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy
When
Approximately what year did this event take place
guess it was 1984, 85
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called , and that you could contract it through sexual activity
It's impossible to know exactly when or how  was infected with
But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985
That happened once
People weren't talking about  then, the way we are now
Or safe sex
You'd heard of  in 1984, 85
'd heard of something The gay plague, gay cancer, but
we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you
-- losing strength
() (sounds far away) Do you need a break
No
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct
That is not correct
never lied about it
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk
No
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks
:    ' , , ' (
/)
Some do
didn't
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right
In some situations
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you
Objection
'll withdraw it
Mr
Beckett
Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater
, sitting next to Sarah
Yes
You could have infected him, isn't that right
Miguel has not been infected
As said, we weren't aware of , then, or how it is spread
Really
Yes
Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct
That's right
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had and fired you
Absolutely
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time
One
Here, in front of my ear
An  hands Conine a shaving mirror
She holds it before Andrew
Remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away
Answering truthfully
Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is  very visible
By the time  was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger
Answer the question, please
No
can't really see it
Thank you
Andrew rubs his eyes
() (far away) This would be a good time to break for the day
() (far away) Your Honor
May  have ten minutes in re-direct
() (far away) Beckett
Andrew finds the Judge looking at him
(
) Can you go on for ten minutes
Yes sir
Joe   from the plaintiff's table
only need five
(to Belinda, reaching for the mirror) May
Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror
(
) Do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired
Yes
On my torso
If it please the court, 'd like to ask Mr
Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about
We object, Your Honor
It would unfairly influence the jury
Your Honor, if Mr
Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside
We're talking about , we're talking about lesions
Let's see what we're talking about
--
(a moment, then) 'll allow it
Would you mind removing your shirt, Mr
Beckett
--
Allright
The
Andrew removes his suit jacket
He's weak, so the smallest gesture requires effort

Andrew undoes his tie

Andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down

Andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers

Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror
Yes
Thank you

Charles Wheeler strides down the corridor, flanked by Kenton, Killcoyne and Belinda, discussing strategy
Bob Seidman steps to Wheeler's side, keeping pace
've discovered something interesting, Charles
(to Belinda) keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy
(to Seidman) What, Bob
No matter how hard  try, can't lose a file in my computer
he's got ' attention
(
) The system automatically makes a backup
Belinda holds up both hands, interrupting with: don't think  should hear this
She walks away, giving a glance over her shoulder as: You can erase the backup
(a challenge to Wheeler) But why would you
(venomous) What's the point, Bob
(calm) Very interesting, Bob
Let's make a note of that
Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer
He never put it in
He lied about that, too
(weary) Charles
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand
After all, this isn't a conspiracy
Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the high-ceilinged corridor
Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman
: --
Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett to your firm
Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate
Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity
If you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the hot rookie
And Andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney
That's why we went after him, that's why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year
waiting for the promise to be fulfilled
But it never was
You kept giving him another chance
Of course we did
When you've groomed someone they way we groomed Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him
you've made quite an investment
We were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver
But, ultimately, we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality
This is one of the saddest times in my life
To sit in this court, testifying to Andy's ultimate failure to make the grade
To discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's rules
To think you know someone, only to find out
you don't know them at all
It's heartbreaking
Thank you
That's all for now, Your Honor
Mr
Miller
Joe rises
Adjusts his jacket
Wheeler waits
(very gentle) Explain to me, if you can, Mr
Wheeler, explain this to me like 'm a ten year-old
This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying
Not about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching  through casual contact with someone who has it
You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character
Am getting this right
Yes, character
To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job
Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult
He takes in the rest of the court, while Wheeler's words
(
) Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle
'  --  , sitting among the spectators
Rachel begins speaking, her   Wheeler's (we should get the feeling she's giving her testimony)
didn't mind covering for Andy, but  did wonder
when was he planning to deal with his problem
Andrew blinks
what's going on
Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler
Everything seems normal
Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people
What kind of people
People who want to bend the rules
'  --   at the defense table: If you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices
Wheeler keeps speaking: to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it
'  --  : You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material
Who makes the rules, Mr
Wheeler
You
'  --  : Yes,  did see the lesions suspected he was sick
: closing his eyes
,    : The everyday, common person with decent values
It seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation
Andrew slowly rises, the   : didn't tell the others, was afraid to
But now, we're standing up for ourselves
But we shouldn't have fired him
It's time to get this society back on track
Andrew
: The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned

Andrew falls into his own
In slow motion
He lies on the floor, looking up
'  -- Joe steps over him
Could you call an ambulance, please
: (
/) working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who , his body
The tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making matters worse
Miguel stands to the side, furious: It's making it worse
Take it out
Take it out
Dr
Gillman  into the room, in street clothes, obviously having answered an emergency call
She tries assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and Andrew  for breath
places an oxygen mask over Andrew's face and he drinks in the air
His eyes are wide open with fear, sweat covering his face

: "Two weeks later
" () If he was "mediocre," why did they gave him this major assignment three weeks before they fired him
() They were testing him
: , grimy windows (

: " Jury deliberations
They wanted to see if he'd rise to the challenge
An American flag hangs on the wall
They wanted to give him a final chance
Makes sense
'd still love to know what happened to that missing file
Wouldn't we all
Ask the computer
They say he wasn't competent
But, you heard him on the stand
He sounded pretty smart to me
Why would they fire him
Why not a medical leave, or
They freaked out over the
They hate homosexuals
It's not against the law to disapprove of homosexuals
It is against the law to fire someone for having
That's why we're here
You're the foreman
You haven't said anything
What do you think
--  , sitting at the head of the table
: They're saying he wasn't a good lawyer
He was mediocre
And the fact that they gave him the most important lawsuit they'd ever had, for one of their most important clients
they say that doesn't prove anything, because that was just a test
What did they call it
carrot
To see if he'd rise to the occasion
Okay
Say 've got to send a pilot into enemy territory, and he's gonna be flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars
Who am  going to put into that plane
rookie who can't cut the grade, because  want to see if he'll rise to the challenge
Or am going to give that assignment to my best pilot, my most experienced, my sharpest, my top gun
The very best 've got

Joe is utterly cool

The Marine rises to his feet
We have, Your Honor
Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye

) We find for the plaintiff, Andrew Beckett
Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm
Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine
Have you awarded any damages
Yes, we have, Your Honor
(referring to a list) For back pay and loss of benefits one hundred fortythree thousand dollars
Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount
Wheeler and his crew  -- (
) For damages related to mental anguish and humiliation
we give no award
Joe is extremely disappointed
(
) And punitive damages we award
Four million, eight hundred and eighty two thousand dollars
Joe throws his pen over his shoulder
Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush forward, pounding him on the back
Andrew's family members hug each other

a hospital (

Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room
Dr
Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett
As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's room, he hears: if he comes out of the hospital this time, you mustn't expect him to be like he was before
Joe steps into

hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed: "Victory
" plays on a portable  player
lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face
sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones
With his free hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm
(Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various parts of his body
) Andrew's brothers  and  are sipping beers with
, , Miguel's sister , Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment
Matt's audience is loving it
As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags from him
Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others
People    , but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room
: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile
: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look
Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants Joe to sit there
Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed
With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask
His voice is raspy, weak: What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean
What
good start
Joe smiles
(
) Excellent work, Joe
thank you
It was good working with you, Andrew
You're welcome
(sees the oxygen mask) Hey
Shouldn't you put that thing back on
Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are weak
Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears
(
) better get home
Lisa and are having some friends over
(muffled by the mask) Sure thing
Joe stands
'll see you, Beckett
Andrew nods, weakly
But he's still smiling and his eyes are dancing
(through mask) Thanks for coming by
You bet
We'll see you later
Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there
(to Miguel) He's looking good
wouldn't be surprised if he gets out of here soon
We just want to get him home
Thanks for stopping by, Joe
Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him
Joe slaps Miguel's back
Night
Joe leaves
Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying: He's tired
He ought to sleep

Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving
Night, Andy

God bless you, Andy
Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek
Goodnight, son
Get some rest, okay
Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead
Goodnight angel, my sweet boy
Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug his brother
He begins to sob
Andy
Andrew puts his weak arms, with the  lines connected, around his brother Randy, to comfort him
(through mask) 'm okay, bro

Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room
Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door
Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes
Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the remote control, and
Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say: 'm ready
Ready for what, baby
Whatever
hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on
Andrew replaces the oxygen mask

Some people laughing
one or two softly crying as they hug each other
Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew at various stages of his life, and things that meant something to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his favorite cat, etc

Instead
We hear only the  from the
Andrew   as he chases a new puppy
