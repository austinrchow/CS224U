"  " Screenplay by Kristine Johnson Jessie Nelson 2001 - 7:30
We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers
With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows
Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows
The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low
There
Symmetry
We move up those hands and meet   as he surveys his domain
Something about him
He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome
But it's more than that
Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child
Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face
They light on a held by one of the Regulars
Double double decaf low-fat Cap
You got it, buddy
Good choice very good choice
Sam moves along, commenting to  as he places Sweet 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks
(') Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half low, half non
Excellent choice
Very good choice
He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the logos all face the same way
His boss  approaches
Sam, they called
It's time for you to go
Sam , but doesn't turn around
(') Sam, did you hear me
"It's time for you to go
" Yes
It's time
Good luck
Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door
- Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street
He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for anyone
argue on the sidewalk
Sam It's time
It's time
Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping
Traffic  to a
Cars , a taxi driver
(') It's time, it's time for you to go
- Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324
Rebecca
Sam pushes the
And we  we are entering: is in the middle of a major contraction
Her face is the opposite of Sam's
Hardened
She lets out a scream that stops Sam dead in his tracks
, a no-nonsense Black Nurse, looks up from the monitor
You the one responsible for this
Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally
'm sorry
Too late for sorries, daddy, get over here and hold her hand
Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand
She pulls it away - Rebecca screams
Sam
You got a live one, Gert
- Okay, this is it
(spins in circles) This is it
This is it
And it's a girl
The  lets out her first cry
Sam watches, awestruck
Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to Rebecca
Rebecca shakes her head -
Gertie walks over to Sam
There's someone who's been waitin' an awful long time to see you, Sam
She places the  into '
Suddenly Sam's whole body  and becomes very still
He looks to Rebecca, but she has turned away
He meets Gertie's eyes
Then in quiet amazement: This is it
What's her name
(looks at clock) Let me see let me see let me see
12:17, March 2nd
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
Recorded March 2nd
1967
Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul McCartney
Lucy Diamond Dawson
We hear   , "Picture yourself on a boat in a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
" - Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag
Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated
They see the bus pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it
As he approaches the bus, he looks to Becca by his side, but she is not there
He looks around and no sign of her
Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street
He screams
Becca
Becca
The more he screams the faster she moves away
Till there's no trace of her
Sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding Lucy to his chest, devastated
We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but she's gone
" : - Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest
Next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk
Sam is surrounded by , the eerie world of the underground at night
Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two against the world
'  - marvel of organization
closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded -shirts, underwear and socks organized by color carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves
Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls
Becca's things sit in one corner
An island of chaos in an "Hold Everything" showroom
The kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table
Bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers
Underneath, a clothes line of baby clothes
The sound of a   breaks the silence
The camera follows and finds the : a  tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs
An exhausted   up from his bed, behind the hammock
He swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep
Didn't you just fall asleep, little girl
(Lucy cries harder) Okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up
(Sam sniffs the air) Oh my, oh my, oh my
Quite a bit of business
He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals", the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers, Go
"  Sam undoes it
(') Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Let me see let me see let me see
Sam attempts to clean and diaper her
He finally manages to pin the buttons so that it at least stays on
(') You look very beautiful this morning, very beautiful
He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles
: We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf: , ,   ,
- Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed
He reaches for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the Huggies
Sam stops moving, Lucy starts , so he jogs in place
Sam decides on one of each
He heads to the Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified
He stops
Lucy
",   " '  - 9
Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs
'  - 11:25
Sam rocks the   in the hammock
He's exhausted, but she's just getting started
He puts another blanket on her
'  - 1:30
Peace
punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate
He tiptoes, his  raised victoriously - "
"  He doesn't get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming
Defeated, he picks her up
The
speaker
(
) What the hell are you doing to that baby
He looks out his window and sees  , his neighbor on the phone, watching him through her window
She is a strange creature with very thick glasses
We sense a uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor
Everything's so tiny, tiny
Tiny
Everything
Won't you please come over
Help
need somebody
Won't you please please help me
You know  can't do that
What does her mother say
Her mother
Her mother said "This isn't my life
'm outta here when she comes
It didn't mean anything, Sam
It was just one night
The two of you
That's all  need
" Annie, what if she's sick
- has her door open a crack
Annie feels the baby's forehead
Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated
She's overheated and not eating enough
How often are you feeding her
lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber
What's a lot
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Three squares hot
Babies need food every two hours, Sam
Oh
'm sorry Lucy Diamond
What time does the little diamond wake up
She never really goes to sleep
Okaaaay
Well, let's assume she's up at six
Keep your  on Nickelodeon want you to feed her first while "Bewitched" is on
Then again, when "Hogan's Heroes" starts
After that, well until "Father Knows Best
" : '  - We are watching "Hogan's Heroes"
We hear ' : " know nothing, absolutely nothing
"  Sam feeds a content Lucy
: '  - "Father Knows Best" on
Lucy blissfully falls asleep in Sam's arms
Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places her ever so gently, when suddenly, the
Sam's    inside: , a Pakistani gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it
, who sees himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah Fawcett -shirt; and , highly paranoid, thinks the world's out to get him
Lucy
Sam  to the
What are you doing here now
Her first sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound
Eight years every Thursday Video Night and you forgot
Oh my god, Video Night
First Thursday of the month
Video night at Sam's house
'm sorry,  forgot
Becca's gone
"Gone with the Wind" is a very sad movie
Oh here we go
Everything changes now
Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night Denny's and Friday night Karaoke
And got hit by a car today
You did
It's probably that guy from the
What guy
(closing window) can't discuss it
And now this
Ifty makes   out of newspapers
Lucy's rapt
She looks smart, doesn't she
Of course, look
She's already reading the newspaper
have five smart sisters in Pakistan
am only brother
"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a wonderful movie  forgot to bring last week for Video Night
Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight
Now it's all my fault
Don't tell me you forgot again
broke a date with a daydream to come here
There's a knock at the door
Ifty goes to get it
Brad moans when he sees his 65   , , standing in the doorway
Mom
told you Video Night's over at nine
It's only six-thirty
(unaware of the baby) Sorry
'll wait in the lobby
She exits
Lucy begins to
Brad takes her - like a hot potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles
She needs motion
My father drove my sisters in his taxi to get them to go to sleep
Two-fifty surcharge on all taxi's from the airport
got hit by a taxi on Tuesday
And it all starts again and we -- : - An empty bus makes its way through the city at night
- Main and Temple
again
She out yet
The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the back
Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm, almost asleep
Almost there, almost there
One more round and she'll be down for the night
We hear the song "Golden Slumbers"
In a , we see Lucy and Sam in on the bus seat
Gradually, she  in -- ,
She's    at And on and on into the night
'   - We see Sam and Lucy  into the booth, wearing birthday hats, taking    picture
We see the as it comes out of the slot
Sam's shoulder with Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never made it into the picture
- 8:30
The place is packed
Sam moves from table to table, cleaning
Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat
Good choice, very good choice
Sam turns and    attached to him in a handmade snugly, crocheted by Annie
She faces outward, all hands, all 16  of her; too big for the snugly
She grabs a croissant from a customer
George looks confused
Then makes a  for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the ground
It  all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth double-latte  in a designer exercise outfit
She begins shrieking
George looks at Sam, this can't go on
- Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door
Please, Annie
She's too big to take to work
'm not a baby-sitter
'm too busy
Annie, Annie, Annie
(suspicious) Did you teach her that
It was her first word
Very first word
Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in
And people worry you're not smart
'  - The apartment looks like a fallout shelter
The kitchen contains enough canned goods to last a year
Brightly colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every available surface
The    of an Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson '   on the keys
In a , it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note, now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord
Until finally the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
This is Mozart
He did twenty-two variations of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
You smell good
You can tell a lot about a person by their smell
If they've got too much perfume on they're covering something up
You gotta watch someone who smells like soap
Gotta wonder what their priorities are
Nervous people
People who try too hard
They smell like fish
But you
You smell like milk
Milk and hope
Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and plays with a ball yarn
(
) Groceries, Annie
Thanks
Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries
The ball of yarn   the door and Lucy chases after it
Annie, terrified, bellows: (') Lucy
Come back here
Come back
It becomes obvious Annie can't walk outside
Trembling: (') "Lucy in the sky with diamonds
" Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back
Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we -- - Sam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers, continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven
- beautiful blue sky
And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" continues as Lucy's    laughing face on a swing then  out
Now Lucy    and out of the other end again
Sam's , glowing with delight,     and then disappears
Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by and  at the park
(
) Daddy, where does the sky end
(
) Let me see, let me see
've never been there but they say it's somewhere near China
- Lucy   , now , sitting on Sam's lap, swinging
(
) Are lady bugs only girls or are there boys, too
And if there are, what are they called
(
) The Beatles
- Then Lucy   , now , followed by Sam
(
) Do  look more like you or Mommy
' He knew this moment would come
' -    - Lucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole
If you and Mommy liked each other enough to have me, how come you're not together anymore
think she fell out of love with me
Not you, never you
Me, just me
When you fall out of love where do you land
Somewhere in Florida,  think
Do you think she'll ever come back
(long pause) Paul McCartney lost his mother when he was fourteen
John lost his mother twice
First when Julie gave John to her sister Mimi to raise
And then again when Julia was hit by a car
They say God picks certain people, special people
That's what they say
Lucy takes this in
Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just so
his potatoes just slightly to the left
Lucy watches
Daddy, did God mean for you to be like this or was it an accident
Do you mean - what do you mean
mean you're different
What do you mean
mean, what do you mean
You're not like the other daddies
'm not am
'm sorry
Don't be sorry
'm lucky
Nobody else's daddy ever comes to the park
' Filled with relief
Bursting with love
We are very lucky, aren't we
Grace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the side
Ice cream on the side
Not on top
Not on top
Good choice
Very good choice
'  - Brad,  know it was your turn
'm sure of it
swear to God it was Robert's turn
Why is it always my fault
keep track, last time,  say to myself,  say, write it down
Bank of America give away beautiful calendar, every month a picture of wild animal, look June, an Elk
Elke Sommer
she starred in the remake of "Prisoner of Zenda"
Three stars Leonard Maltin video movie guide
As they go on, Lucy matter-of-factly , and puts it in the
She turns it on
It's "Kramer vs
Kramer"
Everyone stops their arguing and stares at Lucy
Annie let me borrow it
'   - row of brand new children's shoes on display
Lucy tries on dozens of school shoes, surrounded by Sam and her "Godfathers": Ifty, Brad and Robert
You need a good sturdy school shoe
Arches are very important
Sturdy is boring
Red shoes bring good luck
But red doesn't got with green
Except on Christmas
No brown clodhoppers
Everyone will make fun of her
will make fun of Lucy
She might be stupid
No she's not -- Did they test her
You don't know for sure
Yes  do
But if she is, don't make her go to school
Don't let her in the lunch room
Johnny Marzettie's there
And gym
Get her a pass
The rules for volleyball are so hard to remember
"Rotate Rackman Rotate
" Throw the ball at his forehead and the water on his brain will come out his nose
Meanwhile, Lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe
like these
She know what she likes
She likes these
How much are they
Forty-nine ninety-nine
One penny less than fifty
These shoes are one penny less than fifty
It's okay, Dad
don't really like them
No, no no no no
We'll all give ten dollars
've only got three plus five
But need one for stamps
Don't pull your wad out in front of people
They all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly
Thank you, thank you
We are rich in friends
That's what our fortune cookie said
1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes one
'll count it
Is it enough
(exasperated) If there's a God
Do we get a balloon with these
Yes
All of us, or just her
: - Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of man's shoes
We move up from those shoes to see tightly clasping their balloons as they march victoriously down the street
We   on Lucy's little brown shoes skipping with joy and -- : - Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats
We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a fierce kids soccer game
Score's tied
The ball comes to Lucy
She kicks and misses
From the sidelines we hear: Beautiful kick
Very close
Lucy looks up at her dad proudly
The ball comes again
Nobody could miss this one
But Lucy does
(') Thatta girl
Thatta girl
They're getting scared now
The game continues
The ' ,  , handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son: 'mon, Conner
On your toes
They're all counting on you
Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure
Meanwhile, down at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy
She kicks it
Hard
Right into her team's own goal
The crowd
Hurray, Lucy
You're getting the hang of it now
You've got them scared now
Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and The ball goes flying
The parents in the stand are completely baffled
Sam is completely ecstatic
(') -u-c-y
That's our battlecry
The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie, Conner
Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan reaming his son -- The whole game was right in front of your nose
leave work early to watch you blow the whole game
Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away
Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy
'  - child's hand double jumps across a checker board
(
) Ha
Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner
Two carrots cut into ten pieces
Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces each
(') What's wrong with your father
Why's he acting like a retard
He is
Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he pulls his hand away
Are you
No
Are you sure
Yeah
How do you know
He told me
But he's a retard
Yeah well it takes one to know one
He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the first time a bit uneasily
'  - Sam's reading Lucy her homework book
"They perched in sisisi
" "Silence
" "
silence for a long time
"  Boy
Your teacher chose a hard book this time
"How can we be so difdifdif
" "Different
" Sam glances up at Lucy self-consciously
Lucy grabs the book from Sam, tosses it on the pile and picks up another
(') don't like that book - let's read "Green Eggs and Ham"
Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized than read
" am Sam, Sam  am
Do you like green eggs and ham
do not like them, Sam am
" They both laugh, delighted
Lucy looks sleepy
: Lucy is getting drowsy
Sam is just getting started
(') "And  will eat them here and there
Say  will eat them
do so like green eggs and ham, thank you thank you, Sam  am
"  One more time
Daddy,  have school tomorrow
don't wanna be too sleepy
Just the part about the boat and the goat in the rain in the train
Daddy, Hamburger Hamlet has twelve different kinds of hamburgers
Can we go there Wednesday instead of Denny's
But Wednesday night's Denny's, Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night Karaoke
Lucy nods, a little deflated
(') How about one more time, just the beginning
" am Sam, Sam  am
" Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest
- Lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from ""
Lucy, your turn
Start where Sara left off

Sure you can
"They perched in sisisisi
" Silence

The   her floral dress that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring
She reads a
Look here
"Premature baby claims he's cupid - has the arrow to prove it
"  Do you believe that
Well, if he has the arrow
Yeah
You got a good point
She crosses her legs

You're a good reader

You're lucky

Not so fast
You're under arrest
Solicitation
He wanted to bring his kid,  said no
lightbulb flashes and we -- : - Sam blinks as his  is being taken
Now the profile
He turns so they can get the back of his head
Now the Now Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making thumbprints on the wall
While the  discusses his case with a social worker,
Over the years she's seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's just a job
It's the first time in nineteen years actually believe the guy when he says he didn't know she was a hooker -- You say that like it's a good thing
Your teeth don't sound like they were brushed
Do it with me now

He says he's never spent a night away from his kid
Come with me - got a guy who beat the shit out of his two year old

Margaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone
- The  are lined with '
Various interpretations of the family
We stop at one of a very small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him
It gives us a great deal of insight into what she must be feeling
And in the classroom, it's becoming clear she's holding herself back
It's as if she's literally afraid to learn
We   and see Sam staring at the picture
Mrs
Wright and the principal watch him
(') No one doubts that you love your daughter, Mr
Dawson
But the Department of Social Services contacted us
They shared with us that your records show that your intellectual capacity is around that of a seven year old
Our concern is what happens when Lucy turns eight
Mr
Dawson, do you understand what Miss Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy
No one wanted The Beatles to break up
But you can hear it on the White Album
They were going in different directions
'  - It's bedtime

How can we be so dif

No you're not
don't want to read it if you can't
It makes me happy
'm happy hearing you read it
He holds the book open for Lucy
Now Lucy, pushing through a mountain of resistance, reads
And reads beautifully
"Why are we different and so much alike
" -  - Two children, dressed as Batman, march followed by We see Lucy dressed in  - an And behind her, marching more proudly than any child, is Sam, dressed as  McCARTNEY, in the black suit era - with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest
Sam is the only adult participating in the parade
Music  over the loudspeaker
Sam begins to dance with joyous abandon
Lucy joins him
They dance together happily
Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning to laugh
She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony around the room
Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist and begins to imitate Sam
Another kid joins him
'm a Super Freak
And  thought my dad was a dork
Lucy's face hardens for the first time
In a corrupt world the pure can only stay pure for so long

Lucy's ecstatic
Sam's trying
They have eleven different kinds of hamburgers
This is so great

Your choice
said we'd go to a new place
And here we are
Sam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table
Lucy tries to fold a napkin into an Origami bird
You know what else  want for my birthday, Daddy
want a hundred birds
The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's
They make better birds
There's not so much stuff on the tables there either
Why do they have two kinds of mustard on every table
Coffee
No, no coffee
Sam's system can't handle coffee
Okaaay
What can  get you folks
'd like the Benito Bandito burger and a chocolate chip milkshake, please
'll have the fish special, side of potatoes, salad with Thousand Island Dressing, cherry pie, and
'm sorry, sir
We don't have a fish special
There's fish and chips
It comes with a dinner salad
Chips, chips
You mean potato chips don't want potato chips

You want french fries
No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's

They're little red potatoes
We don't have new potatoes
Denny's has new potatoes
Six new potatoes parsley garnish parsley garnish
Her smile fades
: ' - - Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes
Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table
She doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is
Fish and chips fish and chips

will not eat green eggs and ham

'  - Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy
"  For Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in the center of the apartment and filling the entire place - leaving no room for the few kids and their parents
Brad stands too close to a young attractive mother
Robert shakes all the presents suspiciously
Now when they come through the door, everybody yell "Surprise
"  Do you want to rehearse again
No
bet she already knows
didn't tell her
Did Brad say  did
There's a  at the door
Is that Lucy
Annie's supposed to call and warn us
Shhhh, everyone
Brad hits the lights
Sam    and everyone yells "
"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker

We met at the police station
Put your present over there - Hurry up

Annie says she's coming up the stairs
Everyone be quiet

(Conner keeps talking) Be quiet
Assume surprise positions
Oh brother
Why are you such a party pooper

Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against him
Hey
He's gonna ruin the surprise

We hear a

Then from within the Moonbounce: Surprise
Happy Birthday
Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon
Daddy
You don't have to call him "Daddy"
(in Sam's face) She says you're not her real father, anyway
She's adopted
Humiliated, Lucy
The Social Worker watches, profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone
- police car pulls into the parking lot
Sam and Margaret in the back
Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling from beneath the curtain of the photo booth
'll go get her
It would be better if you stay here
'm sorry to say this, Mr
Dawson, it's clear how much you love your daughter, but we're going to have to remove Lucy from your home
Sam's baffled
One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder, restraining him

No, no no no
It's her birthday
It's her birthday

'm scheduled to come to your apartment at four
No, not five every two hours
It's two every five hours
She only weighs thirty pounds for chrissakes
(back to Sam) The city has given me the difficult task of deciding when to intervene on behalf of the child
Unfortunately, 've learned the hard way that it's better too soon than too late
For now the court will decide what's in Lucy's best interest
Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain
Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being
Run, Lucy, run
We see '   the '  and wrestle out of his grasp
She flies out the booth, holding that balloon
She runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a cop follows
Sam struggles
Reeling, devastated, we    speaking: (

Miss Brown also cites Mr
Dawson's mental deficiencies which raise serious questions about his ability to properly parent

The child shall be removed from the home until a forma jurisdictional hearing
Mr
Dawson, is there anything you'd like to add
Yes
just wanted it to be a nice surprise party

Pink and yellow, pink and yellow
Like a princess
And the balloons at -- (gently) Mr
Dawson, it sounds like a lovely party, but right now  want to talk to you about your legal rights
would strongly suggest you get yourself legal counsel and allow your attorney to present your case at the jurisdictional hearing on February 13th
Counsel, are you available
Ted,  have a trial that day

(panicking) Twenty-two days
Lucy will come home and you want me to bring Lucy back in twenty-two days

Now 'm sorry, we have thirty more cases to see today

Robert, Ifty, and Brad all sit with Yellow Pages open in front of them

Today is Monday, Mrs
Brown
That's three days away
That's too long
She can't sleep without Mr
Jeeters
Well if you're not available until Thursday, maybe  could see her without you there
maybe the Judge made a mistake - maybe he doesn't know that for seven years played with her without you there
No Mrs
Brown, 'm not trying to violate the court
(the other line hangs up) Mrs
Brown
bet they were recording the whole conversation
Check your phone
You can't make a move
You need a lawyer
Call Jerry Spence
He has his own show
He must know what he's doing
No
Johnny Cochran
He has his own show, too
Yeah
He can even get a guilty person off
So you think 'm guilty
No
You didn't kill anybody
But she said 'm not her father
She didn't say that
That runty kid with the blue shirt and the mean father whose voice sounds like the man on the Channel Four News who has a toupee
Toupees are expensive
But Ifty
She said it
But she didn't mean it
said  hated my mother once
"Once upon a time
" is how stories begin
You should get a personal injury lawyer
You've been personally injured
Here - look at this - "Sebastion Gibson
"  He can do anything
Pedestrians
Back and neck
Uninsured Motorist
Dog attacks
The Social Worker said it's a custody case
Then get a divorce lawyer
When Dustin Hoffman was trying to keep Billy from going back to Meryl Streep, his lawyer said it was going to cost him fifteen thousand dollars - and that's if we win
Fifteen thousand dollars
Don't worry about money now

Now the dots in the Lichtenstein on the wall
Now the     -- and her assistant burst in
Rita moves in opposite circles around the room
Looking for something
In fact, as we watch Rita, we realize that she never stops moving
Period
Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy, too much caffeine, not enough food
If she slowed down a beat she might get vulnerable
Can't have that
Can't be wrong
Can't really look you in the eye
Can't help it if she's smarter than anyone else in the room
Any room
Any time
Did Fred Kimble call
'm already twenty minutes late
He -- What'd Michelle Kresge say
She -- She wasn't defensive, was she
Well -- That's ridiculous
What happened with my car
They -- Because it wasn't my fault
-- Thank you, Patricia
This is Mr
Dawson
There was some confusion with the temp last week and -- Mr
Dawson, it's a pleasure
Since somebody made a mistake, unfortunately we only have a little time
Hold all my calls unless it's my kid - 'll have a double cap
Good choice, very good choice
Can we get you anything to drink
Is it free
Hmmmm
-- Sam is in the middle of the beginning of his story
Rita on her second cappuccino, eyes her computer screen for calls

Lucy's favorite is cherry vanilla which is pink, too
Cherries and vanilla

Well keep trying
She unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her desk sorting out all the yellow ones
(') Mr
Dawson, what 'm trying to say is 'm a divorce lawyer and as much as 'd like to,  don't handle cases like yours -- Since you would like to, why don't you talk to your boss
Maybe he would let you
She pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk, now frantically sorting through them
(into phone) Then keep dialing -- (to Sam) What  mean is that at this point in my career,  can't afford to
earn eight dollars an hour at Starbucks
can pay your hourly rate, rate by the hour, hourly -- Rita stands up, ushering him to the door
Mr
Dawson, 'm sorry,  have to be in court in eight minutes with the Kresges
You understand, good luck to you and don't give up
She turns, ahhhh
He's gone
She begins searching the room
(') Patricia
Where are my keys
Where the hell are my keys
Alright alright
(replaying) walked into the room -  went over here -  looked at my desk -  put my coat down - Patricia
Where's my coat

- 8:15
group of Rita's colleagues are celebrating a big win
Rita is backing out of the room with her glass of champagne
am celebrating congratulations to us these are the moments good night
She stops, stunned, as she sees Sam, sitting in the lobby holding out a Starbucks Cappuccino
Non-fat vente cap
'm sorry to bother you, but did you call your friend
(Rita's confused) Your friend from college, your friend who does this kind of work
(there never was a friend) don't have her number anymore, Sam
We lost touch
(devastated) Oh, that happens
That happens
People lose touch
Will you call me if you find it
If you get back in touch
Yes, 'm just in the middle
it's a special
'll call you
To avoid any further interaction, she heads back to the employee party she previously escaped from
Sam walks down the hall
Is that the new janitor
No, it's a case
Sort of a pro-bono thing
Her assistant Patricia clears her throat
(') What's that supposed to mean
Nothing
cracker went down the wrong pipe
Muffled laughter from her colleagues
You think  don't pro-bono
can do pro-bono
can do Goddamn pro-bono
where the hell are my keys
hold the door
Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with Sam who's been holding the door open for her
- The door closes
Rita is trapped with Sam
She stares forward trying to will him not there
Rita gulps her champagne
32nd floor
32 floors more
31st floor
31 floors more
And on and on and on
Rita is about to spontaneously combust
Finally, "" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors, then just as suddenly turns around
Alright, alright 'll take you
Alright, Goddammitt, 'll take you
Oh my God oh my God
Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams
Sam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the elevator door starts closing
No, no  no
Pro-bono
Alright
Pro bono
The doors close
We hear from within, as Sam goes up again: (
) Yes
Alright
liked Sonny Bono too
- Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood
On his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's birthday cake
It's lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen
- Sam waits for his transfer
He sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it
The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake
The bus goes half a block before it  to a halt
Sam jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues on its way
Moments later, the  34 bus pulls up
Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on
He feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is starting to leak ice cream
- Lucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for Sam
Lucy, 'm sorry
But it doesn't look like he's going to make it
(staring forward) He'll be here
You smell like soap
Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late
You'll only have a few minutes left
Suddenly through the door comes Sam   , birthday cake
Lucy runs to him
Daddy
told you  told you
: '    - Margaret, the therapist (Ms
Geller), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny
and she's a Century City lawyer - a very famous lawyer
Guess what her name is
Rita Harrison
(jaw drops) Lovely Rita Meter Maid
Harrison
Just like George
They move to hug each other
for their pens
Sam pulls back self-consciously
Everyone writes even harder
(') You've grown
Have
Your ears are larger
And your eyes are older
He's right
Her eyes are older
He hugs her - (') 'm gonna get a phone machine
Next paycheck
If 'm not home, you can leave a message
"Hi, This is Lucy
" You can't afford a phone machine
The writing starts again
Yes we can
'm in line for a promotion
Big promotion
promotion that's big
They're gonna let you make coffee
Set your dreams high, Lucy
Lucy looks at her father lovingly
'm sorry, Daddy
It was all my fault
No, Lucy
Don't say that
wouldn't want any Daddy but you
She looks around to see if anybody's writing
She suddenly screams at them: (') said  was sorry
said  didn't want any Daddy but him
Why don't you write that down
'  - We hear sobbing and see Rita sitting across from a very rich, very angry
Rita's foot is twitching furiously
are you telling me that neither of you want custody of your child
He's created a monster
He's exactly like him
He
he
The woman is distracted by a loud thumping on Rita's glass wall - it's
Holding an envelope
Very distressed, as the Secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby
am right here with you, excuse me
(she unlocks door) Sam
Didn't  tell you that you have to call
- You know how to make an appointment
It's - That's ridiculous you can always get Patricia
They - Good
'll see you next week
But it's an emergency - lots of three syllable words urgent open at once
He hands the letter to Rita
Rita looks through the glass wall at her clients who are getting impatient
They want to have you and Lucy evaluated by a shrink
The appointment is today at three
Today
Now
Today
know and  want you to object
Sam  can't object
It's court ordered
Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying
He walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket
Here
Don't be sad
She looks at him as if he's from Mars
Rita, now outside her office, watches Sam now inside the office
Patricia, 'm in the middle - get him out of there - She quickly gets up but Rita's too impatient and pushes past her into the office
(') Sam
Sam come with me
(to the Couple) We're gonna get through this excuse us
(to Sam) Sam this is their turn now
Not yours
Theirs
If you leave now you'll never make it and you have to make it
Okay okay  know  take the #34 bus and transfer to the #13
than the Downtown Express to Wilshire then - Rita looks at the Couple leaving her office
'  - Redefining road rage, Rita's slamming the horn
Sam next to her
Go
Go
for chrissakes
Green means Red means stop yellow in the middle means no no no
don't like shrinks
've seen too many shrinks
Yeah
You and me both
Right or left which will it be you
Your mother sent you to shrinks, too
No
Well, sort of
talk about her the whole time 'm there
That's nice
Did you notice that everyone else is driving slower noticed that did you
(on the horn) Go for Chrissakes
How about your mother
Maybe she can help you - She's gone
She's at the Park Lane Mortuary
Two from the left
Under the big tree
Oh
'm sorry
The light is green
She cuts around the car in front of her; flips him off, and in a split second that her head is turned, almost into the car in front of her
She slams on the brakes
Too many shrinks
'm sorry Mrs
Dawson, if  were you  wouldn't waste any more time
'm sorry Mrs
Dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment
'm sorry Mrs
Dawson  think you'd both be happier if Sam was in a home
Rita looks over at Sam, forced to stop
- Sam sits across from a shrink,
, nervously straightening her desk
Mr
Dawson, you do understand, that since  am a court appointed psychologist, the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived
(Sam looks confused) Mr
Dawson, do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived
Sam nods nervously and waves
With that she begins
'  - Sam, Ifty, Brad and Robert hover over a used answering machine
Ifty pours over the instructions
Before you read your message press the red button for record, when you finish, press the yellow button
If you press the green button, it will play it back you
Let's start with the "ogm"
Okay, okay
'm ready
Hello,  am Sam
No, no
didn't press the red button
Oh, yes
False start, false start
It's not working
That's what you get for buying a used machine
Used means broken
You're asking for other people's problems, you have enough of your own, not that everyone doesn't have problems
It's not used
It's pre-owned
Guy bought it for his auto shop and then he got a secretary
Testing, one two three
That's a good code
'll remember that
One, two, three
(pressing button) Quick, you're recording
'm hi
am Sam
'm not home
No, you don't want to say that
you don't want them to know you're not home
But then 'm lying
Everybody's lying
'm not a liar
It will send a mixed message to Lucy
(pressing the button) You're on the air
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Hi, how are you
the tape runs out
That was pretty good
That was natural
Did  sound like a good father
It's the outgoing message
You need to sound more outgoing
Let's start again
- Mrs
Kerry unlocks the phone and dials
She hands the phone to Lucy who waits eagerly in her pj's
Sam's answering machine clicks on; as if on slow speed
Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop
We'd love to show you our body work, but it's invisible
Leave it at the beep
Try again
You must have dialed the wrong number
'  - Rita and Sam walk through the lobby at Rita's Olympic pace
She passes the elevator and heads for the stairs
Look, we've got a lot to go over and 've got five minutes
(pointing to elevator) Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams thirty second floor, thirty-two floors up
Rita heads up the stairs
We hear a
Then another
Rita checks her heart rate watch
Starts walking up the stairs
One-twenty
Gotta get to one-twenty five to make it count
Okay okay okay
'm gonna need that list of people who can testify that you're a good father despite your handicap
didn't mean your handicap  meant your disability - mean the fact that you're retarded
That's not the right word
mean
What do  call you
Sam
am Sam
Rita looks at Sam as she bounds up the fourth floor
Yes you are
(he hands her a list - her ) Hello Ted how you doing/  Whattaya mean what's that supposed to mean
(her heart beep rate goes up) Put Danny on
You're supposed to be taking him to karate
No it is not my day it's your day
took your day last Wednesday - are you eating no  will not hold
Go pick him up
What
can't hear you 'm in the car - they put you through to me here
'm losing you -- (clicks off phone) get paid for this memory -  know took him last
look of horror falls across her face
She does a 180 and starts  down the stairs reading the list
(') We're making progress
Three character witnesses
That's a good start
What does Ifty Bhutto do
He works in a bank
(tripping down the stairs) Excellent
'  - Ifty sits across from Rita who attempts to take notes
Sam is a very concerned father
He always saves his money at Bank of America
Last year there was a lion on the calendar
This year a gazelle
The gazelle is national bird of Tunisia
We have clients, not customers
At Bank of America
Bank on us
He looks up at her, lost
So is she
(') What was the question again, please
: '  - Who sits across from Rita
She tape records him
He always made a point of feeding her breakfast when "Bewitched" was on and lunch when "Jeopardy" was on so she'd be smart
Is that Wonderbra you're wearing
Because you look wonderful
: '  - Robert sits across from Rita, who records him
How long have you and Sam - Why are you recording this
Who's listening
It's often necessary - Who are you really
'm - What's that supposed to mean
Let's - need to talk to my lawyer
: '  - Rita maniacally picks the frosting off a donut
Patricia, get Mr
Dawson on the line
Over her , we hear '
(
) Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop - need this like a - call him at Starbucks - no  don't know which Starbucks
There's forty two between here and the end of the block
- Rita stands next to her Porsche
There are Starbucks in every direction she looks
- Sam is straightening Sweet and Lows
Rita barrels in
Look  don't think you understand what you're up against we have to be in court in three days and we don't have a decent witness
Now you've gotta know someone who can testify who's been to college - or has a degree of some kind - or some sort of way of expressing themselves that's gonna make the court believe that you deserve to get your daughter back need a coffee
Big
Tall
Tall's the smallest
Of course
Of course, whatever
Okay okay okay
Damn
forgot to call back no  did and once you think of this person and there has to be one person - want you to call me at work - because 'm going back there now to my seven other cases -- (her cellphone ) What
Mrs
Robeck

You can give the right answers
Annie plays even harder
Frustrated, he  the piano
(') We can't lose her
can't
'd make it worse for you can't do it
Don't you think  would if could
: - We   : (
) All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip McNeily
Sam stands along with others in the courtroom
The Judge enters and sits
Everyone else sits now, too
Except Sam
Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down
Now we see: Ifty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's , who sits several seats behind Brad knitting
Robert holds up a handmade sign from the back of the courtroom "Free Lucy Dawson"
- Turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness
He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you
This man is razor-sharp
The  who evaluated Sam is on the stand
Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the desk he sits at with Rita
Projected on a  is a of the drawing Lucy made in school
there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here
As you can see from her drawings, she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility
Lucy feels she has to take care of her father
Although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed
Objection
"True feelings revealed"
The state is paying Miss Geller for her opinions - Then every child who rages because they didn't get to stay up for that extra hour of  - Objection your honor - Sam  at Rita's sleeve
She ignores it
in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they didn't want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for Foster Care
Objection
think they want you to stop
Really
Thank you, Sam
We all appreciate your assistance Mr
Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr
Turner
Now Ms
Geller,  assume in your therapy session, Mr
Dawson extolled his parenting abilities
On the contrary, Mr
Dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate - that he was terrified he'd made and would continue to make - and  quote: "Huge mistakes, huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge
" No further questions
Rita starts to scribble notes furiously
So does Sam
Turner smugly sits down
Rita confidently strides toward the witness
You're a mother, aren't you Ms
Geller
Yes
Would it be fair to say that as a parent, you've felt confused from time to time, possibly overwhelmed on occasion, even though you're a wonderful mother
Objection
It's Mr
Dawson's parenting
Not Ms
Geller's that's at question here
But if Ms
Geller has never had a moment where she felt confused as a mother it would bias her opinion
And it is her expert opinion we're all after, isn't it, Mr
Turner
Overruled
'll allow it
Thank you, your Honor
Ms
Geller, know there have been many moments as a parent where 've felt 've made huge mistakes - mistakes that are huge
And 've had to admit them to myself
My husband
But most importantly, to my therapist
Which is the guise Mr
Dawson thought he was seeing you under, isn't that right, Ms
Geller
Objection
Get to the point, Ms
Harrison
The point is you've never had those moments, have you Ms
Geller
Moments that every parent 've ever spoken to has - moments when you've felt the task is so unbelievably challenging that you feel retarded, disabled in some way
Moments when you feel everyone has the key but you
But you've never had those moments, have you Ms
Geller
- Yes or no
- Let me rephrase the question
When your son od'ed - Objection
But if Ms
Geller didn't feel she had made mistakes - mistakes that were huge it might bias her opinion toward Mr
Dawson
will - Thank you
So Ms
Geller - yes or no - when your son od'ed, did you feel you might have made mistakes, mistakes that were huge
(tearfully) Yes
- Sam and Rita go down the cafeteria line
You made her cry
You got lucky
That's not nice
Not very nice
Only in there
Your secretary too
Yellow and green in one bowl
(Sam stares at a bowl of Lima beans and corn) You separate the Lima beans from the corn please
The   stares at him
Yeah
Sure he will
Sam, don't be impossible
(then to Worker) Can  have the spinach omelet - only egg whites no fat no oil no butter and extra mushrooms
Absolutely
Sam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into separate piles
They arrive at the cashier
Rita pulls out her billfold
Sam reaches for his wallet
My treat
My treat
Don't be ridiculous
'll get it
said it's my treat
That means 'll get it
Sam, do you really want to get it or are you just trying to -- Trying to what
You know, trying to act like a - Like a what
Like a
a
real man
didn't say that
You're my lawyer and you think what they think
don't have a chance
No chance at all
Even with an expert witness
Rita looks at him
He's right
She chooses her words carefully
think
you deserve
a fair trial
Answer the question
Okay okay okay
What was the question again
Do you think what they think
Sam can't order food
Sam can't pay a check
Sam can't take care of Lucy
It doesn't matter what  think - it matters that we win
You're my lawyer it matters what you think
Hey, it doesn't matter to them what think
Me
It matters to me
He reaches for the receipt, and faces the  defiantly

That's 5 ones, 2 quarters and 16 cents less than twenty
He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away
Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of admiration

So your mother, this woman with the of a nine-year old had the wisdom to recognize that you would be a great doctor
guess her disability didn't seem to hold you back in life
No
My mother's condition taught me what they can't teach you; compassion and patience
Traits most doctors have in spades
Thank you, no further questions
Sam runs to hug Dr
Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him down
How'd you get through medical school
Where'd you live
We lived with my mother's parents
Oh, Grandma and Grandpa
Would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence
Yes
And didn't these people - your grandparents - with normal intelligence - have the real responsibilities
(relishing this) Objection
hear Mr
Turner's mother in-law lives with him
She must help out
Does that mean he doesn't have the real - Motion to strike that from the record
Irrelevant, immaterial and immature - Irrelevant
Any parent has a right to a support system
'm not talking about the rights of the parent, 'm talking about the rights of a child
(the gavel bangs) 'm talking about entrusting an eight year old's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism, mental retardation
Objection
Motion to strike that from the record
It's clear that one's intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love
You Honor, would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity
Oh, 'm sensitive
'm real sensitive when  see people like you -- (the gavel
) come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else's
That's enough
Both lawyers approach the bench
(both approach) And  suppose tearing apart a family is truly noble work, Mr
Turner
That's it
fine you both for contempt
Two-hundred fifty dollars
What's that to her
She gets that for picking up the phone
Oh, that's what this is about
'll tell you what this is about
See this is an award for you at some luncheon
But 'm here everyday
(gavel  ) You win, you're out the door
But guess who  see come back
The kid
Most of the time, in less than a year
Only now it's too late
So you're right
'm real sensitive
You can't even touch that area
Devastated
: - Margaret Brown observes Sam and Lucy
But how did he prove it
Columbus had to sail around the world to prove it was round
You're so smart, Daddy
Sam shoots a look at Margaret
He hasn't heard anything nice about himself in so long
Lucy looks into her father's eyes
(') Are we winning, Daddy
Sam shoots  look
He doesn't want to lie
Lucy catches the look between Sam and Margaret
Excuse me, time's up
Please
Just a little more
have another client at two-thirty
You need to put your shoes on and get ready to go
Oh no
There's a knot
really big knot
Sam attempts to undo it
Lucy and he work very slowly, cherishing each moment together
'll help you
She undoes it quickly
Hands it back
need to go to the bathroom
- Lucy's feet dangle from under the stall
Margaret's sturdy shoes from under another
Suddenly, Lucy's head pops out and now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall, tip toes across the room and out the door
Locking it with a key
- Lucy runs up to her father
Daddy, she said we could go to the park
What's going on
What made her change her mind
started crying in the bathroom
She thought we needed more time
That was so nice of her
Very nice
- Sam and Lucy hold hands and look out the window
Sam sees Echo Park approaching and gets up
Lucy pulls him back to the seat
She looks Daddy in the eye and in a furtive whisper: Let's not get off
Let's keep going
No, Lucy
Please
That would be wrong
Tamara's Mommy lost her case and Tamara hasn't seen her in six years
She's had five different mommies and one of them hit her
won't let that happen
That's what her real mommy said
And now they won't even let her talk to her
Sam reels with confusion
Lucy buries herself in his chest
(') Daddy, it's the only way to be together
We'll start a new life, get new names
We'll live in a new apartment
They'll never find us
The bus has stopped
Passengers for the park have exited
Sam doesn't move
As the  closes the door and heads on, he holds Lucy protectively to his chest
love you Lucy
love you
My name isn't Lucy anymore, it's Michelle
- Lucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he gazes out at the passing highway, far from home
We hear the song "Michelle"
- 4
Sam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic tunnels and jungle gym
flashlight shines in Sam's face
Hey, buddy
No loitering
Move it
Not yet not yet not yet
You want me to get a black and white down here
He moves toward Sam
goes on
The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the middle of the park and getting totally wet
Not yet not yet not yet
He shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see where    on a bed of coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal
Jesus Christ
She hasn't been sleeping well
She needs a good night's rest
Let her sleep, let her sleep
(the cop moves toward Sam) What are you, crazy
All the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic tunnel
: - Police doors swing open as Rita, coat over pj's, a sleepy by her side, storm inside
Lucy lies on a bench with her head in Sam's lap
What were you thinking what were you possibly thinking
- That's ridiculous
Danny stay with me - (he moves away) What could you possibly gain by kidnapping your kid in the middle of a custody hearing
She - don't wanna hear it
Can you possibly explain this to me
But Lucy said - Who's the parent here
Who's the goddamned parent here
Danny
Stay in the hallway - Danny turns the corner just as Margaret Brown rushes in
Rita turns to her - her expression changes on a dime
(') Miss Brown,  can imagine what you're thinking
'm - But  ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain -- have seen - Their yearning for contact - wouldn't take them in an attempt to comfort them
Where the hell is Danny
You - He - There's - Oh yes there is
And if  were you 'd look at my conscience you do have one don't you long and hard before  tried to use this in court
Is that a threat
No
It's a plea
Give'm a break
Give'm one goddman break
Margaret's cell phone
What
No, Mrs
Sloan
His temperature couldn't be 117, no not even 107
Okay, okay, 'll come
Come on Lucy, 'll take you back
'mon, Danny
We're going home
Danny
Danny
The     and -- (') Goddamn it, Danny
Rita avoids Margaret's look
Margaret's cell phone goes off again
She doesn't answer
Now Rita looks at Margaret, but this time Margaret avoids looking at her
Lucy runs to Rita and throws her arms around her waist
Please don't fire us
It was all my idea
Please don't
Please
Please
Rita is disarmed
She's moved and not used to being moved
- the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God
Lucy's in her best dress, being sworn in
One hand in the air
So help me God
And now         ' -
- Lucy is on the stand, Turner is cross-examining her
heard you turned seven this year
That's pretty exciting
Everybody gets older
It's not that big a deal
What'd you get for your birthday
haven't opened my presents yet
Really
That's odd
Why not
Lucy looks to her father and Rita
opened my presents
got the album - limited edition
What is she doing
Oh, 'm sorry
was confused thought you didn't open your birthday presents because you ran away from your own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted
never said that; why would  say that
Why would your friends say it if you hadn't said it
Kids lie all the time
Next to her skirt, we see her fingers are crossed so hard they're practically turning purple
May  remind you Lucy that you're under oath
You may
And do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble
do
So now that you and  have agreed to tell the truth, where did you sleep last night
Rita glares at Margaret
Thanks a lot
In my bed at the Foster home
All right, Lucy
If you're not going to tell the truth,  am
Your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here
You're lying right now because you're afraid
Afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are
You're afraid of hurting him, but now we need to tell the truth
The truth is deep inside you know you're not getting what you need from your father
Isn't that right, Lucy
She stares at Turner defiantly
"All you need is love
" - as Sam and Rita walk out of the courtroom
Rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in her purse
They see Lucy running down the corridor toward Sam, Margaret Brown behind her
Daddy
did great, didn't
No, Lucy, you lied
Shhh
Don't tell anyone
Rita watches Sam
Moved by his concern as a parent
Lucy, Mrs
Kerry's here to take you back
thought you'd be proud of me
Jo Jo's mom told him to lie on the stand and say he never saw a needle in the house; and he did, and now they're back together
Jo Jo isn't us
The truth, the truth, when the judge hears the truth, he'll know, he'll know we should be together
(bursting) Nobody's interested in the truth, Daddy
Nobody cares
They lead her down the hallway toward Mrs
Kerry - Sam's voice gets louder and louder - determined to make her hear
'  - The darkness of Sam's apartment
We see him on his knees
Saying his prayers by his bedside
Help me, God
Help me, God
Help me, God
We see '  from the window of her apartment as it moves across the frame
- Turner cross examines George, the manager of Starbucks
Sam's my most reliable employee
He's never missed a day of work in eight years
Always warm, always friendly
Admirable qualities for a single father
Mr
Walker, in these eight years, have Mr
Dawson's responsibilities, which
let me see
would include bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n Lows, and sweeping up the place
increased
No
Not really
And isn't that because he's mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee
Objection
Leading the witness
You may answer the question
George searches for a way to tell the truth
Well as a matter of fact, Sam and  have been discussing a promotion that  was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week
Sam leaps to his feet
Oh boy
Thank you, George
Rita pulls him down
Turner seizes the moment
Yes
Thank you, George
Now, after eight years, Sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water
Now, he must certainly be able to help Lucy with her geometry
Objection - No further questions
- Rita prepares Ifty
and when  ask another question
answer in one sentence
Yes
Short and sweet
Yes
One sentence
Short and sweet
My aunt was short and sweet
But her cooking was too spicy she
Rita's twitching foot knocks over her purse
Out spill several Snickers Bars with the chocolate picked off them
Embarrassed, she kneels to pick them up when she and Sam see something that stops them both, awestruck
In the corner of the corridor, huddled on a bench in dark sunglasses, sits Sam runs to her
Annie
can't believe it
(visibly trembling) Tell them to take me quickly
Give me one minute with the judge
- Annie, wearing her dark glasses, is being questioned by Rita
Besides being Lucy's godmother, aren't you also Lucy's piano teacher
Yes
Lucy's very lucky
Didn't you graduate Magna Cum Laud from the Julliard School of Music
Summa Cum Laud
(delighted) Excuse me
Now Ms
Cassell, in all the time you've known them, have you ever questioned Sam's ability as a father
Never
Never
Never
Look at Lucy
She's strong, she's able to display true empathy for people, all kinds of people
know you all think she's as bright as she is despite him
But it's because of him
: - Turner stands where Rita did
Can Sam add
Yes
How about multiplication
He's learning
So what you're saying is that Sam can not even multiply two times two
don't know about you, Mr
Turner, but my fondest memories of my parents have nothing to do with times tables or state capitals
bet he's knocking on your door all the time with questions
Yes
All the time
The last question was whether to use Biz or Clorox to get the grass stains out of Lucy's soccer uniform
This is too good to be true
So let's see
he doesn't know math
he can't even wash her clothes
How about puberty
can only imagine how much insight he'll bring to approaching the sensitive issues of a young girl's development
Mr
Turner, show me a father, any father, who knows how to do that and 'll give them the Parent of the Year award
And you've had plenty of opportunity to observe fathers, haven't you
Objection
But the fact that Ms
Cassell hasn't come out of her room in years might have some effect on her perception
'll allow it
had twenty eight years in the world to observe all kinds of fathers
What about your father, Ms
Cassell
Since you appear to be an expert on father-daughter relationships
long pause
Sam watches as Annie visibly tightens
(') Excuse me, Ms
Cassell,  didn't hear your response
What about your father
Annie reaches for her water glass
We see her hand
It knocks over the glass, shattering it on the floor
Objection
No further questions
Excuse me, Mr
Dawson
said that's enough
will not allow it
Overruled
Overruled
Rita doesn't stop him
The Judge hesitates, incredulous, then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts
'  - Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam
Annie is curled into a tight ball in the passenger seat
Sam is tucked into the shelf in the back
His legs kick Rita in the face with every gear shift
Thank you again, Annie
You were truly extraordinary
Extraordinary
Truly extraordinary
Annie doesn't move
Okay okay okay okay
Well, Sam has his big day on the stand tomorrow and we need to work a little bit so that he's as effective as you were
Effective
Very effective
On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle is a little hidden by that thingamajig, so if you're having a hard time finding it 'll just -- Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she
Noooooooo
Annie's not quite ready to go outside yet
Okay, we'll just take our time
- It's dark now
Annie is still catatonic
Rita's on the car phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling
Home
Home
Juanita, help Danny with his English assignment
Ayude Danny un story
story
(rising from the dead) 'm ready now
(gently) Good, fine, Sam
Annie's ready
Sam's fallen asleep
'     - Rita and Sam enter
'    - Sam is awestruck at the magnificent home
Okay okay okay okay
We'll work in the library
It's down the hall and to the left
They pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of the wide-screen  watching
(') Hey, Danny
(no answer) Where's your father
(staring at ) Guess
don't want to guess
Where is he
(Sam watches Rita) told you  don't want to guess
Well where was he last night
Working late
There you guessed it
He said he was working late
That's what he said
Well who did he say was taking care of you
You
But you said you were working late
am working late
Then go work
How was your day
You have to work
Go work
No
How was your - Her   goes off
Rita moves into the hallway to answer her phone
Sam moves into the den, sits on the couch, the sound of Rita arguing with her husband drifts into the room
Sam looks sideways at Danny who remains stonefaced
This is my favorite part
Hey Dommy, this one looks like he's suffering from shell shock
Boy  guess we can shell it out
It was a shell of a good hit
Rita stands in the doorway watching Sam have a longer conversation with her son than she's had in months
She retreats
'  - Danny and Sam eat popcorn watching the movie
(bellowing) "Turtles in the half-shell, turtle power
"  Rita
Come this is the best part
He heads towards Rita
- In the half-light Sam catches a glimpse of Rita standing in the pantry unconsciously stuffing marshmallows into her mouth
Their eyes lock for a moment
You eat too fast
Come watch the movie
It's getting late
We have to get to work
(handing him a suit) This is my husband's
He won't notice
He's got ten more just like it
Try it on
'  - Sam comes out of the bathroom in the new suit
Rita stares at him astonished
He looks incredibly handsome
Rita, attempting to stifle her reaction, turns away from Sam
Bad
No
Very, very good
But your tie's crooked
Rita stands behind Sam with her around him showing him how to do his tie properly
Their images are reflected in the mirror
(') Cross over once
Loop it around on the inside of your neck
(her hand grazes his neck) Slide the other side through the loop, then tighten
Rita comes around to the front and straightens and tightens the tie
They are both nervous
The room is charged
(') Okay okay okay okay
Our strategy is that we're aggressively pursuing a support system
'm going to ask you h ow are you prepared to help Lucy in school
Let me see let me see let me see
Sam
told you you have to stop that
It makes you look stupid
Okay okay okay
Try again
(endless pause) You say you will find her a tutor
Then say, "How will you pay for it
" Could you slow down
Why do you eat so fast
(ignoring him) We've gone over this a million times
You've found a free tutoring service for her at the
But  didn't
You did
Can't you grasp the concept of manipulating the truth
Not lying
Just a little tweak here and there
No
You're so lucky
You get to play with Danny all the time
He doesn't want to play with me
Yes he does
He does he does
He thinks you don't want to
Oh that's ridiculous of course  want to
Tweak, tweak
(exploding) drove around after work yesterday 'til 9:30 looking for a goddman razor scooter
(in his own world) Tweak, squeak, peek peek
Rita shifts uneasily, embarrassed by her overreaction
'  - Okay, why did you harass that young boy at your home
You know  didn't harass him, Rita
You know that, you know that
Sam, 'm pretending to be Mr
Turner, remember
Okay
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
didn't harass him, Mr
Turner
Mr
Turner - (Sam can't keep a straight face) You don't look like him
That's a blessing
You're so much prettier
(suddenly shy) Thank you
Now
What makes you think you can take care of a woman -  mean a young child - when you have a hard time taking care of yourself
'  - Rita is relentless
Sam is exhausted but determined
But who are you kidding
Isn't Lucy already smarter than you
In some ways
But in other ways, she's not,  think
You think
think
Sam
You've got to be firm on this
think in other ways 'm smarter than her
Smarter than you are, Mr
Turner
In fact, in some ways 'm smarter than you, Judge McNeilly
Whoa
Bring it down
What parent doesn't want more for their child
To be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them
Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when she's a baby, but once she loses respect for you, what will you do
(fierce) won't let that happen
won't
How can you say that
Respect is not just about how smart someone is
Smart is not just about how smart someone is
But what about Lucy
Aren't you being selfish
Doesn't she deserve a better life
Don't you think she's just pretending she's happy to not hurt your feelings
Sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger
Lucy is happy
We have fun
We go to Denny's, we go to video night
know how to love her
know 'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person, but  know how to love
know how to be her father, Mr
Turner
By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion
Rita is unexpectedly near tears
Suddenly before she knows it, she is
The room charged
She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man
know you do, Sam
know you do
- Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit
You look great, Sam
What time do you have to be in court
Half day, half day
take the stand at two
George leads him behind the counter
Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines
Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non fat
Sprinkles or Cinnamon
- 11:00
Sam is doing great
He's humming as he prepares a triple latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker
- 12:00
The place is packed, including a
Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while glancing up at the clock
Sam hands three cups to customers, the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out
takes a sip and
What is this
ordered an Americano, not a latte
Americano, Americano, not a latte
Working as fast as he can but still   , Sam unconsciously drinks the latte
- 12:45
Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess
Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild
Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns it
mint mocha frappuccino   in the face
At that moment, George comes out of his office
'm going to be late
'm going to be late
'll call a taxi
No, no,  can't wait
can't wait
've got to go right now
Sam heads out, the coffee drink still dripping from his face
- Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street out of his mind
Cars are jammed up
He walks over them, a man possessed
- Everyone is in their places, waiting
Your Honor, if the defendant doesn't have enough interest in his daughter to even show up - Your Honor, 'm sure he'll be here any moment
This is an extremely important day to Mr
Dawson
At  , Sam bursts through the doors
Suit stained, hair sticky with frappuccino
Rita's jaw drops
(') Your Honor, may  have a moment with my client
Make it brief, Ms
Harrison
Rita heads towards Sam
Up close, he looks even worse
What the hell happened
(sniffing the air) What is that smell
Mint
Sam, determined, heads for the stand
Rita grabs Sam's shoulders and tries to focus him
Looks deep into his eyes
(') Sam, look at me
Look at me
(he does) will guide you like last night
(Sam hugs her) Not that part of last night, the other part
Now you can do it
know you can
Lucy needs you
(a mile a minute) Lucy needs me
Yes, slow down because Lucy needs you
Lucy needs you
Ms
Harrison
We need you
- Sam, on the stand, talks a mile a minute from the coffee
How will you be able to pay for private tutoring
There's a free program at the
Lucy can go there
But don't you ever think it would be better for Lucy if she lived with a permanent foster family and you could visit whenever you wanted
The Fosters don't know her
Why can't she live with me and they can come visit if they want to
'm firm on this
And 'm getting firmer
Lucy belongs with me
Why
Sam puts his finger to his chin and starts his "Let me see
" Rita gives him a look; he lowers his finger and starts talking very fast from the coffee
The desperately tries to keep pace
Paul wrote the first part of the song "Michelle"
He said to John, "Where do go from here
"  John had been listening to Nina Simone
There was a line in it that went something like, " love you,  love you,  love you
" They put that into the song
It wouldn't be the same song without that
It made the song complete
That's why the whole world cried when they broke up on April 10, 1970
Well, he has some kind of point
, the Stenographer, is still typing
Did you get that, Mary
- Turner fires questions at Sam - a mile a minute
When you were Lucy's age, were you living at home
No
Were you living with your mother and father
No
Well then where were you living
(very quietly) In an institution
So your parents put you in an institution
Only after my mom got sick
What about your father
Where was he
Gone with the wind when Sam was born
So, you weren't raised by your mother
saw her  saw her
When
Christmas, Easter and my birthday
Oh, once a year on your birthday
So in a way, the people at the institution were your parents
Were they nice to you
Some yes
Some on
Some yes
Did they hit you
Sometimes
Sometimes they did sometimes
Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her birthday party
Objection
Nobody hit anybody
Let me rephrase that, strong-armed
So what role model do you call upon as a father when you're parenting Lucy
The head of the institution
The Principal the warden
No
Not Mr
Whitehead
Not him
Then who
Myself
you have the mental capacity of a seven year old
So you ask yourself, a seven year old - am not a seven-year old
How to parent a fellow seven-year old
Yes
No
What was the question
The question is: what makes you think you can be a parent
Your background
Your
Your friends who can't even testify for you
Objection - My friends - Objection - My friends love Lucy even if Rita thought they weren't smart enough to testify
Even if she said you'd wipe the floor with them
Trying to telepathically reach Sam
Excuse me, Mr
Dawson, your lawyer just objected; that means you didn't have to answer the question
You can't even follow the simple rules you've watched here day after day
You really think you can raise a seven-year old
ten year old
thirteen-year old
(in his face) That means she'll be six years more advanced than you
Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar
He searches for words
Then from the clearest place inside himself: 've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent
It has to do with constancy
It has to do with patience
It has to do with listening
To pretending to listen when you can't even listen anymore
The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence
Rita's amazed
(') It has to do with love, like she says
Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she
" (') And  don't know where it's written that a woman has a corner on that market, that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman
Billy has a home with me
It's not perfect
'm not a perfect parent
Sometimes  forget he's just a little kid
(whispers from the courtroom) We built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that, it may be irrep, irrep, irrep
Irreparable
All eyes  to the back of the room
Ifty is there trying with all his might to help his friend
(') Joanne, don't do that, please
Don't do it twice, not to him
Then Meryl Streep can't even look at Dustin Hoffman after that
Right, "Kramer vs
Kramer
"  Thank you for the commentary, Mr
Bhutto
It's hard to find words isn't it, Mr
Dawson
It's confusing
It's confusing to know what to say to Lucy half the time, isn't it
Mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything Turner's saying, Sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom
Rita, stunned and incredulous; Turner and his associate smirking at him; Ifty, shaking his head; Robert, his face in his hands; Miss Wright, Margaret Brown, the State's Expert, almost willing him to fail
Are they right
Are they
No, yes, no
No what
Let me see let me see let me see
You don't know what
Yes
Yes
You're right, you don't know
You don't know enough to really raise your daughter
Objection
These aren't questions, these are attacks
(frantic) am Lucy's father
Are you
Are you really
'm not talking about the fact that you got some homeless woman pregnant
Objection your Honor
motion a recess
Denied
Get to the question, Mr
Turner
The question is if you love your daughter as much as they say you do don't you think she deserves more
Don't you
In your heart of hearts, secretly question yourself every day
Don't you
Yes
Was that a "yes
" Objection
Yes
She does
She deserves everything
In my heart of hearts
Yes she does
And you agree with everyone, you can't give her that
(in unbearable pain) Maybe
Maybe everybody's right
There
He got it
Anguished
Watching Sam unravel as he stands up and starts walking around in a circle in the witness box
(') No more no more
Let it stop
No more
No more
No more
The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned
The verdict is obvious
Sam has passed judgement on himself
- Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward Margaret Brown's office
Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam both see - Sitting, hopeful on the bench
She searches Sam's face for the verdict
The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she knows
She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest
No Daddy
No Daddy
No Daddy
In a    , they hold each other in the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit
The only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the background
Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy
'mon, Lucy
It's time to say goodbye
Don't let go don't let go don't let go - Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each other
With such fierce love; a parent and a child
(') Don't let them Daddy don't let them
Don't ever let me go
He can't let her go
That he can't do
Margaret, steel herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done this
Please help me
Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head,
Now, Margaret literally has to wrench Lucy away from her father's arms
Lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway
Sam is frozen in incalculable pain
'   - We hear "Fool on the Hill"
We follow a trail of melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a Suddenly, the needle   across the record, followed by a mysterious  against the wall
'  - The   to the
Inside, the lights are dim
Lucy's   , ghostlike
Sam, curled into a ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over again against the wall, overcome with grief
'  - '  - The   as we see Rita standing in the doorway, watching her sleeping child
This stranger that she's raised
She moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees   tucked under his arm
She tucks them both in, tenderly
- Saturday in idyllic suburbia
Sam, directions and a map in his hands, tentatively rounds the corner
small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops -    -- Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress
She stands on the front porch with , who wears a red smock and is setting up
There's a tiny chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her
The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with her
Your teacher told me you were an artist
You wear too much perfume
You're trying too hard
am, aren't
Maybe you could teach me how to paint
My daddy's coming today
We're going to open my birthday presents
Why don't you just go do something
From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything she deserves
He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand - feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing
Puts them in his bouquet
Then stops
Feels guilty
Tries to put the flowers
He stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away
Lucy sits on the steps
Randy sits right next to her
Where he  standing, but is now
The flowers lay in the dirt
From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits
And waits
And waits
- It's Saturday
The place is buzzing
Sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his parents
Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee, could you clean this up
Sam sees a  at a table covered with spilled coffee
(') said  need a refill and a towel over here
(snapping) You need a towel
refill
glass of water
You need more than you already have
You have everything - (all his fury and frustration) Everything
But it's not enough
Take my daughter, too
Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he backs into a shelf of  he so carefully arranged
They onto the floor
: - Paints and brushes go  across the porch as Lucy Totally out of control
You gave him the wrong address
You're hiding me from him
As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her
- Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch
Her eyes swollen from crying
Finally, she gets up and moves to the tiny chair that Randy put out for her
Straightens the easel and begins to paint
The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her face and hair
Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint
Randy and Lucy paint in silence for a long time
Then - You're going to send me away now, aren't you
(tenderly) No
We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song "Here, There and Everywhere
" '  - We see  sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays with one finger
, as  and , we see '  at the  - : - With Lucy and Randy's hands as they  side by side to Sam's sad melody
Lucy's pictures start , angular with blacks and blues, then  soften and the dark figures recede
By the , there is a  of the red of Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture
'  - We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself serenading no one
'  - We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the birthday presents
They look close, almost like a mother and daughter
Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's present and we see a stack of   '
Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift in
Randy picks up one of Lucy's pictures and moves to the wall
(') You know, this wall really needs something special on it
Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the Denny's napkins into an origami bird
Then crushes it
Then cautiously: What's the longest any one of those kids stayed with you
Megan stayed a little over a year
(averting her eyes) Did you ever want any of them to stay longer
Moved herself
Understanding how huge a question this is coming from this bruised little heart
'  -   - Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into an odd origami pattern
There's a knock at the door - Sam doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper
(
) Sam it's me
Open up
He doesn't answer it, just methodically folds
'  - Rita stands there impatiently
don't have time for this
You were supposed to show up for your first evaluation
And  leave work early to get there and where the hell are you
Open the door
Sam
Open the goddamn door
(nothing) Alright
If you don't care enough to open the goddamn door 'm outta here
've ruined my practice, 've alienated my colleagues -  sent my kid off on a fishing trip with his father so  could work with you and you won't open your goddman door for me
Fine
'
've had enough
She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with the mastery of a karate black belt -    the door down
'  - Rita bursts through the door and then stops
Sam has created an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together
fortress against the world
He keeps folding - doesn't even look at Rita
He's more far gone than she could imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on it
Sam, it's Rita
Can  come in
No room
No room
Hey
lived in the East Village don't need a lot of room
Sam makes life too hard
Sam makes life too hard on everyone
Sam,  can go at least nine more rounds
But you gotta let me in
Please Sam
Please
He pulls out one small brick of origami, opening a window
(') Thank you
Now  can see your kind eyes
George told me you needed a break from work
don't want to work there anymore
Too many people
Maybe we could find you a quieter job
Because remember one of the judges conditions is you have to earn more money; you've got to keep earning more money for when we get you Lucy back
Lucy doesn't need me anymore
She has a new family
She doesn't need me anymore
Is that what she said
She didn't have to say it
may be stupid, but  know
know
Well that's the first stupid thing 've ever heard you say
Sam looks at her through the window
in the wall
(') Sam, Sam you can get her back
The court favors reunification
The only thing that can block you is if the foster family petitions to adopt
And from what 've heard, Lucy's making their life miserable - that's our girl
Sam, fight for her
tried
tried
Try harder
You don't know
You don't know
don't know
You don't know what it is to try and try and never get there
You were born perfect, perfect
Is that right
Everyone else is perfect but only Sam feels loss and pain
That's right
People like you don't know
People like me
People like you don't know, don't know what hurt feels like, people like you don't feel, don't feel anything
She slaps him
, he slaps her back
, she slaps him again
She rips the newspaper wall down
You think you got the market cornered on human suffering
Well let me tell you something about "People like me
" People like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable
People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me,  try too hard and  push and he knows it and  talk in that voice, that voice  promised 'd never use, and 've screamed, 've screamed horrible things to him, a five year-old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and  hate him then
know 'm failing you,  know 'm disappointing you,  know you deserve better but get in the fucking car
It's like every morning  wake up and fail, and  look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow  can't
And  know,  know  have everything, and 'm still miserable and it's pathetic
know it's pathetic
No matter how hard  try, something about me will never be enough
She's crying too hard to continue
He pulls her to him
Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him tightly
He whispers in her ear
You're enough
You're so much more than enough
He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity
And staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling
He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes, her tears
And something ignites between them - something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache
(') Lovely Rita
On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together, whole again
'  - Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by , all shapes, all sizes
He heads up the walkway to Randy's house
She comes out of the house and shuts the door behind her, stopping him
You're early
All the lights were green
There's a reason for the court schedule
You stopped showing up
Lucy has had to rebuild her life
want her back
can do it
know can
That's not up to me, but 'm telling you,  will do everything in my power to prevent Lucy from getting hurt again
Sam hangs his head
dog barks at Randy
(') Whose dogs are these
Supplemental income supplemental income - bathe, walk and feed
Sam Dawson meets your canine needs
(to dogs) Sit
Sit
Sit
Sit
Sit
Sit
All the dogs sit but a
Randy heads into the house
The front door opens and Lucy comes out
She runs down the stares to Sam
Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her
She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent up fury
You never came
You never even called
You forgot about me
How could you forget me
never forgot you
forgot me
(') hate you  hate you  hate you
Lucy pulls away
long charged silence
Lucy refusing to even look at her father
(') Lucy,  tried to write you a letter last night
(') Gesundheit, Buster
Buster has a cold
But the letter had too many big words
Pokey, sit
The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers
Lucy stares forward
Sam speaks tentatively, carefully: (') Dear Lucy
Pokey sit
Dear Lucy, 'm sorry that  hurt you
Every moment of the day  thought about you
Lucy in the hammock, Lucy at school
Lucy in the sky
Daddy
love you, recorded September 11th, the day you took your first step
Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time
' - Rows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's in the peas
hand comes into frame and carefully places the tomato just so, in the tomato bin
Now it moves to the olives
Shouldn't all the pimentos be facing up
To reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their plates
Napa cabbage, excellent choice
Purple and green, purple and green
Very rich in Vitamin
Good choice
Very good choice
-  - Sam walks toward the courtroom when we see Rita approaching from the other end of the hall
They both slow down when they see each other
Rita unconsciously fixes her hair
Sam adjusts his tie
Hello, Sam
Mr
Dawson
Sam
Dawson
Hello, lawyer
They almost shake hands - realize that means touching each other and don't
Rita motions toward the door
Shall we
No
We already did
Don't tell anybody
They nervously walk through the door, bumping into each other
- She's very aware of Sam
He looks away, over compensating obviously
Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her eyes
She attempts to put it in place
Furthermore, my client has found a new job, and is making every effort to find a bigger apartment so that - Rita's hair falls in her eyes again
Sam stands up, pulls from his pocket, the one she left at his house
Here
Rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon
Oh, thank you
What a
a lovely barrette, Mr
Dawson
It will look great on Lucy
Who 'm sure you bought it for
Furthermore, so that
there will be more room for Lucy as she grows up
All of that is well and good but the fact that Mr
Dawson quite his job, missed his hearing, and did not even show up for his visits with his daughter
The fact that my client went through profound depression is the most natural reaction any parent could have
But once again he had no idea how his behavior during that depression impacted on his daughter
In these next months, Mr
Dawson will be expanding his support system to include Social Service programs, tutors -- It's too late
The foster family is petitioning the court for sole custody of Lucy and  fully support their request
Sam turns to Rita
This can't be happening
' - Sam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth
With one extra person, it's a little tight
Rita picks at her Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at hand
Isn't it illegal
It's illegal to go through stop signs
It's illegal to cross on the red
It's not illegal
It's very complicated
When a strong foster parent lobbies for a child it changes the equation
They're reaching right through Sam as if he doesn't exist
As if he's a ghost
There's one option we've never talked about, Sam
(very carefully) know what you went through the last time you took the stand
We could settle out of court, ask for the most incredible visitation rights - it would almost seem like joint custody
You're saying  don't have a chance
That's what you're saying
'm not saying you don't have a chance
That's what you said last time and look where he is now
Stop
Rita's not saying  don't have a chance
Are you
Tell me  have a chance
Too long a pause
Ifty looks at the clock
Oh my God
6:35 is Video Night at my house and 'm not even there
If we get there before you do we'll wait for you - check
Sam get your dessert to go
This is very hard to say
'm having my dessert here
With Rita
'm not coming to video night
Devastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their things
Sam - if you want to go
said no, Rita
know, but if you - What
Do you want me to go
didn't say that
But do you want to go
Where
Nevermind
Fine
Fine
,  & Fine
They leave in a huff
The  delivers the check with dessert and coffee
've got it
've got it
Long pause
Rita slowly eats her pie
(') It's good to chew
You're eating more slowly
Rita laughs and nods
(') Coconut Rhubarb
Sidebar, we need to talk
Sidebar
(carefully) Yes we do
need to get Lucy back
We need, we need - to be professional
Do you know what that means
When dealing with Starbucks' customers, be friendly but not familiar
can be your friend
(oddly touched) Thank you, Sam
You need to leave your husband
(her armor up again) Oh, my marriage isn't so bad
'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend
' (undone) It's just
it's just that
've never lost anything
- Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school
We follow Lucy - suddenly a      and It's an
She looks around - but doesn't see Sam anywhere
But she feels him
She walks toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches
There
They made contact
'  - It's later that week
Lucy walks proudly down the street in a   , selling cookies
Randy is by her side, beaming
We've made $22
36
That's seven dollars, 64 cents less than thirty
Well that's one way of looking at it
'  - as they move through the neighborhood
Finally we see her bound up the steps to an apartment building
She knocks on the door
It opens - and Lucy and Randy's Sam stands there
Holding three kittens
see various dogs in arm chairs, the couch
Daddy
What are you doing here
live here
This is where  live
This is where you live
So close to me
wanted to be close to you
wanted to be closer
Look at my apartment number
(it's number 9) John was born on October 9th
His son was born on October 9th
John met Yoko on November 9th
His mother lived at 9 Newcastle, Liverpool
Newcastle
9 letters
Liverpool - 9 letters
Lucy, give me one minute with your father
Sam,  consider myself an understanding person but  don't understand this
You can't close the distance between you and Lucy with a new address
We go to court in a week - don't want to spend half my visit with Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy don't want to waste one more minute
Buster sneezes
(from the doorway) Does Buster still have his cold
He's better, much better
Now 'll have one box of mint chocolate cookies
That'll be three-eighty six
& (in unison) Let me see let me see let me see
That's one dollar and 14 cents less than five
Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe
- From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs
'  - 2
Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep
Staring at the little origami bird on her window sill
She moves it, opens the window wide, quickly takes Mr
Jeeters - and within a moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree
- "The night grows teeth
" stray dogs fight over garbage - a wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy in her pj's
Mr
Jeeters tucked under her arm
Lucy crosses the street
the screeching of tires
- We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly we make out a figure climbing higher and higher
It's Lucy
We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign across the street blinks on and off
'  - Sam's asleep
Suddenly his eyes open wide
And like an animal sensing danger, he gets up
We    of something He rushes to his window and looks to see -- ' Lucy climbing the fire escape
Sam opens the window and reaches for her
Lucy Lucy
What are you doing
You could have really hurt yourself
What are you doing
couldn't sleep
Daddy, did you know that Warren
Harding was the twenty ninth President of the United States
No
Remember - the twenty-ninth President
In case the Judge asks
'  - Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms
He turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house
He knocks on the door
Finally the door opens and we see Randy and Bill in their pajamas  at seeing Sam and Lucy
She couldn't sleep
Give me my daugh - (she stops herself) Give me - 'll take Lucy
Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three times, tell her two stories and give her half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a third of a glass of milk she'll sleep
Good night
Randy and , her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on the quiet street
3:00
-- - Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street
'  - Lucy knocks on Sam's window
- Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house
'  - Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill
- Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house
'  - Until , we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house looking out the windows, which have now been completely covered with
Her room is filled with origami birds from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift
Lucy gets out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly opening the door
-     - We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs
She gets to the front door
It's been where she cannot reach it
From the darkness we hear -- (tenderly) Lucy
Come here
Randy sits in the darkness, next to a and a   '
(') made us a midnight snack
Lucy stares at the muffin and milk
Torn
(') understand that you want to see your daddy
And  don't want to keep you from him
honestly don't
So you tell me when you want to see him
You can see him anytime you want
But we have to arrange it first
Do you understand
(Lucy nods) Now would you like a snack
Lucy nods
Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch
But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy
Thank you
Goodnight
(words caught in her throat) Goodnight, Lucy
'  - We     and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there, looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit
My husband left this when he moved out
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
(entering) Nice place
worry
worry sometimes
You worry you did the wrong thing
worry that 've gotten more out of this relationship than you
No no no
'm the lucky one
have the lawyer that never loses
(covering) That's me
okay, let me see, let me see, let me see
(pulls out notes) They're going to put Bill and Randy on the stand first and then you
Them first, then me
They're a nice couple
They have a nice house
She's pretty
She's smart, too
can tell
The manager of the salad bar is gonna testify, isn't he
That will help us
For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam overwhelms her
Absolutely
Nobody believed that George Harrison could really be a song writer
But he wrote "Here Comes the Sun"
John and Paul said it was one of the best songs on
(tenderly) George was always my favorite Beatle
Lucy's was Paul
'  - 2
Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something
She opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her
Now
What honey
Now
want to see him now
'  - 3:30
We see Sam sleeping in bed
There's a  at the door
Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers
We see that he's wearing the Armani suit
Sam opens the door to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her arms
She fell asleep on the car ride over was gonna turn back and tuck her in to her bed
with the pink canopy
and the quilt  made
But  was afraid she'd wake up at our house
(fighting the ache in her soul) and want to come home
Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion
(') was gonna tell the judge that  could give Lucy the kind of love she never had
But  would be lying
hope  hope  hope that you're saying what  think you're saying even though you're not saying it
Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong arms
For a moment they    between them in the most unique embrace
Randy finally lets go and struggles to say goodbye
Goodnight
'll see you in court
Save me a seat
on your side
Randy walks away
Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in his arms
Then, from a very brave place: Randy
If  tell you  can't do it alone, will you tell the judge
(turns gently) No
Promise
Promise
've looked and looked for a mother for Lucy
Help,  need someone, help, not just anyone
You're the red in Lucy's painting
So unexpectedly bonded to them both
- glorious sunny day
Lucy and her team are in the middle of a fierce game
foul is called when we hear - Penalty
Rules broken
Penalty, please
Sam, wearing a  and whistle around his neck, walking his inimitable walk, races up the field,
Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers
Robert, in sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him
Brad follows around an attractive   as close as he can get to her
Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill
They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride
Lucy and a kid named  go after the ball
Get her
Phillip, you get her
saw that
You gave him a secret signal
Didn't you
Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls are round - on sale at Kmart
The earth is a ball, too
Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he can
Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over
Penalty
Repeat
Rules broken
Penalty
(
) Penalty
Sue him
Kick his ass outta the game
It's
With Danny - hollering from the stands
Looks over at her father
Sam does every coaching gesture, and referee hand signal from every sport known to man
It looks like a bizarre
She does it right back at him
Their secret code
The code that will bind them for the rest of their lives
All watching
What the hell was that
Sam blows his whistle
Play ball
Play ball
The game heats up
Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed toward the goal
Sam is running right alongside them, so excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and intercepts the ball
Sam runs valiantly down the field with it
We hear "Here Comes the Sun"
Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter
Little darlin', it feels like years since you've been here
Here comes the Sun
Here comes the sun
And  say, "It's alright
" And the
