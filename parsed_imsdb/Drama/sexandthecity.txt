Big looks over at her
She shrugs

It's more than you were looking to pay
How much more

Carrie starts giggling
Big looks over to the agents
Must be the altitude
Big smiles
Carrie laughs as the Agent walks on
And across the rooftop terrace --- What --   Nirvana
Your wife has quite a sense of humor
(Cool/quick) They're not married
No, he's my boyfriend
This way
The agent and Carol start out across the terrace
Big and Carrie follow lagging a little behind
Aren't  a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend
Point taken
From now on
you'll be my man friend
Sounds like a dog
Well, if the shoe fits

She gives him a look
He swats her ass, gently as they go

Beautiful light as well
And this is the master bedroom
Hideous
Hate it
Hurts my eyes
Big laughs, Carrie walks around taking it in
(') How is this place even available
Nasty divorce
If you live here what is there to fight about
Carrie opens the closet door
It is very small
(') This is the master closet
No
Yes
Small for a room this size know
Hmmm
Hmmm
Now,  understand the divorce

Carrie looks at him; aghast
He smiles
(') Welcome home, baby
Can we afford this

Carrie screams with joy and shock
He laughs, thrilled
17
/'   --  --  17 Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte walk down the street
" got it
" Just like that
" got it" -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something
It sounds perfect
Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but  don't know about that `cause  keep sweaters in my stove
Carrie and Charlotte laugh
So, he bought it -- and you're going to live there with him
Yes, together
That's right
But he'll own it
So
You are keeping your own place, right
Oh, Miranda, please,  haven't figured out all the details yet, but 'm a smart girl and 'm sure 'll figure out something 'm comfortable with
just want to make sure you're being smart here -- And  love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what want you to feel
Jealous
Miranda smiles
Carrie puts her arm around her

(') Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan
Fine
'm jealous
You're in real estate heaven and 'm in Brooklyn
New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan
Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn
There she is
Hey Hollywood

She waves to them -- as she finishes a call

Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte page through the catalogues as they walk
Miranda types on her Blackberry
(

An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy
The girls stop
Floating in a case at their eye level is a unique, "two finger"   made out of diamonds
There it is
My baby
/ And she's a beauty
When  saw this in the catalogue said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me
One of a kind, filled with fire
And a little too much
Exactly
Come on
Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money
They make their way to the auction room
Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series
Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon
He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital
11
Great
Can't wait
Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women
No,  think it's hot
Sometimes, when 'm alone,  masturbate right along with them
And people say the golden age of television is over
Besides, it's fake sex
When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on
Kinda like Steve and
Miranda laughs
Everyone looks

(Beat; then) But come one-- it's been seven years
He does that,  do this
It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up

Isn't it
They look over at her
(') thought it was just sad for me `cause  know her
But it's really sad, huh
And it's funny cause they were so happy
Till they weren't know, right
We all told her to get married -- but she didn't want to push him
He'd been married three other times
So, she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out
She didn't even have anywhere to live
After ten years
Such a shame
She was a smart girl till she fell in love
Carrie catches Miranda's eye in the mirror, looks away

The creatures are ready
Just gonna sit there
'm not sitting, 'm thinking
Here
Husk and think

He winks -- puts two ears of corn in front of her, then starts chopping tomatoes
'm thinking 'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth
Why
You love your place
know but -- But what
We're together ever night -- so 'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet
You write there
It's your office
There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides
want to make us -- a life there
want it to be ours
It is ours
bought it for us
And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place
And -- if anything were to happen
What's going to happen

this home that built

And you know what happens when people assume
They make an ass out of who
You and me
He smiles
She smiles
Chop

Why -- Do you want to get married
Well,  wouldn't mind be married to you
Would you mind being married to me

So
Okay
Okay
Really
We're getting married

(Beat) Should we get you a diamond
No, please, don't get me a diamond
(Beat; then) Get me a really big closet

Oh, honey

So
Last week, after the auction, started thinking about my options
Right
Right, and

Really
Yes
That's great

You sounded more excited about the botox

So,  put you in my "we're never getting married" file
Now, 've got to take you out of that file
Sorry about the extra paper work
You'll get my bill

No cliche romantic kneeling down on one knee
Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together
20
Well, 'm happy for you
And one more thing
want you to be maid of honor
How do you feel about that
The same way you feel about Botox

"The bride wore a dress by no one

According to a certain trashy tome, you are marrying John James Preston

It will be a sensation
We're calling it: "The Last Single Girl

thought the issue was "great style at every age
" Style yes

(smiles; then) Enid --  have no idea -- were you ever married
Briefly
In 1975

Steve is sitting at the kitchen table
While  run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone

He looks strange
(') What's the matter
Steve
He starts crying
--  had sex with someone else
43
Miranda can't believe her ears
(') -- And you are so amazing with Ma and everything
everything you do and  can't believe  would do that to you
Miranda just sits -- looking at him
(') You and  hadn't had sex in a really long time and  -- Miranda shakes her head, turns and walks out of the kitchen
He gets up and follows her
(') It didn't mean anything -- It was just once
and it's been killing me
She stops and turns around
He stops
It's killing you
She starts down the hall again
He's on her heels

wasn't thinking
Do not follow me

Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are having   brunch at a table nearby
Yes, it's sad, but 'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while  look for a place
Pass the salt
Charlotte passes the salt
(') Plus,  have to be downtown and close to Brooklyn
We're going to keep things as normal for Brady as we can
'll pick him up on my days
take him over on Steve's
46
don't know if this question is allowed -- but how is Steve handling this
Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him
(beat) Not going to happen
can barely even look at him
Steve --  can't believe it
That's what  said
Miranda, honey -- are you sure you want to do this
It's just one time
Anyone can have a slip
Well, even if  could get my head around that justification -- it's the cheating part -- the behind my back part
the violation of the trust -- that's the thing that's killing me
Samantha nods, taking it in
(') Besides
women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own
And that's not me --  can handle it
Always could
Brady walks over holding an action figure
Mommy,  want to go home
Miranda nods; keeping a brave face
Charlotte looks upset

It's a little quick to move out, don't you think
Her reaction is her reaction
Thanks Anaka
Anaka nods and walks away
He had sex once
Not even an affair
Maybe it's not the sex
Maybe, it's the cheating
For me
that would be the thing
That it happened behind my back
That's what she said
He nods
Samantha eats
Thinks
Look
know we're not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else
Long pause
He looks at her
Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook
46B
(beat; then) But
seriously, 'd rather know first
She gets up from the table and moves over to him
You want me to tell you if 'm going to have sex
Fine
'm about to have sex
She sits on the table directly in front of him and opens her legs
Anaka enters -- sees her position, spins on his heels and walks back out

Has he
Mary shakes her head: No -- concerned
Miranda nods

He clicks open a file as Carrie enters
Wedding crunch time
We need to really get serious here
Not now --  just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and have to -- Nope
Wedding before contractor
Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one
Two hundred
Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again
Blame the New York Post and Vogue
Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence
You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room
It's the dress
How can  explain this
It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante
Change the dress
No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress
This dress may be the whole reason to get married
Well, you and the dress
She sits in his lap
He adjusts, uncomfortable
(') How are you coming with your vows
Just a reminder -- you are going to be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on
48
(He's had it) Up, up
have to finish this
Up
He sort of "helps her" out of his lap
Hey
don't have time for this
This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously
No, 'm not -- It's a circus
Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look
Carrie looks at him, stunned by this new information
didn't know that was even an issue
(beat) Why didn't you say anything sooner
You wanted all this
But -- don't you want -- want you, Carrie

49
Well, no
wasn't suggesting -- was just saying
He looks at her
She looks -- devastated

That is the face 've been trying to avoid
Come here

From somewhere down the table,  (50) a Preppy Businessman ; joking
There's a word he's heard before

The room
Big smiles; tight
Carrie leans in
Who is that again
Karl
a partner at the firm
Karl's kind of a jerk
(Calling) You know what they say -- three times a charm
(Calling to Karl) Hey "dick wad"
'm speaking
Whooo
Now
There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man
But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over
(Lifts glass high) So
here's to the groom
man who finally got "Carrie-d" away
Big is touched
Then Karl feels the need to add: Here's hopin', John
Big smiles, he has no choice
He raises his glass
(Soft) Jackass

They chuckle, then -- Samantha's smile fades

The men turn as Steve approaches
He has a look of real pain and guilt and embarrassment on his face
don't want to bother you all -- You're not bothering us
But ---  need to talk to Miranda
Samantha, could you -- ask her to come out
don't want to go in
It's a party and all
Samantha is trapped
trapped and touched

Samantha spots her
Hi

Could you give us -- The guys go inside
Samantha gives Miranda a look and leads them away
Miranda turns
She glares at Steve
52
You didn't leave me any choice
You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know  can't say anything
What could you possibly have to say that could make it better
Miranda, please
It was just that one time
Please --  love you -- You broke us
You broke us
What we had is broken
Three    (25) walk past them into the club
They look back at the scene
Miranda looks down at the ground
Steve is paralyzed
Miranda turns to leave -- looks back at him with daggers and hurt

Miranda goes inside
Steve is a stone

She looks very rattled
Big spots her and follows, gently
Hey
Are you alright
No, 'm not alright
You two are crazy to get married
Marriage ruins everything
Miranda walks away, upset
He stands there; shaken

Carrie hurries over to him
She leans in and puts her arm on his back
There you are
thought you skipped out on me
53
She smiles, kisses him
He smiles, sips his scotch
(') Well, the all-gal sleepover is about to commence
You gonna miss me
Don't go
Spend the night with me
Oh
One night won't kill you
And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life
He sips his scotch
She looks at him, sees a glimmer of something
Something that scares her
(') Is everything okay
He looks over -- sees her face
Scared
'm just tired --  guess

The office door opens --  -  enters and places some documents on the desk in front of her
Miranda signs as she chews and talks

It has to be in Manhattan
Because it does

The assistant takes the documents and starts away

You want to talk about it

Do you miss him

At 11:30

Why'd he do that
`Cause he loves you

There is nothing to be concerned about
Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something

No, she said because 'm already a runner -- it's fine
So, why are you not -- 'm afraid something bad will happen
It's a miracle that 'm even pregnant
But if the doctor said -- It's not rational, Carrie
it's irrational
know that
Okay

Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward
124
Can you do that
don't know
have a lot of thinking to do
Thinking -- or feeling
What do you mean
Miranda -- you're a lawyer
You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical
It's emotional
Sorry, Harvard -- 'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions
Well, then -- 'm screwed
don't know what  feel
You will
There will come a moment when you'll know
And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window
with the past
And  thought picking the place to meet was a challenge
Where is it
The Brooklyn Bridge
Halfway between both our places
Very logical
And yet poetic
Poetic -- if we both show up
Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected

Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The Secret
" (
) Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles
She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand
204A
--                                  204A Samantha walks on the beach
The dog is walking with her
125A
(
) Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her
Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life
The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck
126
No
Come back here
205
'  --   --             205 Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog
Where are you, baby
She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante -- showering in the outdoor shower
Water runs over his and
He sees her and smiles a hot smile
She is thrown -- overwhelmed
(') Sorry -- 'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick-- (catching herself) --Deck
There is a  sound
She looks -- the dog is humping a towel on the deck floor
She looks back at Dante
Want to join me
Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the dog and hurries away
He calls after her
(') 'm Dante
Stop by -- anytime
Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way
206
/ --  --                      206 Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone
Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series
Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit
He unzips it while looking at Samantha
dips a chip in guacamole and eats it
He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles at her
She dips another chip
He steps out of it and looks at her -- almost torturing her
She looks the other way, dips another chip in guacamole and eats it
Then another
127
207
/ --  --                      207 Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone
She picks up a slice of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table
We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover
She walks to the window and looks out
Dante is on his deck putting on sun screen
He glistens
She chews
208
/ --  --                       208 Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who is on his deck smoking a joint
He indicates for her to come over
She shakes her head: No
He walks away
She presses a button on the control panel
The jacuzzi jets start
She re- positions herself "on" them, then
She reaches over and grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and
starts eating it
209
--  --             209 Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone
On the table a legal pad with a list of  and
(
) With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal
She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip on her cappuccino
As she stands up, she catches sight of herself in the mirrored wall
Cappuccino foam covers her top lip
She remembers
She knows
210
--                         210 Miranda stands on the bridge
Alone
She looks at her watch
(
) It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros
Just as this reality hits -- the  parts and Steve is seen  up the bridge
towards her
127A
211
--                         211 Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn
128
(
) And Miranda never looked back
212
'  --  --            212 Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate
(
) Well, almost never
Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve
Kiss me
213
'  --  --                     213 Carrie's apartment is transformed
It is sleeker, polished, more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel
(
) And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me
Carrie --  again -- walks out of the kitchen with Lilacs in a large vase
The door bell buzzes
214
'  --   --           214 Carrie opens the door
Miranda stands there with a very pregnant Charlotte
Sorry
This is a very exclusive party
We're on the list
Miranda Hobbes plus one
and a half
215
'  --  --                   215 chatting and having fun
The front door is open and a coat rack is visible in the hall
couple of (20's) move around
comes up to Carrie
129
woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster told her if she did it again 'd break her arm
Thanks
He walks on
Miranda wanders up to Carrie
Where's Samantha
Her plane landed two hours ago
You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out
Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the dog is in her purse
There's no place like home
Sweetie
They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss
There's a rat in your purse
And that rat better be house trained
walks over to her
Can  take your coat
Samantha nods and takes off her coat
Revealing: She has a belly
very non-Samantha big fat gut
Carrie looks at it
Miranda looks at it
Carrie and Miranda exchange looks
Charlotte comes running down the hall
Samantha
Samantha raises her arms to greet her
Her blouse rides up, the gut peeks out
Charlotte reacts; shocked
130
(') You have a -- dog
Did you ever think you'd see the day -- me with a pooch
All three shake their heads: No
216
' / --  --        216 Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are in the bathroom
So, she has a belly
So what
No, a belly on anyone else is a "so what
"  belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on
" She never mentioned it on the phone
Never
And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body
Should we even bring it up
What -- like a fat intervention
"We love you -- have a salad
" No
We should let her bring it up
There is a knock
Samantha opens the door
She's eating a piece of cake
Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, 'm bored to tears here
She gives them a look
They smile, relieved
131
217
'  --  --                   217 Everyone has left
Samantha is sitting with Charlotte and Miranda and Carrie
They are having coffee
eat -- so  won't cheat
What exactly are you eating
Everything except Dante's dick
Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now
guess  didn't realize how big was until  saw it on your faces
How -- and  say this with love -- How could you not realize it
've been avoiding mirrors
'm proud of you for not cheating
don't know if there's anything to be proud of
stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me
Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back
Why didn't you say something
guess  didn't want to admit it
And when you're in denial -- you don't dial
Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight
You'd be gorgeous at any size
But are you happy
132
(Silence; then) Relationships aren't always about being happy, right
(beat) How often do you feel happy in your relationship
(to Charlotte) 'm pretty sure that's to you
Every day
You feel happy ever day
Not all day -- everyday -- but everyday
When was the last time you felt happy
Six months ago
They react
(') What am  going to do
What does your gut tell you
know but -- (beat; hard) Smith stayed with me through chemo
If he could stay with me through that,  should be able to stay in this relationship for him
Sweetie
You just compared your relationship to chemo
Samantha looks at her, then Charlotte, then Miranda
133
(
) (') There we were
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid
(') And Samantha
Samantha looks
Carrie points
The dog is humping a pillow on Carrie's furniture
(') That pillow cost three hundred dollars
218
--  / --             218 Samantha is sitting -- waiting
Smith enters
Hey -- You're home
thought you were staying the week
He kisses her
She looks at him
Touches his face
We need to talk
Awwww
man
knew this was coming
Yeah
This isn't working
(beat) 've done my best
've given it five years and fifteen pounds
What -- You don't love me any more
Yes,  love you - ah, fuck it -- 'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say --  love you but  love me more
And 've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one need to work on
She stands up and wraps her arms around him, whispers
134
(') You'll find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship
What will you find
don't know
But that's a risk 'm willing to take
She notices the gardenia ring on her finger
She starts to take it off
Stops
Looks back up at him
(') No
'm keeping this
Every time look down at it  want to think of you
She kisses him on the lips
219

She is crying
while eating a hot fudge sundae
leans down
We're landing in new York
'm gonna need to take that now
Samantha nods, and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as fast as she can
Scraping, almost licking the bowl
(
) As someone returned to my life
220
'  --  --                   220 Carrie stands at the door with Louise
(
) Someone left
And  put all the unopened mail from your
Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there
She points to the shelf in the new bookcase
Carrie looks
135
(') And please -- please do not make a mess of CarrieBradshaw

What am  gonna do without you
You'll find some other girl
but she won't have my style
St
Louise, you brought me back to life
Emotion floods Carrie; she chokes up
So does Louise -- And you gave me Louise Vuitton
Carrie laughs -- they hug
(') Serious
We need to stop cryin'
Louise breaks the hug and takes her "love" key chain out of her purse -- hands it to Carrie
(') Your keys
Wait -- don't forget your "love
" No,  found my love
'm leaving that with you
Carrie smiles
Louise starts out the door, turns back
(') See you at my wedding
'll meet you in St
Louis
Louise gives one last look, and leaves
Carrie closes the door
Looks down at "love" in her hand

The     is still sitting on the stoop out front with the ferocious looking pitbull
She starts up the stairs
He checks her out

When are you due

You look gorgeous

(touched; embarrassed) Oh, thank-you
The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks around
Her eyes
Big is sitting across the room at a table -- alone
He hasn't seen her
Charlotte starts to panic as the  (20's) comes over
Hi, can  -- No, 'm sorry --  can't stay -- Help me -- pull out the table can't -- Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette
As she tries to slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the table
Crash

Big spots her -- their eyes meet
She moves away as quickly as she can through the room
He gets up and follows after her

Big is quickly on her heels
Charlotte
Charlotte wait -- He catches up to her - and gently steps to her
(') You're pregnant -- don't run

She starts crying and talking though the tears
(') 'm so mad at you
was always on your side and then you did that to Carrie -- No, no -- 'm not going to cry -- 'm not going to waste tears on you -- (strong; stomping foot) curse the day you were born
Charlotte's eyes widen
She stops moving, entirely

My car's right there
Get in my car

Harry stands there
Beaming
Hi
Congratulations

It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women
She kisses him and walks over to the bed where Charlotte is holding , a beautiful baby with thick dark hair
Oh my God
She's gorgeous
Say hello to Rose
Carrie kisses Charlotte on the head
What a beautiful name
139
After Harry's "Bubbie
" Now, we got a Lily and a Rose
Carrie sits on the edge of the bed
Well,  have to say you two are very cool customers -- just making the "baby's here" call without all the "'m in labor" drama
Oh -- there was plenty of drama
My water broke in front of a restaurant
Very dramatic
Wait -- she's not done
It broke while  was talking to Big
What
See
Drama
bumped into him and  got so upset  started crying and then - my water broke
He brought her to the hospital
Stayed until the baby was born

Silence
Carrie is having a hard time with this
140
Well -- today is not about him
It's about beautiful baby Rose
(beat; forced up) So -- we know she has Charlotte's hair -- what else do we know
Harry and Charlotte give each other a sad glance

She's a doll

She kisses Harry on the cheek and starts away
He asked me to ask you to call him
Carrie stops
Turns around
Looks at him
(') know
It's none of my business
But  felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you
swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall -- his heart stopped
Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine
know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but 'm just a big pile of love today --and feel bad for the guy
He said he's been writing you -- but you never responded
(beat; then) He's never written me
He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number
141
No
He's never written me
Ever
Then, why would he say that he had
