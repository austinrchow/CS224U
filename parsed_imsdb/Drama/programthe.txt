Ward & Aaron Latham 11/23/92 '  (
) Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18
4 ticks left
Kane sets 'em down
: - smashing into the mud, as a football   comes set, frosted breath steaming across to: The   digging in, ready to explode
quarterback, barking signals
The ball is snapped, and we go to   as the lines crash together in the slop
Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield
huge bears down on him
Joe jukes
The end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off
But big  75 is closing the gap
On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face-down in the swamp
We   , spiraling through the slanting rain , black running back, glances back for it, two with him
All three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball
The ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud
Incomplete
The  of the final gun snaps us back to
Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat
Betraying little emotion, Coach  , wiry, intense, early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across the field
#1 (
) Coach, this is the second year in a row you've failed to go to a bowl game
Do you feel your program's in decline
- Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face
(keeping his cool) No, we're just a young team on the verge
We'll be back in a major bowl next year
Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud- splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his locker
, black linebacker, comes by
Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it
Good throw, Joe
It was there
So was half their team
(trailing off) Shit, another Christmas at home
Next year, man
Next year we sell out
Next year we dominate
still fielding questions
#2 You still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with Joe Kane
What are you gonna do to address this need
(a little edgy) Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you guys for a start
As Winters gets up to go, we hear: (
) 'm not gonna lead you into the fog here, Sam
'  - , 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind his desk
Seated across from him are Coach Winters and , 50, the Athletic Director
'm concerned about our Program
It's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising, both public and private
(half-joking) Then stop raising the entrance requirements on me
We never could have gotten Alvin Mack in here under the new guidelines
As Chancellor, my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this University
Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall
football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million
The end zone (60 yards away) is $400,000,000
At a time when we're committed to a 400 million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last two years
Because they've also voiced their displeasure to their legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds
The Athletic Fund is suffering too
Season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow
You layin' all this at my door
There's been a recession on
Yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club
These people are recession proof
They sit in my box every game, and they're much more generous when we're ranked and going to bowl games
Two of them, as you know, are on the Board of Regents, including the Chairman
What are you trying to say to me, Grant
After 12 years, my job's in jeopardy
'm not prepared to discuss your job right now;  just want you to be aware of the situation
The alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks don't pretend to be an expert on football, Sam, and 'll deny that this conversation ever took place, but  do know we need to win next year
- Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches,  and , walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to a waiting car
At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe
(ignoring the effigy) Tickets are in your coat
Itinerary and player profiles are in your briefcase
We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Philly with this kid Darnell Jefferson
Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy
Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage
Looks like 've lost weight
That's it
He strides on
Humes and Clayton race to catch up
This kid's the gamebreaker we've been lookin' for
- Boeing 737 roars into the night sky
(
) Had a 108 yard kickoff return against Taft
Michigan's been down to see him twice
'    - Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from and   in a tattered parlor room
Other boys of various ages and color look in from the adjoining door
Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip, the letters
shaved in block letters into his fade
Darnell, you have the potential to start for us as a freshman
That 108 yard kickoff return you made against Taft
One of the greatest runs 've ever seen a high school player make
Now, Michigan is set at tailback for two years
You won't play till you're a junior
With Joe here gettin' you the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, you'll be All-American with us as a Sophomore
Yes, but 'm really more concerned with Darnell's education
He came here late
He's got some catching up to do
Believe me, education is the first priority in our program
That's why all the players are smarter than me
After all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important
This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend
It was intended to
- We see a run-down tenant  on the edge of a large cotton field
- Two rooms
Dirt floor
Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple cart
Alvin Mack's  opens a Christmas present as Alvin and his   look on
It's an , the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent home
The inscription reads  '
Alvin's mother thinks it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it
' It's real pretty, Alvin
When  turn pro, 'll get you the house to go with it
'  - Winters' daughter , 20, is on the phone with her father
Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured, somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador
She holds a hopelessly out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas
(lying) It's real nice, Dad
- Winters sits on the bed, eating Chinese take-out, the phone cradled in his neck, talking to Louanne
knew you'de like it, Lou
Merry Christmas
Put some fresh flowers on your Mom's grave for me
'll be home in a couple days
- Battered and old, in a declining Pennsylvania neighborhood, hard by a
- Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, , watching the bowl game he would have been in, had
won their last game
His , a grizzled man in his fifties, nods in and out in a tattered armchair
All three have been drinking beer, their empties scattered around
Frank tosses Joe an Iron City beer
Have another Vitamin , Joey
Didn't think we'de see you here this Christmas, little brother
You won't next year
' (getting up) Yeh, well we won't rent your place on the couch
As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree
We see that the whole tree is covered with cans
'  - Darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall
You're from
' Yeh
was just sittin' here by the fire doin' my homework, and decided to give you a call
See how you're doin'
- We see who Darnell is talking to:  , beautiful black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not street
Coach Winters has been telling me about you
'm looking forward to seeing you when you come to visit
'll be your guide
You are coming to visit aren't you
We   and  Autumn in an office with 15 other telephones, a coed on every one
supervises with a clipboard of names and numbers
- Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn is waiting
He introduces them
She's even more attractive than Darnell thought she'd be
She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field where he's greeted by the
playing the school fight song
The  whip into action, legs kicking, pom-poms whirling
The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat stadium, an awesome sight for any young man
Autumn points to the giant
Darnell's name and picture appear
The stadium
cuts in
Now for the starting line-up for the Timber Wolves
At tailback, number 20, Darnell Jefferson
You got that right
Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance
Slaps hands with Joe
- Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights
Darnell and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's dorm
Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn
don't meet too many females like you
You got a lotta class
Real efficacious
Maybe 'll check you out in the fall
hope so, Darnell
He leans down to kiss her
She hesitates, not sure about this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to let it deepen, then breaks it off
Good night
As he watches her go up the steps, we go to: - Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's home is under seige
Reporters
Microphones
Television cameras
Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an jersey with #1 emblazoned on it
Now you know where 'm going and what we're indubitably going to be
and
- hot, late summer day
Over the deserted Quad, we see the title: 6
It fades and we    a city  pulling up at a curb adjacent to the Quad
Off steps Darnell, carrying one battered suitcase
Joe Kane and   , offensive line tackle, are there to greet him
Hey, Darnell, Welcome to
(shaking hands) Yeh, good to see you guys
What happened to the band and the dancin' honies
Regular students don't come back for two weeks yet
Not that they woulda been here
Now that you've enrolled, you're just another wormshit freshman
- dorm devoted exclusively to football players
Luxurious lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms
Spacious living quarters
world unto itself
Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room
Here's your room
If you need anything call the hall manager
Darnell looks around, taking it all in
He tries to be cool, but this is easily the nicest room he's ever had
See ya later
Freshman Placement test tomorrow at nine
McKinnley Hall
Joe and Bud start down the hall
Darnell turns back into his room, then starts to pace off it's dimensions, heel to toe
911 - College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their admirers
black  , driven by Joe Kane with Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb
They get off, head inside
911 - Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous among them is Louanne Winters
Joe and Darnell give her a nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players wait: Bud Lite,  , good-looking, silver-tongued ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and  , heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end
Between them is a large pitcher of beer
Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back
There goes my cover of the media guide
Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin
This is Darnell Jefferson, freshman tailback
How ya' doin'
was hopin' you'de have rolled your bike or somethin'
Nothin' serious, just enough to keep you out for the season
(pouring himself some beer) No such luck, Backup Man
But 'll try to engineer a few blowouts
Get you get some mop-up time
(studying Lattimer) Shit, Lats, you look buffed, man
You put on some weight
35 lbs
Spent the summer in the gym
'm tired of watchin' you guys play
intend to start this year
You get any bigger, you can play offense
Yeh, but don't  have to get dumber too
Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him
Lattimer deflects it
Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne
She gives Bobby a surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her
He gives her the "just a minute" sign
You still seein' Louanne
Yeh
Now and then, when the tide rises
Don't want her to think this is some kind've exclusive deal
Coach finds out you're nailin' his daughter, you'll be playin' dorm ball
'll bail before that
Besides, this is what he gets for not startin' me
Bobby laughs and heads over to Louanne's table, as Joe pours himself another beer
Alvin enters the bar, goes to Joe's table, plops a copy of Sports Illustrated down in front of Joe
Hey, man, you seen this
On the cover is a picture of Joe and   , The coverline reads,  : (ribbing Joe) You must be some very bad-ass motherfucker
Joe stares at the cover
He's more stunned than elated
Jesus
What
You didn't know
knew there was gonna be an article
didn't know it was gonna be on the cover
Shit, we do all the work
You get all the pub
Too bad we're not allowed to hit you in practice
Be fun to kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy Candidate
guess you'll have to wait till we get to the pros
(to Darnell) Beer boy, get me some
Are you serious
Does it look like 'm serious
Joe drains his beer, pours another
Lattimer starts to read form the article
Listen to this
"
has a solid nucleus returning, but the Timberwolves, coming off two disappointing seasons, will only go as far as the strong right arm of Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take them
" That right, Joe
You gonna lead us to the promised land
'm gonna lead
but can you follow
Muted chuckles, but set faces
The challenge accepted
Joe chugs his beer, pours another
- The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward a busy two-lane highway
Joe, a little drunker than the others, starts  at the moon like a Timber Wolf
The others join in
What are we doin', Joe
(slightly slurred) There's something  wanta try
Gotta wake up our Mojo
Start settin' the tone for the season
This is not a good time to be settin' anything
You're in no shape
Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway
Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole
Joe
God-damnit, why's he always doin' shit like this
Coach'll fuckin' kill me
Alvin, go get him, will ya
Hell no, you go get his ass
Crazy motherfucker
Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by, then lies down on his back, arms at his side
' Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt
Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now
Fuck this shit
Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line
The draft- wake of a passing truck almost blows him over
'mon, Joe, that's enough
Let's get the hell outa here
What if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass
What's the matter, Bud
Can't you follow
Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare
(torn) God-damnit, god-damnit
Shit
Bud can't fight it
He lies down on the line, his head touching Joe's feet
Joe begins to  again
Bud joins in
Alvin and the others can't believe it
Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder bread out there
They're makin' us look like pussies, ya know
Standin' here suckin' our thumbs
(to Alvin) Yeh, and there's nobody from the Defense out there
Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat
Time to ante up
Both turn to Alvin
What are you lookin' at
You think you're bad
Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop
Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow
Louanne grabs Bobby, holds him back
(vaguely sexual) Bobby, be careful, o
k
Please, be careful
Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, leaving her breathless
Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud
Now there's a line of five, a human highway median
Everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out
Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road
This guy do this kinda shit a lot
They never mentioned this in recruiting
Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble back to safety
Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange exhilarated high fives
Alvin just shakes his head
: - Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in test booklets, as a  paces the room
Darnell starts to write an answer, stops, stumped
Worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page
- Darnell and Joe walk across campus
Darnell carries a gleaming, chromed  with a football player on top
He's still thinking about the test
don't know
left a lot of 'em blank
Don't worry, you'll do all right
Lotta people don't finish
(not convinced) Yeh
What are you doin' with the trophy
Coach Winters asked me to bring it to the meeting
don't know what for
Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad
'll see ya at the meeting
(handing him the trophy) Take this for me, will ya
Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn
Hey, Autumn, hold up
What're you doing here
thought students didn't come back for two weeks
(rather coolly) came back early to see a friend
You're looking fresh, Autumn package of pulchritudiness
What about getting together later tonight
Maybe get a pizza
They got pizza in this town don't they
can't tonight
How about tomorrow night
don't think it's a real good idea for us to see each other, Darnell
What's the matter
'm not good enough for you all of a sudden
Too young, is that it
'm not, ya know
They held me back a year
No, it's not that
've got a boyfriend
Did you have this boyfriend when you showed me around
(reluctant to admit it) Yes
Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother you then
'm willing to overlook it now
was mad at him
For what
caught him with another girl white girl
And you're still with this nigger
She nods, slightly embarrassed
Look,  got to get going, Darnell
'm sorry
didn't mean to lead you on
'm glad you came here
She starts walking away
Wait a minute
can at least walk with you, can't
Nothin' wrong with that
She speeds up
He speeds up
'm in a hurry
can keep up
run the forty in four-four
She's just about to say something when   arrives
Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut, well-spoken, middle class
Hey, Autumn -- This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen
Ray and Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters
Hi, Ray
This is
(cutting in, offering his hand) Darnell Jefferson
(pointedly) Tailback
(shaking Darnell's hand) Ray Griffen
(just as pointedly) Starting tailback
know
That's why they recruited me
Autumn can't believe he said this
She starts to interject something to break the tension, but never gets the chance
The two guys they recruited before you are handing out Gatorade now
(making the jerkoff motion) Better start strengthening your wrist
We'll see
(departing, to Ray) Give my best to Miss Lilly
Autumn's mortification is complete
(to himself) What the hell is that supposed to mean
- Establish the new, modern  , home of the
Athletic Department
- The football meeting room
quarter amphitheatre
The Freshman, including Darnell, down in front
Nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former
greats arranged on the Wall of Honor
Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation punctuated with laughter
door opens
The Assistant Coaches file in
The room hushes immediately
Coach Winters walks in
The Upperclassmen break into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join in
Good to see you again, gentlemen
(catching sight of Darnell) Jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress
The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off his earring
wanna talk a little about what we're trying to do here
There are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life
The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of the football cannon
These people are full of shit
You see, football is not like life
(pause) It's better
More exciting, more intense, more fun
In life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind
In football, you know
Every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about
Spreading smiles all around
It's good to be a football player
Last year we didn't make enough of those chances
Last year everyone felt we let the school down
Fuck the school
We let ourselves down
(pointing to the Wall of Honor) We let down a great tradition, a 120- year-old Line of Champions
The smiles are gone
Lots of set faces now
Shame
anger, retribution
Any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights
That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our Round Table
If  were an upperclassman, 'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new-comers this year
Guys who want a place at the Table
(producing Darnell's trophy from behind the podium) This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American
You know what this says to me
The freshmen are hanging on every word
Not a god-damn thing
He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, shattering the base
Darnell and the other freshmen are agog
The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen
(to the freshmen) Everybody here was a high school All- American
(to all the players) Whatever any of you have done before is out the window
We're startin' over
Ground zero
The Table is empty
Are you ready
The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful
We go to the freshmen
They're not so sure
: - Passing drills
Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out
The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head
Joe's angry with himself
(to Winters) He's too pumped up
Tryin' to win the damn Heisman on every throw
'm not sure he's ready for all this hype
Little late to be worryin' about that
If we don't follow up the Sports Illustrated cover with something, it'll look like we didn't believe in our own player
Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid
He'll be allright
- Scrimmage
Joe hands off to Darnell
He sweeps right, cuts it up, blows past the end
In a spectacular display of broken field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety
Alvin, pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping the ball at the same time
There's a wild scramble for the fumble
Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run
The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground, the wind knocked out of him
Ray Griffen runs by to take his place
Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson
You got all the moves
(shouting to the team) Allright, move it up
Let's go, 15 yards, run the next play
The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind
Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask
Cut the necktie tackle horseshit
You think you're in some kinda highlight reel
He left you huggin' air
Target his guts
Drive right through his abdomen
wanta see snot bubbles in his nose
wanta see shit in his underwear
Lattimer nods chastised
Winters moves over to check on Darnell
You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt
(gasping) What do you mean
If you're hurt, you can still play
If you're injured you can't
Are you hurt or are you injured
think 'm just hurt
k
, then get up
Winters extends a hand
Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily to his feet Nice run
Think what it coulda done for us if we still had the ball
(handing him the ball) This is a football
want you to carry it with you wherever you go
Never let it out of your sight
(to the rest of the team) Any of you see him on campus, take a swipe at the ball
Try to knock it out of his hands
Recover it
(to Darnell again) If anybody, but you, returns this ball to me, you'll wish you'de never been born
Winters wheels off leaving a wobbly Darnell alone with his football
(
) This isn't gonna get it, goddamnit
' ,   - Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who are sitting, cowed in his office
see tackling, but  don't see hitting
see effort, but  don't see ferocity
What do you think, they're gonna motivate themselves
Football's just a game to most of these kids
This is our program, our livelihood
It's our job to make them care as much about it as we do
Make them hate me if you have to
It'll bring them together, give them a focus
So get off your butts and put the fear of God in these guys
- Dead tired players toweling off, dressing
The trainer's room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players
Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight room
Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters' office
Shit, Lattimer's an animal all of a sudden
Benchin' 450
He's gotta be on somethin'
What, steroids
Why do you always think my guys are juicin'
don't know
he's on the punt team for three years, then gains 35 pounds of rip in one summer and an attitude to go with it
Winters, who's heard all this, comes by
We're not doctors, gentlemen
The has testing programs for this
Let's let them worry about it
(to Clayton) Besides, it's not that hard to put on 35 pounds in a summer, if you really hit the gym
Winters walks on into his office
Clayton nods, realizing this subject is now closed
'  - Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying there is his
Coach Winters actually smashed a replica
smile appears on Darnell's tired face
- For football players only
Bud Lite moves through the cafeteria line
What you got tonight
Choice of three entrees
Shrimp, lasagna, -bone steak
Tough choice
'll take all three
What a surprise
at another table with Alvin and several other black players
Lattimer is the only white
When do they give ya the scores on that Placement Test
Who cares
flunked it three times, before  got in
Long as you're in the program, they'll get you through
Maybe not with a degree, but they'll keep you eligible
Just don't do nothin' embarrassing they can't cover you for
Hell, they even give Alvin copies of his tests in advance
He sells 'em for a hundred bucks a pop to people in his class
'Course he's gotta have somebody read 'em to him
Fuck you, doughboy
can read
See that shoe
(points to his shoes) That says Nike
still don't wanna flunk that test
wanta get a degree
What do you think, nigger
You're gonna be on the Supreme Court
All you need to know is how to sign an contract
Darnell's stung by this
He'd like to think of himself as capable of more
Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise visitor to the training table
All the players wearing baseball caps, quickly doff them
Winters is angry
What's the matter with you guys
You're supposed to be a team
Winning depends on thinking and acting and going to war together
But you don't even eat like a team
You eat like two teams
white one and a black one
What do  have to do
Make out a seating chart
Now get up
Move around
Mix it up
Now
The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up and change tables
Darnell sits next to Joe
(mock introduction) Hi there
Darnell Jefferson
'm a young black man
Hey, glad to meet ya
Joe Kane, Caucasian
So what doya think a that new Garth Brooks album
love that motherfucker
Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables are integrated now
That's more like it
He turns and walks on out
Immediately, the players begin to drift back to their old tables
- Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out of the non-prescription drug cabinet
Joe pops a Nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed works a knee lift
Camille's the perfect marriage of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation
Joe leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in
How ya' doin'
Fine
Little late to be workin' out, isn't it
(with a little edge) Only time  could get in here when the football team wasn't usin' it
(trying to get a rise out of her) Well, if it wasn't for the football team, might not be a weight room to use
You tryin' to firm up a little, or what
(unfazed) Don't need to firm up
'm strengthening my knee
Had arthroscopic surgery
Had my knee scoped once too
When you're finished here, maybe we could get a yogurt, compare scars
Sorry,  don't date football players
They're all full of themselves saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated, so you're probably worse than most
That's real open minded of you
So you won't consider doin' anything with me
No
Well at least tell me what happened to your knee
What'd you do
Fall outa your convertible
Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe
We think she's going to fire on him
Wrong
You know, there's maybe one thing 'd do with you
What's that
Tennis
'll play tennis with you
Camille starts to walk away
Tennis
You mean now
It's raining
: -   - smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with the exertion
Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a world-class player
She attacks with a vengeance, blasting every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins watch, amazed
We begin a    detailing Camille's relentless dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the line, Joe barely getting it back to the net
Camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return
Camille crushing another forehand
Joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot
Camille serving again at match point
Joe pops up a weak return
Camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking Joe down
He flings his racket against the fence
Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back
Thanks for the game, Heisman
You took it really well
And she walks away along to the net
Joe goes after her, pissed
What's this Heisman crap
Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve
didn't say anything about being a Heisman candidate
don't go around strokin' myself about it
So what's this shit you're givin' me
'm sorry
just figured you were probably kissin' yourself in the mirror every morning
You figured wrong
Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him
So what do you want, an apology just gave you one
want a rematch
rematch
Some other sport
took my beating
You owe me one
Either that or we go out
Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither
'll think about it
Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate
Joe walks off in the other direction
Bud Lite and Bobby follow
Real good date, Joe
Remind me to take her out
: : - Opening day of school
We take  of students arriving, football players checking out the new girls from atop the wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for classes etc
'  - Darnell sits across from  , Academic Advisor
Darnell, 've reviewed your placement test and 'm afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas
What does that mean
can't play football
No
It means you're going to have to take some remedial classes, what we call "zero level" courses
Specifically Math 0 and English 0
Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of his academic standing
You won't get college credit for them, but they will help you prepare to take the Placement Test again at the end of the quarter
If you pass at that time you'll be able to officially enter the university and take college level courses
You'll still be able to take an American History survey course, but it won't count on your record until you pass the Placement Test
But first things first
To start, 'm approving a tutor for you
tutor
don't need no tutor
Any tutor
And yes you do
- meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic Director,  , a publicist,  , and the Sports Information Director (
)
Also present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center of all this attention
think both Joe and the university are best served by a straightforward Heisman campaign
Nothing too gimmicky
We've compiled a mailing list of around 1300 opinion makers; newspapers, football writers, and sports anchors
First we send them a packet on Joe and his achievements
Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; commitment to academics, charity work, etc
Then we update it each week with a postcard
Heisman voters hate opening envelopes
Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this
haven't really done any charity work
You're gonna start
We've got some things lined up
Unfortunately, because we weren't in the top 20 last year, we only have one network
game to give Joe national exposure
Although it's a good one; Michigan
But we'll also be taping all our other games and buying satellite time
That way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to
stations all over the country for their sportscasts
Any questions, Joe
If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now
He tries not to show it
After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign
Still it's a megaton of pressure
Ah, no
just
you really think got a shot to win this
Hell, yes
Plus it's a good thing for the program
Publicizes the school, gives a boost to recruiting, and it's a great thing for you
Jumps up your draft position, the size of your first contract, everything
It's a hell of an opportunity
All you gotta do is back it up on the field, and we have no doubts about that, cause we know "Kane is Able
" Nichols holds up a black   with the phrase "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters
This gets a rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about all this
'  - Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to get to sleep
'  - The phone rings
Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and answers it
Hello
This is Joe Kane
What did you decide
(still drowsy) What
(looking at the clock) It's 3:00 in the morning
wanta know what you decided
don't know
couldn't think of any other sports  could beat you at
Then 'll pick you up tonight at 6:00
He hangs up
What
- Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes
She becomes aware of someone approaching
She looks up to see Darnell
Hey, Autumn
Hi, Darnell
What are you doin here
My advisor says  need a tutor
Ya know, just to get me over a couple rough spots
(showing her a paper) saw your name on this list figured if you couldn't keep my attention, nobody could
'm sorry, Darnell, but 've already been assigned
You're gonna have to find somebody else
'm tutoring Scott Sherman
Not anymore
asked Coach Winters to switch us
Coach Winters wouldn't do that
Yeh he would
'm a bigger prospect than Sherman
(pointing across the way) He's a lineman on the scout team
Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing
Sure enough, is hard at work with another Tutor
Autumn can't believe it
She tries to compose herself
Darnell sits down across the table from her
'mon Autumn, you could teach me some real erudition
(trying to whisper, pissed) Will you stop using those big words
It sounds ridiculous
(serious about this) What doya mean
'm improvin' myself
learn a new word out of the dictionary every day
Mendacious, pejorative, antithetical, commensurate
And you don't ever use them right
Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated
Or erudite
It's just a con
And it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a prospect you are
Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality
His customary bravado melts away
even more reason for you to be my tutor
You already taught me something
Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal
She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having trouble being angry about it
At another table, looking distracted and bored as his reads his history assignment to him
Alvin takes out a walkman and puts the headphones on
'  - Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn
She stops at the sight of something
We    Joe on his Harley
We goin' on that
Yeh
thought we might take a ride
promised my dad 'd never get on one of those
What are you, one of these trust- fund princesses
It's fine for me to play a game  don't know, but  ask you to try somethin' different and you hide behind your daddy
He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her
She burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her to decline this challenge
(snatching the helmet) All right
But we go slow
No cowboy stuff
Joe smiles and kicks the starter
Camille climbs on and they roar off
- Just outside town
Joe and Camille come down the highway at moderate speed
Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we can tell she's enjoying it
This speed, o
k
Yeh, fine
Good
Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back
Her  is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed away from camera
Slow down, damnit
Joe
Joe
They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be a long, sheer dropoff
Joe looks back at Camille, smiles devilishly, not looking where he's going
Camille sees they're heading straight for the edge
(freaked) Joe, look out
Too late
Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille screaming
: As it plops down onto a wide  not visible from the road, three feet below the top of the bank
Joe lands it, skids to a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter
Camille jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger
How could you do that, you stupid punk
It isn't funny, god-dammit, you coulda killed us
You're crazy, you know that
Take it easy
've done that a hundred times
No big deal
Oh, yeh
Then why are you shaking
(embarrassed) don't know
guess cause 've never done it with someone else on the bike
You just wanted to scare me
Are you happy now
Yeh, pretty much
And the scream was even better than  thought it'd be
Every dog within hearing distance wants to mate with you now
Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her ear
Sure enough, there are    in the distance
Joe smiles at her
She looks away, still angry, but amused in spite of herself
- Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do You Love" on the jukebox
Camille and Joe are sitting in a booth
Joe putting away the beers
You come here a lot
Now and then
Why
It's not exactly a campus favorite
This is almost like hidin' out
like places where nobody knows me
This too low-rent for you
No, my dad owned a place like this
Your dad
You mean he owned a chain of these
Not everybody with a Southern accent has their own plantation
My dad could never afford to send me here
learned to play tennis on public courts
Mighta been able to play pro someday, if  hadn't hurt my knee
So you're just a scholarship jock like me
Yeh
You disappointed
No, 've just never been out with a jock before
Is that what we're doin' here
Goin' out
don't know
What doya think
Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet
They dance to a slow song
think you're crazy for jeopardizing your scholarship and a pro future by jumping motorcycles off of highways
Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille
The other guys look to me cause they think 'll do anything
lose that, 'm just another guy, and we all get our ass kicked
don't know, Joe
You scare me
- Joe roars in on his motorcycle
Parks
Starts inside
Finds himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters
Winters holds out his hand
The keys
Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his motorcycle keys
told you, as long as you're in this program, you don't take unnecessary risks off the field man in contention for the Heisman Trophy should be able to remember that
Joe nods, contrite
Winters just walks on off
-   - Autumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes
, using the things we worked on yesterday,  want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect of your life
Something other than football
Like what
Your father, maybe
You could write about your dad
Don't know that much about him
He was off in Detroit workin' in a car plant when  was born
Got laid off, tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money
He died in prison
Some kinda heart problem
Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship
She tries to press on gamely
How about your mother
She was always workin'
Usually two jobs
Comin' home one night she stopped to get us some root beer
Got caught in a gang crossfire
Shot three times
died on the way to the hospital
You want me to write about that
(blown away) No
Good, 'cause none of it's true
Autumn jumps up
(raising her voice) Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible thing to do to somebody
That's not funny
That's sick
Autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down
Had ya goin', didn't
(soft library voice) No you didn't
You just
How could you make up somethin' like that
(contrite now) Sounded more interesting than the truth
My mom took a vacation to Chicago when  was 12
Never came back
Don't know who my dad was
Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth
Who took care of you
started hangin' with the
, gang-bangin'
Did some time in the Hall
Reverand Wallace saw me playin' football on a juvenile probation team
Took me in, got me into high school
Only reason they accepted me was 'cause  could play football
Sorta like here
Football saved my life
'd be nowhere without football
Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in
Well, then
maybe you could write about football this once
Yeh, o
k
thanks
(pause) 've seen a lotta shitty things in my life, Autumn
That's why  know when  see somethin' good
Autumn knows this is no line
He means it
She's seeing him with new eyes
Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity, and more than a little taken by his regard for her
across the room with his tutor
Let's review the chapter  read you yesterday
Which two city states fought in the Punic Wars
dunno
Detroit and Buffalo
'mon, Alvin
You're gonna be tested on this
- video projector projects various football formations on the wall
Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi State's offensive set
2nd and 2 on our 24
What defense are you in
Eagle
Zipper
Hero
Unless the set back shifts into the
Good
(slide changes) How about here
3rd and 7
Okie
Thunder
Lion
What's your assignment
Kill the Quarterback
(slide changes) Hit the tight end so hard his girlfriend dies
(slide changes) Kill everybody
- '  - Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in and unveil a life-size  - of Joe's Sports Illustrated cover pose
They whoop it up, as Joe tries to muster some enthusiasm
- Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math book
As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her
Autumn quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw Darnell's attempt
Darnell laughs
- group of football players sits in the back of the class
As the   lectures at the board, Darnell furiously takes notes
Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity, leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football out of Darnell's left hand
Darnell, Scott and two other spring out of their seats, scrambling after the loose ball
The prof and the other students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball
Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it
He and the others quickly return to their seats
The prof looks at Darnell aghast
Sorry
lost my football
- Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball
Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a fist in triumph
Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket and stomps around
- Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on a secluded patch of lawn
Darnell holds his football
As he begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the ball out of his hand
They both scramble for it, Darnell winding up slightly on top of her
They eye each other a beat
Darnell bends down to kiss her
She lets herself kiss him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her books
- Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board in the hall
The starting lineup for the first game has been posted
Darnell traces his finger from the designation over to the name
He drops his eyes, obviously disappointed
Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board
He finds his name posted as a starting defensive end
Punching the air, he dashes out of the building
Yes
Starting defense
Place at the table
Whooo
Yes
- Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins head-butting car windows
He breaks out three in a row, and yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood
Winters, walking with the  , has seen this from across the street
He knows there's something dark at work here
is gonna test half the team before the game Saturday
Make sure Lattimer knows about it
- The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles
Coach Winters addresses the assembly
As the veteran players know, we have Pride Night every year before our opening game
It's a chance to get to know each other better, share some thoughts, and bring us closer together as a team
So to start off, 'd like each player to tell the others in his group what he likes best about football and then what he's most proud of off the field
've asked some of the seniors to lead it off
Gentlemen
don't know
It's the battle
The goin' to war with the other guys
Hangin' together
- The team walks through several plays
They wear coats and ties, but no socks
Their ankles are taped
(
) Bein' different from everybody else
Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels the night before games
Settin' ourselves apart
- Before the game
An   gives Lattimer a little test tube to urinate in for his drug test
Lattimer goes into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back of the tank, where a     is taped
He pours it in the test vial
(
) Havin' a chance to be somebody
To do somethin' that people look up to you for
Your strength and your courage
Not everybody can play football
We're the lucky ones
- The thing 'm most proud of myself for
- Darnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching the ball from arm to arm
(
) Just that 'm here
That 'm not dead or in jail
- The great thing about football is you can lose yourself in it
- Joe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the rhythmic tapping of his feet
(
) There's no time to think, to worry, to have doubts
Everything else fades away
You just move and react
- The best thing is when you dominate
That feeling when you hit a guy real good, really stick him, and you hear that little moan
- Alvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war paint
They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his mouth
Alvin spits into it
Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's
Darnell can't believe this shit
(
) You know it's killin' him, but you feel great
It's just him and you, and he's the one that's hurtin'
We move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and : - The Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping pads, yelling encouragement
Winters waves them forward
They start to run down the tunnel
runs with the players as the light at the end of the tunnel becomes larger and brighter
Crowd  becomes louder until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the light and 95,000
This is Big Time College Football
announcer   and colorman,   are holding forth
Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den where the
Timberwolves, led by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open their season against the tough Mississippi State Bulldogs under head coach Jackie Sherrill
- The crowd stands, waving banners, as the
kicker comes forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky
The fields the ball at the four yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried
The defense trots out and huddles up
All right, let's get evil
60 minutes, balls out
Let's open a can of kick- ass
Kill 'em all
Let the paramedics sort 'em out
The Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to the line of scrimmage
Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks eyes with the tailback, No
23
Hey, 23, don't think  don't recognize you, you little fuck
The tailback looks away
Hey, pay attention when 'm talkin' to you, nigger
You're the guy that shot my mother aren't you
What
You were tryin' to steal her fuckin' car weren't you, cocksucker
Shut up
never heard of your mother
On the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange
(to Joe) What's Alvin saying to that guy
Just gettin' himself pumped up
He wasn't pumped up already
(to tailback) Thought 'd never find you didn't ya
But  got you now nigger, and 'm gonna kill you motherfucker
'm gonna bust your guts open and watch you die
The ball is snapped
The quarterback pitches to the tailback as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his lungs
The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer
The ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with it
ball
The bench and stands erupt as Lattimer and Alvin but heads and trot off the field
Atta baby, Alvin, heads up
Big pop, Steve, way to stick 'em
(turning to Joe) Joe, let's go up top
Take it to 'em right away
Joe leads the offense on
disappointed Darnell stands on the sidelines
(in huddle) let's put the women and children to bed, and go lookin' for dinner
Don't let em up
51 Strike, Orange left
On 4
Joe begins to howl like a wolf
The others join in
pack of Timberwolves
They break the huddle, come to the line of scrimmage
Bud Lite begins to sing
Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any day
Here am , your special island
Bud lines up opposite a big, black
Shut up, snowflake
You think you're in the school play
No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling
And the highway runs right over your ass
Bullshit, you're gonna be my bitch, baby
You gonna be my punk bitch
(singing again) So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night,  hate to go and leave this pretty sight
Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped
Bud Lite and the Big Tackle fire out
Bud drives a forearm into the stomach of the Black Tackle, doubling him over
The Black Tackle comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping his neck back
Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up
Bud Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground
The Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs
Bud rolls him over
Joe spots his flanker back,  , on a flag pattern
Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone
Touchdown
The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's throat getting up from the pile
Joe pumps a fist in the air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates
: It reads
28, Mississippi State 20
4th Quarter
Jefferson
In for Griffen
Darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action, buttons his chinstrap, races onto the field
(
) 2:05 left
Kane hands to Jefferson
He takes a handoff, runs a trap up the middle, is hit by , clawing at the ball
They bring him down, but Darnell doesn't fumble
He gets up, still clutching the ball, and starts back to the huddle with it
The hustles after him
Excuse me, son, but we're gonna need that football for another couple minutes
Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up
Even Winters has to laugh
We go to: Lattimer, sacking the quarterback, tackling him high, ripping his helmet off
Lattimer runs off the field, holding it up like a trophy
The gun sounds, the game is over
Accepting congratulations from his staff
Guess we'll be on the payroll for another week
walking off the field together, both their jerseys blood- stained
Good game, man
Really enjoyed it
Yeh, you're a strong motherfucker
Shitty singer though
- reception of some sort for the players is in progress
Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch bowl
approaches him
Good to see ya in there, Darnell
Way to hold on to that pigskin
As he walks by, he slips an  into Darnell's coat pocket
Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill
Surprised, he goes over to Alvin
Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar bill
Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred once you're startin', depending on how you play
But we're not supposed to get any are we
Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a month scholarship money
And the double assholes won't let us have jobs, so you take your money where you can get it
(taking Darnell's envelope) 'll keep it for you, till you see the light
Shit, they oughta be payin' us anyway
Athletic Department gets 3 million just for goin' to a bowl game
'  - Joe sits alone on his bed watching
He's being interviewed in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face
(
) This performance today -- two touchdown passes, another you ran in
Where do you think this puts you in the Heisman race
Joe hates this question
We go to the screen
(uncomfortable) really have no idea
That's up to you guys
The image changes to  anchor   in the studio
Now let's turn to our Heisman watch
(does the pose while remaining seated) We begin with Sports Illustrated cover boy Joe Kane of
who led his team to an impressive victory this afternoon
Well, if Joe continues to raise Kane, he may well be Able to dust off a large space on his trophy shelf
Although the real test will come in four weeks against Michigan and their Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen
- Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm
(
) Michigan also won big today
Timothy, "He Could Go All The Way Men", will be looking to do so against the Timberwolves
And of course the able Kane will be looking to also
can't wait
'  - Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door
No answer
Knocks again
Nothing
Disappointed, he turns and walks away
- The post-game victory party is in full swing
All the players, their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking, celebrating
Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching the action
don't know,  never seem to make out at things like this
Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne
You don't make out anywhere
Or did you finally break the snatch barrier this summer
Fuck you, Bobby
(realizing Louanne's there) Excuse me, Louanne
sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor
Alvin notices
Forget it, nigger
No chance for you there
Why not
Griffin's goin' to medical school
She likes that light-skinned respectable shit
You're just her ghetto toy
Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where Ray and Autumn are standing
slow tune plays
(to Autumn) Can  have this one
don't think so
What are you so worried about
You haven't lost your starting job yet
Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand
(turning to Ray) Just one
Ray reluctantly backs off
Darnell and Autumn start to dance
Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them as they move around the floor
They try to pretend they're just having a nice little chat
(whispering) Take it easy, Darnell
This isn't a good time to push things
You're putting me in an awkward position
Yeh, well,  got a little encouragement along the way
That kiss
it was just
a kiss
Bullshit
You meant it
wouldn't be standing here now, everybody thinkin' 'm a stupid asshole, if didn't know you meant it
wanna see you, Autumn
Not in study hall
Not like your student
Like somebody to be taken seriously
do take you seriously, Darnell, but 'm still with Ray
can't just go paradin' around town
don't need to go paradin'
We'll go someplace different
Someplace nobody'll see us
She looks at him a long beat
She doesn't need this complication, this conflict, but she can't say no
God, why am  even considering this
The song ends
Ray moves in to reclaim her
(to Darnell) All caught up on your arithmetic
Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove
Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12 carries
Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by Joe and Bud Lite, step between them
Darnell shrugs them off and leaves the party
(to Bud Lite) Just what we need, a little team unity
Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio
'm gettin' a little sick of this asshole, Autumn
don't like you hangin' out with him
It's embarrassing
don't hang out with him
tutor him
Then have him get another tutor
can't do that
made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam
can't bail out on him now
What the hell difference does it makes
They'll grease him through no matter what he does
Nobody's ever gonna see his graduation
Don't tell me you're falling for this guy
He's just another gang-banger with speed
just said  wanted to help him
What are you more afraid of, losing your girl or your position
Maybe you oughta think about what you're in danger of losing
Maybe  will
Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party too
- Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just staring out at the night
He hears a voice behind him
(
) So where you wanna go
He turns
It's Autumn
- The party's still in full gear
Ray is now chatting up a few of the groupies
Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner
Joe's knocked back several beers
He's a little tipsy, and lost in thought
Maybe she's out with some guy
Who
Camille
don't think she's the type to screw around on ya
Shoot ya, maybe
It wouldn't be screwing around
It's not like we're going together
Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, , at a table across the way
She's eyeing Joe big time
She wants him
He stares back at her
She doesn't blink
- Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library steps, having been studying late
As she heads for her dorm, she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped around Joe, nuzzling him
Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed to see her
They exchange a look
Camille, upset, turns and wheels off
Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get it out
We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and sliding, clutching on to each other
You're right, nobody would ever see us here
- Near closing time
Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then
There are few other skaters at this hour
Yes,  figure the key is to go places only white people go
Next time we'll go bowling
Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating it's closing time
Plus  saw this in Rocky
never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now  know
They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble over to a bench, begin to unlace
Thanks, that was fun, sort of
You were pretty good for the first time
Well, it's not really my first time
My dad took me skating once
He used to play ball for
, didn't he
Yeah, how'd you know that
saw his picture on the Wall of Fame
You got his eyes
Luckily, you didn't get his thighs
She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to kiss him
He puts a finger to her lips
Make sure you mean it this time
She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again
They fall into a deep kiss
We   to
Two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink
The lights flicker and go out
- Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes
Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist
Both are surprised to see the other
What are you doin' here
Couldn't sleep
was just sweatin' out some of the beer
Camille just nods
Long, silent pause
didn't go home with her
thought about it
but  didn't
You drink too much
Yeh
He turns, starts toward the door
Why didn't you
Why didn't  what
Go home with her
don't know
guess  figured maybe there was somethin' goin' on between you and me
Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then gets off the bike and walks toward him
Then why'd you pick her up in the first place
was drunk
needed some company
(angry) Company
Yeh,  can see you havin' a real far-ranging discussion with Sheri
mean, ya know, physical company
was
just needed to pounce on somebody  guess
Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around Joe's waist, leaving him naked
Why can't you pounce on me
Aren't good enough to pounce on
Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back
Joe's totally thrown by this reaction in her
Well, you're more conservative
classier
you're not that kinda girl
She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training table
(insulted) How do you know
You've never slept with me
She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table
What makes you think she's such a great ride
(climbing up on top of him) 'm prettier, my legs are longer
(pulling down her leotard) 've got better tits
(exasperated) Why would you go to her, when you have me
didn't know  had you
(softer, leaning close) Well you do
He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his
They fall into a long, white-hot kiss
- Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically
Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top
(between kisses) You shoulda looked for me at the library, or don't you ever go there
(rolling back on top) go there
got a 3
2 in Political Science
just don't go there on Saturday nights
(rolling back on top again) have a paper due Monday
What'de she do
Sit on your lap or just give you the nail-me stare
Shut up, Camille
Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them off the table and out of sight
- Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books , checking attendance, walks up to Louanne
She's uneasy as the
checks his chart
What's your name
Bobby Collins
Can  see your
Louanne knows she's in deep trouble
'   - high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to run simultaneous views of different positions during the same play
grim-looking group of assistant coaches approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the images on the screen
Coach, we, ah
got a problem with Bobby Collins
Yeh
He talked
a friend
into taking a test for him and got caught
They had a new
in there
What's the penalty
Well, the rules say automatic expulsion for both of them
Fortunately, we've got friends on the Board of Regents
think we can beat this if we really go to bat for him
We got Mack off when he turned in that other guys term paper
(shaking his head) But what kinda idiot would do something like that
Well,  guess Bobby figured he was gonna flunk
don't mean Bobby
mean what kinda guy would be dumb enough to take a test for him
Uh, well
it wasn't a guy
girl
Typical Collins
He must have banged her until she couldn't think straight
Who was it
(barely able to get it out) It was
Louanne
Winters' face goes dead
'  - Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne
Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so stupid
he was behind, he needed help
'm sorry
just
Sorry
You're sorry
You've destroyed my credibility at the University, my authority with the players
Christ, it looks like 'm running a dirty program
And Collins of all people
What the hell's the matter with you, Louanne
(crying) don't know
thought he
loved me
Loved you
He loves anything that winks back, the little rat bastard
And what are you gonna do for school now
use my influence to get you back in, it'll stink to high hell
The press'll crucify me
'll get in someplace
God, Louanne,  told you to stay away from my players
That was my cardinal rule, stay away from the damn players
They've always been good enough for you
Good enough to devote your life to
Why aren't they good enough for me
Or are they too good
You're changing the subject, Louanne
We're talkin' about you breakin' the rules
Didn't you ever break the rules just a little
Didn't you tell me once that 90 per cent of the schools obey the  rules, and the other 10 per cent go to bowl games
Was that just a joke
She gets up and walks out of the room
Winters closes his eyes and slumps down on the couch
- Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn
Autumn storms in, obviously upset about something
She slaps a corrected test down in front of him
You seen this
You got a  on your math test
Yeh,  kinda figured that
had some trouble on this last part
We went over that last week, Darnell
What is this time we spend in here
Just a joke to you
don't even think you've been listening to me
've been listening to you, baby
Don't call me baby
thought you wanted to learn
But if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get another tutor to waste time with
'mon, Autumn, we just had a good time, and now you're gettin' all nuts behind this
It's just one test
So far, it's the only test
want you to study this whole chapter
By yourself, without me here
When come back, we'll discuss it
Be ready to do problems based on it
Whatever you say, Teach
(big grin) don't wish to be cast in a pejorative light, so 'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities
She shakes her head and walks away
Darnell's grin fades
He looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes
He's embarrassed and deeply worried
- The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's strangely subdued
Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a -   hanging inside
Immediately the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter
Coach'd probably shoot ya lower
Suddenly the room goes silent
Standing in the doorway is Coach Winters
He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding his gaze
His eyes come to rest on Bobby
Bobby tries to hide the shirt, but Winters has seen
Winters just stares at Bobby a beat, then
You all played a fine game on Saturday
Take the day off
With that, he turns and walks out the door
The players remain silent
Bobby throws the shirt in the trash
'   - Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs and down the hall to his daughter's room
She's packing her things
He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs her tight
Neither speak
tear rolls down Louanne's cheek
Hits the floor
- very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks on Coach Winter's door
'mon in, Collins
' Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk
Winters doesn't invite him to sit
Listen, Coach,  just want you to know 'm really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne
was real glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to junior college here
(cutting him off) Shut up
Bobby does
Instantly
could easily take your case to the Board of Regents
You've had no prior infractions and  could argue that you were under abnormal pressure
(pause) But  won't
You embarrassed me, you embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program
As of now, you are no longer a member of this university or it's football team
Clean out your locker
Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief
There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes
Finally, dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out
- Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's more photogenic buildings
sportscaster   and his video crew wait to interview him as a   finishes applying makeup to Joe's face
Publicist Sharon Braver watches like a hawk
(to his cameraman) We ready, Jerry
, let's mark it
An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe
Joe, this game is being billed as a potential "Heisman Shootout"
Did you feel any added pressure this week
- phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as Joe goes through passing drills
(
) knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen
- , Well, ya know, you try to block it out, but it's basically impossible
Everybody seems to be talkin' about it, all the newspapers, the interviews
- Joe is being interviewed by   on a local television show
(
) The hype on
, tryin' to get somethin' goin
- Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera, waves off the take
Hold it
Hold it
What
What's the problem
Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially
What you're saying is true, of course, but  don't think it's the message you want to send
- Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone
video spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape
(
) It makes you seem a little nervous
Like the pressure might be getting to you
- This game is nationally televised, so most Heisman voters will be watching
think a more casual approach is better
Modest, controlled, casual
Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera
(to Braver, irritated) We all set now
(gets a nod) Let's mark it
(the take is marked) Joe, this game is being billed as a potential "Heisman Shootout
" - huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue
The cheerleaders, all wearing "  " buttons, whip the crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium
(
) Did you feel any added pressure this week, knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen
The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe
" On "Joe", they assume the Heisman trophy pose
Joe seems slightly embarrassed by it all
- No,  don't really think too much about that kinda thing
Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look
- Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad tracks below
Neither says anything
Joe seems strangely preoccupied
Camille decides to break the silence
Your parents comin' to the game tomorrow
My mom's dead
My dad has never seen me play
Why not
Guess he's not that interested in football
But you're one of the best players in the country
(snapping) He's just not into it, o
k
(chastised) k
(silence) What's goin' on, Joe
You ask me out here, like you wanta talk about somethin', then you don't say anything
You worried about tomorrow
No
'm worried about the days after that
just
don't know
feel like tomorrow's gonna be my last game
want to stay up, make the time go slow
Why would it be your last game
You afraid of getting hurt
No, that'd be a relief
Then, at least,  wouldn't be a failure
Joe, why are you thinking like this
Why would you be a failure
You're having a great year, you're a Heisman Trophy candidate, you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros
(testy) How do you know what's waiting for me
You don't know me at all
(hurt) don't know you
How can you say that
Because you wouldn't be here now if you did
You only know the guy that's supposed to make millions in the pros
Is that what you think
That 'm with you for the money
Why else
Infuriated, she slaps him across the face
Fuck you, Joe
(starting to cry) don't give a shit about your money
don't even give a shit about football
And you know what
Maybe you're right, maybe  don't know you
She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view
Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry
Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train
Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him
Joe
Joe
My god, Joe, what are you doing
No
No
As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties
Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him
She falls to her knees screaming
Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties
It's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly
The train passes
Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks
Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees
She lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade
She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment
God Joe, oh god, are you allright
(drained) Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth
Guess you've really seen the dark side now, huh
You should've gotten out while you had the chance
Before it all goes to hell
don't wanta get out, damnit
What's wrong Joe
Why would it all go to hell
'm a Kane, Camille
That's all it takes
We're cut out to be drunks and fuck-ups
We never live up to expectations
It's in our blood
My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up
My dad went the longest
Waited till he was playin' triple  ball, before he hit the wall
Sometimes  feel like 'm just waiting for my turn
The better  do, the closer it gets
You're not like them, you can beat all that
You can stop drinking, you can break the chain
If  gave up that,  wouldn't be much of a football player
And if wasn't a football player, what would be
The question hangs in the air
You'de still be Joe
And 'd still love you
He pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against each other
Just don't say  never warned you
- and   in the foreground, the jammed to capacity stadium in the background
This shot is going out on nationwide
, the college Game of the Week
4:29 to go and it's been a great one
Two undefeated teams goin' after each other
Michigan up by four, 24- 20, but the lead has changed hands three times, and you get the feeling that whoever has the ball last is gonna win it
Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage
Yells signals
(
) Well, it was billed as a Heisman shootout, and it's been all of that
Both Waymen and Kane moving their teams up and down the field, having big days
Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a receiver, decides to run for it
He sprints up the middle, 15, 10; a  comes at him at the 5
We see Joe's
through
He pushes the lunging safety away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the he never saw
Joe is knocked down, over the goal line and out cold
The crowd goes wild
(
) Kane back to pass, can't find anybody, gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit at the goal-line
Touchdown
Great run by Kane
Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him
(
) He's still down
Looks like he's hurt
We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration around him begins to die down
As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's shoulders, and lowered onto the bench
We go to a of a man's face waving something
We  to a  waving smelling salts under Joe's nose
Joe begins to come around
The doctor holds up two fingers
How many fingers am  holding up
Four
- Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage
As Tim Waymen gets under center, Alvin begins to yell at him
Hey, powderpuff
You're the white boy that ratted my brother out
Sent him to jail, cocksucker
Ran off with the fuckin' money
Left the blood to do the time, huh
Waymen begins to call signals
Yeh, you're the little bastard
Account of you, my bros' datin' his cell mate
You hear me, powderpuff
Gonna make you pay
You gonna be my cellmate now
You gonna have 250 lbs
of pissed-off nigger up your ass
(
) in an eight-man line looking for the run on third and short
The ball is snapped
Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback, hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass
On the sideline, Coach Winters yells, "Pass
Pass
" Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and takes dead aim on Waymen
Just as Waymen releases the ball, Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf
(
) Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the blitz, Waymen is goin for it all
Hit as he throws
The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral
The
secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is a step behind
The ball comes down in the hands of the Michigan tight end,
(
) Hunt has got a step
He's got it
Touchdown
Winters slams his headphones to the ground
(
) Great clutch throw under pressure
Can't do it much better than that
The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes him track his finger, etc
You're vision's back to normal
You think you can go
Yeh, 'm fine
Just a little headache
(getting up, shouting to his teamates) Offense, let's get it back
Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust
Damn tough to scare that little white boy
Either his momma dropped him on his head, or the motherfucker is deaf
Coach Winters goes to Darnell
Jefferson, in for Griffen
Griffen slams his helmet to the ground
- Joe breaks the huddle as the
offense comes to the line
(
) Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go, Kane brings 'em to the line of scrimmage
Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares out a screen pass to Darnell
Darnell grabs it and takes off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking
Darnell finally runs out of bounds at the twenty
(
) Great run by Jefferson, the highly- touted Freshman, the longest of the day for the Wolves
And this one is turning out to be everything we thought it would be
coming back to the huddle, pumped up
Joe kneels in the center
, time to put the women and children to bed, and go looking for dinner
He begins to howl, as do all the others
The Call of the Wild
82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2
They clap hands, come to the line
Joe looks over the defense, bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped
Action goes to
Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass
The Michigan cornerback comes on a blitz, locked on Joe
Joe starts to roll, but knows the corner will catch him
On the run, he launches the ball toward Darnell
Darnell opens his hands to receive it, but at the last second, the Michigan  steps in front and intercepts it
(
) Kane looking for Jefferson
It's
Intercepted
Intercepted by Freeman
And that should do it
Joe sinks to his knees in frustration
The blitzing cornerback does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet
Winters looks like he's been punched
As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go to: - Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium behind him
Well, it was everything we expected it to be
Fine performances on both sides of the field
- Players undress and shower in relative silence
No joy here
(
) The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of the quarterbacks would probably have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran for another
Joe Kane accounted for three
touchdowns, but had that crucial interception in the waning moments
And that proved to be the difference
The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters enter
Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead against the wall, the water coursing over him
- Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and dressed
He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking to Coach Humes
Hey, Autumn
Hi, Darnell
Is this your dad
Yes
How do you do, Mr
Haley
'm Darnell Jefferson
Jefferson
Nice run you made on that screen pass
Another block and you might have scored
Thank you
We'll get 'em next year
How do you and Autumn know each other
You a friend of Ray's
Darnell is jolted by this question
It's obvious that Autumn has never told her dad about him
(filling the void) Ah,  tutor him
Oh really
In what
Darnell would like to crawl under a rock
Math and English
Ah
There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr
Haley's voice
He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam
This is not lost on Darnell
Well, stay on top of that, Darnell
'd have been in real trouble if hadn't gotten my degree
played ball once
Hurt my knee
Yeh,  know
used to put a copy of my report card inside the webbing of my helmet to remind me that college was more important than football
(forcing enthusiasm) Good idea
Well,  gotta get goin'
Nice to meet you Mr
Haley
Nice to meet you, Darnell
See you around, Autumn
Before Autumn can respond, Ray Griffen approaches from the other direction
Hey, Mr
Haley
Good to see you
Hey, Ray
You still havin' dinner with us tonight
Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he walks away
Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front of her father
- The post-game party
Not as raucous as after the opening game victory
few players are dancing, but most are sitting, drinking, commiserating
(to Alvin) Anybody seen Joe
Not yet
Probably out with Camille
Haven't seen Darnell either
- Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named
They're kissing softly, light necking
Lattimer starts to unbutton her blouse
She begins to demur
think we better get back downstairs
No, Leslie, we're just getting to know each other
(starting to get up) No,  think
Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed
She's starting to get a little scared
'mon Leslie, you didn't come up here to stop now
He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for the door
Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs her again, throws her violently on the bed
She screams
What were you doin'
Leadin' me on
He gets on the bed, kneels above her
She starts to struggle
He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open
Freaked, she begins to scream and kick
Enraged, Lattimer slaps her around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her some more, throws her to the floor
Picks her up again, when suddenly the door   and Bud Lite and Alvin race in
(throwing Leslie on the bed again) Get outa here
Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down, but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull
Two other players charge in and finally all four are able to shackle Lattimer
He continues to struggle a bit, then gives up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk
This is it, man
No more 'roids
This shit has gotta stop
Lattimer breaks down and cries
'  - Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola
He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of himself
He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket
The phone rings
He looks at it a beat, then walks out of the room
'  - Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe
She listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned
-   - Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending interception over and over
The phone rings
Hello, yeh
What
- The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on in Winters' office
All the assistant coaches are there
It looks like this will blow over
The girl's father is a big booster, contributed a lotta money
So he said they won't go to the press
He said that
The father
Yeh, he's not exactly happy about all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt the program
We're still gonna have to suspend Lattimer
What for
There aren't any charges
Nobody outside the program knows about this
He's outa control, Lyle
We can't ignore this anymore
don't know what pisses me off more -- that he's juicin' or that he's doin' such a shitty job of hidin' it
He's never tested positive
If we suspend him without proof, he could sue us for jeopardizing his draft status, his pro career
Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till he kills somebody
hate to lose him as much as you do, but we gotta clean him up before he does somethin' that lands the whole program on probation
Plus, we have to take some action or the girl's dad is gonna start havin' second thoughts
don't care how many checks he's written
So what do we do
All eyes go to Winters
Bring him down here
- 20 Close on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer
Three games
Why so many
You oughta be grateful  didn't suspend you for the whole year
Lattimer nods, he knows it's true
What are you gonna give as the reason
We'll say you've got a hamstring pull
(relieved) Thank you, Coach
Don't thank me
During those three weeks, you better kick the roids, cause when you come back 'm gonna personally test you before every game
No
shit either
'm gonna watch the piss go into the bottle
You got that
(barely audible, shamed) Yes, sir
Start practicing your limp
- Not the 911 we saw earlier
Joe sits at a table in the back, with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser
Both are down in the dumps
At a nearby table there's a group of and their
Coupla real college heroes, huh
Tearin' up the town
First time  ever lost a girl and a game on the same day
Guess  never really had the girl
Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, , giving him the once over and a little smile
Joe smiles back, not really interested
Debbie's  notices
You know that guy
Not really
Then why you smilin' at him
don't know
he looks like that quarterback guy
Joe, what's his name
So what
So you go and smile at him
The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to Joe's table
You been lookin' at my girlfriend
(a little drunk himself) don't know
Which one is she
Wise guy, huh
Mr
bigtime quarterback
The one who choked his ass off today
You got nothin' better to do then look at my girlfriend
Joe says nothing
Hey, Heisman, 'm talkin' to you
You too good to talk to me
'm not even interested in talkin' to you
You think you're a bad ass
You think my girl's hot for you
Take your pads off, you're just another pussy
Joe gets up to go
The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him away
The guy charges Joe
The bar owner rushes to the phone as a full scale brawl begins
Joe takes a blow, knocks the boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the floor
The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in his shoulder
(grabbing him) 'mon we gotta get outa here
- speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line on the curves
- Joe's driving, Darnell's holding on
Suddenly we hear
Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror
Oh shit
'  - Winters is asleep
The phone rings
He picks it up
What is it now
Oh Jesus
'   - Joe sits across the desk from Winters, just the two of them
The guy went for me first
What was supposed to do
Doesn't make any difference
It made the papers, all the wire services
The guy had to go to the hospital
Worst of all they got you on drunk driving
You had a blood alcohol level
50 above the legal limit
We can't smooth that over, Joe
It'd look like we were sprayin' Pledge on bird shit
We had to agree to send you to Rehab
Rehab
'll be a god-damn joke
You can't do this to me
It was the only way we could get them to drop the assault and
You go to trial on those, we lose you for a year, and risk investigation
'mon, lotsa athletes have been through Rehab
Not in the middle of the season
Not in the middle of a Heisman campaign
You'll only miss four games
You'll be back in time for the last one, Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get there
Plus, you've still got your senior year
Yeh, but what will  come back as
What kinda player
Don't worry, you'll still be the Man
You'll still be the leader of this team
Joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up to leave
'm sorry, Coach
These things happen
Joe walks on out, Winters watches him go, then slams the desk in anger
Drained, he sinks back in his chair
Fuckin' kids
- Darnell's walking across campus toward class
Autumn sees him, calls out to him
Darnell, wait
'mon Darnell,  wanta talk to you
Darnell doesn't slow up
Autumn has to run to catch up
Where you been,  been callin' you
Been busy
Darnell, 'm sorry about Saturday
It was an awkward situation
It wasn't awkward
It was educational
realized how you see me
'm good enough to tutor, to go places with, but not to tell your father about
That's not it
It's just that my father expects me to be with somebody like Ray
He wouldn't understand us
(stopping) Why not
don't know
he likes Ray cause
He's a good student, he acts right
he doesn't need football
He's class and 'm not, right
didn't say that
You don't have to, Autumn
'm everything your dad used to be and don't want you fallin' back into
Darnell
You were right before, Autumn should have another tutor
Thanks for everything you did for me
Darnell walks away
Autumn can only watch him go
'  - Joe finishes packing his bags
He sees a picture of Camille on the dresser
Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in the trash
He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the shower, pulls out a match and lights it
He watches it catch fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room
We hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile
- Joe is shown into his room
Bare
One cot
One dresser
He drops his bag, sags onto the bed
(
) Four fuckin' weeks
- tired and depressed group of
football players undress after practice
Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer standing in street clothes
Bud softly sings "Don't Cry For Me Argentina
" Shit, the defense is gonna have to pitch shutouts now
(to Lattimer) and you're gone for 3
What the hell did you take that shit for
Nobody seemed to mind when  was knockin' people's dicks in the dirt
bust chops too
don't have to get all fucked up
Not everybody has the ability you do, Alvin
You do what you have to do to play
Well, you're not playin' much now are you
Shit, whole fuckin' season down the drain
- Winters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after practice
The stadium is deserted
been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson
What's he wanta do now, cut practice down to once a week
No, he's happy with the way the season's gone so far
The Alumni have pretty much stayed off his back, but with Joe out now, it could all be up for grabs again
He thinks he's gonna have trouble marchin' the ball down the old fund- raisin' board, huh
The facts are, all we have left are freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' saw at practice today, convinced me that any of them are ready to step in
What are you sayin
We gotta get Bobby Collins back
Wilson say that
He didn't have to
Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All- Star either
Yeh, but he's good enough to get us a split of the next four games
Look, just because you're Wilson's boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean 'm gonna let him make me look like a fuckin' whore
Don't give me that high and mighty shit
There's a lotta people on the bubble here
Four straight loses and we're out of bowl contention
How's that gonna make you look
If you're too stupid to consider your own situation, then maybe you oughta think about your assistant coaches
They've got families to feed too
Howard walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the middle of the field
- The seven members of the    sit on one side of a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle
On the other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President of the Faculty Senate,  , Academic Advisor, , President of the Student Body,  , and Galen Howard
Fowler is addressing the board
Therefore,  respectfully submit that Bobby Collins should not be given special treatment just because he's a football player
Would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating
Nobody's talking about letting the girl who took the test back in
Winters could kill this kid
think it's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken
Beginning Golf, Voice and Speech Improvement
'd like to point out that Mr
Collins was still on schedule to get his degree
(pointing to Collin's transcript) In what, Swimming Pool Management
Would you like to respond, Coach Winters
Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the odious nature of what he has to do
don't know much about all this other stuff, but  do know the punishment should fit the crime
Cheating's bad, but  don't think it deserves a life sentence
Here's one of those athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate
think Bobby Collins made a big mistake, but he's already been suspended for several weeks
He's served his time
think he deserves a second chance
Like Alvin Mack
We gave him a second chance and since he's had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level
You're using his body to make money for the Athletic Department -- you, yourself, are making three times what the Chancellor is -- but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education
He's helpin' to pay for your physics lab too
If you're willin' to go without a new office, maybe  could hold him out a few games
Save his body
Gentlemen
Alvin was way behind in school when he got here
You can't make up for, in four years, what it took 18 to create
Then he should never have been admitted in the first place
It's not fair to other students who worked hard to get here
Is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools
You hold everybody to the same standards, you're discriminating against the poor kids
Most of my players are farm boys, inner-city kids
Football is their deliverance
Deliverance from what
valid education
You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin out, you take away their futures
In Alvin's case you probably cost him a couple million dollars in the pros
But this is not a football vocational school
It's an Institute of Higher Learning
Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000 people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment
Gentlemen, please, let's get back to the business at hand, Bobby Collins
As you know,  played football here
And  remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you're dead tired
So  have some sympathy for this young man
But  never cheated, so the real question is his character
Since you know him better than anyone else in this room; and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks, do you feel he's learned his lesson
In other words, can you vouch for his character
Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade
(it's killing him) Yes, sir,  can
Bobby Collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile
- Learnihan and Winters come down the steps, their faces set
As they split off: Another case like this, 'll take it all the way up to the Governor
Don't mess with me, Learnihan
'll have you teachin' Study Hall
- Bobby Collins walks in prior to practice
His teammates gather round, slap him on the back, high five etc
Winters watches from his office, disgusted
'  - Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though, his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him
Suddenly, he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces
His hand bleeds
He doesn't care
He just sits there and seethes
'  - Camille's on the phone
Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer
'd like to speak to Joe Kane
'     - Joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket knocks on his door
You've got a phone call
Camille Schaeffer
Joe says nothing, not wanting to deal with this
She says she's your girlfriend don't want to talk to her
You sure
Yeh
The nurse leaves
Joe gets up, goes to the wall, and starts pounding it with his right hand
'  - (
) 'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak to you right now
Crushed and angry, Camille hangs up
- Bud Lite is watching television
Louanne enters on her way to Bobby Collins' room, carrying an armload of neatly-pressed laundry
But Lite gets up to bar her way
Hey, Louanne, how ya' doin
Fine, Bud, ya know
Goin to
, hopin' to get back in here next year
Just came by to give Bobby some laundry  did for him
You two seein' each other again
Yeh, he was even talking about us gettin' a place off campus together, until he got reinstated
don't know how  woulda told my dad
Bud just nods blankly
Louanne starts to head for Bobby's room
Ah, Louanne
(pained to say it) wouldn't go in there right now
Why not
Bud doesn't have the heart to tell her
She finally realizes Bobby's with another girl
Ah
Guess 'm pretty stupid when it comes to men
never learn, do
think maybe men are just stupid when it comes to you
If you ever feel like, ya know, just talkin' sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me know
My schedule's pretty open
Thanks, Bud (handing him the clothes) Give him these, will ya
Bud nods
Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the hall with as much dignity as she can muster
'   - Winters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe huddled on his bed
Shivering
Get up
wanta talk to you
Joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up
Don't sit up
Stand up
If you can
Joe gets unsteadily to his feet
He feels sick
Winters reaches out to shake hands
Joe does not reciprocate
Hides his right hand behind his body
What's the matter, Joe
You won't shake hands with me
(Joe is silent) You don't want me to see your hand, do you
(more silence) So  guess what  heard was true, huh
You been poundin' the walls with your passin' hand, right
(silence) tell you what, Joe, you want to hit somethin', hit me
Joe doesn't move
said hit me
'm the one who put you in here
Don't hit the damn wall
It ain't the wall's fault
Hit me
Go on, hit me right now
Joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it
Who else you wanta hit, huh
you're daddy maybe
Cause he's a no-show prick
Well, 'm a daddy, too, and not a very good one at that
So just hit me instead
'll take your daddy's beatin' for him
Go on, you want to
Hit me, damnit
Joe shakes his head
(pushes Joe in the chest) Hit me
'm not gonna leave you alone until you hit me
(shakes Joe by shoulders) The guys'll thank you
They've always wanted to do it
So do it now, damnit
Do it
Joe sinks to his knees
Winters stares down at him, then kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away
, Joe, it's o
k
guess  need it more than you do
(pause) You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself
Let me see that hand
Joe reveals his hand
It's barked and cut, but not badly swollen
It's o
k
(playfully) You can still throw with it, you fuckin' mook
(pause) Look, the nurses say this is the toughest time for you right now thought 'd stick around a little, case you wanta play some cards, pick a fight with the wall again, whatever
You don't have to
Yes  do
'  - Lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia
He carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into his toilet
Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble into the water
He flushes
: '     - The sun shines through the window
Joe wakes up, raises up, looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair
Winters rouses
Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright
Winters gives him a nod of approval
detailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games
1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game
The scoreboard reads
14 Boston College 10
2) Darnell in study hall, with his new tutor concentrating on her explanation, applying himself
- 3) Steve Lattimer, in street clothes, paces the sidelines, jumping up and down in frustration, his hamstring bandaged to sell the injury ruse
He catches himself, gets back on his crutches
newspaper fades up through the shot
It reads "Wolves Offense Fires Blanks in 13-0 Loss to Texas
" - 4) Darnell sits in a cafe, drinking coffee and studying
Ray comes in, his arm around a co-ed,
They buy a pastry and leave, not having seen Darnell
Darnell ponders this a second, goes back to studying
- 5)  group of patients is gathered around a
set in the Rehab Center, watching a pre-game show
One goes to Joe's room, where Joe's lying on his cot
Hey, Joe, don't you wanta watch the game
It's on cable
No thanks
Joe leans back, staring at the ceiling
6) Sportscaster   is holding forth on the local evening news
on the strength of a 62 yard touchdown run by freshman Darnell Jefferson, squeaked by the North Carolina Tarheels today, 14 to 13, keeping their bowl hopes alive
7) Darnell, with his books, on the way to the library, passes the frat house where the victory party is in progress
He sees Ray and Autumn walking together
Autumn sees him, her face lights up
He gives her a slight smile, keeps walking
She watches him with a certain longing
- 8) Darnell, alone in the library, late at night, studying
- 9) Lattimer, carrying his gear bag, walks into the locker room
His teammates come over to shake his hand, slap him on the back, welcome him back to the team
'    - Joe sits on his bed listening to the
broadcast
(
) hoping to get past a tough Iowa Hawkeyes team in their last game before the return of star quarterback, Joe Kane
- The
defense is on the field
Alvin moves up opposite the
know you, motherfucker
You're the prick who got my little sister pregnant
We ain't seen you around lately
Where you been, huh
Answer me, motherfucker, or 'm gonna peel your cap
The ball is hiked
Iowa runs a sweep left
Lattimer tries to get outside to contain, but is blocked by the fullback, who goes low and cuts his legs out from under him
Shit, Lattimer
Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the corner, then suddenly cuts back
Alvin has overrun the play slightly
We go to   as he turns and is hit with a wicked -  by the guard he taunted
Alvin's leg flexes at a horrifying angle
We    of bone and tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain, grabbing his left leg
Oh, no
The doctor and trainers sprint out to the field
'    - We move in on Joe's face, as Harvey is heard on the radio in the b
g
(
) Oh, boy, this does not look good, Harmon
They're bringing the stretchers out
Joe's eyes close
He knows what this means
- Alvin is being strapped on the stretcher
(wailing in pain) Oh, shit, oh shit, 'll kill that motherfucker
'll
Oh shit
- An ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium
We hear  inside, the  outside
(
) Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving for the winning touchdown
Fourth and goal at the one
trying to hold on without their star middle linebacker, Alvin Mack
- The
defensive line digs in
Lattimer tries to suck up his remaining strength
Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side
He fights through one block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him
They meet in a titanic collision at the goal line
The back keeps driving, twisting
Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was on steroids, is unable to
The back falls over the goal line
Touchdown
13
10
As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man
(
) Coach, you've lost two of your last four
- Coach Winters faces the press
Why do your teams seem to nose dive at the end of the last couple seasons
This was a tough loss, but this ain't any nose dive
We've had some key players out, but if we win next week, we'll still win the conference and go to a major bowl on New Year's Day
mean,  know you guys can't write, but  thought you could at least count
- Alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated
He's still a little groggy from anesthetic
Coach Winters stands beside him
You look good, Alvin
Yeh,  feel o
k
Any of the guys been down yet
They called
Hell, you know how football players are about hospitals and injuries
Yeh
Several beats of silence
Then: 'm never gonna play again, am
Doctors aren't always right, Alvin
but  just want you to know
you're the best defensive football player ever coached
Alvin nods
Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head, gives him a smile, walks out
Tears brim in Winters eyes as he leaves
Alvin's head goes back against the pillow
Tears aren't brimming here
They're rolling down his cheeks
- Joe walks out with his suitcase
Coach Winters waits for him
Shakes his hand
They get in the car
(
) Congratulations
'm proud of you, Joe
- know you had a difficult time
Michigan is easy, right
Bourbon is tough
Scotch
They share a laugh
Winters pulls out two sets of round trip airline tickets
got somethin' for ya
Coupla round trip tickets
Go see your dad
Get it cleaned up
Joe takes the tickets, just looks at him
'  - (on the phone) 'm gonna have to take a test with the coach right there
You sure you got somethin' better than blockers
(
) Much better
This guy is foolproof
See ya Saturday
Lattimer hangs up, picks up a
Stares at it a second, sweat beading on his forehead
Then plunges it an inch deep into his thigh
Pulls it out, sits on the bed a beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously, biceps bulging
'  - The coach is facing Ray and Darnell across his desk
wanta do something different for this game
Try to maximize our speed, but keep you both in the lineup at the same time
Ray, 'm moving you to fullback
Darnell, you're startin' at tail
Ray is stunned, Darnell elated, but neither says a word
Ray, you'll be carrying the ball less and blocking more, but they'll still have to respect your running and pass-catching ability
Not everybody can make a transition like this
You think you can handle it
(tight lipped) Yes, sir
Good
We can't afford any hang dogs
- Camille comes off the court, after tennis practice
She's surprised to find Joe waiting for her
Hello, Camille
(cool) Hello, Joe
You allright now
Yeh
yeh,  think so
Good, 'm happy for you
She starts to walk away, heading for the bike racks
Camille, hold on,
'm sorry that  didn't want
that  couldn't see you
You couldn't even talk to me
What happened to "there's somethin' goin' on between you and me"
Camille gets on her bike
'mon, Camille,  was embarrassed couldn't
and pedals off
(shouting after her) couldn't understand why anybody would wanta talk to me
Camille
She just keeps on going
- bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of Joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund steel works filling the sky in the background
The bus stops at a corner
Joe steps off
No bag
He's not planning on staying long
'  - Joe goes to the front door
Knocks, gets no answer, pushes the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to the back porch
Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's
He's got a couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he has the look of one
How ya doin', Dad
(surprised to see him) Joe
What's this
They throw you out
No
' heard about your little set-to
They had it on the news here
Yeh, they sent me to rehab
' We know what that's worth
Your brother's been through it three times
Joe nods sadly
' So what are you doin' here
've been thinking about some things, Dad
' That's what that damn rehab'll do
Make you think about a lotta things you can't do nothing' about
kinda been wonderin' why you never came to any of my games
All those years
' Oh,  don't know
guess  didn't wanta make you nervous
You mighta tried too hard and screwed up
Or  mighta done real well
Which woulda been harder on you, Dad
' (sensing the anger) What do you mean
Mighta made you feel bad
Like maybe it wasn't written someplace that we all gotta go on our ass
Like maybe you coulda done somethin' more, if you'de tried a little harder
' Or maybe  didn't wanta see you gettin' all excited, all pumped up with pride, when  knew one day it would all come crashin' down
Just like it did
think  spent the last couple years hopin' 'd die before that day
But you know what Dad
That day came and 'm still here
And  got one more game this year
don't know how well 'll play or even how much, but want you there
' How would you feel introducing your drunk dad to all your friends
You think about that
could live with it, if you could
(handing him a ticket) Here's a ticket
Section 2, Row 6
Fifty yard line
If you don't come, 'll never ask you again
' , Joey
And good luck
They give each other a short, quick hug
Nothing sentimental
Joe walks back through the house
His dad stares out at the yard
- Darnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables
He hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another person
He looks up to see Autumn
Hey, Autumn
How's Ray
Don't know
Haven't seen him since the night  saw you
He'd been goin' out
Monica Lambert
You knew
Why didn't you tell me
Didn't wanta win you over that way
Silence
Darnell looks back at his books
just wondered how your studying was comin'
You ready for tomorrow
The test
hope so
been workin' pretty hard
Good
(sitting down) talked to my dad last night
Oh, yeah
How's he doin
Fine
We talked about you
What did you say
(eyes brimming) told him 'd gone out with you
told him  wished  could still go bowling
Darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet
He hugs her
- Darnell is bent over his test booklet
He writes furiously, stops to think, starts writing again
- Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out
The ball flutters badly, falling short
He's rusty
doubt if we can start him
(simmering) He's worse than that
He's outa shape
(blowing his whistle) All right, that's enough for today
Practice is cancelled
Everybody off the field, but Kane
(the players hesitate) 'mon what the hell are you standin' around lookin' at
Get outa here
The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file off
Even the coaches are baffled
Winters walks over to Joe, who has no idea what this is about
Didn't do much while you were in there, did ya
Well, we didn't exactly have a team
You could've worked out on your own
had some other things to worry about
Well, we're gonna make up for lost time
We'll start by hoppin' the steps
Hoppin' the steps
What, you're gonna punish me now
Don't talk back to me, Joe
'll kick your ass
went easy on you, 'cause you had to get through detox, but that's out to sea now
You let this team down; you let this program down
Start those steps
Right leg
- Hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot, laboring as he passes Winters, halfway up
Now the left
Joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the steps, his quadriceps bursting with pain
: -  - hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, Winters watching from below
: -   - Bone weary now
Winters has him run 20 yards, get down and do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc
Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only do 4
Winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to run again
70 guys
70 guys who busted their butts all year
Because of you they might not win the conference
Because of you they might not go to a bowl
(barely able to stand) didn't wanna leave
just screwed up
You dogged on them
(stopping, exhausted) No, no  never dogged
worked my ass off
played hard
(pushing him forward) Then you shoulda stayed in shape
Keep runnin', dammit
(wobbling, starting to break down) always played hard
gave my everything for you
When you came to the Center,  thought you were really worried about me
But you don't give a shit
We're all just a buncha sled dogs
If you had another guy who could throw, you'da left me in the fuckin' hospital
(falling to his knees, sobbing) The only thing that matters is the program, the god-damn program
Winters pushes Joe down to do his pushups
Joe has to strain mightily to do two
Nobody forced you to play football, Joe
Not me, not the program, nobody
But when you sign on, you commit yourself to pay the price, to do whatever it takes
Well, you haven't paid the price yet
You still owe this team
You owe this team big- time
(walking away) Get a shower
Joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as Winters continues to walk away
'  - Lattimer lies on a table, a   going into his side
'  supervises
Lattimer's dealer is there
What's this doin
Takin' doped urine outa your bladder and puttin clean back in
Call it an oil change
- Coach Winters watches unknowingly as Lattimer pees the catheterized urine into a cup
- The team is gathered around
Conspicuous among them is Lattimer, who's painted his face like a skeleton
Coach Winters is whipping them up with a pre-game rant
Gotta get it done today, boys
Gotta ring that bell
60 minutes
60 minutes of mean
No prisoners
No mercy
Nothin' but snot bubbles
Gotta ring that bell, gotta ring that Championship bell
(shouting) Ding Motherfucking Dong
Pumped to the gills, the
team explodes in yells and races out into the tunnel
The  continues  and mixes with the     as: - (
) Wolves movin' left to right on your radio dial
Looking to generate some offense
They've been up and down the last few weeks
in the huddle
28 Thunder right
On go
They break and the
offense comes to the line
Collins calls signals
We go to   as he fades to pass
Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass
Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard
Bobby flips the ball over the charging defenders
Darnell catches it, gets a good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is out ahead blocking
There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into the secondary
Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins to look for the safeties
Ray, however, barely brushes the linebacker, who doesn't even break stride
He lowers his head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the football
Fumble
There's a scramble
The Yellow Jackets free safety comes up with it
The crowd and the
bench, quickly deflated, sit back down
Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says nothing
He knows Ray tanked the block
'  - Alvin sits alone in the "living room", listening to the
game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate
His mother mends a pair of jeans in the b
g
(
) So the Wolves defense has held after the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets will opt for the field goal
Around a 34 yarder
Ball is down, it's away, it's long enough
And good
Georgia Tech jumps out on top 3-0
Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from Alvin
There's none
- Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick sideline, but it's a little short
The Yellow Jackets' sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down the sideline for a touchdown
(
) Collins back to pass, rushed, now fires out in the flat
It's picked off by Hill
Down the sideline
He's gonna go in untouched
Touchdown, Georgia Tech
- discouraged bunch of
players drag into the locker room
Some swear, some bang their lockers
'mon guys, we're only down ten
Let's get our fuckin' shit together
Darnell marches over to Ray's locker
You missed that block on purpose, didn't you, asshole
You're full of shit
You fumble, you try to blame me
It's Autumn isn't it
That's what this is all about
The hell with Autumn
You just can't take a hit
Infuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging
Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, trying to beat the shit out of each other
Finally, several players manage to pull them apart
Coach Winters charges over
Don't tell me who started it
don't care
All  care about is this football team
We win together
We lose together
So whatever your problem is, get over it
don't want any more of this shit
Understand
Yes, sir
As for the rest of you guys
Here's what  think of the way you played
Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange Juice and Gatorade
He swipes the cups off the table creating a small flood on the floor
Then turns the table over
The players are shocked
They've seldom seen him like this
(pointing toward the Yellow Jackets' locker room) They're laughin' at you over there
Makin' plans for the evening
They never dreamed it'd be this easy
You guys are nothin' but bugs splattered on their windshield
You better stock up on potato chips, 'cause you're gonna be watching a lotta
on New Years Day
Winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate their mistakes
Winters goes over to Joe
Get warm, Joe
You're startin' the second half
Joe nods, excited but uncertain
Winters moves on to Ray Griffen
By the way
don't let me see you miss anymore blocks
- The
players return to their bench for the start of the second half, gather in a circle
Joe looks up in the stands to the seat he reserved for his father
It's empty
: 1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it
2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is sacked
3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield
- Clayton approaches Winters on the sideline
Joe's too tentative, too cautious out there
He seems flat
Maybe we oughta give Collins another shot
Joe just needs to get the feel back
He'll be allright
Sam, we can't afford to wait
(snapping) said he'll be allright
(
) 5:51 to go
Georgia Tech up 10 to nothing
The Wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here
Their defense has been keepin' them in it
As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes up to him
Joe,  know that Rehab was good for you
Got rid of a lotta bad habits
But what about the rest of you
What happened to the Joe Kane that used to take command of this team, the Joe Kane these guys i'd run through a bulldozer for
They put him out with the trash
What are you waitin' for, somebody to feel sorry for you cause you've had some problems
Nobody in this stadium gives a shit
It's time to step up, Joe
Time to sit at the head of the Table
As Joe comes into the huddle
He's all business now
All right, we've held these guys up long enough
Give me time back here, and 'll rip 'em apart
16 shift, green, bolt
First sound
Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go
" The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the sideline
First down
In quick succession, we see Joe: 1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle
2) Fades to pass, is rushed
Forced out of the pocket, scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard line
He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt
(
) Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to get it to the four, but it's gonna bring up fourth and goal
No doubt about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go for it here, if they're gonna get back in this game
Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into the huddle
Give it to me up the gut, Coach
They've been ignoring me
know can score
No, we're gonna go with the sweep
Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field
Ray is upset, angry
He swears to himself
Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear
28 Thunder right
On 2
The team breaks out, comes to the line
Joe looks over the defense, screams signals as the   is building
We go to   as the ball is snapped
Ray takes one step forward then turns right, leading the play
Joe pitches to Darnell who follows Ray
Georgia Tech's outside linebacker comes up to stop the play
Ray stumbles before he can make the block
He drops out of our picture
Shit
Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline
The linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle on him
Darnell starts to cut back
He lowers his shoulder to take the linebacker's blow
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out
Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line
Touchdown,
The stands erupt
It's the first thing they've had to cheer about all day
Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to talk to his defense
Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance
He runs over to Ray, grabs him by the helmet
Monster block, man
Monster motherfuckin' block
Ray smiles
They butt heads and run off the field ' (softly to himself) All right, defense
Let's get evil
Kill 'em all, let the paramedics sort 'em out
- Georgia Tech has the ball
They break their huddle
(
) 1:11 and counting
Third and one
The Wolves have got to stop them on this play if they're gonna get the ball back
first down here and it's all she wrote
is out of timeouts
The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands off to his  on the countertrap
The tailback runs behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer
Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block
The back lowers his head, starts to power into Lattimer
Lattimer lets out a fierce yell
Smash
Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, vibrating his helmet
Lattimer's legs churn, driving the tailback back and into the ground
We see the back's face
There are snot bubbles in his nose
No first down
No way
Lattimer jabs both arms in the air
The crowd goes nuts, as the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling their arms, whipping up the crowd
Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field
He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes
Sees the steroids there
He knows it's the only way the kid could have done it
Decides not to bust him
Lattimer knows it
Winters gives his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise
He catches the snap, boots the ball away
Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat
Suddenly, he reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there
He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line
The
fans are on their feet
Winters races over to Joe
Time for 2 plays
If it's not open in the end zone, take the sideline
As the offense runs onto the field, Winters checks the scoreboard
17 seconds left
Georgia Tech 10
7
- Joe brings the Wolves up
(
) Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35
17 seconds left
Kane barking signals
Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away from the rush
Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he fires a bullet down the sideline
Ray Griffen catches it and goes out of bounds at the twelve
Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more time outs, as the refs move the chains
(
) Field goal here ties it, but a tie may not get the Wolves into a bowl
Tough decision for Winters
(to Joe) You want me to send in the kicking team or you think you can handle it
Give me the ball
, let's do 24 inside slot, left blue lightning
Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as the crowd's roar goes off the charts
(in huddle) , 24 inside slot, left blue lightning
Let's put the women and children to bed, and go lookin' for fuckin' dinner
On 2
He starts the wolf howl
The others join in, howling for all they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors
They clap and break the huddle
The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the Georgia Tech end zone
Joe looks up in the stands again at the seat he left for his father
It's still empty
This one's for you, Dad
Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi
" We go to   as the ball is snapped
The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing everything at Joe
Joe drops back five steps
Bud Lite picks up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player
Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket
It's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe
Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone
Joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field
He spots Darnell breaking between defensive backs
Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that Darnell is heading for
The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker
Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral
Darnell dives
The two defensive backs dive
The ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in Darnell's
He clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see
Touchdown
This time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance
Pandemonium
The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes crazy
Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing none of them will hug him
Joe, Bud and the others mob Darnell
'  - Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be a part of again
We leave him staring off into an uncertain future
' - - The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory, congratulating each other
Conspicuous among them are the Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman of the Board of Regents
Looks like the Timberwolves are back
Probably brought the library with them
Hope so
(turning to Galen Howard) Give my sincere congratulations to Coach Winters
He'll be delighted
The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund football field and starts advancing the ball
15,10, touchdown
This brings applause all around
- As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs him, leads him to her dad
Daddy, you remember Darnell
Yes,  do
Great catch, Darnell
Thank you, sir
got somethin' for you
Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained piece of paper
My entrance exam
Got a 92
Coach Winters said you got an 87
He looked it up
(laughing) 'll kill him
walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the fans
He looks for Camille, doesn't see her
Coach Winters comes up next to him
Hell of a throw, Joe
Good to see you back
Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug
And don't worry about the Heisman
We'll gear up for it next year
Joe manages a weary smile
coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him
Both stop as Louanne walks toward them
Bobby smiles to himself in anticipation of her fawning over him
She walks right by him and up to Bud
You still feel like gettin' a beer
Bud smiles
Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to hit on, hails a cheerleader
Bud and Louanne walk off together
Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of his reaction
He's not a football player any more
He's graduating this year
He's still got a bowl game
Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not
So make sure he doesn't violate curfew
Louanne smiles
Winters returns it, and walks away
Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping
(
) An amazing conclusion to a great season
We can see Steve Lattimer down on the bench weeping tears of joy as
goes back to a bowl for the first time in three years
These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll never be able to play pro football without steroids
- Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging Quad paths
Camille approaches from the opposite direction, stops when she sees Joe
What are you doin' here
Waitin' for you
figured you'de have to come through here on your way to dinner
This softens, relaxes her a bit
Shouldn't you be out celebrating
You played real well
need your help with somethin' know 'm not your favorite guy right now, but it's all startin' again
The expectations, the pressure, the talk about the Heisman next year was wonderin' if you'de like to go somewhere, maybe share a six-pack with me
Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again
He pulls a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back
She laughs in spite of herself
They settle again
miss you, Camille
don't like bein' without you
'll think about it
They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long kiss and embrace as we pull up and back
- Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the tunnel to a waiting car
No effigy this time
Tickets are in your coat
Itinerary and player profiles in the briefcase
We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore with the kid from Park
Then we're on to
They continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season, another year in the annals of The Program
