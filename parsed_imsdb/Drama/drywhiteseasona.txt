Rewrite by May 1987 Revised First Draft " , , " Aime Cesaire -: : - Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan school
The students are mainly from middle-class families
School athletics are in progress
The stu- dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept sports ground
, a 47-years-old African laborer is work- ing in the school garden
few feet away is his 15- years-old son  leaning against a wall watching the games
, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is enthusiastically cheering his son , a 15-years-old, who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last leg of the race
The excitement increases as they approach the tape
Ben is beside himself, egging his son with shouts
The young teacher, , standing next to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the father on the back
Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy
The ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan
Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud father pushing his way through the animated boys
As he reaches Johan he pats him on the back
This was your best race
(excited) beat him, Papa
(proudly) You did son
Come on, shower
They walk happily towards the school buildings in conver- sation, Johan being slapped on the back by friends
Ben stops to talk to Gordon who jumps to his feet
'll be expecting you
There isn't much to do, only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers
() 2
: We'll be there, Mr
Ben'sir, Jonathan come to help me
Ben hadn't seen Jonathan
He turns to him
And how's the algebra
Still giving you trouble
(with respect) Just a little, Mr
Ben'sir
Me too
(straightening himself) He's working hard, Mr
Ben'sir, and your money will not be wasted
Emily and me will always thank you
(as he leaves) See you both later
Gordon returns to his work a little distance further group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously
As they near Jonathan, two nudge each other and giggle
Then, one of them trips Jonathan
He falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to attack the boy
Gordon shouts "Jonathan
" The headmaster,
, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action
Jonathan stands panting with rage
He suddenly strides away towards the gate in a rage
(shouting angrily) ya phi
(Where are you going
) Jonathan turns to look at his father and continues to walk off
- The beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area with long rows of low benches
() 3
: Men sit drinking African beer in one-half and one gallon plastics containers
The place buzzes with noise
Several people are touting wares for sale
Suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the drinking area, obviously to cause trouble
The starts to address the clients
Your children are starving and you are drinking
We demand freedom and our fathers are drunk
We ask you to boycott these beer halls
Revolution and drink don't work together
large   , obviously drunk, stands up, a stick in his hand
Since when do children talk like this to their fathers
They need thrashing
The man and several others advance on the boys
The boys run into the serving area, close the doors and start breaking up the place
Two police Land Rovers  to a halt outside
The boys run out through a side en- trance
They are chased by the police who are black
Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years, are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come running out chased by the police
It is prudent for them to run down the street
The boys and police are bearing down on them
Their escape is cut off by the apperance of another police Land Rover
Two policemen, two blacks and two whites join in the capture
Jonathan, Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested
As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their innocence without success and are driven away
-   - The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench along a wall
There is a reception counter with Sgt: Van Zyl in charge
The boys are lined up against a wall
The sergeant stands with a tall blond man with a scar on his chin,
() 4
: The sergeant reads out a name and    looks at Stolz; if he nods the boy stands aside
After     this ritual, the ones that Stolz has chosen are marched    to a waiting police van and driven away
The others are     taken to the cells at the police station, these include    Jonathan and Wellington
- The
The doors open
The 40 years-old- minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets his parishioners as they file out of the church
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, , a clean- cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan -- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen- year-old every father dreams of
Susan greets friends and acquaintances, pausing to chat
mostly formalities
Johan, his eyes on a girl his age
She is with her father, Mr
Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off with her parents
his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed
She takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car, carries the child to the group chatting with , her husband
She shows it off proudly
Ben is chatting, concerned, to a
She looks drawn and worried
() He won't come to church
He lies in bed all day, listening to his headphones
wondered why he wasn't at school
Would it help if  came to see him
He's always seemed a good kid to me
Oh, would you
Of course
'll phone and we can fix a time
Mrs
Coetzee smiles her gratitude
Ben
Ben
She's waving impatiently at him
He crosses back to her

The
The nanny comes forward -- Suzette hands it over
Mrs
Coetzee
She looked worried
She's having trouble with her boy
He won't come to school
So you said you'd have a word with him
Yes
She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately
'  -  - The Du Toit family
Susan is bringing out the salads
Chris, her son-in-law, is at the barbecue, stinging his eyes
Ben is bouncing his grandson, little Hennie, in a small, portable pool
The black nanny sits in attendance in the shade, a towel at the ready
The good life
Suddenly disturbed by
Gordon and Jonathan standing uncertain at the far side of the garden; Gordon's hat pressed flat against his chest, Jonathan defiant
Susan looks up -- as do each in turn -- curious at the intrusion
then the black nanny -- and finally Ben
After a moment, Ben walks up to Gordon
Gordon
What are you doing here
'  - Six cuts, like six knife gashes, revealed on the blood- stained buttocks of Gordon's son, who stands in painful, truculent embarrassment
Ben is shocked by the severity of the canning
That's not why 'm complaining, Mister Ben, sir
If he did wrong, 'd beat him myself
But he didn't
() 6
: He did nothing and they wouldn't listen
They wouldn't believe him
'm sorry, Gordon
But there must be a reason
He says he wasn't doing anything wrong, Mister Ben, sir
And believe him,  know my son
It's an injustice
What about the court
Didn't he state his case
What does he know about court
Before he knew, it was all over
don't think there is anything we can do about it now
Outside, peering     through the half-opened door, is Johan, shocked at what     he sees
Ben tapes Jonathan on the head, he pulls up his     shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious to cover himself     up again
We can get a lawyer to appeal
lawyer
That won't heal Jonathan's buttocks
Susan appears at the door
Ben
'll be out in a minute
She nods, ushering Johan away from the door back outside
You don't understand, Mister Ben, sir
don't want him to have a police record
() () 7
: (') It will be there for  the rest of his life and make it  difficult for him to get a job in  the future
Don't worry, Gordon
'm sure there'll be no record, it's such a minor case
Please don't worry
Ben calls Johan from the outside
Johan, get some iodine from the cupboard
Johan rushes in the house
'm not worried about the wounds
They'll heal in time, Mister Ben, sir
It's the wounds here
(slaps his chest) worry about
Injustice
it festers
Johan comes back with a small bottle of medicine
(to Gordon) Rub it on the wounds and it will help
'  - Ben watches   the black man and his son trudge down the long drive,   the father's arm on the son's shouldre
At the foot of   the drive the nose of an exotic Soweto cab can be seen   waiting
a large butterfly painted on the hood
'  - Ben takes his place at the table
Susan brings a piece of boerwors and a mug of beer
Trouble
Jonathan has been caned, by the police
She places the boerwors and the beer before him
() 8
: He probably deserved it
-   - School grounds of the Orlando Secondary School
Students are milling around in high spirits
One group is putting finishing touches to a banner reading: "no to aparhteid education
" There are two other banners being carried around the school yard, followed by the younger children
They read: "No to the Oppressor's language" "Bantu education is slave education
" , one of the eldest, aged about 18 years calls for silence
The  immediately obey
() You all know why we are going to march
The crowd shouts: 'No to Bantu education' 'No to apartheid' 'Freedom Now'
There must be discipline
We start marching from here and we'll join up with the others at the main road
Please take care of the younger ones
Let's go
The Students start marching led by one of the banners, singing a freedom song
Amongst them is Jonathan and Wellington
They are sing- ing
The march turns round one of the streets
Several groups of students marchers converge to join the march that has already started, including Jonathan's group
There are several banners condeming Bantu education, apartheid, etc
() 9
: Examples:    "  " "   " "  " "    " There are chants of slogans as they march: 'If we learn Afrikaans vorster must learn Zulu
' 'Bantu education
Stinks
Stinks
Stinks
' 'Equal education
Now
Now
Now
' They also start singing a freedom song
Three police Jeeps block the route of the march little distance behind are police troops carriers ('hippos')
About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to approach
As the march gets closer the students' singing increases in volume
The Soweto   police  steps forward with a loud- speaker in   hand
He confronts the lead of the march
He signals for   them to stop
The dogs are straining at their leashes and   their handlers taunt the leading group
Now listen to me, this is an illegal demonstration
order you to disperse immediately
The Students start singing the African national anthem 'Nkosi Sikelele
' Children of 8, 9, 10 years singing lustily with their fists clenched as everyone else
Jonathan and Wellington singing
Camouflauged police scrambling out of Jeeps with guns and tear gas grenades
They stand with the rifles pointing at the marchers
The singing continues
The Commandant confers with a junior officer who hurries to the group of policemen and gives them instructions
The ones carrying tear gas move towards front
The police start donning gas masks
() 10
: This is the last warning
Disperse immediately or  will take action
voice in the crowd shouts "Banutu education
" The crowd shouts back "Stinks, Stinks, Stinks
" The Commandant gives a hand signal
Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog- handlers attack
There is panic with Students running in all directions, several choking
Some of the students start throwing stones at the police, hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black policeman
Without warning,
Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying and seriously wounded, others helped away
Some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they pelt the police with stones
The police in the 'hippos' are jumping off and pursuing Students, some
Woman grabs two of the running children age about 9/10 and hustles them into house
Jonathan and Wellington are running with      a group
In the distance the sound of an
Jeep cuts off their escape, they turn back running      as  are towards them, a little girl drops,      shot in the back
Jonathan shouts to Wellington who       is ahead of him
Wellington
Wellington
Wellington looks back, sees Jonathan trying to help the little girl
He runs back to help
Another girl, aged about 17 years, is also trying to help
Two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house, they are about 18 years old
The girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen shouting hysterically
Shoot me
Come on, shoot me
Shoot me
() 11
: She slumps to the ground crying
Jonathan, Wellington and the Girl are hustled into a crowded van amid punches and kicks from the police
The van drives off leaving the injured Girl on the road, neighbors run to assist the Girl
As the van is passing, see a burning car, in the distance a building on fire; another

- The carnage, the dead, the wounded
The stunned bewilderment of blacks and police alike
even the latter unnerved by their own brutality
- Soweto train rushing through suburb of Johannesburg
train
- The third-class carriage is crowded with African commuters returning to Soweto
The passengers represent all the social and economic strata of Soweto: laborers, factory workers, domestic servants, clerk secretaries, the unemployed, etc
In the carriage, Gordon, returning from work, standing
middle-aged  is standing in the crowded aisle at one end of the carriage
She suddenly shouts: () 12
: (to man in front of her) Careful with your bag
Can't you see where it's touching
#1 (standing half-way down carriage) Can  see where it's touching
Men of today only like looking
Laughter in the carriage
Gordon is also enjoying the joke
#2 (standing by a door) It's the electricity
What has electricity to do with it
few voices also ask same question
#2 Today with the electricity they say: (in an affected voice) 'Darling let's not switch off the light
' Laughter and voice saying "that's true
" #1 (standing very near Gordon) hope you have electricity with those thick glasses of yours
With your eyes you couldn't find anything
More laughter
#3 Tell us, does your wife also wear thick glasses
#2 (quickly) You should know, she's your sister
() 13
: There is more laughter
Suddenly a  jumps on his seat waving his arms -- he's about 40 years old -- in
He cannot take it any more
Quiet
Thulani
Thulani
The noise goes down
They are killing our children and you are making jokes
(
) They say hundreds of children have died and Soweto is burning
- talking about the information
- The white people, they will pay, and soon
'They will pay, they will pay
' Since when have they been killing us, putting us in jails, starving our children to death, taking our land
Hundreds of years
And what have you men done
Only talk, talk, talk
You are not men
Sis
(Shit
) The conversations in the carriage become muted and serious
The train enters Soweto, there is smoke hanging over sev- eral parts of the township, and official buildings are on fire
Suddenly, the passengers are gripped by the seriousness of the situation
There are snatches of conversation such as: "That's the superintendent's office on fire
" " hope the children are home
" "We have to dodge bullets tonight
" "Vorster must hang for this
" " hope the world hears about this

'  - Silence
small three-room Soweto brick house -- The living room is modestly furnished
, Gordon's 40-year-old wife, is sitting on a narrow iron bedstead against the wall, clutching her youngest 2-year-old son -- Her mind is preoccupied
Sitting next to her is a ten-year-old daughter
Gordon is sitting on a chair at the table with his second eldest son, Robert -- aged 14 years -- standing by the side of the table -- sitting on an old easy chair is a Soweto resident with his 15-year-old  standing beside him
(to girl) Are you sure it was Jonathan they took away
The girl glances at her father
He coaxes her to talk
() Yes, baba, with Wellington
- Black parents, waiting
At the counter with Gordon, a large black man, , a friend -- his big easy smile is working hard on a white policeman, the station , about to run out of patience
No, no,  understand, Baas, but is that all the names
There's no other list somewhere
'm telling you
He's not in custody
Have you tried the hospital
Have you tried the mortuary
Gordon sucks in his breath audibly
'm only suggesting the possibilities
But, what about John Voster Square
() 15
: Look, 've tried to help you
Thank you
Stanley walks up to a
You're here too, sis Paulina, who are you looking for
They picked up my girl -- 13-year- old girl
(comforting her) We are all searching
The policeman calls her -- she hurries to the counter
: - white-uniformed assistant leads a line of African parents, reeking of sadness, into a cool room where metal drawers open from the walls
Stanley and  their black lawyer -- the two men seem to be very well-known, people shake hands with them, salute them -- Gordon and Emily's sadness is tinged with anger -- they have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are
Stanley's large hand is placed gently on Emily's shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them
They belong to children, some    in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seemingly unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brought to our attention
woman behind them starts to scream
They look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling
Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her
The assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body
The woman can't, won't leave her dead child
Her friend has to pull her away
() 16
: The crowd parts to let them through
Other women reach out to touch her
Gordon looks into the last drawer, Jonathan is not there
They make their way out past the other parents and a group of mourning women sitting
- Gordon, Emily and their friends cross to Stanley's great white elderly Dodge, this "etembalami" with the big butter- fly
For, amongst other things, he is the owner and driver of a pirate taxi
They get in
Stanley pauses -- looks across at a small red  Beetle parked nearby, waiting
He shakes his head -- the  flashes its lights and drives off
'  - Inside they sit in silence
recovering from the ordeal
Only Emily silently whispers "Thank God, thank God
" After a while
What now
He is our son
we must find him
'll make more inquiries -- John Vorster Square -- the special branch -- but  don't hold out much hope
You're a lawyer, Julius
(laughs) black lawyer
Those Boers
the bastards'll kick him around till they lose him
What about the Baas
If he asks, they will give him an answer
(bitterly) When the boy was flogged he didn't help
Why should he help him now
17
'  - Gordon is at work already -- 8  -- mowing the lawn
He's intense, unsmiling, burdened as he goes about his task, expertly
Sounds of  and   coming from inside
'  - Ben and Johan, in robes, their hair still wet from their showers, having an imaginary boxing match
Johan has Ben on the ropes, backs him out of the house
' Ben adjusts the sash of his robe and takes the offensive towards Johan, as he sees Gordon
Hi, Gordon
No response
Ben does a double-take and stops playing
(to Johan) Hold it, champ
He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry, Johan follows behind
Gordon, you okay
No response again
Gordon continues to work
Ben and Johan exchange puzzled looks
Isn't this Jonathan's day to help you
How is he, recovering
Gordon stops, switches  the , stands not looking at Ben
don't know, Mister Ben, sir -- the police took him
Again
What for
() 18
: They arrested many
They even deny they've got him
He's disappeared
Disappeared
He's a child -- why didn't you tell me
Gordon just looks at him, sadly, patiently
Okay
'll see what  can find out
Ben walks off with Johan as Gordon  the

Probably nothing, but he's worried

He dials a number

Hello, Dan
No

until the snaps him out of his thoughts

Cries and whistles rise through the still, warm air from a game of schoolboy rugby being played below us by immaculately-fitted teams
On another part of the field Gordon's lawnmower off to the side -- two figures pace -- slowly -- one white, one black -- overlays all this
strange
ironically African
Mister Ben, sir
If it was me, all right
And if it was Emily, all right
We are not young
But he's out child
My time and your time, it's passing
But the time of our children is coming
And now if they kill our children -- if we let them -- what is it that we lived for
(places a hand on Gordon's shoulder -- comforting) What can we do, Gordon
You or We can't change it
That day, Mr
Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing
But if we had
if someone heard what we had to say this would not have happened
It's a terrible thing, Gordon -- God knows 'm sorry
But you have other children to live for
'll help them too with their schooling
() 23
: (interrupting) How did he die, Mister Ben, sir
told you, Gordon
He died on the day of the riots
That's what  they say
But  got to know for  certain
How can have peace
must know how my son died and  where they buried him
The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle
The kids run off past Ben and Gordon
Gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and  the
Gordon
The police -- if they've said
don't care what they say
He is my child
God is my witness today: cannot stop before  know what happened and where he lies
His body belongs to Emily and me
And drives away -- chugging across the field
leaving Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching
From his: in the school behind -- a worried headmaster watches
We hear his voice over
(
) This business of Gordon's son
Be careful, Ben
These are not normal times -- one has to make allowances
: The car park
He and Ben are getting into their cars at the end of the day
() 24
: Don't worry
'm no crusader
've known Gordon a long time, that's all
understand -- it's your Christian duty to your neighbor
Something like that -- yes
Just don't get too close
Teachers must stay out of politics
Love to Susan
And drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his head at the man's obtuseness
- Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with a bucket and a pierced tin
Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child
Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby: Look who's coming
It's baba
Emily turns to look
She immediately realizes that some- thing is wrong
She drops the tin and walks a few steps toward the gate
Gordon sees her and stops
Emily starts to break down
Oh, no
oh no, Lord
Gordon hurries to embrace her
(sobbing and repeating) Please don't tell me
Gordon starts to lead her to the house
Margaret, Emily's neighbor, comes, hurries, helps her, comforts her, escorting them to the house

- Stanley and Gordon are driving along Soweto main road
10-years-old  stops the car
'  - (to Stanley) Baba,  heard you're looking for Wellington
He's out, Baba
Where is he
Where is he
He's with some boys at Dube's shop
Thank you very much
You've worked like a man
(turning to Gordon) Let's go
Stanley turns the car round and drives off at speed
'  - Wellington and a few pals are standing outside the shop -- they greet Stanley as they see the car -- Stanley shouts back greeting
Take it easy, boys
Hey Wellington
Wellington comes to the car
He's limping, wearing sunglasses
As he's approaching the car, Stanley opens the back door for him
He enters and removes the glasses
Stanley notices a deep scar from the forehead to the cheek
What happened
Don't tell me
Did they do that to you
() 26
: Wellington has a nervous arm-twitch
and nods to the question
(anxiously) want to know what happened to Jonathan
Isn't he out yet
(pause) last saw him weeks ago
Jonathan is dead
have to know how he died
' Sizette and   Chris with the family at dinner
Suzette is passed the   Rand Daily Mail newspaper by Chris, folded at an article   headlined: " "    by Melanie Bruwer
Isn't that tragic
Jonathan was such a nice boy
Even played with my Johan when they were small, God
And he was such a nice boy, well- mannered
You said he was very bright at school
Chris helps himself to more
Suzette looks at the paper
Well, this kind of journalism doesn't help the situation
Look at her face
What does she look like
The Rand Daily Mail always exaggerates
() 27
: She passes the paper to Ben
He looks at Melanie's pic- ture: she looks 30 years old, long black hair, large dark eyes with a fierce, unsettling, uncompromising stare, a small nose and a generous and sensual mouth
Looks quite attractive to me
Chris and Johan laugh
(he surveys the article; then with a serious tone) '
Is only the latest in scores of black youths who have disappeared whilst in police custody
' What does she expect
They're out of control
Give then an inch and they take a hundred miles
It's in their nature
The only language they understand is force
Chris, Jonathan was fifteen, like me
Would you use force on me
You're not a terrorist
If you were -- like an increasing number of them, you'd deserve it
Look, every time you pick up the newspaper
(interrupts; focusing on the paper) My God, one hundred shot
They didn't have to kill them
This bloody Bruwer woman reports one hundred shot, but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first
thought the idea was to give them their own areas, banstustans
Let them live with their own kind
No chance of conflict then
Everybody's happy
() 28
: And who would do the work
Pardon
The work, who'd do it
You for a start
Come on
Help me clear these dishes
As Johan stands, to clear the table
He turns to his father with a smile, and shrugs -- an irritated Suzette joins them
'  () - The small dark room is crowded
The one oil lamp -- on the table -- At the table sits Gordon
his glasses on the end of his nose
Emily is sitting by the stove
Robert stands beside her chair, watching, listening
The youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed
Wellington is sitting beside Gordon at the table
There is something wild in his manner
He looks everywhere as if he is scared of being attacked unawares
The black cleaner from John Vorster Sq
stands near the table
Gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten document
'On the second day of our detention at John Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors
We were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks
This for a long time
' Wellington nods and gets more paranoid
The black cleaner puts an understanding hand on his shoulder
'On one day me and Jonathan
' Gordon pauses
steadies himself
pushes his glasses up his nose
clears his throat
() 29
: '
We were asked questions for the whole day and night by Capt
Stolz and different policemen -- they never stopped
They tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school, that we were working for the
and got money from overseas
Capt
Stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find Toni Mtimkulu -- Everytime they asked question, they beat us
It was bad beating
' Wellington nods again
Emily closes her eyes to shut out the image
'We told them we had done nothing and didn't know about all the things they are asking us; on two occasion they put a wet bag over my head and  -- couldn't breathe --  thought  was going to die
One day  heard Jonathan being beaten
He was screaming and crying, and then a noise like tables and chairs being knocked down, and Capt
Stolz shouting "you bastard, get up, do you hear me
" Ngubene, don't pretend here, get up
" Then the next day heard he had gone to hospital and never saw him again
' There's a long silence
Gordon closes his eyes and struggles with his grief
Emily sobs, Robert looks on in anger
Then, finally, Gordon offers a pen to Wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state- ment, when
Suddenly there   is the sound of a
Wellington rushes   to the front window and peers outside; then panics, fear   in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom and jumps through the   window
Everyone in the room is bewildered
The front door bursts open
Emily sits impassively look- ing at the five policemen (two whites and three Africans)
The youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry
Emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns to her chair
() 30
: Stay right where you are
He notices the papers on the table and picks them up
He looks at them and realizes their importance
Capt
Stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and its occupants
Lieutenant Venter hands him the papers
He goes through them, nodding to himself as he reads silently
He folds them neatly and puts them into his inside jacket pocket
He walks up to Gordon
(to Gordon) On your feet
So, you must be Gordon Ngubene
Gordon doesn't answer
He turns to the cleaner who automatically stands
We know each other, don't we
Calmly, he paces round the room looking around, then when he reaches the bed where the 10-years-old girl is watch- ing terrified, he pulls off the blankets, yanks the girl off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed
The child cries
Robert the brother goes to his sister and hugs her as he glares at Stolz with anger and hatred
(turning to Venter) Gert, in daardie kammer
(Gert, that room) (turning to the other one) Jaimie, in die ander
(Jamie, the other room) Niks, Kaptein
(Nothing, Captain) Take the bastards away
The other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty- handed
Gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as they are handcuffed by the African Security Police
Over his shoulder Gordon manages to give Emily one last look, as he's hustled out of the house
() 31
: Emily sits motionless, anger in her face
She can hear the sound of the
Margaret (her neighbor) appears at the door
'  - Behind Ben's house, are the servants' quarters attached to the garage
Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself workshop
The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial rugby player, of his family, school staff and reproduction
On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at university
He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe- rack with several pipes
His indulgence is a comfortable easy chair
Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben
He's hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper
His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his chair
He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light
He sits in his chair: Gordon's voice rises in his thoughts
(
) That day, Mister Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing
God as my witness today:  must know what happened and where he lies
His body belongs to Emily and me
He mutters -- more a prayer than a curse
Jeezus -- Jeezus -- Jeezus Christ
Good night, Papa
() 32
: Johan is entering, knocking on the half-open door
He's in his pajamas and dressing gown, ready for bed
Ben looks up at him
Johan kisses his father who suddenly clasp his son hard, clinging to him for dear life
The boy throws his arms around his dad's neck
Oh, Papa
Susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee
She's had a bath -- her hair is wet -- and she's in her housecoat
Ben and Johan don't notice her approach
She watches sympathetically for a moment, then
Coffee
Come on, Johan
Time for bed
Johan pulls back from his father's arms
Yes, son
Go and get some sleep
The boy nods and leaves
As Susan rests the cup of coffee on the desk before Ben
She notices the Rand Daily Mail
'm proud of you, Ben
what you've done for that family
But darling, you shouldn't take these things to heart so much
What more can you do about it
don't know
'm just tired, suppose
(stroking his hair gently) Come, come to bed
Her housecoat has fallen open
He lifts his face to hers and kisses her
will, in a minute
'll just put the thoughts of Standar Six away
They mustn't be lost to posterity
() 33
: She chuckles, satisfied, leaving him
He picks up his cup and drinks
He thinks again for a moment
Then he removes a photocopied letter from an envelope and reads: (
) '
Seeking the whereabouts of a certain Jonathan Ngubene, regret to inform you we have no record of anyone of that name
' - Afrikaan boys in uniform hunching over their desks writing
On the blackboard: the date and history test: What year did the first white man arrive in South Africa
When was the Battle of Blood River
Who was the Zulu chief who was defeated at the battle of Isanadlawana
Who was the president of the first Afrikander Republic
Give the route of the Voortrekkers from the cape
Ben walks through the aisles and from time to time oppor- tunities to glance at the window at Gordon's motionless tractor sitting in the field
He turns back   and notices a boy focusing on the ceiling
His pen in his   mouth, trying desperately to find the answers
Ben    has a smile, then crosses to him, bends down and strikes a   similar pose
The class breaks up into laughter
(slapping the student's back) All right, time up
Hand in your test
Moans from the students
-  - Ben appears on the other side of the veranda
He is in Cloete's company -- the little big man
grey hair
65 years old
The headmaster
They stop in before Ben's colleague, Vivier, passing, shakes hands with him
woman arrives and waits
Cloete says something to Ben, then laughs
() 34
: Ben smiles and Cloete goes into the office
The woman approaches Ben
talks to him
they both turn back to see
Emily standing there, a soaking headscarf tied native- style around her head
Ben thanks the woman and crosses the yard
What's happened, Emily
(calmly) 'm sorry, Baas
but it's Gordon
- Stanley is waiting in his car
His sunglasses on his nose
The    to give the end of the tea inter- val
Ben walks out with Emily to Stanley's car
Stanley gets out, they stare at each other
Finally Stanley breaks the silence
(putting out his hand) How's it
'm Stanley
heard about you
Ben feels a little uncomfortable
This is Stanley Makhaya
He helps us all the time
Stanley opens the door to Emily
Don't worry too much, Emily, 'm sure Gordon will be home in a few days
Stanley slaps the door with a big laugh
He gets into the car and drives away
perplexed
35
-    - Gordon stands facing the wall, his arm raised
He has wetted his trousers
Captain Stolz is pacing behind him
Lieutenant Venter, sitting on the edge of the desk, is smoking
Come on, Kaffir, talk
Please, 've done nothing
All tried to do was to find
Stolz interrupts him with a blow to his face
As Gordon drops his hands, the officer shouts to him
Up with those bloody arms
We don't like gramophone records here
Now who has been giving you informations
Gordon doesn't answer
The Lieutenant walks slowly to him, calmly removes his fag-end of cigarette from his lips and stubs it on Gordon's neck
(very calmly) Why don't you answer the Captain, han
He walks back to his place
Captain Stolz opens the door and shouts: Johannes
The bag
Gordon has a look of terror
Immediately a black security policeman walks in with a bag
All right
Johannes goes to wet the bag in a bucket in a corner
Lieutenant Venter grabs Gordon, throws him onto a chair and handcuffs his hands behind the chair
() 36
: Stolz is supervising
The Lieutenant places the wet bag over Gordon's head and ties it
Gordon starts groaning and wriggling
: (  ) - Under the gaze of a uniformed  in a bulletproof glass cage, Ben fills in a slip, then hands it to the Policeman, who then makes a phone call
Whilst waiting, Ben notices a video surveillance camera
Just then, a 20-year-old African girl, Afro-style hair, is brought in held on both sides by two white policemen
She is taken into a lift
Ben watches them enter the lift and follows the progress of lift to the 10th floor
The Policeman stamps the slip and gives it to Ben
Somebody will meet you on second floor
Ben enters a lift
(  ) - Gordon's still sitting on the chair, slumped -- Johannes removes the handcuffs as the Lieutenant removes the wet bag
Gordon is breathing heavily and semi-conscious
Suddenly Captain Stolz punches him heavily on the face
Gordon drops on the floor with blood gushing from his nose and mouth
Captain Stolz grabs him by his collar
(hysterically) Come on you bloody black bastard
Who has been telling you lies
The
Stolz drops Gordon and walks to answer
(calmly) 'll be down immediately, Colonel
: 37
'  - Behind the large desk, Colonel  replaces the tele- phone receiver; there is a  on the door -- and a young policeman ushers in Ben
Colonel Viljoen stands and ex- tends a hand
Come in, Mr
Du Toit, come in
How do you do
They shake
He's a large, friendly man, ruddy face, gray crew cut
Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen
used to watch you play for the Transvaal
You were one of the great wing forwards
(grinning) Long time ago
There's a  on the door
Come in
The door opens revealing Captain Stolz
Captain Stolz, Mr
Du Toit
Captain Stolz nods correctly, unsmiling, comfortably dressed, English-style
He shakes hands with Ben
Then walks toward the window and stands there
As he's watching Ben, he begins to clean out his pipe with a silver penknife; (to Ben) Do sit down
Ben sinks into a low leather chair before the desk
Be- hind him he can feel Stolz's eyes
Viljoen peers through his half-moons at the letter in front of him
The pipe scraping continues behind Ben's ear
All right now, Gordon Ngubene
() 38
: Well
to put it simply, Colonel
(smiling) 'm always grateful for that
thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding could help straighten out
Like what
know him, Colonel
He works at my school
He's done work for me too
And you feel you know him enough to vouch for him
Yes, after so many years
10 years
Gordon's not the type to get himself in trouble
He's an honest, hard-working, church- going man
Ha
You'd be surprised how many honest, decent, church-going men we come across during a working day
He leans back comfortably in his chair
It's routine, Mr
Du Toit -- a routine enquiry
Cleaning up these townships we must leave no stone unturned
appreciate that -- but Gordon would never
(interrupting) Not an easy task either -- the press screaming blue murder -- especially the English
() () 39
: (') And they'll be the first to squeal if the Reds took over, make no mistake
Rushing back overseas clutching their bloody British passports
Have you any idea what will happen here if we don't follow every lead
We have a duty -- obligation
You have your job -- we have ours
Ben hastens to reassure him
He looks directly at Ben, frank, open, trustworthy
Colonel -- believe me, 'm with you all the way
But in this case -- 'm sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent
After all, we're all human
We all make mistakes sometimes
Viljoen laughs again
We are indeed, Mr
Du Toit -- we are indeed
Though there's many who might need persuading as to that fact
Then
authority
Mr
Du Toit
While you're here, would you mind if  asked you a few questions about Ngubene
(genuinely) Colonel, 'd welcome it
Good
There's another pause
The Colonel takes out a fountain pen -- unscrews it -- and arranges a sheet before him before speaking
Shall we start with his son
() 40
: Jonathan
The eldest
Yes
He died some time ago
Viljoen doesn't react
What do you know about Gordon's activities since Jonathan's death
The noise stops behind
Nothing, Colonel
Did Gordon ever discuss the death with you
Of course he did -- he was upset
The Colonel pauses
But he accepted the truth
He is a religious man
in the end he would have resigned himself to it
Would have
You mean he didn't
Was he angry
Rebellious
Come on, Colonel
If one of your kids died
(nods to family picture on desk) and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried, wouldn't you be upset
We told him how his son died, Mr
Du Toit
() 41
: Ben turns back, surprised
You have a son, Mr
Du Toit
The Colonel looks up at him
the first sign of steel in his eyes
then back to the papers
The noise starts again behind Ben
Does he burn and destroy -- everything he can lay his hands on
No -- and neither does mine
That's what  can't understand
after everything the government does for them
(looks straight at Ben) Think about it, Mr
Du Toit
We're for you, not against you
(irritably) 've never doubted it, Colonel
It's you who appear to be doubting me
These questions
You're making me feel like a criminal
There's a moment's pause -- then a burst of laughter
'm sorry, Mr
Du Toit
'm sorry
It's force of habit
Once a policeman, always a policeman, eh
More laughter -- Ben joins in
Viljoen stands, signalling an end to the meeting
'  - Johan is sitting, waiting, in the parked car
the He's bored
' As soon as we're satisfied he's innocent, he will be released
We know what we're doing, Mr
Du Toit
You want your wife and that boy of yours to sleep safe tonight, don't you
() 42
: Ben nods, smiles, makes for the door, turns
One last favor, Colonel
Fire away
Gordon's wife -- she's very worried
May she bring him some food and a change of clothes while he's still here
No problem
Thank you for your help
Thank you
'll rely on you, then
Will you find your way out
think so
And thanks
feel much happier now
Good
And give my regards to your father-in-law -- tell him we'll have a drink sometime -- maybe go to a game
will
Goodbye
And the door shuts behind him
There's silence for a moment
Viljoen staring at the closed door -- Stolz looks expectantly at him
(pointing up) Is the little bird singing yet
'm working on it
Good
Stolz leaves, shutting the door behind him
: 43
Ben opening his car
Johan is sitting in the front seat
As Ben gets into the car, he glances at the John Vorster Square building
'  - Ben is motoring through and out of Johannesburg
Johan is silent beside him, impatient
talked to them
Gordon will be released soon
The colonel was very understanding
Did you see Gordon
Ben suddenly realizes that he didn't ask to see Gordon
(embarrassed) No
Did they say anything about Jonathan
No, but
Johan, he is dead
We can't do anything for him
Don't mention this visit to your mother
Okay
- Suzette and Susan in the kitchen arranging the dessert tray
The kitchen is surprisingly neat
is coming from the dining room
What extra-mural interest
Champion of political detainees
Ben comes in to open extra bottles of wine, hears Susan's line
(laughing, turns to Ben) Is that right, Papa
() 44
: That's right, Suzette
But, only one detainee: 'Gordon
' Our Gordon
That's right
(disbelieving) My God
What on earth for
Susan leaves the kitchen without a word, with the dessert plates on the tray to the dining room
-   - Susan reaches  and the minister  , with their dessert plates
The candles have burned down amid the detritus of dinner: glasses disarranged and dirty, the cloth spotted with food and wine and ashes
In addition to Viviers, dateless, and Bester and his wife, the school's headmaster, Cloete and his wife
-  - Ben hastily uncorking a bottle of wine while talking to Suzette
It must be a mistake, Papa
Of course it is
went down there, told them
They're looking into it
Went down where
John Vorster Square
Suzette giggles, amazed
You old devil you
Does Ma know
No
And you're not going to tell her
() 45
: pause
She looks at him
Be careful
don't want my favorite Papa in trouble, Gordon or no Gordon
She ruffles his hair, smiles, kisses him
They go back into the dining room
- More wine
Viviers
Not for me, Oom Ben
'm drunk enough
Mrs
Cloete
Please
Ben serves her
Susan passes to fetch milk jug and sugar basin from the chine cupboard
(to Mrs
Bester) Oh,  saw those sheets you liked, Sally, on sale at Bloom's
Will you be free on Wednesday afternoon
have one or two other things to buy
- Susan enters the kitchen
As she is about to place the jug and basin on the table next to the tray with cups of the same set, there is a knock at the door
(turning to the door) Come in
The door opens and Stanley steps in
() 46
: (surprised) Who are you
What do you want
: - Ben and guests hear Susan
Ben jumps up, hurries to the door
Viviers starts to follow
- Ben stops at the door, sees Stanley, turns to Viviers
It's all right
Viviers returns to his seat as Ben shuts the door behind him
Oh, it's you
hum
Stanley, isn't it
(to Susan) That's all right, darling
Ben leads Stanley out of the kitchen, closing the door behind him
intrigued
'  - Lewinson is at the phone, behind him his wife, too, is entertaining guests for dinner
Friday night, man
'm no doctor, 'm not on standby all the bloody time
Can't they wait 'til Monday
'  - Dan
'm standing here with Gordon's clothing in my hand
It's bloodstained
() () 47
: (') There are broken teeth in the pocket
Monday may be too late
(pause) The lawyer has been banned
Stanley is waiting, his great hand on his hips, the other one on Emily's shoulder
She is sitting on a chair
Obviously, Stanley doesn't expect a positive response
- (interested) Do you mean Julius Nqakula
(pause) Too bad, he's a good lawyer
Why are you getting so involved, Ben
'  - 'm just trying to help Gordon
You represented many cases, tell me, does this happen often
(pause) But Gordon's not political
(pause) Okay, Dan, 'm sorry for disturbing your weekend
Ben replaces the phone
Turns to Emily and Stanley
He agrees to see you tomorrow and will apply to the supreme court for an interdict to stop any assaults on Gordon
And, we'll find out what's going on
You're all right, Lanie
Ben can just hear Emily's soft voice
Thank you, Baas
Come on, sisi
Tomorrow it'll all be first-class again
48
- Laughter again
Ben has rejoined the party in the lounge
The women are together talking, laughing and the men on their own
More coffee, anyone
General assent
The security police don't arrest people for nothing, Ben
Leave it alone
They could make a mistake
Blacks lead double lives
One you see and one you don't
These people surprise you all the time
(joking) That's what  like about them
We're not concerned with 'blacks
' We're talking about good man and very loyal
(serving coffee to Cloete) And a hard worker too
hard worker
had to get rid of him
Susan doesn't react
She leaves to join the womens' group
What
fired him a few days before he was arrested for staying away from work for days
And for the sake of the school  say good riddance
What do you mean 'good riddance'
() 49
: have a responsibility for the children
These are troubled times, Ben, we can't trust the natives any more
You have to be extra careful about any influences, Oom Ben
Even their churches are breeding grounds for all sorts of evil ideas
Gordon's not subversive and definitely not a Communist
Then he's got nothing to worry about
Except his three teeth
Our government mustn't allow such things to happen
After all, it's a Christian government
(turning to Bester) What do you say, Dominee
Bester doesn't answer
(irritably) 'm not talking about the government
believe in our government, damn it
His sharp tone surprises everybody
He quiets
Look,  know the police often know more than we do
'm not questioning that
'm as loyal as the next man
But  do know Gordon Ngubene
there is something wrong
There's a moment's embarrassed silence, broken by Suzette's entrance with a tray of glasses and a bottle of brandy
(putting the tray in front of Ben) Anything else, Papa
() 50
: Ben starts pouring, and offers the first glass to Bester
Dominee
Bester shakes his hand
Nee Dankie
Ben hands the glass to Viviers
Immediately Viviers raises his glass and laughingly says: Oom, Ben, may your problems be small ones
(  ) - Gordon is undoing his trousers
Venter roughly drops the trousers and pushing him to the floor
He handcuffs him while Johannes pulls off the trousers and underpants, and manacles his ankles
Johannes fetches a rod
Venter goes to a cupboard, pulls out two electric wires with electrodes attachments and places them on the desk
All the preparation is done with practiced efficiency
From the adjoining room there are angry shouts of a woman
Venter and Johannes place the rod between Gordon's elbow- joints and the back of his knees
The door opens
Gordon has a look of terror on his face
(
) Sorry 'm late
Captain Stolz enters carrying a thickish file under his arms, goes straight to the desk and sits down
Johnannes, the table
Johannes moves the table in line with the desk
Lieutenant Venter and Johannes lift the trussed Gordon and the ends of the rod between the desk and table
() 51
: You're a heavy shitface
Too much mealie porridge
Captain Stolz holds Gordon by the head and swings him like a pendulum
How do you feel today
Ready to fly
Very calmly Captain Stolz pulls out some papers from the file
(pointing one sheet of paper) Yes, Mister Ngubene, we know about this Wellington
and
(pointing another affidavit) We know about him
and him Now, we want the names of the others
And today you're going to tell us
The  in the next room  louder than before -- that one is a real and tough activist -- (to himself) Bloody woman
(to Johannes) Water
As Johannes is fetching the bucket of water
Venter goes to the cupboard and stays there
'Samson' is ready, Captain, shall switch him on
Johannes empties the bucket over Gordon
Stolz attaches the terminal to Gordon's earlobes
(to Venter) Okay
Gert
Gordon is given a short burst of electric shock
(reacts) Hai
() 52
: That was a small taste of 'Samson
' We have a whole day
knock at the door
Kom
black policeman in uniform
, enters with a letter in his hand
What do you want
letter for you, Captain
Stolz goes to take the letter and turns to place it on his desk
He notices Seroke still standing
What are you bloody-well waiting for
No reply, Captain
Get out of here
Seroke leaves
(to Gordon) Now about these affidavits who told you to collect them
The Who recruited you
Gordon mumbles something
What
He bends forward to hear, and Gordon's swollen, puffy eyes hold his gaze
don't know anything about the You've had your chance
Now you're going to shit

- Dominee Bester is preaching from the pulpit
God created the whole human race so that they could occupy the entire earth
He decreed how long each nation should flourish, and what the boundaries of each territory should be
Our task is to preserve that creative diversity
Behind him, in his deacon's black tails, Ben listens with clasped hands
On the opposite side, another man is lis- tening, standing in the love of his family, Cloete
Brothers and sisters, like our forebears, the Voortrekkers, who trekked into the wilderness preserve the Afrikanere way of life given to them by God
Today, we also live in times of great danger
Let not fear overcome you
Cling to the ways of justice and truth preserved by our leaders
So shall God be honored
' The faces    of his friends scattered among the pews, Suzette and Susan    listening intently, Johan beside her visibly bored, his    eyes wandering to the Cloete's daughter at the end of    the pew
So shall the Afrikaner people flourish
The organ plays the opening notes to a hymn, the congre- gation rises and sings

'  - Ben's garage/workshop -- the door is open
Ben and Johan are together building a strong desk for Johan
The  offers  to keep them company
Susan is confronting Ben
Why didn't you tell me you'd been down to John Vorster Square
What difference would it have made
'm your wife, damn it
She turns the  , irritably
didn't want to upset you
Upset me
It upsets me when you share your bloody secrets with a child
Johan is embarrassed
Ben glances at him
Johan shrugs and shakes his head "not me
" Ben planes on
Ben
Ben
Look at me for God sakes
(turns to Johan) Johan uit met jou
Johan leaves
(posing down the plane) Now what
We have a good life
We may not have everything we might have had if
(interrupts) If 'd been more ambitious
() 55
: (looking at him) Ben, what's happening
(pause) Sometimes it seems to me  don't know you
Ben looks at her
Her tone is panic, urgent
She looks afraid
He crosses over to her, takes her in his arms
What's happening -- it's something 've never had to face -- deal with -- before
He's the gardener for God's sake, not one of the family
Be patient with me
When Gordon is free you'll have me all to yourself again
promise
(nuzzling into his chest) Ben
We're growing old
Nonsense
One's as old as he feels
feel young and very attractive
can still do my duty
She smiles up at him, chuckles, and then they kiss
Johan interrupts
Papa
(smiling indulgently at Johan's interruption) _______________________________ Stanley's here, Papa
Johan leaves
Oh, bloody hell
() 56
: Susan exclaims in angry frustration and flees
Stanley appears at the garage door
He stands
Gordon's dead
What
The news leaves Ben speechless
Stanley continues in flat, emotionless tones
The bastards say he committed suicide
hanged himself
Ben, recovering from the shock
Suicide
is that what they told Emily -- poor woman
They didn't tell her
She heard it on the radio like the rest of us
contacted Lewinson immediately
He then rung the police to ask why Emily wasn't informed
Would you believe it, they said they were sorry, and they didn't know where to contact her
Ben walks slowly out of the garage in deep thoughts -- Stanley follows him
- (almost to himself) God
never thought Gordon could commit suicide
Did you understand me
said, they said he committed suicide
How do we know
Gordon wasn't a coward
() 57
: Yes, but
(interrupts aggressively) What do you mean 'but'
What about Timol who they said had jumped from a top-floor window
What about Ngudle
What about Mosala
Joyi
Malele
They all died in that John Vorster Square
All suicide, eh
Ben stares at him
There is something like a strange silence between them
Ben is confused and Stanley is staring at him
Ben breaks this embarrassing mood
Anything  can do to help
He's got brothers
(surprised) Brothers
'm his brother, man, we all are
We'll take care of everything
(with pride) That's the African way
Stanley, 'd like to see Gordon
Don't look for trouble, man
You know there are riots all over Soweto
You're out of it
Why don't you stay out
Don't you understand
've got to go
(with a mischievous smile) You got to go
Of course, Lanie
the last farewell
But we have to be careful
'  - Stanley drives sportingly as he talks to Ben, seated in the back
() 58
: We expected it
How can you talk like that
guy gets picked up by the
he's part of history, man
You mean you had no hope, you didn't believe he'd be released
Hope's a white word, Lanie
It's not hope we need
There's silence for a moment
Well, thank God Emily has you to lean on, Stanley
Emily is like my sister
We go back many years
Do you belong to the xhosa tribe too
am an African
That's all
(looking through the rear mirror) Comprende
am an African too
Stanley turns abruptly

Next you'll have me believing we grew up in the same country, same laws, same freedom, same everything

- (like a tour guide) We are now about to leave the white jungle and entering the land of love and glory
The car approaches a huge perimeter notice: " " Ben is driven into a different world; children playing in dirty streets, in wrecks of cars, open spaces devoid of vegetables, smoke from large rubbish dumps, burnt-out skeletons of buses, beer halls and buildings
Clusters of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance
So this is Soweto
(like an actor, with big expansive gesture) Land of love and glory, Lanie
(turning suddenly to Ben) But watch out for the police and army
They're patrolling all the time
The car follows an isolated broken stretch of tarred road hill cluttered with rusty tins, cardboard containers, bottles
- group of young children playing under the blinding sun in a muddy ditch, notice the big painted butterfly on the hood of Stanley's car
They wave and scream at Stanley in their language and he screams back at them
Two little girls start running, heading toward the car
Stanley notices the red  parked in a corner
He man- euvers and parks his car nearby
(opening door) Hurry up, Lanie

' modern funeral parlor with its name painted on the side: "   ()
" Stanley notices the two little girls with dusty smiling faces, standing there waiting for him
(checking his pants' pockets) No sweets today
'm sorry, babies
The children give Stanley a coy disbelieving look as they watch him go with the "white man
" ' On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag and a camera
The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly greeting -- it's  , the Rand Daily reporter -- and keep moving
Ben turns back for a moment
Her face seems familiar to him
He would like to talk to her, but there is no time
Stanley is already inside
- Ben and Stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively- dressed in a dark suit
Gordon's coffin stands as one of many in the room
Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit
His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted, blackish purple
There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips
Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker
The man opens Gordon's shirt and reveals the bruised and battered chest
() 61
: Stanley observes Ben who looks at the wounds with horror
Then another command from Stanley and the undertaker opens the shirt to the waist
Ben's ashen
Stanley thanks the man and turns to leave
Ben remains a minute
He shuts his eyes tightly
Now he saw it
Now he must believe it
He must accept that this battered corpse is Gordon
As he follows Stanley, he thanks the undertaker
- Outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and Stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for Ben by the car
The same two little girls approach Stanley who gives them some coins -- they run off happily
Ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight
Stanley glares at Ben, who is pale, shaken and silent
They get into the car in silence
(turning to Ben) 'The living close the eyes of the dead
The dead open the eyes of the living
' Stanley starts the car
Please, take me to Emily
Stanley looks at him
Look, we'd took one hell of a chance to get here, let's not push it
really have to see her, Stanley
Stanley drives off
(determined; looking through rearview mirror) said don't push it
have to keep you alive
What's more the house is full of mourners
() 62
: They drive in silence
then: What are your thoughts now
What do you mean
(aggressively) Come on
know you came to see the body
What do you think now
(exposed) cannot think
'm confused
You either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version
For Christ sake, just get off my back, Stanley
Okay
It was a simple question
Stanley turns his   and   invades the car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust
- The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the leafy calm of the white suburb
The "Bantu"  is   on the radio under Stanley's animated conversation with Ben
You know, Lanie, when you run a taxi, especially a pirate taxi like me, you have eyes and ears everywhere
Even when a policeman farts in his bed you know
People want a reference book, a permit to stay in Soweto, a house, anything, we taxi drivers know the routes
'll tell you something
news bulletin in African language interrupts the music
Stanley listens
() 63
: Shit
What
Dr
Hassiem has been picked up
Who's he
Stanley silently pulls up along the curb and comes to rest at Ben's gate
'  -  - Dr
Hassiem is the doctor we got to represent Emily at Gordon's autopsy
We wanted the truth
Ben suddenly realizes the significances
He would have testified
Bloody hell
smart move by your Boer brothers
They have silenced Hassiem
His report has to be important
We can only use what we have
Therefore, Lewinson must get a very good advocate
(pause) If only we could get   hold of this Hassiem's report
What's the use
It's one big game and we blacks are merely spectators
Hey Lanie, can one be a spectator as he's being kicked around
He laughs
() 64
: It's not a question of being spectators
The courts are impartial, the law is what matters
(quite seriously) That's what you all say
have to move man
Your neighbors
Now, be careful
They will put their marks on you
Who
Stanley takes an empty cigarette packet from his pocket, he writes on it
You'll find out
(handing the packet to Ben) In case you need me
Don't give your name -- just say 'Lanie' phoned -- right
Ben gets out of the car
Now tomorrow at ten
(interrupting) Sharp
At our smart liberal friend's office, yeh
Good night
Stanley drives vigorously away
Ben walks slowly and thoughtfully towards his house
He notices Susan watching him through the window
He slumps on a chair on the veranda as Susan comes out of the house followed by Johan -- they both stand slightly worried at his moroseness
went to Soweto and saw Gordon's body
They have lied to me, my own people -- they killed him saw the body
() 65
: Johan looks horrified
Ben, you're not a doctor
His death was announced officially
They wouldn't say anything unless they were certain of their facts
(more animated) Facts
There's a doctor who participated at the autopsy Doctor Hassiem and he
(interrupts) You mean the Indian doctor who's been arrested
It was in the five o'clock news, Papa
That's him, he represented Emily at the autopsy
(suddenly desperate) Ben, 'm sorry about Gordon's death, but please for all our sakes, forget about this whole thing
Let's get back to a normal life
Can  have a drink
brandy
You always know what  need
Johan hurries into the house
(pleading) Please, Ben, 'm frightened
She turns and walks into the house, leaving Ben
66
- The large Soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for burials
The chief mourners, Emily, Robert, his sister, Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are standing on either side of the
Gordon's coffin is in the grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave
There are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are youths
There are several local reporters and overseas television reporters
The police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs
Before  conclude,  have to say we are tired of making this journey every day, sometimes twice in one day, burying our children, and those, like our departed brother, Ngubene who were merely seeking the truth; and those who have been denounced by traitors amongst us; and those who have been brutally killed for no reason, yes  shall say it, by the police
Let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of God; let them listen to our peaceful and just demands; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek forgiveness, then listen to God
The crowd roars:   "Amanda
Amanda
" The Priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in
At the end of the hymn
We will have a few words from Mr
Pilani our father and leader
The crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised
The funeral has now become a political demonstration
Mr
Pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70-years-old, walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners
He is handed a loudspeaker
() 67
: threads his way through the crowd, a loud hailer in his hand
As he reaches the grave he turns
The crowd is quiet
He says something to the Priest then addresses the crowd
The funeral is over
order everyone to go home
This is not a political rally
repeat, disperse
As though by signal the police start attacking the mourners with truncheons and dogs
There is pandemon- ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or covering in them
The Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away in the opposite direction
The press and television are recording the scene
The police start throwing tear gas canisters
There is no confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions
One television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord
Melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes
'  - Ben, Susan watching the main evening news bulletin on
On the screen a sequence of rioting
(
) Despite repeated warnings young blacks attacked the police with rocks and petrol bombs
Five policemen were injured
Susan briefly glances at Ben
(
) Several arrests were made
One youth was killed and five wounded
Follows the newscaster and then reports: (
) This morning there was a serious disturbance at the funeral of Gordon Ngubene
Susan leaves the room
() 68
: The detainee who committed suicide by hanging himself at John Vorster Square
An overseas television cameraman broke an arm during the disturbance
It's been reported that several people had been killed by a car-bomb in Belfast Northern Island
Ben turns  the  and stays in his thoughts
-  - Stanley and Ben are driving in the outskirts of Johannesburg
- Stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which he maintains through the streets of Soweto
using his horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and indulgence of others
The   to a halt outside Emily's house
Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled neighbors
and acknowledges the friendly shouts of children
Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens the back door, leans and says something
Suddenly, to everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car; Stanley hustles him into Emily's house
Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then closes the door behind him
'  - Ben stands awkwardly for a moment, taking in the room and the people in it
He then walks over to Emily who is standing at the table
He goes to shake her hand
How are you, Emily
Well, thank you, Mr
Ben, sir
Eh, that's father Masonwane, our priest, and that's Margaret from next door
Ben nods at them
Stanley sits himself down
() 69
: (raising his hand in greeting) Mfundisi
(priest) Sisi
(sister) (to Ben) Please sit down
Take this chair, the other one is broken
(apologetically) didn't mean to disturb you
've come to talk to you
(as she sits on the broken chair) Yes, it's good
What  want to know is why did they kill him
He didn't do them nothing
You know, Mr
Ben, sir,  washed his whole body for he was my husband
And know a man who killed himself, he doesn't look like that
Master, you must understand she's still raw inside
'm sure
Robert walks in, looks at Ben and walks into his bedroom to fetch something, then as he's about to go out: Robert, where are you manners today
Don't you greet visitors
Robert stops momentarily and looks at Ben with hostility and hurries out of the room banging the door
'm sorry for his rudeness
(to Ben) You have to understand what's happening to our children today, they're like wasps when you burn their nest
() 70
: That's right
Our children are saying 'that's enough
' Things have to change in this country
They accuse us of being cowards
Emily,  have really come to assure you that  will do all can to help you find out what really happened to Jonathan and your husband -- we cannot bring them back to life, but we can make sure that this sort of thing won't ever happen again
You mean well, sir, but it's better to forgive
If we keep the pain alive then hate and bitterness will remain with us
The air must be cleared
So we can breathe again
The air can only be cleared if we forget about yesterday's thunder
Mr
Ben is right
It's not that want to go on with this thing because it's a bad thing that Jonathan died, that Gordon died that's hard enough to bear, but can forgive it
But they covered Gordon's name with dirt and we must clean it up, else he'll never have peace in his grave
(to Ben) You must understand for us, suicide is a coward's way out, how do they say, it's a 'cop out
' Gordon wasn't a coward and we'll prove that
We have a very good advocate for the inquest
His name is De Villiers
have confidence in him and the truth will come out
() 71
: The truth must be known
They killed my husband who wouldn't hurt a fly and they killed Jonathan who was only a child
Those people who did it are sinful people who don't know what they're doing
He
Mfundisi, what are you saying now
You mean
We must help them
That's the only way
They need our help, not hate, but love
pity them and  ask the Lord to help me so  can learn to love them
If that's what you preach in your church you will soon be starving
They covered his name with dirt
Aren't you afraid sis Emily
No
In the end one grows tired of being afraid
Amen
Ben has been listening to the discussion with interest, this being the first time he has heard Africans talking seriously about their problems
Emily, Stanley and  will do all we can
As  said we have a good advocate
Everyone involved with Gordon's death will be questioned and all that's known regarding what happened in John Vorster Square will come out
() 72
: How can anything come out of that John Vorster Square
Who there will say: 'Yes, we killed the boy and Gordon
' Lawyers ask questions
And don't policemen lie
Thank you, Mr
Ben, sir for what you're doing
(standing) 'm pleased  came
(to Ben as he goes to the door) Wait, let me check the situation
He opens the door and walks out
'  - small group of youngsters are there, hands thrust into their pockets, hanging around in a stony silence
Robert is standing by the door
Stanley calls one of them and talks to him -- the boys look around and say something
As Stanley goes back to the door, passing Robert, he ruffles his hair
(to Robert) Take it easy
(then to Ben) It's okey, dokey, but hurry
Ben hurries out of the room
The children stare at him
(as they go to the car) Do
() 73
: (interrupts) Yes, on the floor man
Stanley opens the back door for Ben
Who crouches on the floor
Some of the boys snicker and one bursts out laughing
As Stanley gets into the car he shouts at them: Okay
Kids, time to go home
Be careful
(shouting back) Sure 'bra' Stanley
Take it easy
Stanley drives off at speed
- Stanley is driving, they have left Soweto
Ben still on the floor
Are we still in Soweto
Why don't you look for yourself
Ben rises and sees that they're at least a mile out
He is not amused
(sitting up) What the hell are you playing at
(as he bursts into loud laugh) Precautions, Lanie
(exposing) Don't call me Lanie
What does that mean anyway
(still laughing) You will not understand, Lanie
They drive off
74
'  - Susan and Ben are in bed
Susan is in Ben's arms, she is relaxed and loving
Ben talks quietly and calmly
think  am without awareness
have always cared about people, call it a social conscience
But my visit to Gordon's house made me experience another dimension of human conditions
The poverty, ja
No,  expected that
But listening to them talk made me realize that  did not know the blacks
Now  question my attitudes, my concerns as Ben, and complacence as a white person
Ben,  know your anxiety about the inquest
All will be cleared up, in a legal way, and you'll be back to your normal self
Now let's turn off the lights
Susan kisses Ben tenderly
-     - The inquest of Gordon Ngubene
conducted by In the witness box is
, the state pathologist, giving evidence
Advocate   is cross examining
Dr
Jansen, you are a state pathologist of many years standing and  have no doubt a well-qualified pathologist
Could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased
found that death had been caused by the application of force to the neck, consistent with hanging
() 75
: There's a vigorous reaction to this around the court, which gives us a chance to discover the crowd: In the white section of the public gallery are Ben and about eight other whites
The black section is filled to capacity with a few stand- ing
In the front row is sitting Stanley next to Margaret
At the entrance, a white policeman
In the press section are several reporters; amongst them Melanie Bruwer the Rand Daily Mail reporter
Colonel Viljoen and several policemen are sitting around the court
You are sure about the hanging
This pressure on the neck, could it also have been exerted in other ways
It could, but it is not for me to speculate
Of course not, Doctor
The list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings, abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc
How long before death do you estimate he received these injuries
couldn't say exactly
Roughly
Some were fourteen to twenty days old, others three to four days and others even more recent
Even more recent
see understand you had a Dr
Hassiem present at the autopsy
That's correct
() 76
: There were two reports, ours and his
Did they tally
Yes, it was
In most respects
Stanley listening
Isn't it normal practice to have one report
Why did Dr
Hassiem decide to draw up a separate report
If he really co-signed yours
That's for him to answer
would very much like to, Dr
Jansen, but he's been detained -- you know of course that he represented the Ngubene family
Thank you
There's a murmur around the court
Ben looks across at Viljoen who returns his gaze -- smiling
: the police physician, giving evidence
Dr
Herzog, did you examine the deceased
Yes, one day Captain Stolz called me in
The man had toothache
(aggressive) That's all
(uncomfortable) As far as  could tell -- yes
() 77
: You didn't examine him thoroughly
Why should
The man was perfectly healthy, just complaining of toothache extracted three decayed teeth, and gave him aspirin for the pain
that's all
Did the captain or anyone else assist you during the examination
(hesitates) cannot remember
(more aggressive and accusing) Dr
Herzog, tell us
Have you been intimidated by the Security Police or did you deliberately cooperate with them in playing their disgusting little game of hide-and-seek
(jumping up from his seat) protest, Your Worship
Advocate De Villiers, will you refrain from insinuations
Thank you, Doctor Herzog
'm sure Gordon Ngubene was extremely grateful
Herzog's face is impassive
crowd reacting
Advocate Louw
During the hubbub De Villiers and the state advocate trade places
The courtroom is quiet
() 78
: Thank you, Your Worship
'd like to call Captain Stolz
There's a buzz from the spectators as Captain Stolz walks up to the witness stand
He's given a Bible
Ben -- watches him
- In witness box, swearing in Afrikaans
You're a police officer stationed at John Vorster Square
That's right, Your Worship
You arrested Gordon Ngubene
Could you describe what happened
Acting on information we had received,  went to the house of the deceased, accompanied by Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant Botha, and three native members of the security force
This was about 10
informed Ngubene that he was under arrest under Article 6 of the Terrorism Act
He then became violent and resisted arrest
certain force had to be applied to restrain him
Stanley listening
Ben listening
We found several incriminating documents
These pointed to his involvement with the
and activities endangering the security of the state
79
Ben looking at Stolz, and shaking his head, bewildered
Was the deceased ever assaulted to your knowledge
Never
He was always treated with courtesy and correctness
But, one time we had cause to use force against him
It was the day before his death
The deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression
He tried to jump through the open window of my office
He was acting like a mad man
It took six of my men to restrain him, and he had to be manacled hand and foot, for his own safety
But once he calmed down, he was ready to make a statement about his activities
The next morning we found him dead in his cell
Is the statement in evidence
No, Your Worship
It can't be disclosed in court without damaging our investigation, but would like to offer into evidence a suicide note written by the deceased
Louw, taking it from his file on the table
Stanley and Margaret listening
'Dear Captain
prefer to die rather than betray any more of my friends
Amandla
Gordon Ngubene
' He hands it to the court clerk
There's uproar at this
Thank you, Your Worship
Advocate De Villiers
() 80
: Ben is disgusted
He looks about the court, as if seeking allies
His eyes meet Melanie's -- just for a second there's recognition -- then he returns to De Villiers
Advocate De Villiers cross-examining Captain Stolz
Thank you, Your Worship
Captain Stolz, you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness, then how do you account for the injuries found on the body
Sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes
The gallery screams its objections
Stanley leans forward and grins across the partition at Ben
The Magistrate warns the crowd
Finally the gallery quiets down
You say he tried to jump out of the open window
Are there no bars to prevent such an act
They had been removed for repair
And why did he wish to jump out
Because you were torturing him
He wasn't tortured
Perhaps it was the toothache then
No reaction from Stolz
You said you seized incriminating documents at the deceased's home; can you produce them to see how subversive he was
(to Magistrate) Those documents cannot be introduced as evidence, Your Worship, in view of the fact that state security is involved
() 81
: The Magistrate makes a note
put it to you, Captain -- that the only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his efforts to establish what happened to his son, Jonathan, allegedly shot during a riot, although several witnesses are prepared to testify that he died in detention one month later
(jumping up) protest
This would support my case that an innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable circumstances
If it please Your Worship
this unwarranted slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable
and based,  may say, on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the present inquest
agree
(turning on Louw) If the police are really interested in retaining an unsullied reputation, they should not object to the real facts being presented
Thank you, Captain
The real facts are being presented -- as the following affadivits prove
They are all by detainees -- who testify that they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his detention -- to the time of his death -- and on all occasions he was in good health
() 82
: As the documents are passed to the Magistrate, they are scorned by De Villiers
Imperviously he requests: trust the signatories of these documents
are available to corroborate their evidence in person
Detainee in the witness box
He swears in Zulu
De Villiers holds his signed affidavit
Mr
Archibald, when did you first meet Gordon Ngubene
(looking at black crowd, then to De Villiers) never saw Gordon Ngubene
sudden stillness in the court
Ben
Stanley
Melanie
Louw
Are you saying that you didn't sign this statement
never met Mr
Ngubene
they forced me to sign
Captain Stolz, he hit me many times with a rubber hose
he said he would kill me 'less  signed
this
this is what he did to me
He pulls up his shirt -- his back is covered in bruises
The crowd cannot restrain itself any longer
Ben is aghast by what he sees
Thank you, Mr
Archibald
() 83
: Advocate Louw
(uncomfortable) No thank you, Your Worship
As Archibald leaves the witness stand, held by a special branch officer, he raises his fist in salute and shouts to the crowd: "
" The crowd responds: "Ngawethu
" Ben looks at Archibald
He is very impressed by this strength in the prisoner's eyes
An officer   of the court shouts at the crowd: "silte in die koort"   (silence in court) -- bailiffs collar a few of the loudest   protesters and pull them with brutality out of the   courtroom
(to town, wearily) May we put up the second signatory
Louw confers hurriedly with the prosecution officers, then turns back to the court
Your Worship -- the other three signatories cannot appear for reasons of state security
He sits down, bland, examining his papers
Your Worship, 'd like to recall Captain Stolz
As Captain Stolz returns to the stand he crosses Archibald being handcuffed by the
officer
Ben watches him passing by the detainee, straight, im- passive without a look to him
Captain, you're still under oath -- you took Archibald's statement
Was it voluntary
'm sure you'll say it was, then how did he come by the injuries on his back
He fell down the stairs a few days ago
() 84
: Fell down the stairs
You should do something about those stairs, Captain, so many people fall on them
Thank you
The crowd laughs
(to the Magistrate) Your Worship, may  be excused have to escort detainee Archibal back to John Vorster Square
You may, Captain, and thank you
(to the crowd) think this's a good moment to adjourn -- we'll reconvene at two thirty
- Emily, Margaret, Stanley and a man, are sitting outside the court eating fish and chips
There are various Africans sitting around for their lunch break
: - Ben and Dan Lewinson having a light lunch in a nearby cafe
(buoyant) De Villiers is making mincemeat of them
He's very good
His cross- examination has got them rattled
It's obvious to anybody
The evidence is clear
(pause) Did you see Archibal's back
He didn't have to tell the truth
Dan Lewinson's dry laugh catches in his throat
() 85
: That's what Stolz is saying to him right now in his torture room
: - Advocate De Villiers and a dignified Emily in the witness stand
Captain Stolz lied
My husband never fight the police when he was arrested
They were rough with him, pushing him and threatening
When your husband's clothes were given to you, in what condition were they
There was blood on them and in the back pocket  found three broken teeth
Now Mrs
Ngubene, you have seen the note that's said to have been written by your husband
Do you recognize the writing
(firmly) That's not how my husband writes
(strongly) He never wrote that letter, they lie
Thank you, Mrs
Ngubene
Advocte Louw
He shakes his head
(facing the Magistrate and in firm voice) They killed my husband and son
() 86
: Ben, satisfied
(to a policeman next to Viljoen) Will you take the woman out
'd like to call my last witness
Grace Nkosi
Grace's name is called
She is an attractive 20-years- old girl
As she passes by Ben, he watches her with concern; her face looks familiar
Of course he remembers having seen her at John Vorster Square the first time he went there to meet the colonel
is the African girl the two security officers were lifted to the ten flour
He recognizes her
Grace Nkosi in the witness stand
She swears in Xhosa
Were you ever detained
Yes sir, at John Vorster Square
For how long
Six months
Can you tell us what happened to you during that time
was interrogated by many special policemen, but mainly Captain Stolz and the one they call Venter
As they were searching somebody know, they wanted me to tell them where that person was hidden
As refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok
After some time fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach
Ben obviously shocked
() 87
: spot blood and they try to make me lick it
Then Captain Stolz threw a wet towel and started twisting it around my neck
(she illustrates) until  lost consciousness
They did this several time and the last one Captain Stolz said 'come on meid, speak up, or do you want to die like Gordon Ngubene
'  few days later  was released
Melanie taking notes
Thank you, Miss Grace
That's all, Your Worship
(rising and looking at Grace for some seconds) You made that up
Say you made it up
It's the truth
have nothing more to say
Louw sits down
We shall adjourn until tomorrow morning
'll hear the arguments and give the verdict
The crowd stands and starts to leave the courtroom
: -  ( ) silent black crowd; Emily, Margaret, Stanley anxiously awaiting the verdict
Today the public gallery is more crowded than before
wish to thank both advocates for conducting this case without rancour and in the best traditions of the South African legal profession
() 88
: Ben's face
Dan Lewinson's face
Viljoen and Stolz's faces
have listened to all the evidence and the arguments
To begin with  have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security Police had been guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the deceased
There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be restrained with force
There was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck, consistent with hanging
Consequently,  find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any person
: Viljoen and Stolz smiling, shaking hands with Advocate Louw in congratulations
: - The predominantly black crowd obviously dissatisfied with the verdict, discussing it as it moves slowly towards the main entrance
In the crowd Stanley, Margaret and Emily controlled, dignified but obviously pained
: totally depressed, walking up to Emily
() 89
: (to Ben over noise of the discussion) Don't worry, man
There's another day
Ben leans towards Emily
'm sorry, Emily
Several press photographers are taking pictures osten- sibly of Emily the widow
Stanley gently guides Emily out of the building
Ben, who is following, is besieged by the insistent reporters, shouting: 'Mister Du Toit, how do you know Mrs
Ngubene
' 'Mister Du Toit, can you answer, is it true, he was a terrorist
' Ben tries to get through
Mister Du Toit, what do you think of the verdict
Do you believe the police
Melanie appears, grabs Ben and pushes him away through them
Hang on, Melanie, 'm coming with you
(shouts back) Fuck off
The press is still pursuing them
As Ben and Melanie reach Melanie's car: My car is over there
(opening the car) Never mind your car
Let's get away from these vultures
() 90
: They get into the car and as they drive away, Melanie introduces herself
By the way, 'm Melanie Bruwer
Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail
read your article about Jonathan
Ten out of ten, Mr
Du Toit know about you too
(uncomfortable) You do
Melanie smiles
We have a mutual friend
One Stanley
remember
The mortuary in Soweto
(pause) The ambiguous Stanley
Stanley
No
Just careful big black rough uncut diamond
Don't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude
There's much more to him
He couldn't have given you a glowing report of me
(suddenly aggressive) 'm sorry, but where are we going
thought a cooling drink at my house
(on the defensive) Mrs
Bruwer, 'm not

: (interrupts) promise you
'm not after an interview or anything like that
She smiles
really must go home
Please, Mr
Du Toit, and you'll meet my darling father
She smiles again
disarming smile
'  - Melanie drives into the yard
The house is an old Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a controlled wild garden
figure is bent over a beehive
large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features
Melanie stops the car in the driveway
(pointing from the car) There he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the left
That's old Bruwer
They get out of the car and walk towards him
How long have you lived here
Oh, about twenty-one years love this house
(without looking up) Is that you, Melanie
Of course, Dad
want you to meet a friend
Does anyone have a friend nowadays
() 92
: He straightens up and throws the net over his head and studies Ben
is seventy years old; an interesting face with a goatee beard
Mr
Du toit, Dad
Do you like bees
(smiling) have nothing against them
(to Ben) Be careful,  can see philosophy coming
You shut up
(to Ben) Let me tell you about bees, and for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose -- based on the common good
course from which he cannot be deflected
Greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him
He lives solely to serve his fellow bee
What about individuality, Dad
There's the rub, my girl
There's the rub
One of these days 'll ask the bees
'm sure they have the answer
Now, you two run along
He replaces his net and continues with the hive
drink, Dad
've been peeing too much this morning
() 93
: (as they walk toward the house) That's my Daddy
Melanie and Ben enter the house
'   - The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers, of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings -- records, African sculptures
On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous speakers
settee, a chess set
The furniture is old and well- used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two big cats sleeping on it
It's civilized pandemonium
(gesturing to the room) Now you see in what environment was spawned
Ben looks at the shelves and smiles
Please sit down, on that chair
(pointing to club chair) That's Dad's
Drink
Please
(interrupts, mischievous) brandy
(looking at her surprised, then smiling) No thanks, a beer will be fine
Melanie goes into the kitchen leaving Ben
He cannot forget what he heard and what he saw in the court
She returns barefooted, with two beer mugs, and hands one to Ben
() 94
: The mugs are the few things that Dad brought from Germany
He studied philosophy in Tubingen and Berlin before the last war
thought they were German
Melanie sits, her legs propped up on the settee, hugging her knees
Mr
Du Toit, tell
(interrupts) Please, call me Ben
All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so depressed
You really expect a different verdict
(disgruntled) Why do you ask
Can you understand it
Of course  understand it
What could they have
'm not cynical
'm only trying to be realistic
Tell me, Miss Bruwer
Ben and Melanie, that's fair
Tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice
(lighting a cigarette) 'll never stop believing
But in this country 've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations
What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations
() 95
: Exactly
And you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well
You've got to know your enemy first
That's a tall order: 'know injustice
know the enemy
' it seems  have a long haul ahead of me
Not at all, Ben
You have already taken the first steps
(pause) Welcome to South Africa
She smiles
'  - Susan is sitting at the dressing table
She is applying cleansing cream to her face
She is relaxed
Ben is getting ready for bed
Did you enjoy the 'bobotie
' When heard the verdict on the news knew you'd be upset
(softer) wanted to make you something special
(thoughtful) Thank you, darling
pause
Susan starts to remove the cream
'm glad it's all over
You take things to heart too much
Ben comes and stands behind Susan -- looking at her through the mirror
(trying to keep control of himself) They killed Gordon -- first they kill Jonathan, and then him
How can they get away with it
() 96
: (soothingly) Now come on, Ben
Gordon's death upset me, too
But the Magistrate had all the facts
He must know what he's doing, he's had years of experience
The case has run its course, and nobody can do anything more about it
It's all over and done with
(looking at her) 'm not so sure about that, Susan
Susan swivels around and faces Ben
'm damned well sure
It's over, Ben
You better get that into your head
Ben just stares at her with seething anger
She stands up and starts being hysterical
teacher, always a bloody teacher
You never moved yourself for us
But for the blacks, oh yes
Whose side are you on, Ben
And 'm sick and tired of those natives coming here
Why don't you bloody well go and live in Soweto
Ben strides out of the room
(following and shouting) Now where are you going
(without looking) Soweto
Then shuts the door behind him
Susan stands stupefied
There's the sound of the - Ben is standing in the middle of the room, in the dark
On the wall behind him is a young Suzette's picture
() 97
: After a few seconds, Ben moves slowly to the bed and sits on it still in deep thought
a: And: : - It's a Saturday morning
shopping center in a white suburb
Ben goes into a newspaper shop
There are two children buying sweets and a woman leaving
The  is an Afrikaner in his middle age
More meneer Van de Merwe
(Morning Mister Van de Merwe
) (in offhand manner) More meneer du Toit
Our boys gave the Eastern province a thrashing
Yes
Ben realizes that the man is not his usual conversational self
Is anything wrong
No
Ben goes to pick up an Afrikaans newspaper and the Rand Daily Mail
(walking up to counter) And a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners
The man gets them and takes a note from Ben and gives him his change
By then a man is waiting
() 98
: See you tomorrow
As he walks out the other man turns around to watch him
- Ben walks    out of the shop
The newspaper under his arm
group of    three middle-aged women turn to look at him
Ben didn't    see them
little further on, he meets Mrs
Coetzee
He tries to greet her but she walks straight by
Further on, he notices two men obviously talking about him
Then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they pass him
He begins to wonder what's it all about, and spontaneously checks his clothes
'  -  - Susan and Suzette sit there
Suzette's holding a news- paper -- the Ossewa -- Susan's thoughtful, her face is red and discomposed -- obviously she had cried
The but they deliberately ignore it
Ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees Suzette's sports car and hurries to join them
Suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her
(jumping up and showing the cover of Ossewa) Now, Papa, this is going too far
How could you
(surprised) How's that, Suzette
Ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover
picture of himself and Emily outside the courtroom
The two faces are close together with the notes: " , wife of native who died in detention, comforted by a friend of family, Mr
" And in parenthesis "see page two
" He throws the Ossewa on a chair and checks into the Rand Daily Mail
Inside there is a long article with Emily's picture, titled "the Face of Grief
" Ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head
He suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside
() 99
: You didn't stop to think of the family
Poor mother, how can she face anyone
And tomorrow is Sunday
Now listen
Johan steps into the veranda
What's everybody yelling about
You listen, Papa, just tell me, why
Recognizing his father in the photo, Johan has picked up the newspaper from the chair
Do you really think  specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture
And what's more it's distorted
What's distorted about it
Your face is practically touching that meid's face, like you were about to kiss her
(disgruntled) Suzette, pull yourself together
Today the whole country has seen that photograph
We, your children, are going to suffer
At this very moment Chris is negotiating with the Provincial Council
Would you like to see them cancel it
You have no feeling, Papa
(shocked) Suzette
She leaves in rage
(conciliating) What's Papa done, anyway
If something happened to him, wouldn't you be upset
() 100
: (standing up) Not enough, Johan, to throw myself into the garden boy's arms
That goes without saying
(trying to joke) There must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper
Before she can stop herself, Susan slaps him across the face, although not hard
Johan leaves without a word
She clutches her hand, shocked at having it against him
The  starts to
Susan runs out sobbing
Ben looks at her then walks into the living room to pick up the phone
'   - (into phone) Who
don't know you and have nothing to say to you
No thank you for your advice
He puts the phone down
The   again
Ben picks it up and waits
It's you, Viviers
appreciate it
of course
Not yet
Any thank you
Tot siens
He replaces the receiver and is about to light his pipe when the   again
Morning, Mr
Cloete
'd like to say
(impatiently) Mr
Cloete, may  ask what on earth has the picture to do with politics
'm sorry Mr
Cloete, have to go
He replaces the telephone and walks out of the house

'  -  - The farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of acres
In the distance there's a range of mountains
Several cattle are grazing, herded by a poorly-clad African and his son, aged 8 years
Bester and Ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the cattle kraal with calves penned in
Everything was examined in depth in court
Did you read the papers, Dominee
Were you happy with what came to light
And is it the Magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist
Was it really facts, Ben
Just then the African "" walks up to them taking off his lattered greasy hat
Ja
What is it Tom
() Does the Baas want me to bring the bull now
Later, Tom
() Dankie, Baas
Tom hurries away
bought a bull last week
know, Gordon
What they said about him, that he was plotting against the government -- is a downright lie
He was only doing what would have done as a father; searching for his son
No one but God can see what's in our hearts
() () 102
: (') Isn't it presumptuous to pretend we can speak for someone else
Have you no faith in your fellow men, Dominee
Don't you love your neighbor
(confronting Ben) Wait a minute, instead of criticizing blindly, don't you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we have
suppose this had been Russia; what do you think would have happened then
What's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom
The one man they allowed to speak for himself, that young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn't he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement
And the girl who spoke of her own torture
99 That did not refer to our situation in this South Africa
Do you know what  believe in, Dominee, that once in one's life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it
One can gain the world and still lose one's soul
Tea must be ready
Bester and Ben walk towards the house still in conversation
103
- The staff is having coffee during morning break in the staff room
The room has several easy chairs, a table with the morning newspapers on it
The walls have pictures of South African scenes
There are several conversations in Afrikaans
This is the first morning since the photograph
Ben walks into the staff room
The conversations stop
Everyone looks at him with hostility
The teachers all place their cups on the table and quietly file out of the room
Ben pours himself a cup of coffee; as he takes his first sip, Cloete looks in, sees him
He walks in
hope you don't mind us talking here
don't mind, Mr
Cloete
'll come to the point
You can't imagine how shocked  was by that scandalous photograph in the Ossewa
The woman lost her husband, she was shattered with grief
Kaffir woman, Du Toit
(angrily) can't see that it makes any difference
Have you gone color blind then
And what about the apartheid laws
Our first responsibility as teachers is the reputation of the school, the pupils entrusted to us
We have to be an example to them in and out of this school yard
Ben looks at him calmly
() 104
: thought  had warned you about involving yourself with Kaffirs
Obviously you didn't heed my advice
That's all  have to say for now
Cloete walks out of the room
Viviers hurries into the room, he is late for his coffee
'Morning, Oom Ben
(acknowledging greeting) Viviers
(pouring coffee) Private coffee with Cloete
Ben picks up the copy of the Ossewa with the photograph and shows it to Viviers
'  - Ben stops the car in the Bruwer driveway
From the driving seat he searches the garden for Bruwer
He walks up to the front door and knocks, but there's no reply
He goes 'round to the back and finds the old man on his knees weeding his vegetable garden
Good afternoon, Professor
(looking up) Melanie isn't home
You are
Ben Du Toit
You have a nice vegetable garden
You mean the area or the produce
Both
What plants are these
() 105
: What's the world coming to
It's herbs, can't you see
Thyme there, oregano over there, feunel next to the tomatoes, sage here and rosemary somewhere
Poor plants, they re not in their ideal soil or climate
Next time, 'll bring some soil from the mountain of Zeus
Perhaps the old man's holiness will do the trick
He throws down the small weeding-fork
Come, you are just the person to sample my greengage wine
don't suppose you've ever tasted it
'm sure 'm the only person in the country making greengage wine
He leads Ben to the two old chairs by the back wall
He enters the kitchen and returns with a bottle of greengage wine and two glasses
(as he pours) The first bottle this year, and you don't have to tell me if you like it or not
Tell me, did you ever study philosophy
Not really
've read a few books
(taking a sip) Not bad, in fact quite good
Now where was
Oh,  was going to say after decades of philosophy, find myself being forced back to the earth
Do you know, Ben, we're all living in the spell of abstractions
Hitler, apartheid, the great American dream, the lot
What about Jesus
Misunderstood
() () 106
: (') (referring to the wine) You don't have to finish it
(lying) It's quite nice
Melanie has told me a little about you
It's not an easy road you have chosen
feel  have no choice
Bruwer farts loudly, Ben is taken aback, but the Professor continues
Of course you have a choice
Damn it
One always has a choice
Only thank God you made the choice you did
But all  want to say is, keep your eyes open, young man
That's encouraging
We are both Boers, Ben
We know how hard our people worked to get a toehold on this land; it was a good life
Now look at the mess
It's all systems and no God
Sooner or later people start believing in their way of life as an absolute: unmutable, fundamental, a precondition
Saw it, with my own eyes in Germany, a nation running after an idea
Sieg heil, sieg heil
left there thirty years ago because couldn't take it any longer
And now  see it happening in my own country, step by step
Terrifyingly predictable
This sickness of the great abstraction
He farts and sips his greengage wine
() 107
: Ben is so fascinated by the old man's conversation he didn't react
He is learning form his old Afrikaner
What you say is very interesting and important
Take for example the way the government is handling the electorate; like a bloody donkey
Carrot in front and kick at the backside
The carrot is apartheid, Dogma
The kick is quite simply, fear
Black peril, red peril, whatever name you want to give it
(pause) Fear can be a wonderful ally, Ben
talk too much,  always do with younger people, they don't fall asleep to me
(laughs) We Afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye and look around us and at ourselves
You are right
We still have time
History should teach us about those who regarded themselves as the chosen people
(standing up comforted) Professor Bruwer, may  say  have needed to hear somebody say some of the things you said
still have hope for our country
If you lose that you have lost everything
'll get back to the earth
(shaking hands) Thank you
() 108
: 'll tell that hot-head daughter of mine that you came to see her
Ben takes his leave
'  - Ben and Dan Lewinson are sitting opposite, cups of coffee in front of them
There is absolutely no doubt that they were killed in custody
Those responsible must be punished, whoever they are, or whatever their rank
The problem is laying our hands on them
Tell me, Dan, we lost at the inquest, what next
The family can file a civil claim
What does that entail
To put it briefly, it means we have to have witnesses, affidavits and any information relating to the arrest and death of Gordon
We also need similar information on Jonathan
You see Ben, for example, Stolz figures in both cases
That's one link at least
know what  have to do
- It's lunch time and the working population of Jo'burg has paused for lunch
Ben and Melanie are sitting at a table outside
The cafe is on the outskirts of a very affluent part of Johannesburg
() 109
: didn't think you would want to have anything to do with me after that crap in the Ossewa
Why
You didn't write it
'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush
No
So what happened
can imagine
The family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors
distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer Du Toit is a leper
That's why  called on you the other day,  needed to talk to somebody rational
Thanks for the compliment
But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them
In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor
You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal English paper
My mother was a foreigner, 'm not pure, wragte Afrikaner
They don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you
What kind of loyalty
Blind loyalty
Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon,  gave all the loyalty  could give, laager loyalty
You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains
() 110
: Has it ever occurred to you that the Volk may be scared to leave the laager
That's the downfall of this country
So, where do you go from here
We carry on
There has to be justice
Justice
We lost at the inquest, so we pursue them in a civil action consulted the attorney Dan Lewinson
We know each other well
#' 107 - 110 Mr
Du Toit, if you knew what we're working with every day of our lives, and what we're up against, you would understand why we have to be so thorough
However you go about it
can understand you're upset about having your house searched but
wasn't thinking about myself
What are you talking about then, Mr
Du Toit
My thoughts, Captain, 'm sure, are an open book to you
() 111
: Stolz picks up a book of Picasso's Peace Paintings, starts leafing through it carefully, scrutinizing each page
He puts the Picasso book carefully back in the place he took it from
An interesting book -- Picasso -- Not one 'm familiar with
Not on your list of banned books, Captain
Stolz doesn't react
: '   - The search continues in the living room
Susan is standing pale, rigid, shocked
Mr
Du Toit
If you're keeping anything from us, we can turn this whole house upside down if we want to
We have all the time in the world
(throwing Ben a warning daggers look) 'm afraid  don't understand
Nothing from Stolz
One of the men starts to roll up the carpet to look under it
Susan has to move out of his way
(gently to Susan) Why don't you go upstairs
'm afraid she has to stay where we can see her -- in case she wanted to warn someone
My father's an
Warn who

: - All four tires of Ben's car have been slashed to ribbons
'  - Ben and Johan are there
Ben takes a file from under a toolbox and measures it carefully against the drawer base
Then, he selects a piece of wood approximately the size of the drawer and tries it for size
We should be in no doubt that's he's constructing a hiding place
'  - Susan is preparing a roast
There's music from a trans- istor
Susan is startled by a voice, her father's (Ben's --)
She turns , the
-- Roast beef,  hope it's like your mother's
(happy) Papa
He is aged about 70 years, thick set
She rushes to him and he hugs her tightly and practically lifts her off the floor
She kisses him
Where's Mama
She disentangles herself and goes to the living room as excited as a child, the mother is standing by two cases, smiling
Susan hugs her
Mama
She holds her mother at arm's length inspecting her
The perfume and a new hairstyle
Your father insisted that  don't disgrace you
() 113
: (hugging her again) expected you a little later
-- She insisted we start early
Where is Ben
(walking in with golf club bag) In the study
'll get him
-- Have you put on weight, Susan
Please don't say that, Papa
Ben walks in
Sorry
Didn't hear you arrive
He shakes hands with Father-In-Law
-- How are you, Ben
Fine
He goes to --
He kisses her on the cheek
And how are you, Ma
-- () Well, Ben, still have trouble with my feet
Why doesn't everyone sit down
'll prepare some tea
baked a cake
She goes to the kitchen
- Ben and Father-In-Law are having a drink after a round of golf, outside the club house
() 114
: -- 'm getting tired of the trek to Cape Town and then back to Pretoria
If  had my way, Parliament and government would be in the same city
There's nothing wrong with Pretoria
thought you'd prefer Cape Town; the sea and Table Mountain
-- That's for   holidays
Anyway, Ben, one of the   reasons for this visit was that    wanted to have a discussion   with you
What about
-- It's that photograph in the papers
Ben, a thing like that could be an embarrassment for someone who is a member of Parliament
It's a grievous day when one's family's behavior comes between him and his duty to the fatherland
Are you blaming me for trying to help those people
-- 've been doing that all my life, be they black or white
But no member of our family has been seen with a Kaffir woman before, Ben
Father signals the African waiter for more drinks
am glad you mentioned it, Father
Because 'd like to discuss the whole thing with you
First, there's the matter of Gordon Ngubene himself
-- What about him
thought the case was closed
() 115
: The inquest didn't clear up half of what happened
-- Oh, really
We have no irrefutable evidence yet, but we have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up
-- You're jumping to conclusions, Ben
know what 'm talking about
The black waiter places the drinks on the table
-- All right, Ben, 'm listening
Perhaps  can use my influence
But you'll have to convince me first
If they have really nothing to hide, why is the special branch going out of its way to intimidate me
-- (practically choking) What's this about special branch
They raided the house; they are tapping my phone, and  have been threatened by one of the officers
-- 'm sorry, Ben, 'd rather not have anything to do with this sort of thing
Why
-- If the special branch are involved they must have good reasons
() 116
: It's exactly what  said, Father, when Jonathan first got into trouble
Of course, they have good reasons: hushing up how Gordon died and how his son died
-- (angry) Ben, how could you side with the enemies of your people
You mean you're prepared to sit back and allow an injustice to be done
-- (his face grows purple) It's you, Ben, who talk about injustice
man who teaches history at school
Did you forget what our people have suffered under the English oppressors
Now that we have at along last come to power in our own land
Now we're free to do to others what they used to do to us
What will you do if you were a black man in this country today, Father
-- Don't you realize what the government is doing for the blacks
It's a slow process, Ben
One of these days the whole bloody lot of them will be free and independent in their own parts of the land, the bantoustans -- what can be more just than that
But they're not ready yet
The waiter returns -- Father-in-law pays the bill, and as he rises to leave, he puts a paternal arm on Ben's shoulder
-- We have nothing to be ashamed of before the eyes of the world, my boy
() 117
: (standing, his golf bag in his hand) We don't
'm not sure we're going to survive
They walk away
-- Don't underestimate us, Ben
Our power of survival
We are Afrikaners
- Stanley is parked in a street corner in the last     white suburb on the way to Soweto
Ben pulls up in his      car behind Stanley's
He walks over to Stanley's car      and enters the back
Stanley smiles as he points at      his watch
African time
'm sorry
They drive off towards Soweto
Doesn't matter, Lanie -- as long we are on time for the revolution
The special branch searched my house four days ago
The
searches your house
(chuckles) Did they take anything
few journals, letters -- nothing much
Just wanted to scare me, that's all
Don't be so sure
They may think you're onto something big
They're not that stupid
() 118
: Stanley laughs
'Lanie' -- don't you believe it -- nothing's as stupid as the old
If they decide it's a bomb they're looking for, you can shove a turd in their face and they'll swear to God it's a bomb
He laughs
making Ben smile
pause
And did they
What
Scare you
No
They tried too hard
Stanley laughs again
Hallelujah
(offers his huge hand) Shake, man
Join the club
Ben accepts the handshake
: '   - Susan sitting on an armchair, sewing
She is aware of a car stopping opposite the house
Then several young voices shout: "Kaffir lover" "Kaffer boetie" "Red Communist" The car drives off at speed
Susan sits petrified
: 119
'  - Ben and Stanley driving in Soweto
It's a different city by night
The dark seems to soften the violence of the confrontation, hiding the details which, by day, assault and insult the eyes
There are several  in the distance
The only light comes from the small, square windows of the innumerable houses
Did you hear that, Lanie
More kids dying
Ben says nothing
Further on there's a group of people outside a house
As they pass they hear   from the house
What's happening
What's the singing
wake for a child; eight months old
She was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it
They drive on
: '  - Ben, Stanley and Emily are sitting    'round the table
Ben has pulled the lamp closer to read    one of two notes from Gordon -- one is written on ruled    paper, the other a square of toilet paper
The notes     have been smuggled out of John Vorster Square
(
) (shakily) 'My dear wife, you must not worry about me
miss you and the children
You must look after them in the fear of the Lord
'm hungry, and  don't know what they want from me
But  think 'll be home some day
think about
' They are interrupted by a  at the door
Emily snatches the notes and stuffs them into her bosom
Everyone is tense as Emily slowly walks up to the door
() 120
: She opens it and   a man with a hat and dressed as a min- ister walks in
Before anyone can say anything, Stanley bursts out in a   loud laugh
The man is slightly built, aged 40 years
He is
On your knees, everyone, prayers time
Ben is perplexed
Emily closes the door and locks it
Hey man, you should have been a mfundisi holiness oozer
(removing this hat) Okay, Stanley
It's stupid, but one is forced to do these things
He walks up to Ben and offers him his hand
'm Julius Nqakula
'm banned and also under house arrest
That's why  have this ridiculous garb on
understand
He's one of the most solid lawyers we have; they've immobilized him, that's the right word isn't it
He laughs
Stanley has told me about you appreciate the risk you are taking by coming here to meet me
was reading the notes Gordon smuggled out of John Vorster Square
May  have a glance at them
Emily produces the notes
Julius takes them
He starts reading the toilet paper, which is harder to read
() 121
: (
) (speaking with great difficulty) 'My dear wife
am still in these conditions
worse
and too much pain
They don't want to believe me
You must try to help me
They won't stop
You must care for the children

They're very -- (a word mumbled) -- but God will provide
love you and  miss you very much
Try to help me because
' The voice breaks off
(to Emily) When did you get the letters
(uncomfortable) The first one two days after they took him away
And the other one came later
But, Emily, why didn't you tell me long ago
had given my word to the man -- who brought them to me -- Emily,  have to meet the man
He said he didn't want anybody to know who he is
cannot make trouble for him in his work
He has to be persuaded
He is very important to us
(to Julius) You as a lawyer will understand
() () 122
: (') We intend starting a civil suit against the police, to do that it is necessary to have as many affidavits as we can from people who have any information about Gordon since he was arrested
And this man is vital and so is the Indian doctor
You mean Dr
Hassiem
How are you going to do that
You know of course that he is detained
know, with luck they may release him
With luck
But, Emily, this man is important, please try to tell him we will protect his identity
No one will know
Nothing will be done without his approval
only want to talk to him
Why don't you leave it to Stanley and
What do you say, Stanley
Sure
May  call you Julius, 'm not very good with some African names
(laughs) Nqakula, that's a hell of a name
Please call me Julius
This case must be reopened and we must win
We have to dig up everything
We need your cooperation, Julius
() 123
: Where do  start
Don't forget my restrictions
They did not ban you so you could sit on your backside and have a Soweto holiday
You could help with the affidavits
Lewinson the lawyer has stressed their importance
We know each other
He's a good lawyer for this kind of case
Of course 'll do what  can
My commitment forces me
'm glad
How   are you planning to safeguard the   documents
Stanley told me you   have already had a said by the
wouldn't worry
have a secure place
Let's hope so
'll make some tea
Not for me, Sis -- too strong for me
No whisky
In my house
You know better than that, Stanley
Tea then
(turning to Julius) and God forgive me -- : 124
'  - Ben is standing by the workbench, the new drawer he and Johan built for the toolbox, open before him
He's rereading Gordon's letters to Emily
Sound of approaching
Ben quickly puts the letters into the drawer and shuts it
Susan appears at the door -- she looks ten years older
Ben, it's Johan
You'd better come
'  - Johan sits, Ben crouched before him
The boy's shirt is torn, his eyes swollen, his lip cut
He looks at the floor
Susan hovers
He won't tell me why it happened Ben holds his son's arms, gently
Johan
Was it because of me
He doesn't answer for a moment
Then he nods
You see
It's gone too far, Ben
You've got to stop it
(shouting at his mother) don't care
It doesn't hurt me
Susan stares at him, at Ben, turns abruptly, walks out of the room
Johan looks at his father
It was my friends, Dad
They're so stupid
They won't listen
They don't even want to know what you're trying to do
He's crying
Are you sure you know
() 125
: Yes
know
Does it worry you
Johan looks at his father through his tears
Don't stop, Dad
You mustn't give up now

Loud, sharp, terrifying

Ben bursts in, holds her tight, as she screams into his chest
(hysterical) Call the police, Ben, call the police
Johan's voice comes from his room
(
) Papa
Papa
(calling) It's okay, son
we're all right
Everything's okay
(
) What's happened
(shouting) It's okay, stay there, please
Gently, he leads Susan who is sobbing now, out of the room
- (in disbelief) My God
They were trying to kill us
She's seated at the kitchen table
Ben has poured her a brandy which she cups in her hands
They were trying to scare us, that's all
() 127
: Her fear turns into anger
(screaming) Oh, is that all
What the hell more do you want to happen
we're ordinary people for God's sake -- and you've pitched us into this -- this nightmare
can't take any more, Ben
can't take any more
She drops her head and sobs
Ben sits beside her, and takes her hands to comfort her
Susan puts her head on his shoulder
(in a quiet pleading voice) Please, Ben, stop
Just stop
please
Ben is obviously moved
He squeezes her hands, then takes her in his arms
'  - The colonel, amiable, cool, behind his desk
dishev- elled Ben, pitched angrily forward in his chair
Now you must be exaggerating, Mr
Du Toit
My house has been searched
My phone is tapped
My mail is opened
And last night three shots were fired through my window -- close to killing my wife
Viljoen reacts
Mr
Du Toit, if shots were fired into your premises, we will investigate
All  want to know, Colonel, is why don't you leave me in peace
() 128
: Now wait, wait a minute, Mr
Du Toit, you're not trying to blame me
Tell me, Colonel, why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene
Is that what you are doing
(he pauses) Well, now
If you possess any information that may be of use to us,  trust you won't hesitate to discuss it with me
He leans forward towards Ben, his tone darkening
Because if there are facts you are deliberately hiding from us, Mr
Du Toit -- If you give us reason to believe that you may be involved in activities that may be dangerous to both yourself and us -- then  can foresee some problems
Is that a threat, Colonel
(smiling and sitting back) Let's call it a warning friendly warning
For God's sake, open your eyes, Mr
Du Toit
Don't you see you're being used
(sarcastically) By the Communists,  suppose
Ben gets up to go
The colonel doesn't rise to see him out
Goodbye, Colonel
(at the door, turning back) 'm sure
He leaves
The colonel immediately picks up the phone
129
'  - 40-year-old African woman walks up to Ben's kitchen door
She knocks
Ben opens the door in pyjamas and dressing-gown
She hands him a note and leaves
Ben reads the note and goes back into the house
- Vrededorp is a colored section of Johannesburg
It's rundown area vacated by whites
There are children play- ing in the street
Some unemployed men are sitting on old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two women from his milk churn
Ben drives into the street   searching for an address
He stops outside a house
As    he gets out of the car the children and everyone stop   to look at him with interest
He walks up to a door and   knocks
appears as the door opens
She is young and obviously educated
Mr
Du Toit
Ben nods, hesitatingly
Please, come in
Ben walks into the living/dining room
It's a    very tidy room with a three piece sitting room suite, a   sideboard with a clock on it
At one end of the room is    the dining area
The floor is linoleum and covered with    a rug in the middle
Stanley is lounging on a settee, beer in hand
On the chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit, drinks orange squash
Thirtyish, pleasant face but very tense
He rises as Ben walks in
(rising and shaking hands with Ben) How's it
No trouble finding this place
You met Sadie
She's one of us
Ben nods to her
() 130
: And this is Johnson Seroke
The man of the letters
(nodding in greeting) Johnson
( ) Please sit down, Mr
Du Toit beer, tea or orange squash
beer would be nice
Sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer and a glass
She opens the beer and hands it to Ben
She disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the door
You know they call this place Vrededorp, but we baptize it Malay Camp
Your first time in Malay Camp, Lanie
've driven through here many times
The main road, eh
(smiling) Ja
The woman re-enters
You'll excuse me
Stanley, you know what to do with the key
Sure, Sadie
And thank you
Can help myself to another beer
You know it is
Goodbye, Mr
Du Toit, and you, be careful
To the Seroke
() 131
: (trying to smile) Okay, Sadie
Sadie leaves
That woman can die for you
We mustn't be long, Johnson has to be back on duty
Alright, let's get on with it
Stanley tells me, you work at John Vorster Square
had no choice, they transferred me there
Yet you smuggled out letters to Emily
(pulling the fingers of his left hand one by one cracking the joints over and over) What do you do if a man asks you, and he's in trouble
If they find out he'd be in very big trouble
know that
Tell me, what do you know about Gordon
Very little
You did talk to him from time to time
He gave me the letters
When was the last time you saw him
() 132
: Just before he died
Did you attend any of the interrogations
No
'm not a member of the Special Branch
But once  had to deliver a letter to Capt
Stolz, Gordon was there
(concerned) How were they interrogating him
Seroke hesitates and looks at Stanley
It's okay
Tell him what you told me
(anxious) What
They were using the pole
The pole, what's that
(demonstrating) They handcuff you and manacle your feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees
Then you're like a chicken ready for the oven
They hang you between two tables
Then they do what they like with you
The
call it the aeroplane
Ben is horrified
see
Who were in that room
Stolz
Lieutenant Venter and a black
() 133
: You are sure
He's sure
(to himself) It's very interesting
When was the last time you saw him
(nervous) saw them take the body away to the cells
He was limp
You did
Johnson, why do you stay with the police
You don't really belong there
It's a job
And how can  go away
love my family
He jumps up and faces Ben with a look of anger and panic
They must never know  told you anything
Right
understand
promise
This is strictly between the three of us
Don't worry, man
Seroke shakes hands with them as he's leaving
(slapping his back) Take it easy
Stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer
(
) beer, Lanie
(shouting) No, thank you
You know, Stanley, after what happened the other night  was about to give this whole thing up
() 134
: (intrigued) What happened, man
My wife nearly got killed
Three shots were fired into the house
What right have  to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger
That's what asked myself
Three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like Stolz, and say ' give up
' What is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life
Shit,  thought you had more guts than this, man
didn't say 'm giving up
But you thought about it
Johnson has revived my determination
It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but we'll survive
You and me tell you
You think we may still win in the end, Stanley
Of course not, Lanie -- but we needn't lose either -- what matters is to stick around
Ben nods
By the way, man, 'm off on a trip -- Botswana -- thought 'd tell you in case you get worried
Why are you going there
() 135
: Business
Tell you next week
Now for the bad news 've been saving to the last
What
Julius has been arrested
He broke his banning order and visited his sister
You know what that means
At least a year's imprisonment
year in jail just for visiting his sister
That's the chance he took
And he'll be the last to complain
Don't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us
So what
Lanie, you're not getting guilt complexes now, are you
That's a luxury only liberals can afford
Julius will be back, man
All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze
How can we shrug off a man we've been working with
Who said we're shrugging him off
Best way of remembering a man, Lanie, is to carry on fighting
'  - Ben's study is in chaos
The books have been plucked from the shelves and the contents of his drawers emptied on the floor
Ben standing in the middle of the room surveying the vandalism
136
- This is a medium-sized kitchen with two doors leading from it, one to the dining room and the other to the living room
It has not changed since it was furnished twenty years ago, the only modern appliances being the electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table
Ben is leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the living room, drinking coffee
Melanie, bare-feet, her long black hair tied up in a ribbon, is washing up
She looks younger and fragile with this hair-style
(smiling) What about you
What
mean not married
And living in this chaos with my eccentric father
love him and we get on perfectly
We have been together since  was a year old
My mother could not adapt to South Africa
She went back to London and we've never heard from her since
Being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that
Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic mother
In fact she had two families, me and her three children in Alexandra township
And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist
Why a journalist
(laughs) Sometimes  ask myself the same question
She leans against the sink and picks up her mug of coffee
() 137
: Alright
'll tell you
was brought up in a sheltered way, not that Dad was possessive, not openly anyway
think he'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect me as much as he could
Then,  went to university
don't know what you'll think
being a teacher
Pause
About what
Then  married my ex-teacher
Oh
He must have been young
Fifteen years difference
He too protected me like Dad
Then one day  visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township was shocked, Ben, and ashamed
Go on
Melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up
That made me think that  was a parasite, something white and maggot-like
just a thing
a sweet and ineffectual thing felt more and more claustrophobic
Poor Brian, who loved and pampered me
Had no idea what was happening
left him for a whole year and we divorced
And then you became a journalist
Melanie goes to the living room, as she passes Ben she touches his arm and continues talking
() 138
: (
) thought it would force me, or help me, to expose myself
To force me to see and to take notice of what was happening around me
Did it work
She returns to the kitchen with a cigarette
wish  could give you a straight answer
What did help me was my wanderings in Africa
How did you manage that on a South African passport
We South Africans are white devils in Africa
My mother was English, remember
So  get a British passport
It comes in handy even for the paper
You really are your father's daughter
wonder what he's doing right now
Most likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever
One of the two large  approaches them, tail in the air, and goes to Melanie, drubbing against her legs, luxuriously
She picks it up into her arms
How often does he go on these trips to the veldt
It depends -- (approaching Ben with cat) -- Bonjour, Ben
'm Porto and my friend is Bello
Ben smiles and starts to caress Porto in Melanie's arms
139
- '  - - Parked outside the house is a municipality truck already half-laden with Emily's furniture and possessions
Four Africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck -- super- vising the eviction of Emily are a white Soweto official, Captain Stolz and Lt
Venter
In the b
g
, a hundred yards away is a "hippo" with black and white armed policemen
Behind the truck are two police Land Rovers
Emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes
Her daughter is carrying the youngest child and standing next to Emily -- several children are watching
woman in the crowd starts singing a freedom song: " " ("   ")
The song is taken up by the other women
Venter tries to stop them and disperse them
Stolz signals to him to leave them alone
One of the Africans then walks up to her for the chair
She refuses to get off the chair
The man looks at the white official as though to ask "what do  do
" The official looks at Stolz
Venter walks up to Emily and, about to pull her off the chair
Don't you touch me
Venter pulls back
The women start to ululate
Emily rises majestically, takes the youngest in her arms and walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter
People cluster around her, singing with rage and shaking her hand
Stolz observes the scene, impassive
(
) Come back
Buya
(shouts) Buya
Buya
Emily and the children are helped onto the back of the truck which drives away preceded by the police "hippo" and escorted from the rear by the Land Rovers
The crowd continues singing
- Ben is leaving his home
This is a Saturday morning
Two men are sitting in a car a few yards from the entrance to the house
Ben doesn't pay attention to them
When he is about twenty yards past, one of the men, Jaimie -- who was present when Gordon was arrested -- gets out of the car and follows Ben
Ben stops at a corner for a car and again the  stop
() 140
: He turns furtively and sees the man, stopped, turning his head
Ben decides to turn the corner, and listens to the The man is still following
Ben then decides to turn right back to have a good look at the man
They pass each other and Ben takes a good look at him and turns back onto the streets to the local shops
The man decides not to follow
'  - Ben and Stanley sit
Ben on his desk
Stanley in an armchair with a drink
They look perplexed
(irritated) She's a widow, man
That's what happens in Soweto when a woman loses her man
They throw her out of the house and out of the city
(disgusted) Zululand
The whole thing smells of being an excuse to send her hundreds of miles from the case
And how will they live there
Shit
was about to find her a place, but  had to go to look for Robert
So, that's why you went to Botswana for
Sis Emily asked me but it was no use
His mind was made up
He was going to join Wellington in Zambia
Couldn't you stop him
He's a little boy, Stanley
Stanley gulps down his whisky and stands up
(focusing Ben in the eyes) He'll be back in a few years
And he won't be throwing stones
Then, puts the empty glass on the desk
141
/
'  - Stanley peers through the curtains: he sees a car parked outside the house
In it Jaimie and another
They are watching the house
Stanley quietly opens the door and walks outside
'  - Stanley walks past his car and approaches the policeman
(using his usual humor) Good evening
'd like to invite you into my humble home, but it's full of terrorists
The two policemen get out of their car, obviously angry
(pointing at Stanley's car) Open the boot
You cheeky bastard
Okay, with pleasure
They search and find nothing
Open the door and remove the seat
Stanley executes the order
Jaimie and the  - peer in, their eyes sweeping the car
Now, your pass, bliksem
Stanley   produces his passbook and hands it to the Police- man who   inspects the pages laboriously, then throws the book to   the ground
Stanley doesn't pick it up and just watches   the man
You watch your bloody step
Right
They return to their car and drive off
Stanley looks at them thoughtfully, then picks up his book
- All the students are in classes
Cloete walks        out of a classroom and sees Capt
Stolz walking towards       the build- ing
Cloete stops to wait for him
They shake         hands and walk to Cloete's office talking affably
They        enter office
142
'  - Ben and Susan in bed, asleep
The
waking them both
Ben answers
There's no one there
He puts it down
The
Ben puts the re- ceiver down
(calmly) Ben, please stop whilst there's time
Please, Ben
(focusing on ceiling) It's impossible to stop now, Susan
believe 'm right in what 'm doing
If  stop now 'll go mad
(despaired) Whatever the price you pay for it
(painfully) have got to
Susan shuts her eyes tight and turns her back on him to hide her tears
: '  - It's a functional office
Picture of the South African president (1976) John Vorster, on the wall
Various staff pictures
Ben, summoned by Cloete, sits
Think of your heritage, man
My God -- think of your wife, your family, friends, neighbors
What's going to happened to them -- all of us -- if we can't depend on our own kind
We're educationalists -- teachers
We are building for the future
Without simple justice we don't deserve a future
We're Boers, man -- Afrikaners
We are your nation
What's justice for us is justice -- period
() () 143
: (') Traitors like you are threatening centuries of Afrikaner sacrifice
That last remark was slanderous -- 'm simply being faithful to the truth
Slanderous
My God, man, you slander a whole people
He walks silently through the office then continues
You have given me no alternative
have to abide by the regulations of the Department of Education -- so  have made my report
And there will have to be a formal inquiry
But until such time
(rising) It won't be necessary, Mr
Cloete
'll send you my resignation
Thank you for making things much easier
Ben stares at him for a moment, then turns to leave
As he reaches the door, Cloete says: And it would be better if Johan left too
Ben turns to stare at him, amazed
Are you serious
He's a Kaffir-lover too, isn't he
The color drains from Ben's face
Then he steps forward, slaps Cloete thunderously across the face, hurling him back into his chair, and strides out, leaving the door ajar
144
- It's the end of the school day
The yard is practically deserted
Only Viviers waiting for Ben under the veranda
Ben appears
Oom Ben,  was waiting for you
have something interesting to tell you
(striding on towards his car) Later, Viviers
(keeping up) But, Oom Ben, it's about the they came to question me
Before they started questioning me  told them they were wasting their time
Ben doesn't react
They asked if  was cooperating with you
What  knew about the Can you imagine that
They then said: 'Mr
Viviers you come from a good Afrikaans family and it's important that you realize that communists are looking for people like you and before you know where you are they're using you
And, Oom Ben
(reaching the car; interrupting him) 'm sorry, Viviers
never wanted you to get involved
(getting into his car) have just resigned
(amazed) What
Ben drives away

'   - Christmas day lunch
Assembled around the table are Ben's Father-in-law, his wife Helen, Suzette and Chris, her husband, Johan, Ben and Susan
They're all wearing paper hats from Christmas crackers
On the table is a large piece of roast lamb, ox tongue, a large turkey and assorted vegetables
Ben is at the head of the table adjacent to the door lead- ing to the kitchen, the Father-in-law is sitting by his side facing the door
Ben is in the middle of carving the turkey, plates are being passed to him
Was last year's turkey as big as this, Papa
About the same size
Do you remember the turkey  had for Easter
You said it was as big as a baby ostrich, Papa
don't remember that, Suzette
-- You know, Johan, when  was a boy in the Karoo, we used to fry ostrich eggs
You know how big they are
(laughing) As big as this table
(to Father-in-law) think he deserves the parson's nose for that remark
They laugh
Susan laughs
She does her best to compose
Suddenly
a  at the outside kitchen door
As Ben turns towards the door it opens and
'  - Stanley erupts into the kitchen like a great black bull in white suit and white shoes
scarlet tie is matched by a huge handkerchief hanging from his pocket
He is a little drunk
() 146
: (obviously surprised by this family scene) Oh
(then grinning and laughing thunderously) Merry Christmas, everyone
There's deadly quiet -- not even the clink of a spoon -- as the Du Toits look on aghast
Slowly, as if in a dream, Ben rises and goes to Stanley who spots him
'Lanie'
compliments of the season, old mate
Stanley
What are you doing here
Before Stanley answers, the Father-in-law gets up from his chair and goes to the kitchen
-- Who's this Kaffir, Ben
(shocked) Why don't you tell the Boer who this Kaffir is
Shut up, Stanley
(to Father-in-law) That's all right
'll
-- (quivering with rage) Kaffir calling me a Boer
Chris hurries into the kitchen ready for a fight
Ben, did you hear that
Call the police, Ben
(to Father-in-law) Please, go to the table
(to Stanley) Stanley, wait outside
() 147
: (fuming) Who are these people, anyway
Stanley, this is still my house
Let me throw him out
Ben steps between them and pushes Chris back into the dining room
(laughing) Let him try, leave him, Lanie
(to Father-in-law) Please leave me with him
'll explain everything later
-- Nothing has changed in this house
Mother, let's go
He strides into the dining room
- Susan sits   with her eyes tight shut -- trying to shut out the horror   of it all
As the Father-in-law goes into the living   room, he pulls back his wife's chair and helps her to her   feet
-- (to his wife) Let's leave this house
've been sworn at by a Kaffir and Ben protects him
(following) Chris
Chris follows
Susan also
From the living room, she calls Johan who is left alone at the table, perplexed
Johan goes to his mother
There's a general rush for the door and, without warning, the room is empty
Only the    merrily around their candles
() 148
- (with cascading laughter) Lanie
Ever in your fucking life seen such a stampede, hah
(furious) Maybe you think it's funny, Stanley, but  don't
Do you realize what you've done
(he sighs deeply) Come into the dining room
Stanley follows Ben slowly, swaying
(chuckling) Jeez, who was that old cunt with the potbelly and black suit, looks like an undertaker
- - Ben sits on his chair
My father-in-law
(deliberately) (sitting beside Ben) You joking
(he laughs) Shit
fucked it all up for you
Sorry, man
He laughs again
Ben cannot take it anymore
Now pull yourself together, Stanley
It's not funny at all
What's the matter with you today
You're drunk and making an idiot of yourself
Say what you've come to say
Otherwise, go to hell
Stanley's laughter changes into a broad grin
He sur- veys the table and takes a bit of turkey from a plate and starts to eat it quietly
() 149
: (after a pause) Right
Dead right
Put the Kaffir in his place
Ben grabs him by the shoulders and starts to shake him
Bloody hell
Stanley, what's wrong with you
Stanley shoves Ben off, and glares at him, bloodshot eyes breathing heavily
Emily is dead
Ben stares at him in stunned disbelief
Emily dead
How
When
Stanley doesn't answer - he cries
Ben grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him
What happened, Stanley
Oh, my God
Please tell me
(between two sobs) broken heart
All they said
Ben's hand still on Stanley's shoulder, he sits slowly beside him, shaken, his face ravaged by the news
God
Through the window, he sees Suzette and Chris carrying suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car; Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed Susan, helping them into the car
As they leave see Johan leaning against the dining room door, watching his father and Stanley
-   - very tense Ben is sitting on Professor Bruwer's chair
Melanie is curled up on the old settee
() 150
: They don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care
That's the main reason for coming here tonight
Melanie,  need your help
Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit
The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad
And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press
(pause) That way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament
And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country
You know, Melanie, 'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto
The enemy is ourselves
Our bigotry, our laws, our system
We have our own fight and it's just beginning
We better win before the blacks have won
Ben and Melanie laugh
Now, before going to the press, have to have all the documents must have two vital affidavits; Dr
Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia
Zambia
'm going to Rhodesia
can go to Zambia
() 151
: (surprised) Could you
And  can use my British passport
know my way around Lusaka
That would be very useful
Melanie jumps off the settee
This calls for a drink
Gin and tonic
Please
As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness
her dress swinging around her legs
her bare feet soundless on the floor
the quiet grace of her movement
On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes to the record player
There's a record already on the turntable
Suddenly as if rising from a dream, Ben murmurs: Melanie
Be careful
(as she plays the record and flippantly) Of course, Ben
She goes into the kitchen
As Melanie hums to herself to     the  , in the kitchen, Ben walks over to the     window and furtively glances out, to assure himself     that nobody is watching
He takes then a book on a pile     next to the settee and pages slowly through it
Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy mood
She places Ben's glass on the side table next to the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit down
() 152
: Cheers
Ben raises his glass and touches it with hers
Do be careful
wouldn't want you hurt
She reaches for his hand
(with gentleness) Don't worry
And hurry back
new track starts on the
(excited) That's my favorite, Ben
Jumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the side table, she pulls him to his feet
can't dance
Rugger player
They laugh as they start to dance to the slow The laughing subsides as they hold each other closer
The dancing starts to lose the beat of the music
They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel- ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him
They stop dancing
Ben kisses her
long, warm and tender kiss
' Ben and Melanie in bed
He is kissing her and fondling her passionately
During the love play, Ben reaches for the lightswitch of the bedside lamp, and knocks it over
They make love
153
- Ben is shopping at the local supermarket
He    is pushing a trolley
As he places some groceries into    his trolley, he notices a man standing near the check-out   counters
The man is similar built as Jamie and similar   hairstyle
He's reading a newspaper, his face concealed
Ben drops the package he was inspecting, back on the shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and see his face
The man moves away
Ben follows him and has decided to confront him
Man picks up a pack of ham
Ben is about to remonstrate with him
Listen, you
Just then a  and her daughter hurry to the man, push- ing a trolley
Man turns to look at Ben
Darling, put that down, it's not good for your cholesterol
(to the man) 'm sorry, my mistake
He pushes his trolley away embarrassed
'  -   - The immaculate blue of the pool
Johan hurls himself out of the water, flops down at the side
Suzette and Ben nearby, sitting in the sun
Pieter at the barbecue, sizzling thick steaks
servant in white uniform soundlessly laying the table on the patio behind him
The nanny with the baby in the shade
-- How's she doing
Better
She's waiting for you to ask her to come home
doubt it
() 154
: She turns to Ben, squinting in the sun
Papa,  don't want to interfere
Then don't
pause
know this is going to sound strange coming from me
mean haven't exactly been supportive for the past months
can't say agree with what you've done but respect you for what you are
Johan listening
'm just
destroyed by what's happening to us as a family
Suzette
(interrupts, squeezing his arm
) Please, Papa, for Mom's sake
For all of our sakes
Let's try and patch it up
Ben smiles sadly at her
Suzette understands
Johan looks at them
: '  - Ben and Johan in the car
Suzette leans in through the driver's window
Let me know if there's anything can do to help
Thanks
'm glad you understand
() 155
: don't want to worry about you
That search, this vandalism, those shots
they're really after the evidence you've been accumulating Can  look after them for you, Papa
Ben smiles
You don't have to worry
They'll never find them
(smiling) Where on earth do you keep them
Johan looking at Suzette then at Ben with concern
- Ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket section of the Asian township
He peers around him, then walks away
Ben knocks at a door
The door is opened cautiously by
, a tall, handsome Indian, aged 35 years
His clothes are casual but expensive
His six-year-old daughter, large dark eyes, is clinging to his leg
We recognize the little girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier
Dr
Hassiem
'm Ben Du Toit
'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's
(raising his hands) The inquest is over, Mr
Du Toit
Not for me, Doctor
've got to know what happened to Gordon
Dr
Hassiem looks shaky, nervous
only came home yesterday
After three months in detention and now 'm banned and confined to the house
There's nothing  can do for you
() 156
: The little girl still clinging to his leg, watching Ben
know it may be painful to you, Doctor, but  need to talk to you
How can  be sure you weren't actually sent by them
Ask Emily
Doctor, we are in the process of filing a civil claim
And your help is vital
Hassiem gives Ben a long look
He picks up his daughter and opens the door fully
Come in
Ben walks into the large living room, tastefully furnished
Sit down
Ben is still looking 'round at the opulence
He sits in a chair
Thank you for inviting me in
(the little girl on his knees) What do you want to know
Just one thing, Doctor
Why did you sign the State Pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well
(disconcerted) What makes you think  signed Dr
Jansen's report
The report produced in court had both your signatures on it
() 157
: Impossible
What did you write in your report
Dr
Jansen and  didn't disagree on the facts
After all we examined the same body in the same time
But just on the interpretation
For example, if Gordon, had really been hanged, the marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front
(he touches his larynx) But in this case, the bruises were more obvious on the sides
Pause
Ben nods, silent
Something else really upset me, perhaps it isn't important
What was it
Dr
Hassiem puts down his daughter
(leaning forward) You see, through a misunderstanding arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy
There wasn't a soul around except a young African attendant
When  told him 'd come for the autopsy, he let me in
The body was on the table dressed
noticed blood on the clothes
And then
As  examined the clothes more closely, a police-officer came in and said  wasn't allowed in the morgue before Dr
Jansen arrived
When  returned with Dr
Jansen, half an hour later, the body was naked
() 158
: (excited) Doctor, we've already got the African attendant's affidavit
He testified that Capt
Stolz ordered him to burn the clothes
(pause) Did you mention what you said in your report
Of course
found it most odd
Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing
Dr
Hassiem thinks it over for a while then: Please excuse me for a minute
Ben watches him leave the room, the little girl following him
He gets up from the chair, walks to the window, glances through it, then steps to look at some family photographs on the mantlepiece
Amongst them a photograph of Dr
Hassiem before "Big Ben
" Dr
Hassiem returns with a file, the daughter still following
(opening the file) This is my report
only have one copy
(astounded) You have a copy of the report
Hassiem grins
know how to hide things from the , Mr
Du Toit
Ben congratulates him by a deep laughter
: '  - Ben and Dr
Hassiem working as a team, tape the type- written sheets of the report among a Rand Daily Mail newspaper pages at the back
() 159
: On Dr
Hassiem's desk we recognize next to the phone, the little girl's photograph
hope you have as secure a place as  have
(with an accomplice smile) think so
- multi-storied building half-built
Stanley standing on the fourth floor watching Ben's arrival
Ben searches for Stanley who draws Ben's attention; beckons him up
Ben indicates they meet halfway
He joins Stanley who's sitting on a pile of bricks
(with expansive gesture) Take a pew, man
(sitting and excited) We have it, Stanley
Have what
Hassiem's report
You know what that means, Stanley
Melanie arrives in two days
We'll have all the evidence
Everything is in place
We'll get them yet, especially Stolz
That's fantastic, man
Stanley produces from his jacket pocket a newspaper -- Rand Daily Mail
He opens it on a certain page with the picture of an African in police uniform, and hands it to Ben
(shocked) God
It's Johnson Seroke
() 160
: Late at night
knock on the door
He opened and five shots, point-blank range
Face, chest, stomach
(reading) ' police spokesman when questioned said: "It's not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life in the service of his country, fighting terrorism
" (folding paper in disgust) Bloody bastards
They killed him
Stolz must have thought he knew too much
What's the score
The nurse is detained; the mortuary attendant has disappeared; the police van driver who brought Jonathan to hospital is detained
Julius is in jail, and now Johnson dead
Who's next on their secret list, wonder
How much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clear Gordon's name
Hey
Are you going soft, Lanie
We must keep going even more so now
And for every bloke who's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands
And for our children's future
know
If  can no longer believe that right is on my side, if  can no longer believe in imperative to go on, what will become of me, Stanley
Ben looks at Johnson's picture again and shakes his head
'  - 8x10 black and white photograph on Ben's desk
() 161
: On the photograph a naked man and a girl on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side
The man is Ben and the girl is Melanie
Stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is speaking
patronizing
We're all made of flesh and blood, Mr
Du Toit -- we've all got our flaws
And if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business
But it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher
You mean, if  cooperate, if stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you
these photographs will disappear
Let's just say  may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn't used against you
Suppose  refuse
Stolz looks past Ben
Is this your son
Ben whirls around to see Johan at the door
He shoots, puts himself between the photograph and his son obviously surprised to find Capt
Stolz there
Johan, leave us alone, please
Johan walks away
Don't you think this business has gone long enough
Ben, struggling to maintain his composure
() 162
: That's for you people to decide
Isn't it
won't be blackmailed, Captain -- not even by you
Mind if  smoke
Ben answers by a gesture
(after lighting his cigarette) Now be honest
Has all the evidence you've been collecting in connection with Gordon Ngubene brought you closer to the truth you are looking for
Yes,  think so and there's more to come
pause
really hoped we could talk man-to-man
It's not possible, Captain
Not between you and me
It's high time, Mr
Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace
'm offering you a chance
You mean my very last chance
One never knows
It may not be important to you, but we have to survive
If we can only survive through murder and torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist
Slowly and deliberately Stolz stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray
() 163
: Is that your final answer
Before you go
'll tell this, Captain
have a pretty good idea of what  will eventually uncover
mean the truth
And  won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth
Ben walks up to the door to see him out
There's no response from Stolz
He calmly takes a small card out of his pocket and rests it on Ben's desk
Here's my card -- my private line
If you should change your mind
Let's say before the end of the week
Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt the photograph
Stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase
(leaving) Be careful, Mr
Du Toit
There are people who can make things very difficult for you
They are wasting their time
They just can't hurt me anymore trust you'll give them the message, Captain
He walks out
Ben follows him 'round the garage and watches him get into his car and drive away
Johan joins his father
(mischievous) brandy, Papa
(smiling back, ruffling his hair) gin and tonic would be fine
164
- Ben and Johan are standing in the public enclosure on the top floor of the airport building
Ben is unshaved, he looks tired, but happy
There is the usual bustle of airport staff for the steps and luggage, two-thirds of the staff being black
Passengers emerge from the plane Melanie amongst them
Some waving to friends and relatives on the public en- closure
Melanie stops momentarily and looks up at the enclosure
She sees Ben and Johan and waves at them
They wave back and Ben indicates they'll be waiting for her below
She walks off as they happily await her after the ususal formalities
- Ben and Johan are waiting outside the arrivals exit
Several passengers stream out, some being met
Eventually there is a trickle of passengers
An   is one of the last to come out
Ben approaches her
Excuse me, 'm waiting for a lady with a red dress
Are there still, many people to come
did see her
She was ahead of me
Maybe she's still in there
Thank you
Just then an  walks out of the door
Ben hurries to him
Excuse me
Can  help you
'm waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer
She's taking a rather long time to be cleared
What did you say her name was
Melanie Bruwer
'll go and check
() 165
: The Official hurries back
Is there any other exit, Papa
No
They have to collect their luggage and pass through customs
(joking) Maybe she can't find her bag
(smilng back) That's possble
Just then Stolz appears through the door
He slowly walks up to Ben and Johan
Ben becomes apprehensive
Afternoon, Meneer Du Toit
Johan, isn't it
Ruffling his hair; Johan pulling away and glaring at him
What now, Captain
Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, Miss Bruwer
You know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful
Now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country
But you know something else
She has been secretly holding a British passport South African passport and a British pasport
Now you tell me, where is her patriotism
Her allegiance
The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant
So she is being put on the first available plane to London
This must be heart- breaking for you
Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit, Johan
Stolz walks back
() 166
: (quietly) Let's go home, Johan
don't understand, Papa
(striding) 'll explain later
They hurry out of the building in silence
'  - Ben and Johan arriving at the house
An unsympathetic small crowd is there waiting
They react, murmuring in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos
The wreckage
The garage and Ben's study have been bombed
Johan leaves Ben and rushes to the house
The crowd starts to disperse
The entire    tools cupboard has been methodically ripped apart and    the contents strewn on the garage floor
Everything    is half-burnt
charred
Ben has sunk onto the stool    in total defeat
There's silence
Then Johan appears at the door
He hands Ben a large envelope -- in it, the file with all the papers
Ben looks up at Johan
(very proud) took it out
Hide it in my secret place
Ben grabs his son, hugs him and holds on for dear life
Thank you, son
You did a man's job
: '  - Ben is sitting at the kitchen table
() 167
: Before him, scattered on the table: the affidavits he collected, the Hassiem report, cuttings of articles by Melanie in the Rand Daily Mail about Jonathan, newspaper pictures of Gordon, of Seroke, of himself with Emily, the half-burnt "peace painting" of Picasso, half-burnt photo of Ben with Suzette, a staff photograph, Ben amongst it, and a charred trophy
Ben starts putting material relevent to his inquiries into a large brown envelope
Johan enters kitchen with a large envelope and hands it to his father
Somebody has dropped it through the door
Thank you
(leaving) 'm nearly ready, Papa
Ben examines the unstamped envelope with his address, with curiosity then opens it
The contents is Wellington's affidavit
(happy) Wellington's affidavit
He looks inside the envelope, expecting a personal note
There's none
(to himself) Good old Melanie
: '  - Johan is packing his sport kit and few clothes into a bag
: '  -  - Ben and Johan are walking towards the entrance, Johan wheeling his bike
Ben hugs his son
() 168
: Johan gets on the bike and rides out
: '  - Ben is pouring coffee
He looks tired and tensed
The in the living room
He hurries to answer it
Who knows, could be Melanie from the airport
- Ben picks up the phone
menacing male voice says: (
) Meneer du Toit, tonight we're coming to kill you
Ben replaces the receiver obviously shaken
He becomes aware of  approaching the kitchen
Ben is terrified
at the door and the door swings open:     it's Stanley
(anxious) What's happened, man
(obviously still scared) It's you
It was a bomb
And the papers
Don't worry
Safe
Thanks to Johan
Incidentally,  have Wellington's affidavit
Melanie found him
She's being deported
The official reason is that she possessed a British passport don't know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to me
Man, it's all happening
Stanley walks out, glances at the devastated study
He reenters the kitchen and slams on a chair
He takes a packet of "Lucky Strike" from his pocket and offers it to Ben () 169
: Like a joint
No, thanks
Stanley lights a cigarette and surveys the table
He picks up the half-burnt Picasso book, gives it a brief glance, and tosses it back on the table and starts to chuckle
(surprised) What's so funny
(still chuckling) They drop the bomb on you
Ben walks up to him puts his hand on his shoulder
There's an understanding trace of a smile on his face
- Ben sitting in a cafe smoking his pipe
waiter serves him a glass of beer, for which he pays
: - It's raining
Stanley driving in the rain on the same road as Johan
: - '     - Suzette's sports car pulls up outside the cafe where Ben is waiting
: - Ben rises as Suzette joins him at his table
They kiss and she sits opposite him
(looking at her straight in the eyes) How are you, Suzette
() 170
: (in a soft voice) Okay, Papa
Would you like a drink
No, thanks
Without taking his eyes off her, he takes a brown envelope from a chair and pushes it slowly towards the uncomfor- table Suzette
She picks up the envelope
(rising) have to go, Papa
(looking out) know
Suzette awkwardly kisses him on the cheek
Look after them
Suzette looks at him for a moment and hurries to her car
As Suzette leaves, Ben turns back into the room, his eyes glassy with tears
: - Suzette gets into her car and drives off
The parked car follows
The two cars turn at the next corner
The two cars approach following each other
As the second car overtakes, he draws Suzette's attention with his and signals her to pull up
As she gets out of her car holding the brown envelope, Capt
Stolz gets out of the other side
Suzette walks over to the passenger:      Colonel Viljoen
(smiling) see you got the goodies
() 171
: (happily) was on my way to your office, Colonel
We thought we'd save you the trouble, Mrs
Klopper
She hands Viljoen the envelope
Here it is, Colonel
Thank you
This country needs more people like you
must hurry, Colonel
Goodbye
She drives off
: '  - Stolz gets into the car as Colonel Viljoen starts open- ing the brown envelope
Now let's see what we've got
: - Stanley is parked near the building
He's drumming on the steering wheel to the rhythm of   from his car
: '  - Viljoen has just finished opening the brown envelope
He pulls out the half-burnt Picasso book and Captain Stolz's card which he gave to Ben
On the card is written: "  " (goodbye) () 172
: Ben Du Toit The bastard
: - Johan hurries out of the building and is about to get on his bike
His attention is drawn by Stanley's familiar Johan turns, sees Stanley, and with a grin makes thumbs- up sign which happy Stanley returns with his large thumb
Johan cycles away followed by Stanley
: - Ben looks at his watch
He goes to the cash desk and pays
He walks slowly out of the cafe
Stands at the door to find his car keys; the rain has emptied the street
Ben turns up his collar and waits for a break in the traffic
: - Captain Stolz alone in the car
He drives around the corner into the cafe street
Just then, Ben is hurrying across the road to his car
Captain Stolz sees him, accelerates and hits Ben, hurling him high into the air
And speeds away
People rush to Ben's side
crowd quietly gathers
and
