The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn from use
single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a picnic table
The backyard is lined by crops
Corn
Golden and brown
Six feet high
Everything is perfect
Like a postcard
And then we '

He thought he heard something
He listens Graham climbs out of bed
He moves in his pajama pants and white Barron's minor league baseball -shirt towards the bedroom door
: - Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors meet
He moves to the door that has children's drawings taped to it
He puts his ear close
Listens
Beat
He relaxes
Graham leans down and picks up two balled up sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor
He puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his bedroom
: - bathroom door is open Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded outline of where a large   used to hang
It's ghostly stained forever on the blank wall
The water from the sink stops
Graham steps into the doorway
Toothbrush and foam in his mouth
He becomes very still
: '  - The bedroom door bursts open
Graham steps into his children's room
There are children's books everywhere
Overflowing off shelves
Piled in corners
Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds
They're both empty
: - throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings onto his feet in one quick motion
He is hyper-awake
Merrill is in his late twenties
He is well build
His muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and looks around bewildered
: - Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the backyard
He spins as he looks around
Merrill, now with a -shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side stairs adjacent to the garage building
Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each other across the yard
Where are they
Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes
(yelling in the distance) Daaaad
Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the They look away from the house, across the yard and into
: - The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as they run through the crops
appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them like an apparition
She is in her nightgown
She is four
They reach her fast
She stands unaware of them in a daze
Her hair is messed from sleep
Bo where's Morgan
stands peacefully lost in her thoughts
Beat
Bo
Bo finally looks at her father
Beat
She smiles softly
Are you in my dreams too
Beat
This isn't a -- (
) Dad
Graham looks in the direction of  '
He's close
Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops
He finds  standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms
Morgan what's happening
Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan
The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought
Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's looking straight at him
Are
you
hurt
Beat
Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer
think God did it
Beat
Did what Morgan
Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his face
Graham is forced to look to his right
Beat
Graham sees something
Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet
He starts moving forward towards something
He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a clearing
Two German Shepherds are running back and forth
They are clearly agitated
Graham looks around at the , Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center
Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him
The dogs keep running and barking as ,

" : - Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the right temperature
The other hand holds a cordless phone to his ear
(into phone) Lee actually the reason 'm calling is about Lionel
Graham stokes the coals with a
(into phone) Was he at home last night with you or was he out and about with the Wolfington brothers
Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads towards the house
(into phone) Well, there was a little mischief done to our crops last night
Beat
(into phone) know he's a fine boy
No one's saying otherwise
Graham steps through the back screen door into his Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a (into phone) Listen Lee,  don't even mind if it was him
You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me
See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that
The kids were
confused by it
It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing around
(beat, listens) The movies
(beat) Are you sure
(beat) Okay, then
Thank you for your patience Lee
Graham turns off the phone
He turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds
There is a on the kitchen tiles
Houdini peed
think he's sick
Graham looks at the majestic dog
It's shivering
Take him outside
'll call Dr
Reynolds
Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces
Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the puddle of urine
The  rings with Graham still on his knees on the kitchen floor
He leans back so he can see down the hall
balding police officer stands on the other side of the screen door
That was quick Edgar
only called you boys about two hours ago
nods that he knows
Mrs
Kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, "diving for her life" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards
She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards
Spitting
By the time  got there, Mrs
Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place
She must have had a cold or something
It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach
Beat
Graham stares at Officer Paski
So what happened to your crops
: - Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water
She moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table
Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill
He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, before walking over to Houdini
The two children sit down in the grass with the dog
Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl
She stops
Takes a tiny sip of the water first
She holds the glass out to Morgan
think it's contaminated
You don't even know what that word means
He drinks
It's not contaminated
It's just tap water
Pour it in his bowl
It tastes funny
He licks his butt everyday
He's not going to mind
Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl
Beat
Houdini just sits staring at them
He is not shivering
He doesn't drink
He is unnaturally still
Bo pushes the bowl closer
'
' The children turn white
Houdini
Bo stands up
Bo don't run
Houdini crouches down
What's wrong boy
'   ,
Stop it Houdini
The German Shepherd trembles
His body tightens
He's about to leap
Beat
(soft) Bo, run
: - Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle
Beat
The crops all around them sway as the wind blows
Beat
Officer Paski yells over the wind
(yelling) It's the strangest thing Father
(yelling) Don't call me Father
(yelling) What's that
(yelling) Don't call me Father
It's just Graham now
(yelling) Sorry
They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each other
Beat
(yelling) You said something was strange
What's strange
(yelling) The footprints
(yelling) What about them
(yelling) There are none
: - Officer Paski's knee touches the ground
He points to a single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side
(soft) Look at where it's bent over
Graham stands next to him and leans in
The joint where the stalk bends from the ground is a perfect ""
It's not broken
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it
Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave
(softy) Can't be by hand
It's too perfect
Beat
Doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants
Graham, nods in agreement
Officer Paski stands up
Second thing this week  can't explain
What was the first thing
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior
Sometimes violent behavior
Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow
Sounds like a virus
No Father, they're edgy
On alert
Like they act when they smell a predator around
Peeing on themselves and everything
We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes
He turns back and stares in the direction of the house
You can barely see the roof over the crops
Beat
(preoccupied) Edgar, please don't call me Father
The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face
What's wrong
Beat
don't hear my children
: - Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table
Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard
They stop cold when they look in his direction
They begin a slow walk towards him
Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap
Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently
Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball
As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying
Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a Beat
They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth
He inhales the asthma spray
Beat
He lowers the inhaler so he can speak
(soft) He wanted to kill Bo
Beat
Graham stares at his ten-year old son
Did he hurt you
Beat
Morgan nods, "No
"  His tough exterior breaks as his face starts to tremble
He starts crying
Graham picks him up in his arms
(whispers in his ear) 'm so sorry Morgan
Graham reaches up for Bo
She has dirt and tears on her face
Beat
She slowly climbs down
Graham carries both his children as they cry in his arms
He starts towards the house
Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food
used a little Tabasco in the potato salad
Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym
Houdini's sick
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed
Make sure the knot's tight
Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands
He nods
The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed
Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door
The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck
: - Graham lies in bed
He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself
They're tough cookies, those two
They think Houdini's playing with you up there
(beat) At least it got them to sleep
Graham stares off
Beat
He smiles a little
Okay Miss Puzzle Master
got one for you
What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field
and what would scare every animal in this county
(beat) Have you figured it out yet
(smiles) You probably have
(beat) Give me a hint Colleen
Is it bigger than a bread box
: - The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight
: - Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep
His daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed
She is five inches away from his face
Graham gets startled
What's the matter
saw a monster
Can  have a glass of water
Beat
What's wrong with the water next to your bed
It tastes old
Graham slowly gets up from the bed
He takes his daughter's hand and starts out of the room
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night
Only for pee or poop
Right
Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened hall
: '  - Morgan's body is half off his bed
Graham gently lifts him back onto the pillow and covers him up
There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table
Graham moves to Bo's bed
He sits on the edge of it
She stares back at him as she holds her panda
(soft) What are you thinking about
(soft) Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself
Beat
(soft) It makes me feel better
(soft) Does she ever answer back
(soft) No
(soft) She doesn't answer me either
Beat
They both sit quietly for a moment
Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window ' Graham stands
He looks to his daughter with startled eyes
(soft) Get under a blanket
They can't get you under the blankets
: - Merrill sleeps in front of the family room television
hand gently shakes him
Merrill wakes and looks up at his brother zipping up his overcoat
: - Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us
He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house
It's time for an ass whoopin'
This is not an intelligent way to approach this
Merrill opens the front door
It's pitch black outside
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers
(whispering) We both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions
We act crazy, insane with anger
Make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side
Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle
(whispering) Explain, act crazy
(whispering) Curse and stuff
(whispering) 'm not going to curse
(whispering) You don't mean it
It's just for show
(whispering) It doesn't sound natural when curse
(whispering) Just make noises then
(whispering) Explain noises
(whispering) Are you going to do this or what
(whispering) No 'm not
(whispering) You want him coming in the house next time
Beat
They
Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness
(hushed tone) On the count of three
(beat) One
two
three
Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite directions
: '    - Merrill is in a full sprint
He hugs the side of the building as he runs
We're gonna beat your ass bitch
: '    - Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house
He waves his arms
Ahhhh
'm insane with anger
Graham spots a   darting around the corner ahead of him
've lost my mind
It's time for an ass whoopin'
: '    - Merrill turns a corner full speed '
'm gonna tear your head off
Merrill charges : - Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come to a stop facing each other
Beat
They look around, panting heavily
cursed
heard
Graham's eyes drift above them
He's on the roof
They follow the roof around the corner
They find themselves in the backyard
Their eyes catch movement away from the house
They just catch       as he disappears into the crops
The swing on the swing set is still moving from being hit
They stare across the yard silently (
) It was very dark
(
) Yes it was
: - Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad open
He faces Graham and Merrill
You can't describe him at all
Don't you think that's find of odd
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it
don't know whether to look for a midget or a -- He definitely wasn't a midget
Okay
(beat) So he was tall
(to Merrill) would say so
Probably
Over six feet
Beat
It was very dark
Yes, it was
We've established that
(beat) Just tell me about his clothing then
Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski
Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or jeans
They keep staring
Edgar closes his pad
Let me ask you two something
Don't be embarrassed by the answer
It is possible
Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around
You said you went in opposite directions
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it
But we couldn't see him
He stayed mostly in the shadows
All we could make out was movement
(beat) But 'll tell you something with absolute certainty
There was someone watching our house last night
He was looking in my children's windows and  want you to find him Edgar
(beat) need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is something serious
The three men stand in the doorway
Edgar opens his pad
apologize
Morgan walks up to the front door
He holds up a baby monitor
Can  use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie
Yes
It needs batteries
Edgar, come inside
The three men follow Morgan into the house
They pass through the family room where Bo stands at the television
She is staring at the screen Bo changes the channel
She finds a cartoon
She sits down on the sofa
Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the How certain are you, that this was a male
don't know any girls can run like that
Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some batteries
He hands them to Morgan
These are 's;  need double 's
have some upstairs
Graham starts out of the kitchen
don't know Merrill
've seen some of those women on the Olympics
They could out run me easy
They all move into the Bo watches cartoons This guy got on the roof in like a second
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves
Bo nods and moves to the television
The pack of men follow Graham up the That roof is over ten feet high
He's telling you the truth, Edgar
Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high
They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his bedroom
He moves into his They all move in with him
They got women's high jumping in the Olympics
They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me
Graham takes the clock radio from the sink
Tries to open the back
Shoot, it needs a screw driver have double 's in here
Graham waves the radio
The men and Morgan move out of the bathroom
know you're making a point Edgar
just don't know what it is
They moves down the
Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine
Scared a couple of customers
No one's seen her since
My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw
We should just keep all possibilities available
They move through the
Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon
Dad, where's the remote
Bo starts looking around the couch
Graham stops before entering the kitchen
The group stops with him
He looks at Bo searching the couch
He walks over to the television
There are three glasses of water on the  set
He stands next to the set
Doesn't see what's on the screen
Bo, you're too old to still be doing this
The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it
(beat) Now what's wrong with this one
Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father
Looks at the glass
There's dust in it
This one
hair
This one
Morgan took a sip
It has his amoebas in it
Beat
Bo turns back to her search
Graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses
He heads towards the kitchen
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility
'm not done asking questions and don't appreciate the sarcasm
They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into the
Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver
He starts opening the clock radio
Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you
Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church
Graham looks at Edgar
don't think so
Do you owe anybody money
You can tell me off the record if you need too
No
No
Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries
Is anything missing
No
Graham hands Morgan the monitor
He turns it It's still making the noises
It's broken
It's old Morgan
Morgan heads out of the kitchen
Listen,  was out of line with that whole female Scandinavian Olympian thing
Edgar nods
It's just that, 'm pretty strong and pretty fast
And  was running as fast as  could
And this guy
(embarrassed smile) He was just toying with us
Beat
Merrill walks out of the kitchen
Graham watches Edgar think it over
: - Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit
He picks them up
Sees two more on the coffee table
He gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill
Could everyone just take a seat on the couch
have some preliminary thoughts
Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches the
Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan
There are three possibilities here
We'll call them one, two and three
The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm
really don't believe that's what we're looking at here
In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all
That's kind of clear
(beat) The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family
This is a possibility, but a very slim one
(beat) assure you  will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario
He's a watcher
Someone who this is a game for
He's laying low
Doesn't want to be seen
But he wants to watch you
Study you folks
Officer Paski walks towards the windows
Graham, Merrill and Morgan follow him with their eyes
Officer Paski walks next to the television
, Officer Paski turns to them
Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen
Now  don't want you all to worry about this no more
You're making more of this than it is
(beat) You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd
(beat) Maybe you guys should do something fun
Let me worry about this person
Let me find out who it is and then -- What the hell are you people looking at
Edgar comes around to see the screen
'll be damned
Turn up the volume Bo
Bo gets up
can't find the remote
She presses the up arrows on the  controls
-- images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty-four year old local camera man in Kerala, a southern city of India
It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours
The television report cuts to Columbia University
() Crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life
They died out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes
This new resurgence is wholly different
Elements of it are unexplainable
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries
(beat) There is only a limited amount of explanations
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically
(beat) It's for real
Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply
(wonder) Extraterrestrials
What in God's name is going on
Beat
as everyone watches the images on the television screen
: - The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car
Don't ask me what  think
Cause can't think straight right now
'm going back to the station
Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and try to think clear
After that might make some calls
(beat) Hoaxes
People got way too much time on their hands
Edgar turns back to Graham
But 'll tell you something, what said in their, still goes
You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days
Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago
Six months
Edgar stares at Graham
And three weeks
It's left its mark still
The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world
Take them into town
Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things
It's good medicine
It's good advice
(beat) Say hi to Marcia for me
You take care of yourself
(beat) Graham
: - The Hess family rides in their station wagon
Graham drives
Merrill is shotgun
The children are in the back
Morgan leans forward and
signs intended to be seen from the sky -- Graham
No radio either
Just for a while
Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat
: - Downtown Bucks County
group of small stores along a quiet street
The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter
Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around
Merrill puts change in the meter
Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo
Book money
Morgan holds out his hand
Graham gives his son a look as he reaches into his back pocket
Only one
Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk
Graham watches them turn into a store
Merrill steps onto the sidewalk
Hands in his pockets as he walks away
Graham turns and calls after him
(calls out) Meet back in fifteen minutes
Merrill waves over his shoulder
He keeps walking
Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy
: '  - mom and pop bookstore
Three isles wide
, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter and watch a black and white
The Morgan steps up to the counter
Extraterrestrials
That's what they keep alluding to
It's just a bunch of crock
They're trying to sell sodas, plain and simple
've been watching these reports since morning
've seen twelve soda commercials so far
Twelve
Do you have book on extraterrestrials
Don't tell me you believe this horse manure
Morgan shrugs
Mrs
Nathan pushes her husband aside
As a matter of fact,  think we have one
Came by mistake in a shipment
Decided to keep it for city people
Mrs
Nathan points over to the far corner
Last row
Third book from the left honey
: - Graham waits at a white counter
gum chewing  in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio
(
) Why is no one saying the obvious
This is just a rash case of copycats
Someone, somewhere, does the first one
It's on , it's on the internet
In less than an hour a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are
on the verge of mass hysteria
It was asthma medicine right Father
For Morgan Hess
And it's not Father anymore
The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and She quietly finds the prescription on the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham
She doesn't ring it up
She just stands there fiddling with the bag holding Morgan's medicine
Beat
Can  ask you a favor Father
Graham stares at the girl
Beat
He nods "yes
" Can  take confession with you
Beat
Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the girl's hands in his
He talks very slowly
Tracey,  -- am -- not -- a -- reverend -- anymore
haven't been for six months
You know this
Beat
When Tracey speaks her
All this stuff on
(beat) Joe Gills was in here talking about the end of the world
'm just a little scared
(beat) Please
need to take confession with you
Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes
He exhales slowly
: - Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army uniform standing at attention on a beach
We are in a narrow
Inside the small storefront space is a desk
gentleman sporting a sits behind it
young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling out some forms
got it figured
Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him
You do
've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights
Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like
No one's got hurt mind you
And that's the give away
(doesn't see) see
It's called probing
It's a military procedure
You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things
Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation
Evaluate the level of danger
Make sure things are all clear
Clear for what
The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence
For the rest of them
It takes a second, but Merrill smiles
The crewcut guy smiles back
Merrill points at a poster
You have a pamphlet or something can read
The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures
Picks the top brochure and hands it to Merrill
The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely
Hey you didn't used to play baseball did you
Merrill looks up from the brochure
Beat
Shit
know you
You're Merrill Hess
was there that day you hit that five hundred and eighty seven footer over the left field wall and set the record
That thing had a motor on it
It's still the record right
Merrill not, "yes
" (soft) got the bat at home
On the wall
You got two minor league home run records don't you
Beat
Five
The five longest
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of  and
(
) Cause he also has the minor league strike out record
Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at the folding table
Hello Lionel
smirks
He'd just swing as hard as he could every time
It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could
Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree
(beat) Merrill here, struck out more times than any two players
Beat
You really hold the strike out record
Beat
Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket
Looks like he's not going to say anything
When he does, the words are soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times
Felt wrong not to swing
Beat
The crewcut guy shakes his head
Merrill turns and starts walking
As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in Lionel's direction, like he might hit him
Lionel flinches and covers his face
Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office
: - cursed thirty-seven times last week
said the f-word a couple times, but mostly "shits" and "bastards
" (beat) Is "Douche bag" a curse
Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the counter
suppose it's in its usage
How about "John you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara
" That's a curse
Then it's not thirty-seven
It's seventy-one
Graham's eyes widen
stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick from -mart
punched my brother in the back three times
Graham looks around the empty store for help
: '  - Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water
There is another glass, half-full, on her table
Mrs
Nathan watches as the little girl takes careful sips
Beat
Bo looks up with a grimace
It's contaminated
Carl, there's something wrong with our water
Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book
Your water is fine
Bo has a thing about her drinking water
She's had it her whole life
Like a tick people have
Except it's not a tick
(fascinated) Is that right
Bo shrugs
She places the glass she sipped on the table with the other glass
Mrs
Nathan stares at the four-year old
(
) Thirteen
Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr
Nathan points to the  screen
Coke Cola commercial is on

Mrs
Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the extraterrestrial book to her
'll take it
: - Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car
Beat
The driver's side opens and Graham sits in
Pharmacy crowded
don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone
Is that understood
Beat
Everyone nods, "yes
" Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in reverse -- and then stops
Graham is staring out the windshield
Merrill follows his stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a coming out of a store
Merrill's face changes expression too
They both stare as the man passes in front of the car
(soft) Is that him
(soft) Yeah
Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck
It's here that he notices the stares
He glances up to see the faces watching him from the station wagon
The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck
He gets in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station wagon, backs out of the parking lot
Beat
The Hess family sits quietly
Who is he
Nobody says anything for the longest time
He's the man who killed mom
Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into the street
: - The crops sway hypnotically in a gentle breeze
The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway
It comes to a stop in front of the house
The engine goes off
No one gets out
: - All four sit quietly not getting out
Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor out of his jacket
He holds it in his lap
Beat
What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials
Beat
All this crop stuff
They did it twenty-five years ago
It was a joke
It's just static Morgan
Turn it up and see
Morgan turns a knob on the side
It's a code
Let me see that please
Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat It's noise
It's broken Morgan
It'll just keep doing this
(beat) Let's get out of the car okay
We might lose the signal
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this
We'll look like mental patients
Beat
Nobody gets out of the station wagon
'm getting out now
Don't do it
Graham pulls the handle
His door opens
He waits before getting out
The other three station wagon doors open right after
Graham stands and closes his driver side door
,   , Nobody move
Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon
Three of the doors are open
,    , Voices
Did you hear that
Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand
Not English though
You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill
heard them Morgan
Graham doesn't move his arm
He keeps it out in the air where he had it as he closed his door
Graham looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon
It's probably picking up another baby monitor
That's right
Let me see it
Beat
Graham moves
He hands the monitor over the hood
Merrill reaches for it
, Stop
Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over the roof of the station wagon
It doesn't sound like words
Merrill concentrates on Graham looks around at his rapt family
See this is why we're not watching those news reports
People get obsessed
(beat) 'm letting go now
No dad
Don't do it
You'll lose the signal
Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them
Beat
Morgan is the first one to move
Don't let go
He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper where he begins to climb onto the station wagon
Morgan
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it
Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands
Morgan, be careful
got him
Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew
Morgan raises the monitor above his head
, Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood
Hold on
Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood
He takes hold of Bo
All four are on the car now
Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon
Merrill holds him by the waist
Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and the windshield
Graham boosts her up over his head with both hands
Merrill you got her
Merrill reaches out his free hand
Bo reaches out to him
Stop
Everyone  exactly where they are
Graham holds Bo over his head
Bo reaches out to Merrill
Merrill sits on the roof with one arm out
Morgan stands with the baby monitor raised high in the air
The Hess family remains very still on the hood of their station wagon as they listen
- (soft) There's two of them talking
- , Graham struggles to hold Bo up
Bo struggles to keep her arms out
Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the incredible
Morgan's eyes widen as , -      , '
Beat
Everyone looks up at the baby monitor
The red lights are off
' Beat
(soft) They hung up
Graham brings Bo down into his lap
Morgan takes a seat next to Merrill on the roof
The Hess family sits like mental patients on the top of their station wagon
: - The  are on in the kitchen
We see Graham, Merrill and the children doing dishes after dinner
The
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post outside the barn
The dog whips back and forth frantically
She keeps looking in our direction
Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of dog food and a bowl of water
We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog
When he gets close, Graham slows
He approaches the dog carefully
He places the two bowls close but not too close
The dog has no interest in them
She keeps barking and glaring in our direction
Graham watches her for a few moments, and : - Graham stands frozen looking across his yard
Isabelle, the dog turns in desperate circles behind him
Graham's eyes stay focused on the same point in the darkness
He talks to no one
You know something
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting
Beat
Graham starts to move
can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing
Graham reaches the barbecue area
There's a flashlight on the picnic table
Graham Graham starts toward the crops
It's a kind of faith
It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see
Graham steps right up to them
He hesitates and then steps into the field of We can't see two feet in any direction
Six foot stalks of corn line Graham on all sides You were always good at that
Graham starts following it
His shoulders brush crops on either side
Believing in things you couldn't see
(beat) You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you
You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor
Graham stops
Nothing but crops disappearing into darkness
It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe
'
Graham spins and aims the (yelling) You're wasting your time here
'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or  or anybody
You're not going to get famous
Beat
There is no response ,
' Beat
Graham holds his breath Graham turns and drops the  at the same time ' Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness
His hands search over the ground in all directions
They finally touch the flashlight
Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the "on" button
He does
It instantly moves into the darkness
Graham tries to get up
He stumbles backwards into the crops
He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise
He gets up and starts running
Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions
He panics
He doesn't know where he is Graham makes a sudden right turn
He puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes
He's running as fast as he can
Another sudden turn, this time left
Graham emerges into his Graham keeps running across the yard When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns
There is no one behind him
The wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze
Graham gains control of his breathing
He turns and walks to the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step
: - Graham steps into the kitchen
His hair is messed
His shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it
He locks the back door
The children don't notice his presence
They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes
Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room
He sees Merrill there
Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the mounted above the fireplace
Merrill doesn't notice him either
Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat
His breathing is a slow controlled pant
He runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks
His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind
Beat
Merrill is the first to notice him
He moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen
As he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet
The children stop playing and look up to Merrill
They follow his stare to the kitchen table
Beat
Graham looks up at them
(soft) Okay

: - -- first appeared fifty two minutes ago
"'"
Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering lights
Fourteen
Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the television set
Mexico City officials as well as officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either government's airforce
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space
They were not detected by radar by either country
Beat
The crazies were right
Beat
Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on the screen
We have to tape this
Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand
He grabs one
Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the
My ballet recital
Morgan stares at his sister
(gravely serious) Listen Bo
This is very important
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change
The history of the world's future is on the  right now
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there
(beat) For your children Bo
My ballet recital
Dad
Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen
(preoccupied) Find another tape
Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa
They both have the same dazed, slow movements
Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically
He finds one and reaches for the
Uncle Merrill, 'm using your tape
Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the  and presses record
He's breathing heavy now
Wheezing actually
Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his father and his uncle
Bo walks over and squeezes in also
The four of them stare at the television
You're seeing a live feed from our  affiliate down in Mexico City
The time there is 7:17pm
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way
What you're seeing is real
(beat) Everything they wrote in science books is about to change
Beat
(soft) Told you
Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales
: - The family room lights are off now
The  is still on
The There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on the television now
The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen
Morgan is asleep on Graham's lap
Bo is asleep on Merrill's shoulder
(whispers) Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world
Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill
(whispers) That's true
Merrill looks his brother in the eyes
Beat
(whispers) Do you think it's a possibility
(whispers) Yes
(whispers) How can you say that
(whispers) That wasn't the answer you wanted
(whispers) Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be
Give me some comfort
Beat
Graham thinks it over
(whispers) There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us
You see signs
Sometimes they're little ones
You think of someone
The phone rings
They're on the phone
Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City
(beat) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing
But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle
sign of God's existence
It's all in how you look at things Merrill
(beat) What you have to decide is what kind of person you are
Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance
Beat
Merrill is deep in thought
was at this party once
'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney
She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me
go to lean in and kiss her and realize  have gum in my mouth turn and take out the gum
Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around
Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself
(beat) knew the second it happened
It was a miracle
could have been kissing her when she threw up
That would have scarred me for life
may never have recovered
Merrill looks at the  screen
Beat
'm a miracle man
Those lights are a miracle
Graham smiles
(whispers) There you go
Beat
(whispers) So which type are you
Beat
(whispers) Do you feel comforted
(whispers) Yes
(whispers) What does it matter then
The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television
It's a long beat before Graham speaks
(whispers) Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her
Beat
Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother
(whispers) She said, "See", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said
"Tell Merrill to swing away
" Merrill's mouth opens a bit
Graham turns and chuckles at his expression
(whispers) Do you know why she said that
Merrill nods, "No
" (whispers) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head
(beat) There is no one watching out for us Merrill
We're all on our own
Graham turns back to the television
Beat
: - Graham's eyes open
the family room
He is alone on the couch
Alone in the room
He looks to the television
It's not there
Graham moves to his feet and look around the room
His eyes stop on an   that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door
Graham moves to the door
Graham opens the Merrill looks up
He's seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him
For the kids protection
All they were doing was watching  from five a
m
felt like they were getting obsessed like you said
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right
What's furry, furry rabbit
(points) That's a game isn't it
(beat) Anyway
(points at the ) There's been some interesting developments
What time is it
Eleven a
m
They're gone
Beat
Graham looks at the  screen
There's a daylight shot of Mexico City
The skies are empty above it
But they're not really gone
We just can't see them
Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night
Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down
Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning
They found the bird
His head crushed in
When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky
(beat) They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell
Already thought of
Two other birds did the same thing an hour later
Not as dramatic
They lived
But you could see they hit something
Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different eyes
They're still there hovering
In fact, some people think there's more of them now
All over the place
Over us even
(beat) And there's a theory about the crop circles now
They think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system -- so they can navigate
Coordinate
Makes sense doesn't it
: - We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door, which is closed
The same sun-faded outline of where a large cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door
Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window
The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym single tree throws shade onto a picnic table
The back of the yard is lined by corn crops
Golden and brown
Six feet high
The crops go on well beyond our view
Graham stares at them quietly
Watching
Beat He listens closely : '  - Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room
Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed
They have wrapped around their heads like a helmet
Graham stares at his children
So the aliens can't read our minds
Oh
They tell you everything in this book
Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore
Graham enters the room
The children make space for him on the bed
He takes a seat between them
Morgan puts the book on his father's lap
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development
It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet
Who wrote this book
Graham looks on the back cover for a picture
There's none there
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs
That means they're unemployed
Morgan closes the book
Dad, are you going to be serious
Bo points at the book
Yeah, serious
Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads
don't know what got into me
Beat
Morgan puts the book on his father's lap
There are pictures
Beat
Morgan opens the tome
Dr
Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- Bimboo
Dad
just asked his name
You had a tone
Beat
Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a tone
He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us
Morgan turns the page
To make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe
Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human
Or the other reason
They're hostile
They've used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next
Morgan turns the page
There is a picture of a house space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at it
Beat
Looks a little like our house doesn't it
Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture
Beat
The same windows
(soft) That's weird
The three of them study the picture of the house
It's on fire
Their eyes move to the front yard
There are three bodies lying dead on the front lawn
Two are children
The children  and cling to their father The   again
Graham gets up
He closes the book
That's enough from Dr
Bimboo for now
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something
Graham steps out into the hallway
He tucks the book under his arm and picks up the phone
Father
, and then the phone disconnects
Hello
Graham looks at the receiver and then slowly hangs it up
Graham walks down the hall to a small window
The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road
Graham stares into the distance
About a half-mile away we see the
Graham gazes at it for a beat
: - Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on
He moves to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it
Merrill looks up from the television
'm going out for a few minutes
No one leaves this house
No one
Merrill nods
Where are you going
Ray Reddy's house
Graham starts down the hall
Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time
He looks down the hall shocked
Why
Graham unlocks the front door
think he just called here
: '  - -- (
) You don't think something bad will happen do you Morgan
Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up on the window seat in his room
Why, you got one of your feeling again
Bo nods, "Yes
" Is it bad
Bo nods, "Yes" slowly
If it does,  won't let anything bad happen to you
Bo hugs Morgan tight
(soft) don't want you to die
Who said  was going to die
Bo keeps hugging Morgan
Who said  was going to die
Beat
Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him
Come on Bo
need to keep a look out
Bo lets go
Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the telescope
: - mailbox reads "
Reddy
" There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter mile driveway
We saw the roof of this house from the Hess hallway window
Graham stands at the front door and
Beat
Graham tries to look inside
Curtains block his view
Graham walks around the porch
Turns the corner of the house
He looks in a side window
, , Graham stands straight up
He looks around nervously
He takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the safety of his station wagon before he notices the parked to the side of the house
There is someone sitting in it
: - The passenger side window of the truck is open
Graham steps up to it and looks inside
The thin man with the leather jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel
He stares out the windshield
He is covered in sweat
Hello Ray
doesn't look over
Doesn't react
Keeps staring
Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white
Graham glances to the backseat of the truck
There are two large bags over flowing with clothes
Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the Beat
What happened Ray
Beat
Ray doesn't look over when he speaks
wrote your number down to call you
It's been sitting next to the phone for six months
When  knew it was inside the house,  couldn't think of any other number to call
panicked
(beat) Thank you for coming Father
(soft) You're welcome Ray
Tears start falling down Ray's face
worked so long that night ain't never fallen asleep driving before
And never since
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction
If 'd fallen asleep then, 'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache
It had to happen at that right moment
That certain ten-fifteen seconds when  passed her walking
It was like it was meant to be
Ray finally turns
His red face quivers as he talks
guess if this is the end of the world, 'm screwed right
People who kill Reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven
Ray starts the car
Where you going Ray
To the lake
The way  see it, all the places marked in the crops and such -- none of them are really near water
figure they don't like water
(beat) Can't be any worse than here
Beat
Ray, did you see one of them
Ray looks at Graham
'm truly sorry for what 've done to you and yours
The two men stare at each other for a beat
Ray looks away
He puts the car in drive
And don't open my pantry Father locked one of them in there
Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway
: - Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats
His eyes are closed
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a forty-two year old Romero Valadares
Merrill's eyes open
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil
It was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are; this is genuine
What you are about to see, may disturb you
Merrill sits up in his chair
The chair in the closet  as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen

His mouth is open a little

: - The door swings open slowly
Graham steps into Ray Reddy's kitchen
Cabinets are open
Dishes are broken
Chairs are turned over
The faucet is running full blast
Graham's eyes move across the room
The kitchen table is upside down and leaned up against the pantry door
Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the kitchen
He leans a little bit and listens
From behind the pantry door '
Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the leaning table
Graham stands up straight and thinks it over
Beat
Graham takes two small steps closer
When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry door Hello
Beat
(loud) The police are here
am with them
am a police officer
(beat) just want to talk to you
There is no movement from the pantry
Beat
(loud) We know all about the hoax
We already took some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon
(mouths to himself) Paddy wagon
Graham waits for a reply, but none comes
If you tell us your name and why you did it, we'll give you the same deal we gave the others
Don't throw away your life son
Beat
Graham bends down where he stands
He puts his head near the wood floor
He tries to look under the door
All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry
He's at too severe an angle
Graham sits up
He's only four feet away from the pantry door
He looks around not knowing what to do
His eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor
He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to the door
Beat
He reaches with the butcher knife underneath the slanted kitchen table
He uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door
Graham watches the '
Graham pulls the knife out
He sits there kneeling two feet from the door
Beat
He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the slanted table
He stops halfway down
He loses his nerve and sits up
He rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the counter
Graham starts walking across the kitchen
He gets to the door
Puts his hand on the doorknob
He stays like that for a long time
Beat
Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor, only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the pantry
There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of the pantry
Nothing else
Graham stares at his
Something's wrong
Parts of it feel like a painting
-- , - : - The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it turns sharply onto the road
Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his right
Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon comes to a fast stop
Beat
Graham gets out of the car
He walks a few feet ahead of the station wagon
He bends down in the middle of the road
lays limp on the asphalt
Its head is crushed
Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers
Beat
Graham turns and looks straight up at the , above him
(soft) Douche bag
: - Graham enters his front hall
He closes the door and locks it behind him
He turns and looks into the family room
Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa
All three are wearing foil helmets
Beat
They're skin changes color
That's why we couldn't see him that night
Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch
Beat
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs
He takes a seat on the second to last step
He sits obscured by the balusters
Beat
Tell me something Morgan
In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile
Yes
They would invade us using only ground tactics
Hand to hand combat
They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them
'm sorry, what book is this
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade
They said one of two things could happen
One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later
What's two
They win
The words hang in the air
Graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something
Sounds made up
Beat
We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave
(beat) Or we can stay here
Board up this house
Hide inside our home and wait it out
Either way, at least we'll be together
(beat) All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand
No one raises their hand
All those in favor of home, raise your hand
All four put their hands in the air
Beat
They lower them and sit in silence
How do we know boards will do anything
Beat
(soft) Because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors
: - We see Graham inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room after another
a stack of wooden boards on the porch
to the barn where Isabelle is tied
She is not pacing
She is not barking
She sits staring right at us
She is shivering
to the garage building where we see Merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs
He's moving into the main house
Merrill walks across the yard
His eyes look around carefully as he moves
Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn
He stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things
He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases
The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has cracked
He takes the ball out
Stares at it
We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of clothes and things on the grass
He looks around and finds what he's looking for
rake
Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball in the other, he turns to face the crops
,
Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a batter's stance
His left leg digs into the grass in front of him
His weight is mostly on his back leg
He looks out into the distance high over the crops
He throws the baseball up in the air
Merrill grabs the wooden handle
Merrill's shoulders move with blinding speed
The wooden rake handle slices the air
And misses the ball
The ball drops at Merrill's feet
as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again
This time his shoulders move even faster
The wooden stick actually makes    as it cuts the air
The ball drops at Merrill's feet
as Merrill snatches the ball up and tries a third time
This time he  as he swings
He rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the eye
The baseball drops at his feet
Strike three
Merrill stands still in the yard
He's breathing a little heavy as he stares down at the ball
He gently picks it up
He walks back to his pile of things and then suddenly turns
He throws the ball in the air as he does
His left leg goes out
His weight goes to his right leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and power
The ball rockets into the air
We watch it fly overhead
sail high over the crops
it becomes a tiny dot in the sky
After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth
It lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air
It cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops
Maybe more
to Merrill standing in the backyard
He drops the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things
He piles them in his arms
When his arms are full, he starts for the porch : - Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet
Come quick
'
They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the closet
Graham and Merrill are holding hammers
All four stare at the television
Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights
There are lights in the skies over an estimated two hundred and seventy four cities
That total could be as high as four hundred within the hour
""
They decided to show themselves
Beat
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver
It's like War of the Worlds
They think it might happen all at once
The words silence everyone
Beat
The image goes back to a quiet  anchor
He takes a second before starting up again
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to synagogues, churches and temples
The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in the streets praying
Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side
Ground forces are being assembled in countries throughout the globe
'm going to get back to the windows
Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet
She turns back to the television
Beat
Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew
(whispers) You guys okay
They don't answer
They watch the soldiers loading up onto trucks on the television
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world
(beat) Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill
Don't worry
Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle
You sure right
Beat
Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces
He looks back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood
He turns back to the children
You know about signs Morgan
Not like the ones people write on
It's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it
Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled
They're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you
The children think it over
Beat
once had a bad dream and couldn't wake up
kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and  woke up
It was a picture of mom
She was smiling
It made me feel safe
You mean like that
Beat
Yeah, like that
(beat) believe in signs Morgan
think there's someone watching out for us
got to believe he's going to make sure we're all right in the end
: - Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the door half-way
He stands in the hall by himself
He takes a couple deep breaths as everything hits him
: - Morgan turns off the television
He and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs
: - Graham sits in a chair by the windows
He has a board on his lap
He has a hammer in his hands
Graham drowns in his thoughts as the skies darken behind him
: - Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls
Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools
Too many windows in the bedrooms
We don't have enough boards
Merrill stands and leans against the wall
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors
Where are we going to sleep
The family room
Everyone sits quietly for a moment
What about Isabelle
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner
Beat
'll make sandwiches
want spaghetti
We should eat fast Bo
Spaghetti sounds great
Merrill glances at Graham
What do you want, Morgan
Beat
Anything
Graham nods "yes
" French toast
and mashed potatoes
Now we're talking
(beat) How about you Merrill
Graham turns and looks at Merrill
They stare at each other quietly
They have a conversation without words
Beat
(soft) Chicken Teriyaki
Good choice
'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon
(smiles) Extra bacon
: - The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back door
The sink is piled with pots and pans
It seems like every utensil and dish in the kitchen was used
: - One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have been boarded up
The table is set
Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast, chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed elegantly on serving dishes
The Hess family sits around the table
Beat
The scene is somber
No one is moving
What's the matter with everyone
Eat
No one says anything
No one eats
Beat
'm scared
Me too
don't want to hear anymore talk like that
And  don't want to see anymore faces like the ones 'm looking at
(beat) We are going to enjoy this meal
Nothing can stop us from enjoying this meal
Enjoy
Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry
Stop crying
Don't yell at her
Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table
Fine, if you all don't want to eat, then 'm going to have some of everything
Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his plate
He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it in his mouth
He swallows
This tastes so great
Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham stuffs more in his mouth
He chews and chews and swallows hard
He digs his fork into the pile again
Graham starts crying as he eats
He keeps taking more bites
More tears fall
Morgan gets up from his seat
He goes to Graham's chair
He leans against his dad's arm and cries with him
Graham's fork stops moving
He watches as Bo moves from her seat to his other side
She holds her dad's arm and cries
Beat
Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and hugs them tight
Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile on Graham's chair
Merrill buries his head in Graham's shoulder
The Hess family huddles together at one end of the table
Beat
Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place setting where the baby monitor sits on the table Merrill sits up
Graham puts down the children from his lap
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out of the dinning room
He moves through the family room and into the hall
Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television
He turns it
Beat Beat
Graham changes stations
Beat
Graham steps out into the hall
Merrill and the two children are standing there waiting
Graham looks at them
(soft) It's happening
: - Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the children's bedroom door
The master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it
Graham is inside his bedroom : '  - Graham walks to the window next to his bed
It's the same one we've looked out twice before
Graham looks out onto his backyard
The There is a light breeze
Nothing seems wrong
Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness
He moves closer to the glass
Watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind
Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black forty feet away
Graham goes very still
; '  '
Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom
Graham hurry
Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in the hall
Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the bedroom door behind him
: - Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame
Graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood
Graham glances to his right as he works
Bo and Morgan are standing together at the top of the stairs
Bo holds Morgan's hand
Graham keeps hammering as he speaks
Did  ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo
Bo nods "no" lightly
You came out of your momma and you didn't even cry
You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped
Graham stops hammering
Merrill keeps going
They literally gasped
(Graham gasps like them) Then they go, "She's like an angel
"  They said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful
" Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment
Merrill finishes hammering
Graham goes over and picks up Bo
(soft) And you know what else happened
Bo nods, "no
" (soft) When they put you on the table to clean you up, you looked at me and smiled
They say babies that young can't smile
You smiled
Graham looks at his daughter quietly
He brushes the hair out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up
All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors
Beat
(soft) Let's go down now
: - Graham puts Bo down in the hallway
She stands close to him
Merrill puts down Morgan
The four of them stand quietly in a tight group
We forgot about Isabelle
' Beat
(whispers) Should we turn off the lights
(soft) They already know we're here
(almost inaudible) Dad -- Do you know what happened when you were born Morgan
Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak
You came out and your momma kept bleeding
The doctors rushed you out of the room before  could even see you
All four look up
They're on the roof
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you
Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors
They're in the house
Graham takes Morgan's hand
wanted your momma to see you first
She had dreamed about you her whole life
(beat) They waited till she felt better, then they brought you in
They placed you right in her arms
And she looked at you
And you looked at her
You just stared at each other for the longest time and then she said real soft, "Hello Morgan, 'm you momma, you look just like dreamed
" Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back
The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs
The
Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the ceiling of the upstairs hallway
He stares at a rectangle in the ceiling
tiny rope hangs from the rectangle
Beat
The attic door
Merrill sprints up the stairs
Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill
: - Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling
There is movement right above them
Dust falls from a ceiling light right next to them
The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway
The springs in the trap door begins to
The door starts to fall open
Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and reach up
The door opens a few inches
Merrill is taller
The door presses against his fingers first
It gives a few more inches before Merrill stops it
Graham's finger are barely touching it
Merrill's face turns red with strain as something pushes down on the door
This is a very temporary solution
Graham brings his arms down
He sees his children watching from the bottom of the stairs
Graham looks around where he is
There is a very small table with photos against a wall
laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors
nothing else
Graham turns to Merrill
How temporary
Merrill's face is a deep crimson
Twenty-two seconds
Graham looks around again
the same things
the same table
the same closet
Graham stops and stares at the closet
It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed on a guide rail
The wooden folding door is very tall
Its top is one foot from the ceiling
Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door
He starts rocking it hard
Pulling it out
It starts to come out of its guide rail
Graham leans back with all his weight
The thin wooden door rips out of place
One end is still attached at the hinge
Graham pulls it straight
It reaches into the middle of the landing
It stands right next to Merrill
Right under the attic trapdoor
Its top is only a few inches lower than Merrill's reach
Let go
Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor
It connects with the top of the closet door and stops
The trapdoor is now open almost a foot
We can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic
Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door
After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up
The trapdoor closes
Beat
It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a
The attic trapdoor closes again
Opens again with force
The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright
Graham moves down the stairs
Merrill follows him
: - Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door
-- Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall
Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall
Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs
: - The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he enters the kitchen
Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it
Merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door
They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and jam the rest underneath the table
Graham leans against the kitchen counter
Merrill stares at the pile of furniture
This is going to do nothing
We have to go in the basement
Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom
There's no way out of there
Beat
Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children
Did  ever tell you,  dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm
Should we make a run for it out the back
They're right behind the door
Merrill looks at the boarded up back door
Graham turns to Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall
He was only a year and half old
(to Graham) What are you doing
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar
Your grandma said, "No
"  He tried to take a bite, so grabbed it
Merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen
must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle
His elbow popped right out of the socket
He didn't scream or anything
His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still
They're coming
Graham moves towards the basement stairs
held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital
couldn't stop crying
We need to go into the basement now
Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs
Morgan and Bo move to their father slowly
You know what your Uncle Merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place
He jumped off the table and gave me a hug
He had already forgotten that  was the one who hurt him
Graham ushers the two children down the stairs
He waits for Merrill
Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks toward him
Merrill stops and looks down the stairs
We won't be able to get out of there
'm sorry  hurt your arm
Beat
Merrill's eyes fill with water
He doesn't look up at his older brother

Merrill walks down the stairs
Graham waits at the top
He watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against it
Beat
The door starts to force its way open - ,
: - Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement
We forgot our foil helmets
Graham closes the door behind him
It has no lock
We need something to wedge against the doorknob
The basement is lined with metal shelves
The shelves are cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools
Merrill rummages through the shelves frantically
They'll read our minds
You're scaring your sister
'm already scared
Graham puts his ear to the door and listens
Merrill -- 'm looking
Merrill moves to another set of shelves
He starts knocking things to the ground
(to himself) They'll know our secret thoughts
There is
The doorknob turns
Graham grabs it with both hands
The door begins to push open
Merrill
Got it
Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground
He holds it up in the air
It has a three-foot wooden handle
Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction
single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling
It is the only light in the room
Merrill with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room

No sound
No signal
He listens to the
Beat
What's happening out there
Beat
(in the dark) can't even imagine
hope they're doing better than we are
We don't even have helmets
He looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights
They're just making noises
They're not trying to get in
(beat) Why are they doing that
Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness
Morgan moves his
They want our attention on the door
beat of silence
They're distracting us
From what
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers
What book
They'll find a way in
Morgan, give me your flashlight
Morgan puts the '
He picks it up

- Merrill slowly catches his breath
He reaches over to his side and grabs the remaining flashlight ' '
' '
We don't have his medicine
Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray
Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear
Don't be scared Morgan
We'll slow it down together
Feel my chest
Feel it going in and out
Breathe like me
Breathe like me
Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain and panic
He can't breathe
Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch
Graham closes his eyes
Beat
He opens his eyes and talks into Morgan's ear
Stay with me
Stay with me know it hurts
Be strong baby
It'll pass
Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness
Don't do this to me again
Not again
Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face
Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on Graham's hand
The fingers squeeze with all the strength they have
Graham looks to Merrill helplessly
Merrill's eyes fill up with water
Graham's eyes close
hate you
hate you
Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear
The fear is feeding it
Don't be afraid of what's happening
Believe it's going to pass
Believe it
Just wait
Don't be afraid
The air is coming
Believe
We don't have to be afraid
It's about to pass
Here it comes
Don't be afraid
Here comes the air
' There we go
We don't have to be scared at all
We know it'll pass
We believe it
Don't be afraid Morgan
Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand
Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his son
Feel my chest
Breathe with me
Together
The air is going in our lungs
Together
We're the same
We're the same
Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with Graham's
' Graham's eyes close
He starts crying
He speaks to no one

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand
Merrill watches as father and son breathe together
Merrill and Bo hold each other tight

Graham nods without looking over
Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in her hand Merrill nods to her
She reaches down and presses the button

Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have also confirmed
Graham opens his eyes from sleep Merrill steps into his vision
found a pack of light bulbs
Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf Parts of China and Northern Korea are among the few remaining to verify withdrawals
They're broadcasting
It came on about two hours ago
Woke me up
(beat) We won Graham
Merrill waits for his brother to say something
Beat
It went on all night
Everywhere
It was completely a ground battle
Mostly hand to hand
You can't see them unless you're up close
lot of people died
Some from combat
But most from poison gas inhalation
They secrete it
Beat
How many died
They think over a hundred thousand
They're just estimates
(beat) But we held strong
How do they know it's over

(beat) don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay
'm serious
Merrill's face is hard
He looks shaken
Graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression
(soft) Okay
Beat
'
Graham and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on Merrill's folded sweater
Morgan's breathing is strained
He still looks grey
He's been like that for awhile
We need to get him some medicine
Have they said anything about our area
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure
Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground
Graham turns to Merrill
(whispers) He's not strong enough to fight off another attack
(whispers) know
(beat) We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham
The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan
He moves across the room towards him

Beat
Merrill opens it all the way
Merrill moves up the stairs by himself
He reaches the top and looks around
Turns back down to the faces at the bottom
Gives them the thumbs up
Graham leads Bo up the stairs
He carries a limp Morgan in his arms
: - Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the toppled chairs to get to the cabinets
Get the syringe as well
We might need to give him an epinephrine shot
Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets
: - Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa
, Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room
People are dancing
She points at the closet
Morgan strains to look in her direction
Graham looks at him
You want to see it
Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe
'll bring the  in here
: - Today there are no countries, and no races, and no differences -- we are all apart of the same -- Graham unplugs the television
The screen goes black
Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and the television cart out into the hall
: - Graham pulls the television into the family room
Careful not to trip it on the carpet
Graham moves the television into position The  stops moving
Graham stays frozen with his hands on either side of the television cart
He's slightly bent over
His back is to the family room
Graham straightens and turns around slowly
Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air
Morgan's face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up
For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air
Then we see the outlines
and we see the eyes
The black eyes
There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the middle of the family room
It's powdery skin has taken on the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly, it almost disappears
It blinks
Graham and Bo have turned to stone
Bo stands frozen in the front hall
Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the family room
He takes two steps into the room and comes to a stop next to the fireplace
The inhaler and syringe in his hand fall to the ground
The creature is between Graham and Merrill in the middle of the family room
Morgan is dying
The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand
Graham's eyes shift to the hand --
The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face
It tilts its fingers and palm back '
small pore opens up on its wrist Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of the creature
It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's
-- ' (soft) He's reading my -- : - The car door opens
Graham Hess steps out
His coat is open
He is wearing a black shirt and black pants priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt
Graham looks around in a daze
We are on a country road Four police cars are scattered amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances
large group of officers and workers hover around a green truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees
Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham
He whispers something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he approaches
Edgar looks badly shaken
Beat
The two men look at each other
What do you know
Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides
Beat
There was an accident
Drunk driving
They weren't sure
He wasn't drinking
Ray fell asleep at the wheel
Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the ambulances
Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass
His arms rest on his bent knees
Is he okay
Yes
That's the first thing Colleen asked too
Graham smiles a little smile
She's talking
Which ambulance is she in
Beat
She's not in an ambulance Father
Why not
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah
Hit Colleen and then a tree
She was pinned between the two
Pinned
What does that mean
Beat
The truck
the truck has severed most of her lower half
What did you say
Beat
She won't be saved
At this point she's alive, because the truck is holding her together
She doesn't feel much, and she's talking almost like normal
We didn't pull the truck out, cause we wanted you to come down here to be with her, as long as she's awake
That won't be very long
(beat) Father, you understand what 've told you
Beat
Edgar
(he starts crying) Is this the last time 'm going to talk to my wife
Beat
Yes it is

He walks on, unaware of the stares
He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck
It sticks out onto the road a few feet
He comes around the side of the vehicle
is beautiful in a delicate way
Her straight brown hair falls down over her small face
She leans over the front bumper of the truck onto the hood
Her head rests on her arms like a child resting on a school desk
Her back is against a tree
The lower half of her is obscured by the truck
She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up to her
She is shivering slightly
(soft) Hi sweetie
Hi baby
Graham glances down
There are bundles of blood soaked blankets in the area below her
They peek out under the twisted front of the truck
Graham looks up quickly
was just taking a walk before dinner
You love walks
Beat
guess it was meant to be
Beat
Does it hurt
don't feel much
Good
Graham touches her cheek
She starts crying
Graham starts crying with her

He'll always take care of her
(crying) will
(crying) Tell Graham -- (crying) 'm here

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand
She rests on it
Her eyes are distant

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall
Beat
(soft) Swing away, Merrill
Morgan's face is obscured by gas

Merrill turns and looks to Graham
Swing away
Graham's eyes are not on Merrill
Merrill follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him
Beat
Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting place
The creature starts to move
Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward
He stops
His weight shifts to his right leg
The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room
Merrill's left leg goes out
His torso and shoulders turn with staggering speed and strength
The bat slices through the air of the family room
Contact
The creature gets  across the back with the baseball bat
Morgan is dropped
He falls to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile
His arms and legs flop lifelessly to the carpet
The creature turns to face Merrill
All the creature sees is the    as Merrill swings like a lumberjack
The creature falls to the ground
Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan
Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms
The creature moves to its feet
Merrill's hands choke up on the bat
Merrill's eyes are on fire
Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine on the ground
Merrill  as he swings again
His powerful muscles pull his shoulders whipping around
The bat connects with the creature across its chest
The creature is thrown back into the wall
Two glass of water fall off a shelf and '

They stare at each other with sudden realization
Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places all over the family room

Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks
Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps outside

The creature falls back into the coffee table
Bo's glasses of water crack and   the creature's His torso turns a powdery white
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its environment
Parts are white
The creature stands again
Merrill looks for the next target in the room
Bo points to the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched
Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat
He nods
: - His wrists turn
His shoulders torque ' ,         ' , --
'      -- ,
Bo watches quietly from the door
Merrill drops the handle of the bat in his hands
: - Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass
Morgan lays limp in his arms
They kneel down in the grass with him
Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand
He looks to Morgan
The boy's head is tilted back
His tiny mouth hangs open unnaturally
His lungs were closed
(beat) His lungs were closed
No poison got in
No poison got in
Merrill stares at Morgan
His body is utterly still
His lungs were closed
Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand
Don't touch him

Graham
Don't

Graham starts crying
Every bit of sadness trapped in his body is released
He looks down through tears and tears at Morgan
Did someone save me
Yeah baby
think someone did
: - We look out through the broken glass of the second story bedroom window
We see the worn jungle gym
We see the single tree throwing shade on the picnic table
We see the golden brown corn lining the back of the yard
And we see the Hess family
Sitting together on the grass
Huddled together in the sunlight
