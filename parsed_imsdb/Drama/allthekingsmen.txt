' Written by Robert Rossen Based on the novel by Robert Penn Warren 1949 Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The Chronicle
" He reads the society page
man enters and leans across his desk
Burden
Jack Burden
The boss wants to see you
He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office
Interior: Madison's Office, Day Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk
Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark
No
Who'd he shoot
Oh, county
uh
treasurer, or something like that
What's so special about him
They say he's an honest man
What want you to do is to hop into your car
Why, you promised me a vacation
Well, that can wait
Yeah
but there's a
a girl know
He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton
Oh
Well, she can wait too
Jack takes the paper back and looks at it
The question is
can
The answer is
get up there
Right
(starts to go) Oh
uh
what did you say his name was
Who
The fellow's name
Oh, the
uh
Stark
Willie Stark
Madison goes on with his work
(as he leaves) Willie Stark
: Exterior: Kanoma City, Day As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town
(voice over) found him in Kanoma City
typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat
He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square
As he walks over the begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking
to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money
When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this
Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me
Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure 'm not elected county treasurer
Well, 'll tell you why
man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering
Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills
Because they're afraid of the truth
and the truth is this
They're trying to steal your money
Yeah,  said steal
The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse
Why
Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better
The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare
They're interested in welfare, sure
But it's their own
Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures
That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners
That same brick factory uses convict labor
The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd
Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on
Why
City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace
(ignores him) If you folks'll be so kind as to read these handbills, my boy will pass them out among you
There's an ordinance against that too
(his face grim) Pass 'em out, Tom
The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of his hand
Willie jumps down off the platform
Let him alone
The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform snapping a picture
(to deputy) Get that camera
Willie, you're under arrest
He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away
The crowd follows them to the courthouse
Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat off his neck and goes back into the poolroom
: Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are playing pool as Jack enters
Where can  find Tiny Duffy
Right over there, mister
He walks over to Duffy
Some townspeople, who followed him there, gather around him to listen
Uh, they told me  could get my camera back here
Who told you that
People
Can
You the reporter that's been snoopin' around town
Are you Tiny Duffy
What paper
Chronicle
You sure come a long way to stick your nose into other people's business
That's true
Only my boss on the paper can't see it that way
It ain't any of his business either
Whose business is it
Them as is tendin' to it
County commissioners that the voters of Kanoma County elected to tend to their business and not take no buttin' in from nobody
You a commissioner
Yeah
Name's Pillsbury
Dolph Pillsbury
2ND Me too
'm a commissioner too
Who isn't a commissioner
He's the head man
(to Pillsbury) Then you're in a position to know where -- He's in a position to know nothin'
And to say nothin'
thought you said he was head man
(smiling) He uses my head
(laughing loudly) Oh, Tiny, you're a card
Ain't he a card
Yeah, he's a card
Now, who thought up those city ordinances about arresting someone for making a speech
Who's arrested
Nobody's been arrested
(looks toward the door) Hi, Willie
Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy
The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's apron, step aside to let him pass through
Hi, Willie
(to Sheriff) Did you apologize to Willie
(mumbles) Yeah,  apologized to Willie
Did you give him his handbills back
Yeah,  gave 'em back
Give him back his flag and his bag and
(points to Jack) give this man his camera
'm going to be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr
Duffy
You go right ahead, Willie
We all believe in free speech
We got to
it's in the Constitution
My boy is out distributing those handbills now
It's a free country, Willie
If you can convince the people to vote for you
you go right ahead
What did you want to see me about, Mr
Duffy
wanted you to meet a fella came all the way up from the state capital to meet you
reporter
Wants to write you up
maybe put your picture in the paper
(turns to Jack) 'm happy to know you, sir
Burden's my name
Jack Burden
Can we go somewhere where we can talk
Now that ain't polite
Don't you want to hear both sides of the story
Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him
know your side
(finds the plate missing) What happened to the plate your men took from my camera
Must have dropped out
Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax
It's a hot day
Hey, Sugar Boy
Yeah
Bring some cold beer for the boys
None for me, thank you kindly
Now you know Willie don't drink, Tiny
His wife don't favor drinking
And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie
'll have some orange pop if you don't mind
Duffy roars with laughter
Orange pop
All right, Sugar Boy
Bring him some orange pop
(stutters) Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out
Did you hear that, boys
The p-p- pop's s-s-sold out
They all laugh
Now ain't he a card
(his face hard) He stutters, Mr
Duffy, but you
you don't say anything
(to Jack) Let's go, mister
They turn and go out
: Exterior: Dirt Road, Day Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse
They pass a farmer and his family walking by the side of the road
Willie smiles and waves to them
Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the steps, waiting to welcome Willie
(as they go up the steps) This is my wife, Lucy, Mr
Burden
How do you do
That's my pa
Jack reaches out to shake his hand
: Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a napkin, and pushes his plate back
Now we'll talk
Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated around the dinner table
You've been talking for a long time, Mr
Stark
Willie's got a lot to say
You sleepy, Pappy
You want to have a nap
No,  want to hear it
Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen
'm worried about Tom
It's getting dark
He should have been home
He's a strong boy
Don't worry about him
He can take care of himself
How old is the boy
Fifteen
How long have you been married
Nine years
Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise
Lucy comes back into the room
(laughs) He was a neighbor's boy
They were poor folks
Both died
couldn't have any children, so
He's a good boy
Oh, he's the best
couldn't love him any more if he was my own flesh and blood
(to Lucy) And now you, Mrs
Stark
Oh, there isn't very much to tell about me
How did you meet
was teaching school and one day a pupil walked in
It was Willie couldn't have a grown man in the class and Willie wanted to learn so badly
so  married him
Is that the only reason
(pressing Willie's arm) Except that  loved him
Get the coffee, Lucy
She goes back into the kitchen
When did they fire you, Mrs
Stark
(as she serves the coffee) couple of weeks ago
'd been teaching for a long time and nobody ever said  wasn't all right
But don't care
don't want to teach in a schoolhouse that they built just so somebody can steal some money
And Willie doesn't want to be Treasurer, either, if he has to associate with those dishonest people
(glumly) 'm going to run
They can't keep me from running
If you don't mind the truth, Mr
Stark, you haven't much of a chance
'm going to run
They're not going to kick me around like  was dirt
don't care if Willie loses
just so he gets the truth to the people
Isn't that true, Willie
Willie is silent
Jack looks at him
Isn't it, Willie
Hmmm
Yeah, yeah, sure, that's right
Well, if you lose you can give a little more time to studying your law books
Oh, you studying law too
By myself, at night
Willie's a smart boy
If  ever find the time 'm going to take a course at the university
The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch
His clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody
He still carries some of the handbills
They rise to their feet and cluster around him
What happened, Tommy boy
What's the matter
(head down, muttering) gave out the handbills, Pa
Speak up
Speak up
Let him tell it his own way
Go on, Tommy
This time they were waiting for me
They took them away from me
Threw them in the dirt and beat me up brought some of them back
(pats him on the back) Good boy
Have you eaten yet, Tom
Let him wash up first
As Tom and Pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing through the front window, shattering the glass
Willie, his face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out onto the porch
Jack stands at the door, watching Willie shout into the darkness around him
'm going to run
and you're not going to stop me
'm gonna run even if  don't get a single vote
: Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, Day Jack's fingers type out a story, the last line of which reads "an honest man with courage
" He pulls the sheet out and hands it to Madison
Here you are

You've been writing these like you really mean them

It was separated from the mainland by a body of water
For the first time  wondered if it wasn't separated by more than that
: Exterior: Mrs
Burden's Home, Day As Jack arrives, Mrs
Burden and her husband, McEvoy, are seated at a lawn table near the boat landing
Hello, Mother
She runs forward to meet him
Floyd, Jack's home

You look beautiful, Mother

But first, let's have a drink
Can't that wait until this evening
She goes ahead and pours the drinks
Floyd

If that's all right with you

(reproachfully) Now, Jackie
here we all are
Floyd, Jackie, myself
(raises her glass for a toast) To the best time we've ever had together
Yes, Mother
They drink
Mrs
Burden gulps hers down avidly
Jack looks at her and then at McEvoy
Excuse me
He turns and walks back toward the shore
He boards a small motorboat and heads toward a house that can be seen across the water
: Exterior: Stanton Home (Burden's Landing), Day As the boat approaches the shore
Adam Stanton reaches down and pulls the boat up on land
He throws his arm around Jack, and the two climb the hill toward Judge Stanton, who stands waiting to greet him
Dr
Stanton,  presume
(laughing) Is my shingle showing
Good to see you, boy
Very good
Good to see you, Judge
How have you been
What have you been doing
They walk back together to the patio tables
Oh, just sitting here
waiting for all of you to come home
You know, when a man starts to get old his eyes stray and play funny tricks on him
As  watched you in that boat thought sure  saw a boy of twelve with a fishing rod in his hands
And was sure the first thing he'd say would be
Jack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path
He runs to meet her
As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge
Do you mind if  kiss your niece, sir
He kisses her, and they turn and walk away

Because my son's home
Thank you, Mother
Thank you very much
Monty, Anne and  have been discussing Jack's career
What do you think he ought to go in for
Shall he be a lawyer, doctor
Jack looks at Anne
We were just discussing whether you should
(to his mother) like what 'm doing, Mother
You do very well at it
read your articles about this fellow
Willie Stark
Very convincing
Too convincing for my tastes
lot of people like them
lot of people are fools
Articles like that shouldn't be permitted
They only tend to incite people
What are you afraid of
thought they were very good
was proud of you, Jack
was particularly interested in Stark's ideas on health and medicine
You know the conditions at the hospital  work in
They're intolerable
'd like to meet this Willie Stark
He sounds like an honest man
Honest man
This state is full of these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with price tags on them
The louder he yells the higher his price
You think you can buy anything, don't you
Yes, don't you
There is a silence
Then McEvoy turns to the Judge
What do you think, Judge
think this state could stand a few changes
(his face white) Well, 'll tell you what  think -- (quickly) Oh, please
let's not talk politics
Anne is right
absolutely forbid any more of it
know what we need, we need another toast
(to the Judge) You propose it, Monty
you're so good at it
The Judge picks up his glass and stands up
To the young people
to Anne, to Jack, to Adam
To what lies before them
To the world they'll make
in spite of the mistakes we've made
(rising) The mistakes you've made, not me
You're all still pretty high and mighty, aren't you
You all think this state needs a change
You don't like the way it's run
Well, who's going to run it
Willie Stark
The Judge
(to Jack) You
You can be bought too
As a matter of fact you have been
And with my money
Jack's answer is to throw his liquor in his stepfather's face
There is a pause
McEvoy wipes the liquor off with his handkerchief
(slowly) That's a waste of good liquor
(looks at Mrs
Burden) Your mother wouldn't approve
Jack turns and leaves the room
Jack
She hurries after him
Exterior: Veranda, Night As Mrs
Burden comes out after Jack
Anne stands in the doorway
Jack
you go back in and apologize
Apologize
'd rather die
've got to live with him
Well,  don't
Neither do you
You don't love him, Mother
You never did
Son, don't spoil anything now
He can help you
can get along without him
You need this house
And the parties
And the cars and the clothes and the lies
don't
It's the truth, Mother, face it
For once in your life, face it
Mrs
Burden appeals to Anne
Anne, please
please make him understand
Anne says nothing
Mrs
Burden goes back into the house
: Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night Anne and Jack sit alone in the room, beneath the portrait of the old Governor Stanton
Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon
It isn't real
It doesn't exist
It's me pretending  live on what  earn
It's my mother trying to keep herself young, and drinking herself old doing it
It's you and Adam living in this house as though your father were still alive
It's an old man like the Judge dreaming of the past
Anne, come away with me
And do what
(rises impatiently) And live in a shack and eat red beans
Anne, what do you want me to do
Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been sure
You've gone from one thing to the other
a year at law school, and now this job as a reporter
Are you afraid  can't make a living
Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that
don't care about the money
It
it's just that
want you to be something
What is it you want me to be
don't know
It's just that  want you to be
to do
something important
Jack looks up at the portrait of Governor Stanton
Like your father
All right
'll run for governor
(pause) Anne, 'm sorry
'm sorry  said that
All right, Jack
'll go away with you
'll do anything you want me to do
They kiss
Anne, 've wanted you to say that more than anything in the world, and now that you've said it
Anne, guess you were right

'm not sure  could live up to the

Please wait for me

As they start to go, a man spots Willie, goes over to him, and lifts Willie's arm in the air
Oh, Lord, 'm punished for voting against an honest man
This sudden action brings response; women begin to cry and people push their way forward to grab Willie by the hand
God bless you, Willie
If we had only listened to you, Willie
You were right, Willie
Let me shake your hand, Willie
We should have listened, Willie
You were right all the time
On Willie's face is the realization that something important has happened to him

The question 'd like to know is, why all the speeches you're making around the countryside
Willie is about to answer when he hears the sound of approaching cars
Wonder who that is
He goes to the window, and we see a big black limousine turning into his drive
He opens the door and waits as Sadie, Duffy, Dolph Pillsbury, and other politicians climb the steps to meet him
Brought some people all the way up from the state capital just to meet you

No
No, brother, you don't

Why don't you give me a cigarette
(gives her the pack) To split the vote and win the election for Harrison, huh
If you know, why do you ask
just want to make sure
Yeah
Look, why don't you tell the boys back home to save their money
Willie couldn't steal a vote from
from Abe Lincoln in the Cradle of the Confederacy
wish the poor
had enough sense to have somebody give him a good greasing for the beating he's going to get
'Cause this way all he gets out of it is the ride

Stir 'em up and they'll love it and come back for more
But for heaven's sake don't try and improve their minds

Don't try and fool me
'm not going to lie to you

Better than those other fellows

That you've been framed, you poor sap
Willie looks at her steadily for a moment
(quietly) Framed
And how
Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead decoy
And you let 'em
You let 'em because you thought you were the little lamb of God
But you know what you are
(she waits for his answer; he has none) Well, you're the goat
You are the sacrificial goat
You are a sap
because you let 'em
Sadie
That's enough
Enough
He didn't even get anything out of it
Oh, they'd have paid you to take a rap like that, but they didn't have to pay a sap like you
Oh, no, you were so full of yourself and hot air, all you wanted was a chance to stand up on your hind legs and make a speech: my friends, what this state needs is a good five-cent cigar
What this state needs is a -- (to Jack) Is it true
(prayerfully, to the ceiling) He wants to know if it's true
Is it true
That's what they tell me
There is a long pause
Willie looks almost as if he is going to cry
Sadie pours out another drink, a stiff one
(handing it to him) Here
Willie drinks it all
Hey, lay off that
You're not used to it
(jeeringly) He's not used to a lot of things
Are you, Willie
(angrily) Why don't you lay off of him, Sadie
(ignores Jack) Are you, Willie
Are you
Are you
are you, are you, are you
She shoves the bottle at him
He takes it and pours himself a drink

She is in the bathroom, applying lipstick
Jack enters
Hi
Well, things seem to have quieted down
(laughs) Yeah,  quieted him down
Yeah
How was he
Noisy
Oh, he reared some
He's been telling me all the things he's going to do
He's going to do big things, this fella
He's going to be President
He's going to kill people with his bare hands
quieted him down
Hey

His wife
He talks like she's his mammy
she's going to blow his nose for him
Jack sits on the bed next to Willie
Well, 'll take him from here on in
They're waiting for him at the barbecue
Sadie pulls her coat off Willie and goes to the door
Yeah, well give me a receipt for the body and 'll be on my way
She leaves

Hey, Willie, Willie
come on, wake up, Willie
Come on, Willie

Exterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the platform, waiting for Willie
band plays march music
Duffy goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the platform
Where is he
(pointing) There he is
Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles up the steps past Sadie
Whoops
(to Jack) Is he drunk
Never touches the stuff
Lucy doesn't favor drinkin'
Duffy follows Willie up on the platform
(to Jack) How'd you get him here
He was out stiff
Hair of the dog that bit him
Hair
He must have swallowed the dog
On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed Willie
The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman steps up to the microphone
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce to you that true man of the people, the next governor of the state
Willie Stark
There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak
My friends
He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech
My friends
He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before his eyes with both hands
Then he lifts his head, and looks directly at the people who have come to hear him
As he speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, Willie's people
have a speech here
It's a speech about what this state needs
There's no need in my telling you what this state needs
You are the state and you know what you need
You over there
look at your pants
Have they got holes in the knees
Listen to your stomach
Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger
And you, what about your crops
Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market
And you
What about your kids
Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them
No, 'm not going to read you any speech
He throws his speech away
Duffy looks alarmed
But  am going to tell you a story
It's a funny story
(from the steps) Hey
' So get ready to laugh
What's he up to
Shut up
Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story
It's about a hick
a hick like you, if you please
Yeah, like you
He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm
He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast
and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse
Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right
He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself
So he sat up nights and studied books
He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some
for himself, and for folks like him
Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech
No, 'm not going to lie to you
He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them
No
No, he started off thinking of number one
But something came to him on the way
How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people
That's what came to him
And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics
rotten brick
It killed and mangled a dozen kids
But you know that story
The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick
And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that
So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor
Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm
Sadie, he's wonderful
wonderful
Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury
So they told the hick
and he swallowed it
He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things
He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job
Well, those fellows in the striped pants
they saw the hick and they took him in
He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him
(low voice) Willie, what are you trying to do
Willie turns on him, roaring
There he is
There's your Judas Iscariot
(he pushes Duffy across the platform) Look at him
lickspittle
nose- wiper
Duffy gestures frantically to the band
Play
Play
(pushing him again) Look at him
Play anything
The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium
Willie shouts above it
Look at him
Joe Harrison's dummy
Look at him
That's a lie
Look at him
Duffy signals to some of his goons standing near the platform
Go get him, boys
go get him
Sugar Boy leaps up on the platform, his pistol drawn and pointed at Duffy's men
Willie throws up his arms to silence the crowd
Now, shut up
Shut up, all of you
Now, listen to me, you hicks
Yeah, you're hicks too, and they fooled you a thousand times, just like they fooled me
But this time 'm going to fool somebody
'm going to stay in this race
'm on my own and 'm out for blood
The camera moves in close on Willie's face
Listen to me, you hicks

And this is the truth

Loud cheers and yells
All right, listen to me
listen to me
was the hick they were going to use to split the hick vote
But 'm standing right here now on my hind legs
even a dog can learn to do that
Are you standing on your hind legs
Have you learned to do that much yet
Here it is, here it is, you hicks
Nail up anybody who stands in your way
Nail up Joe Harrison
Nail up McMurphy

What have we got on Hopkins, Jack
(as Jack riffles through the black book) Hello, Jeff
About that Pillsbury business
(reads from black book Jack holds out for him) Here's what  want you to do when it comes up in the legislature
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute
You listen to me
(still reading from book) You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you
You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you
(pause) All right, Tiny'll talk to you in the morning
He grins and hangs up the phone
Get going, Tiny
Duffy leaves
You haven't answered my question
Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide
'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury's hide
It's something much more important than that
If the McMurphy boys get the notion they can get away with this, there's no telling where they'll stop
(quietly) Or where you will
Pillsbury is guilty
As attorney general of this state, it's my job to prosecute
Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was
was human
He isn't
He's a thing
You don't prosecute an adding machine if the spring goes busted and makes a mistake
You fix it
Well,  fixed him
'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury
It's something much bigger than that
(getting up) Yes, it is
He's right, Judge
Can't you see that he's right
He's right because you want him to be right
Because you're afraid to admit you've made a mistake
Do it now before it's too late
(to Willie) 'm offering my resignation as attorney general
You'll have it in writing by messenger in the morning
dated
(softly) It took you a long time to make up your mind, Judge
long time
What made you take such a long time
wasn't sure
And now you are
The Judge nods
'll tell you what you are
You're scared
You sat in that big easy chair of yours for thirty years and played at being a judge
Then all of a sudden  came along and put a bat in your hand, and  said, go ahead, Judge, start swinging
And you did
And you had a wonderful time
But now you're scared
You don't want to get your hands dirty
You want to pick up the marbles
but you don't want to get your hands dirty
Look at my whole program, Judge
How do you think  put that across
knew how, but  never knew why
He starts to leave
You're not by any chance thinking of going over to McMurphy's boys, are you
'm through with politics
'm happy to hear that
(extends his hand) No hard feelings
(ignores the hand) Goodbye, Governor
(to Jack) Are you coming with me, Jack
Jack turns away
You're making a mistake
He goes
Willie closes the door behind him
Do you think he means it when he says he's through with politics, Sadie
No
No,  don't
What about you, Jack
've known the Judge all my life
He's always meant everything he's said
All right
All right
Take it easy
'll take your word for it
: Exterior: Willie's Hotel, Night Willie's car draws up to the curb
Sugar Boy hops out to open the door for Willie
Sadie is watching him from a window upstairs in the hotel
Anne is in the back seat; Willie leans down to talk to her
Sugar, take Miss Stanton home
(to Anne) When am  going to see you again
She doesn't answer
What's the matter, Anne
Please take me home now, Sugar Boy
You've got to understand me
(turns away) understand you
It's myself  don't understand
Do you think  like sneaking around corners any more than you do
But right now, with the Pillsbury business and with your uncle quitting
If got a divorce
Maybe we'd better stop seeing each other
No
No, we won't stop seeing each other, will we
(slowly) No
Because you believe in what  tell you
(puts her hand on his) Because  believe what you tell me
Sadie approaches
Good evening, Governor Stark
(looks at Anne, but talks to Willie) thought you might like to know that Judge Stanton kept his promise
(directly to Willie) He gave the story to every paper in town
Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon as you can
: : Interior: State Legislature Assembly Room, Day Duffy stands in the forground, looking in on the uproar and confusion of the assembly
These are serious charges that Judge Stanton has given to the press
This legislature is entitled to a complete and full report on the Pillsbury affair
Let the truth be known
2ND Let it come out
3RD move that we adjourn
4TH second the motion
All those in favor, say aye
Motion carried
The house is adjourned
As Duffy turns and walks away, other senators rise up in their seats in protest
: : Sign on building reads:   , Subject: , 8
Tonight -- Town Hall
man pastes a strip across the sign:
man is making a speech to a small group of people
If you let Willie Stark get away with the Pillsbury graft, there's no telling
Thugs break up the meeting
The speaker is beaten up
Jack Burden turns through the pages of the little black book
: Interior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Day Willie is lying on the bed
Jack is seated
Sadie and Sugar Boy stand nearby
But we beat the Pillsbury rap
It's over
These things are never over
'll tell you what  want you to do, Jack
want you to start a new page in that black book of yours
under then name of Judge Stanton
You're crazy
There's nothing on the Judge
Why
Because his name is Stanton
Ssshhh, easy
What if  won't do it
You know, some of this has rubbed off on you
What are you going to do
Have me shot
No
no
but 'll have to get myself a new boy
tell you there's nothing on the Judge
Jack, there's something on everybody
Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption
It's a waste of time
What's the matter, Jack
Are you afraid you might find something out
Jack stares at him
: Exterior: Burden's Landing Ferry, Night Jack's car is seen coming across on the ferry
(voice over) kept saying to myself that Willie was wrong about the Judge
If there was anything left at Burden's Landing, it was honor
had to believe that
: Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night Jack and Anne stand together in the living room
Anne,  want to ask you a question
Was the Judge ever broke
Really broke
Why do you want to know
don't want to know, but 've got to
Did he tell you -- Did who tell me
don't know
how should  know if the Judge was ever broke
She walks away from him
Adam enters, carrying bundles of food and two wine bottles
Hello
Come on, Anne, take this food and start cooking
'm hungry
Anne takes the grocery bundles
Jack grabs the wine
Me, 'm on the thirsty side
Bring some glasses, Anne, quick
He joins Adam, who has opened the piano
(laughing) It's been a long time since  played this thing
What do you say we wake up the ghosts, huh
(calling to Anne) Another glass, Anne, for a ghost
(starting to play) Remember the last time  played this
You and Anne were dancing
Anne returns with three glasses
Jack grabs her around the waist and whirls her around
Shall we dance
Let's
let's have a drink first
Adam starts to pour the wine
No, no
keep playing
Anne and want to hear this, don't we, Anne
(Jack pours the wine) Adam
ghost
and me
What shall we drink to
To the ghost
To Adam, to the director of the new medical center
(bangs the piano keys) Don't you ever stop working for him
Adam
came up here to get away
'm sorry, Adam
Well, 'm not
What's wrong with being the director of the new medical center
Nothing, except that 'm not going to take it
Why
Because your uncle resigned
That's partly it
There are other things
What other things
(looks at her) You too
Yes, me too
Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss it, let's not
All right, let's discuss it
But calmly
Calmly
Go ahead, Jack
Why do you think he wants me
Because you're the best man for the job
It could have nothing to do with my name being Stanton
It could have
Let's grant that
That's your answer
No, it's not
If that were the only answer  wouldn't be with him any more
There's another side of it
've learned something from him
You can't make an omelet without cracking eggs
Or heads
But at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for
At what price
At any price
Do you really believe that, Jack
really believe that Stark wants to do good
You do too
It's a matter of method
Many times out of evil comes good
Well, pain is an evil
As a doctor you should know that
Pain is an evil; it is not evil
It is not evil in itself
Stark is evil
The people of the state don't think so
How would they know
The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations
Why be so afraid of criticism
If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth don't see how you can separate the two
No, Stark is not for me
(upset) No, Stark is not for you
Well, what is for you
Pride
Pride, that's all it is
foolish, stupid pride
All you've ever talked about is what you could do if
if somebody would tear down and build
All right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you
But he's not for you
No, he's not for you
She throws down her glass and runs crying from the room
Adam goes after her
Anne

Interior: Stanton Hallway and Stairs, Night Anne runs upstairs and Adam follows
The Judge comes out of his room to see what has happened, sees Jack standing at the foot of the stairs, hesitates a moment, and then goes back to his room without speaking
: Interior: County Recorder Room, Day Jack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to one of the files
He starts to look through the files marked (voice over) Will  find anything, Judge
Will
didn't find it all at once
It takes a long time to go through old courthouse records and musty deeds
a very long time
But it wasn't too hard for me
was well trained in research, especially this kind
He pulls out a file
(voice over) found what  didn't want to find
He takes the file back to the clerk
Have some photostat copies made of these
'll be back tomorrow for them
: Interior: Jack's Hotel Bedroom, Day Jack is lying on his bed, looking over the documents that relate to the Judge
He looks haggard and worried
There is a knock on the door
Jack doesn't answer; the knock is repeated
Who is it
' It's me, Sadie Burke
Wait a minute
He hides the documents under his pillow
All right, come in
She comes in, sniffs the air
Phew
Awful lot of smoke
Awful lot of whisky
You sober
Stone
'll have one with you
(starts tidying up the room) What are you hiding out for
'm not
've been sleeping
For four days
You've been back in town for four days
Willie knows everything
Willie's worried about his boy
Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy
Well, why don't you put something on the phonograph -- a low-down, mean blues
Play it over and over again until you're sick of it
Then crack it and go back to work
(sits down) do it all the time
That's not my problem
No, it isn't your problem
(gets up again) 'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose
Jack goes into the bathroom
'll be with you in a minute
Sadie wanders around
She goes to the dresser, upon which is a photograph of Anne Stanton
She picks up the picture and places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it with her own reflection
Hmmm
Yeah,  can see it
've got to look in the mirror to be able to see it
Soft, white skin
not like mine
(runs her hand across her cheeks) had smallpox when  was a kid
Where  lived it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox
Jack watches her through the open bathroom door
It leaves your face hard
Then she's got poise
Look at the way she holds her head
at just the right angle
That takes training
That takes years of training
Jack, towel in hand, comes out and stands behind her
He looks at her in the mirror, puzzled
see what Willie sees
Willie's got big ideas, Jack
What do you mean
girl like that could be a governor's wife
Or even a President's
What are you talking about
He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and he'll ditch you
(shaking her) Answer me
He'll ditch everybody in the whole world because that's what Willie wants
Nobody in the world but him
What are you talking about
You and your high-tone friends
What do they know
What do they know about anything
Why did you have to mix her in
You're crazy, Sadie
You're out of your mind
Am
Well, why don't you go down and ask her
Or ask him
Ask Willie
Shut up
Go ahead, ask him
Shut up
Ask him
He slaps her hard
Ow-oo
oh
oh
She starts to laugh
: Exterior: Football Field, Day football team is practicing on the field
Willie watches from the bench
player kicks the ball and Tom misses it
Jack walks over to Willie
He's off today
It's only practice
He'll be all right tomorrow
You been gone a long time, Jack
Yeah
figured if you needed me you'd yell
Why'd you lay around the hotel
Thinking
About what
Things
What did you find on the Judge
Nothing
You sure you didn't find anything on the Judge
Yeah, 'm sure
You're going to keep trying, aren't you
If you want me to
want you to
There's something else  want you to do too
What
Bucket boy
Towel slinger
What
(looks at him closely) What's eating you, Jack
(avoiding it) What else do you want me to do
If you've got something on your mind, boy, spit it out
We've been together too long to play games
What do you want me to do
hear your pal Adam Stanton turned down the job as director of the hospital
That's bad
Especially at a time like this
Oh
How did you hear it
Why
What difference does it make
just wanted to know
heard it around
(insistent) How did you hear he turned it down, Willie
Out on the field the boys have stopped playing and are huddled around the coach
'll be right back, Jack
want to see what's happening here
He goes over to the group on the field
The coach is talking to Tom
You going to practice the way  tell you
'm going to do it the way  want to do it
Willie comes up to them
Tom, come here
What's going on here
don't care if he is your son, Governor
No special rules for him
It doesn't make any difference to me either way
whether  play or not
Well, it does to me
(to coach) What do you want him to do
To behave himself
Like the rest of the boys
Four times this season he's broken training
He comes on the practice field half potted
Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules
Do you hear me
You're going to obey the rules
put 'em across, don't
Every Saturday  put 'em across and  can still do it, drunk or sober
That's all you want, isn't it
for me to put 'em across so you can big-shot it around
Isn't that all you want
He walks away
Tom
(to coach) He's a little high-strung
(goes after Tom) Tom, come here
Tom

let's go faster
Come on
The car goes across a bridge, weaving
Two motorcycle cops parked there start to give chase
Tom's car swerves out of control and crashes through a fence
The two motorcycle cops ride out to the field to the wrecked car
They find Tom and Helene, unconscious
One of the cops picks up the empty bottle and hands it to the other

He is obviously drunk
Go on upstairs, Lucy

Hale
What 've got to say anybody can listen to
Where's your boy
Now

My daughter may die
She's not going to die
She'll get the best medical attention there is
No expense will be spared
Where's your boy
'll get him
Wait a minute, Lucy
He's asleep
And the doctor said after a good night's sleep he'll be all right
No, he won't be all right unless you make him all right
'll get him
She goes
Lucy
(to Hale) You care for a drink
No thanks
Accidents will happen, you know
Accidents
Your boy was drunk
saw the police report
There
there was nothing about drunkenness on the police report
Whose police and whose report
say the boy was drunk
And  know it
Tom comes down the stairs, with Lucy
(to Tom) Right here before your father want you -- Mr
Hale -- Tom, the doctor says you need rest, boy
(turns on him) don't want you to try to cover up for me
was wrong
that's all there is to it
You don't know what you're talking about
saw the police report -- don't care what the police report says
was driving and  was drunk
It's all my fault
(to Hale) Anything you want to do to me, you can do
Whatever you want me to do, 'll do
Nobody has to do anything
Stop worrying
'll take care of everything
don't want you to take care of anything
Tom looks ill; he presses his hand to his forehead
Tom, go on upstairs and get some rest, boy
Go on
go on
go on
Tom walks slowly toward the stairs
Sugar, help him
Mr
Hale, come on over and sit down
You sure you wouldn't care for a drink, Mr
Hale
Hale sits down, shakes his head
Hey, Tiny, go home
Go on, out of here

Go on
Duffy leaves, disgruntled
Willie sits on a coffee table
He pours himself another drink
What business did you say you were in
didn't say
What business are you in
Trucking business
Trucking business
Trucks run on state roads
If a man in the trucking business had a contract with the state, a big one, that would be pretty good, wouldn't it
(to Jack) Go on, Jack
Tell him what would happen
Jack is silent
Go on, tell him
You're trying to bribe me, aren't you
No, no
No, 'm not trying to bribe you
'm
'm only talking things over with you, that's all
You're pretty good at talking remember when you first started talking
place called Upton
You did a lot of talking then and the things you said made sense, to me and a lot of other people
believed in you
followed you
and fought for you
Well, the words are still good
But you're not

This whole thing is a mess of lies
It's a frame
The man that made that statement

He can't
He vanished
Let me ask you some questions
Where has he gone
Where is he
Maybe you could answer those questions too, Governor
Sugar Boy makes a move for the reporter but Willie holds him back
won't dignify that question with an answer

It wasn't me that got drunk
But me, 'm takin' the rap
(softer, to Tom) Go on, kid
Get out there and play
Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark is made of

a specialist sent for one
How bad is it really, doctor
He's unconscious
and paralyzed
Lucy slumps in her chair
Has he got a chance
To live
Yes
What do you mean
Even if the operation's successful -- that is, if he lives --  think he'll be paralyzed for life
You'll do everything you can, won't you
Anything between you and me
that won't count, will it
It doesn't have to

Adam
Well, you don't have to worry about him
If Adam finds out it'll be easy to prove a Stanton is no different than anybody else

Even Judge Stanton
Show them to him, Anne

And get some votes
Oh, there are lots of ways to get votes
Yes,  know
won't stand for any interference
won't interfere
may fire you, but  won't interfere

Willie stops for a moment
Oh, there's one thing in there didn't like too well
That messiah or dictator
That's our point of view, Governor
And that's the way it stands
There is a silence
Willie's face is hard
Then he grins
All right, all right, that's the way it stands
as of now
: - : :  , Tom and Pappy Stark are seated on the porch
Tom is in a wheelchair
Lucy comes onto the porch as the sound of sirens is heard, and Willie's two cars, motorcycle escort, and the car of reporters turn onto the drive
Tom, upset, flips his cigarette away as the cars stop in front of the porch
Lucy puts her hand on his shoulder to calm him
Then Willie climbs up the steps to greet Lucy
Hello, Lucy
How are you making it, Pa
How are you, Tom
Tom doesn't answer
Lucy offers her cheek to Willie
Sadie, Jack, and Sugar Boy wait at the bottom of the steps, along with the reporters

Pappy laughs delightedly
He reaches out to turn the dial
All right, go ahead, go ahead
' We interrupt this program to bring you a special announcement
This afternoon, the body of Richard Hale, father of the girl who died in the automobile accident involving the governor's son, was found
medical examination revealed he was beaten to death
Tom starts to wheel toward Willie, but Lucy restrains him
' The ugly charge of "official murder" has been hurled at the administration by a coalition of Stark's opponents, led by Judge Stanton, lately an outspoken critic of the administration
(to Jack) Your friend, the Judge
' Thus an almost forgotten incident provided the spark that might set off the explosion needed to rock Willie Stark out of power
The latest report is that impeachment proceedings may be instituted
Willie turns off the radio
There is a silence
Then Willie turns to Lucy
How long will it take you to pack want you to go back to Capital City with me tonight
Why
Because  need you
What for
(still speaking to Lucy) 'll explain all of that later
Now, Lucy, do like  say
'll wait outside
You stay right here, Jack
want you bear witness to what 've got to say
(indicating Sadie) She can be a witness too
(starting toward the door) 'm going back to the capital and get hold of Duffy
You stay right here, Sadie
Somebody's got to go back to the capital
'll go in the other car
All right, then tell Duffy not to do anything or say anything until  get there
Yes, Governor
She leaves
Now he needs us
Now that he's in trouble he needs us, so he can lead us around like monkeys with rings in our noses
So he can say to people, look at me, feel sorry for me
just a family man with a wife and a crippled son
(shouts) Shut up
Willie
Why don't you leave us alone
Tom wheels himself into his own room
Lucy starts to follow
Leave him alone
How many scrapes have  gotten him out of
How many girls
Willie, stop
It's not him they're after
It's me
How many halfwitted apes do you think 'm going to have to pay to square this one
What do you think this is going to cost me
What do you think it cost him
Suddenly Willie turns his face away

That's all he builds for

Give me a drink, Jack
Jack hands him a bottle and he takes a slug

Who do you mean
You know who 'm talking about

If and when you need it
If and when

He's got four senators wrapped up in his hip pocket
Come on, come on, boy

If he can prove it isn't true,  won't spill it
ought to bust you, Jack
promised two people 'd do it this way
Who are they
Myself
and someone else
It doesn't matter who
'm going to give him a break
All right, give him a break
But if you got the facts, you got the facts
The truth is sufficient
just like it says in the Bible
That's the way it's going to be
All right, boy
'll trust you
Where are you going
(on his way out) 'll be around
Willie turns to go into his private office
Who else do you think he promised, Willie
Willie shrugs
You'd be smart

You're going to need people like us around

Willie, with Lucy and Tom seated behind him, addressing crowd
Willie speaking from the back of a train to a railroad station audience
(voice over) The chips were down, and Willie knew it
He was fighting for his life
He roared across the state making one speech after another
And all of them added up to the same thing
"It's not me they're after, it's you
" Close-ups of Willie, speaking to the people
(voice over) Willie hollered foul
Willie knew if you hollered long enough, hard enough, and loud enough, people begin to believe you
Just in case they didn't, he organized spontaneous demonstrations

Turn 'em out
Turn the yokels out
More men with    signs

Boy, 'll live to be President
Jack and Sugar wait in the car as Willie leans out the car window to talk to a senator
He offers the man a piece of paper

: Interior: Judge Stanton's Study, Night Jack and the Judge are seated opposite each other
Judge,  beg you, as a favor to yourself, to me
call up, release your votes
made a mistake once, Jack
when resigned
It was too easy then, just resigning, pulling out
No, Jack, 've made my choice
have nothing more to lose
Judge, you know what Stark is capable of
Think it over
'll leave now
'll come back tomorrow and we'll talk about it again
You can give me your answer then
The door opens and Willie and Sugar Boy enter
can't wait until tomorrow
'm a very impatient man
(rising) told you not to come in here
(ignoring him) Is it true, Judge, that you're behind the impeachment proceedings
Yes, it's true
Willie takes a seat in an easy chair
wanted to hear you say it with your own silver tongue
Well, you've heard it
If that's all you came to hear you could have saved yourself a trip
Willie picks up a decanter off the table
Mind if  pour myself a drink
How about you, Judge, will you have one
You better
You're going to need it
Jack and Judge Stanton remain standing, silently watching Willie
What'd he say, Jack
You'll get your answer tomorrow
Are you kidding
Did you show it to him, or didn't you
Show me what
That's what  figured
Let's get down to cases, Judge
Do you remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh
The Judge shakes his head
He doesn't
Remember the Fortune Electric Company
Of course
was their counsel for over ten years
Remember how you got the job
How did you find out
(hands the Judge some papers) Do you remember how you got the job
The Judge examines the papers
You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing
Some of it rubs off on everybody
How did you get the job, Judge
Blackmail
(to Jack) swear  never even remembered his name
Isn't that remarkable, Jack never even remembered his name
It's all so long ago it's hard for me to realize it ever happened
Yeah
But it did
Yes, it did
But it's difficult for me to realize it
For me too, Judge
Thanks for that much
Well,  guess you know what the next move is, don't you
Yes,  do
Jack Burden
Willie Stark's hatchet man
(to Willie) asked you
how did you find out
This would never stand at law, not for a minute
It happened over twenty- five years ago, and you could never get any testimony
Everybody is dead
Everybody except you, Judge
You're alive
And people think you're a certain kind of man
And you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise
Ever since then
've done my duty
'm responsible for many good things
(looks at the papers again) But  also did this
Yes, yes, you did
Judge,  beg of you, call and release your votes, for your sake
You have tender sensibilities for a hatchet man
(goes to the door) Good night, gentlemen
How about my answer
You'll have it in the morning
want it tonight
In the morning
Good night, gentlemen
There is silence
Then the three men get up to go
The Judge closes the door behind them

How did you find out
We've got a lot to do
It's getting late, Jack
Let's get back to town
You know we're through, don't you
Aw, you don't mean that, boy
The front door opens, and Adam and Anne come in
What are you doing here
It's all right, doc
Just here to discuss some politics with the Judge
Oh,  see
(starts upstairs) Well, good night
Good night
(to Anne) Did you give him -- Wait a minute, Jack -- Answer me
Did you give -- shot is fired
They turn and rush into the Judge's study
They find the Judge face downward in his leather chair
Adam and Jack kneel beside him
Willie, holding on tightly to Anne's arm, stands in the doorway
Jack picks up the Judge's pistol and looks at Adam
: Exterior: Stanton Home, Night Jack comes out of the house, followed by Anne and Adam
Aren't you going back with him
No
Why not
You belong with him
Jack, how could you have done it
When Anne brought me those papers she told me you promised not to tell Stark until
Yeah

(walks away) Well,  kept my promise
Adam looks unbelievingly at Anne
She looks away
Anne

portable radio is blaring out the news
' From all over the state they're streaming in
From the hill country and farms, the lumber camps
by boat, by train, by horse, and on foot
Willie Stark's army
Through Jack's window we see the street blocked with cars and people, all headed for the State Capitol Building
Anne is in the crowd, trying to get across the street
Seeing Jack in the window, she pushes her way across and enters the hotel
He slams the window shut and comes back into the room
' The state capital is filled with rumors, one of which is that Stark is planning to seize power by force
As commander of the state militia, he has -- Jack turns it off
He goes over to his bed and starts putting clothes into a valise
There is a knock on the door
He ignores it
Another knock
Come in
The door's open
Anne enters
Jack
What do you want
She starts to cry
He grabs her, pulling her face close to his
(bitterly) No,  want to see you cry
He lets her go and she falls to the bed, sobbing
Stop it
called you
All afternoon 've been calling you
know
was here
You've got to tell Adam
You've got to see him
Tell him what
He knows about me and
About you and Willie
(nods) tried to explain to him tried to explain to him that it wasn't the way he thought it was
How was it, Anne
You tell me
He hit me, Jack
My own brother
he hit me
Your brother is an old-fashioned man
He believes in his sister's honor
Me, 'm a modern man
(slams clothes into the valise) The twentieth-century type
run
(rises) 'm frightened, Jack
For who
Your brother, or Willie
(quietly) We're through
Who's through with who
He called me this afternoon
He's going back to Lucy
He said it was better that way
Better for who
Him
Both of us
Did he tell you that too when he asked you to betray the Judge
At least  walked out on him
Oh Jack
help me, please, please
Adam's all 've got left now
Oh, Jack, if you ever loved me
If  ever loved you
(pause) 'll go find Adam
He takes up his coat

It reads --    -- -- Adam enters, looks at the sign, and walks on
Exterior: Street Near Capitol Building, Day Crowds of people headed toward the building, some with signs
marching band plays music for them
Exterior: Capitol Building, Day Crowd waiting outside the building
Mounted policemen keep them in line
From a large platform, loaded with people, comes the chant "We want Willie, we want Willie
" Jack pushes his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing guard on the Capitol steps
Where do you think you're going
(recognizes Jack) Oh, 'm sorry
didn't recognize you
Do you know who Dr
Stanton is
Yes sir
Did he try to come through here today
Haven't seen him, sir
Well, can you check the other entrances
2ND There's no other entrances today
The other entrances are blocked off
Orders are to take no chances
If you care to come inside and wait, Mr
Burden, we can find you a seat
No, thanks
'll wait out here
If Dr
Stanton shows up, let me know
Pass the word along to the boys, will you
Yes sir
Jack turns and looks at the large crowd
voice from a public address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd
All right now
Everybody
that means everybody
let's let Willie know we're here
All together: The chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd
Interior: State Legislature, Day The speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the chanting
We will first proceed to take the judgment of the senate on the question of the impeachment of the governor
(rising) Mr
Speaker, this is a farce to ask us to vote in the face of the kind of intimidation and pressure that has been exerted here in the past few weeks
Even that crowd outside, yelling on cue, is part of that pressure
We want Willie
We want Willie
Willie gets up, and goes to the window
Exterior: State Capitol, Day The crowd, with Jack in the foreground
The crowd suddenly goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window
In the growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises his hands to wave to the crowd
We see various shots of people straining to get a little closer to the steps in order to see him better
Willie then turns and goes back into the room
: Exterior: State Capitol, Day The crowd again, still waiting
The camera pans upward to a loudspeaker
Attention, please
Attention, please
This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out there
He doesn't want any one of you to leave
The camera moves over the faces of the people listening
He wants you to stay in front of this state Capitol until the fight is over
If you want Willie Stark to win, stay where you are
They cheer
Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol Building
It reads  '        -- Do you hear me
stay where you are
Don't go away
Stay where you are
Don't go away
: Exterior: State Capitol, Night Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored
The crowd, every bit as large, is quiet but expectant
Everyone holds still as the announcer's voice is heard again
Attention, please
Attention, please
The balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just ended
This is the result: Willie Stark has won
The crowd explodes
People break through the police barriers
Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot
Camera picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through
Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all
Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by Sugar Boy
Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind
Willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd
They tried to ruin me
But they are ruined
They tried to ruin me because they did not like what  have done
Do you like what  have done
Loud applause, and cries of "yes
" Remember, it's not  who have won, but you
Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and shall live in your right and your will
And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, 'll break him
'll break him with my bare hands
For  have the strength of many
Having finished, he waves at them all
Then he notices Jack and comes down the steps to greet him
Hello, Jack boy, 'm glad you're here
knew you'd come back
He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders
They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees someone
He smiles and puts out his hand
Oh, doctor, 'm very glad to see you
Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building
Before Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him
Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol and fires at Adam
Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into Adam's already fallen body
Then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, forcing them back
Stand back, everybody
Stand back
Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie
Sadie stands against a pillar, looking down on him
(nearly crying) -does it hurt m-much, boss
-d- does it hurt much
Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to Adam
She looks at Adam for a moment, then turns away
Anne, Anne
Where are you going
She doesn't answer, only walks away
He runs after her and catches hold of her arm
don't know
Leave me alone
To do what
don't care
No, that's too easy
don't know,  don't know,  don't know
do
Leave me alone, please
No, no more
He's dead
We're alive
My brother's dead
We've got to go on living
How
So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted
Anne, our life has to give his death meaning
Don't you see that
Look at those people
He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at Willie
Look at them
They still believe in him
And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything
anything
policeman approaches
Mr
Burden
the governor's asking for you
You better hurry
He's going fast
(to Anne) Will you wait here
No reply
Will you wait here
She nods her head slowly
Jack walks through the building to the pillar against which Willie has been propped
Sugar Boy is still beside him
He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking down at Willie
It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark
The whole world
Willie Stark
Why did he do it to me
Willie Stark
Why
His head droops to the side and he dies
