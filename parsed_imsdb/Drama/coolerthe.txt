Written by Frank Hannah & Wayne Kramer - The suggestion of traveling through space
Suddenly a star sparkles to life in the distance
Gives rise to another
and another
until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars
No, not stars
throbbing skyline of neon
,
As seen from a descending aerial shot
We  down into her shimmering embrace : - Cruising the Strip, taking in modern day Las Vegas
Sin City gone theme park
Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: passing revamped faithfuls like  and
then heading  to Fremont Street, where "old school" Vegas makes its last stand
' , ,     arid
- One thing's for sure
This place ain't no bastard child of Epcott Center
At least, not yet
Sure there's some flash going on, but it's more class than overkill
This is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten joint where every dealer knows your name
Where part of the allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper of worn felt
Where "funny business" doesn't just get you blacklisted
It gets you dead
Lets us enter
-    - through the casino floor; highlighting - and pockets of rowdy players winning at , and
It's just one of those nights
The tables are on fire
nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter at a craps table: He checks out his watch, anxious for the arrival of
- From behind a  in a suit
All we see is a murky reflection in gold elevator doors
The floor numbers descending rapidly
- , , all anticipating the arrival of
- The elevator doors open
and we   to the figure's feet
He steps out onto the casino floor
and right away we notice he has a pronounced limp
Following behind the figure
We haven't seen his features yet
(and won't for a while
) -- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a  , the wheel already in mid-spin
His hand casually brushes the side of the table
and we   to the wheel -- just in time to see the ball landing on 00
The players defeat
The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a slight nod of respect to the passing wraith
--
from the passing figure (still in soft focus) to a  calling out: Insurance
At the next table,   pulls a six card 21
Off the players' stunned reactions
No way
One of the players instinctively glances behind him
but the figure has moved on
The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure as he heads toward
--
The   as the shooter lands a hard eight
The dice are fished back to the player
He shakes them up with double ought bravado
We  from his hand  in the f
g
to our murky figure passing in the background
The player throws
(we keep tracking with the figure) as the stickman calls it:
to a thundering chorus of disappointment
-- Our figure passes by in the foreground, while in the background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the -- Following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor of
from the far end of the corridor
As the murky figure approaches, a player in the f
g
hits a jackpot
Another player in mid-ground is also in the midst of a payout
Suddenly -- with the approach of the figure -- both payouts trickle to a stop
(kicks the slot machine) Don't you hold back, baby
Spit it out, darlin'
'mon
Hey
Hey, this ain't right
'posed to be eight hundred dollars
Where's the goddamn manager
Who's in charge of these rip-off slots
Yo, ma'am
change lady
-   - the figure as he turns out of the slot corridor and heads over to the bar
He pours himself a cup of coffee
/ Hey Doris, you got any cream
wanders over with a small container
She starts to pour
Empty
We quickly   to reveal 's features for the first time
His sad sack eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container
Forget it
He's just about to leave, when an attractive cruises up
-- late 20's-mid-30's
Everything about her sparkles, except her eyes
They're post-mortem
She appears frazzled
Sifts through some coin tips
(sotto) Shit
(to Doris) Dewars and a Diet Coke
Please
sheepish look comes over Bernie
He tries to catch her eye
She doesn't even glance at him
Hi, Natalie
She looks at him
Only the faintest hint of recognition
Hi
Uh
Bernie
Yeah, Bernie
(to Doris) Hey, you seen Shelly around
He promised to position me at the tables tonight
've been on skid row all week
(chilly) You didn't settle me from last night
No
You sure
Fuck
And  was way under
It's been, like, an
convention the whole week
'll make up for it tonight
Promise
Doris mutters something under her breath -- heard that one before -- and dumps Natalie's drinks on her tray
If  see Shelly, 'll let him know
That you're looking for him
Natalie grabs up her tray
Doesn't even look at Bernie
Thanks
She takes off
Bitch
That's the third time this month
(to Bernie) Let me get you that cream
(staring after Natalie) Nah, it's okay
Don't get sweet on that, Bernie
Not unless you're looking to get short- changed
She raises the empty cream container for effect, turns it over
few drops dribble out
- Bernie limps away from the bar
We hear another spike of sound from the gaming area
As he approaches, a stops him
Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on eleven
(nods) Uh
Let's do the Chivas Regal
Have that
Natalie bring it over
The one working nickel slots next to the Paradise
spoke to Shelly earlier, he wants her at the tables
The floorman nods, walks off
Bernie makes for the rowdy gaming tables
Takes his time about it
His approach brings an ill-wind to the area
The players appear to sense it
It's in their reactions
slight hesitation of the dice
Fingers tensing over a pile of chips
hand tugging at a tie
The Cooler has arrived
As he reaches table eleven, Natalie intercepts him with a short glass of Chivas Regal
This is you, right
(takes it from her) Thanks
Joe said  should stick around
You say something to Shelly
Bernie just smiles at her
Wow
That was fast
Hey, thanks
She offers up a smile
It jump-starts those dormant eyes
Her whole face comes alive
Notches her up from an eight to a ten
Bernie immediately glances away
He's afraid what she might read in his gaze
Don't mention it
Bernie gestures her over to table eleven
Immediately makes the   in question
good old boy named
He's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one hand
'll make you a fortune on five and nine
'mon forty-five-sixty-three fifty-four
Bernie grabs the drink from Natalie's tray, intentionally bumps Bulldog
Hey, buddy, is this your drink
Back off, pal
'm on a roll here
Another man gladly accepts the drink
Meanwhile, Bulldog sends the dice high up into the air
They drop perfectly on the table
The stickman calls it
Seven out
Mother-fucker
Thank you for those bets, folks
The croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table
Bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices
But he's been noticed all right
By Natalie
Not quite sure what she's just witnessed
Who is this guy
We hear a  over the intercom
(
) Conway, party of twelve, please check your reservation at the Paradise Lounge
Bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker
(to himself) Yeah, yeah, 'm comin'
: -  - -- a player makes a hard six at a craps table
The players howl
-- from the same angle we   from losing dice to the same guy
Bernie looming large in the background
-   - -- Bernie taking a seat at another blackjack table
Next to him, a full table of players on a good run of cards
-- The same table with less players as the dealer appears to be gaining an edge over the players
The only thing filling up are ashtrays
-- Same again, with one player
This time with Natalie watching in the background
Intrigued
show the player's mountain of chips going down until there is only one
-- The dealer taps the felt for the man to bet his last chip
After a moment of indecision he flips the chip into the air
: '  -     - the chip becoming an Alka-Seltzer dropping into a glass
The glass is in  's hand
Director of Casino Operations for the Shangri-la
Late 40's-early 50's
Distinguished, slick, oozing charm
But lose the Cartier, Armani and Paco Raban and you're looking at pure street
He's watching Bernie through the two-way glass
Shakes his head in admiration
Suddenly the office door swings open
stride in
Shelly projects immediate deference to  "" Mid-50's
Former Geovassi family underboss from "back east
" The guy's a relic from the days before MBAs became the weapon of choice in the "family" business
He wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through
Nicky's accompanied by a pair of   in Hugo Boss threads
Shelly glances their way with a look that suggests he's working himself into a full-on sphincter wind- up
Bad news x2
Shelly's muscle,  stands off to one side with an apologetic expression
Nicky, how the hell are you
didn't know you were coming in
Nicky reaches out to shake Shelly's hand
Gets nothing back, then remembers
(shakes his head) Whassimater
You think  don't wash up after goin' to the John
Forget about it
Nicky grabs Shelly, embraces him
(uncomfortably) You shoulda called ahead
woulda sent a car
Ehh
We thought we'd surprise you
Well, anytime, Nicky
Anytime
Shelly sizes up the corporate types
Shelly,  want you to meet one of our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov
And his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb
Shelly sees where this is going
Larry extends his hand
How do you do, Shelly
then catches himself
Quickly pulls it back
Shelly stares him down for a tense beat
What can  get you boys to drink
Off their uncomfortable expressions
'  -     - Shelly seated across from Nicky, Larry and Marty
So
what brings you to town, Nicky
Nicky looks cautiously across the table
Look, Shelly, this is your joint, you run it the way you see fit
But we got a smart kid here and he's got some good ideas on how to revitalize the Shangri-la
Revitalize
What are you talking about
We did thirty-five million last year
Nicky shoots a look over at Larry and Marty
Larry takes this as his cue
First off, Shelly,  want you to know,  have nothing but respect for you
You've done a fantastic job with the Shangri-la for the last sixteen years
No one would dispute that
Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly
Shelly nods carefully
But
But, the business has changed out here
You just have to take a look at the Strip to see what 'm talking about
You mean, that amusement park mook fest out there
You know what that is
That's a fucking violation of something that used to be beautiful
That used to have class
Like a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele
And then that Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way
Nicky and Larry exchange looks
Marty drops his gaze into his lap
Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat whore hiding behind too much makeup
look at her and see all those ugly stretch marks and  want to cry
'Cause  remember her as she was
Yes, well
there's no denying the bottom line
Those eyesores are raking it in
And we can't compete against that
What
You think 'm trying to compete with that
You think this joint's about bringing in the stroller crowd
Fresh off some fucking -ticket ride, looking to break the house on red and black
Fremont's never been about that bullshit
This is where old time and real money comes to play
The numbers, they don't back you up, Shelly
Nostalgia's grand
We all love nostalgia -- but it belongs in a museum
think it's time to decide whether you're running a museum or a casino
Shelly is close to losing it
He catches himself, takes a breath
Hey, forget about it
We'll talk later
Over dinner
(rubs his hands together) So, how's the action
Larry shoots him a disapproving look
Off Shelly's disturbed expression
He's already calculating serious damage control
- Bernie makes his way across the casino floor, when he's intercepted by Shelly
Bernie
Mr
Cool
Got a moment
was just heading over to -- It can wait
Shelly escorts Bernie over to a nearby bar area
The zips over with some drinks
How's the knee
Bernie shrugs
Natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away
Puts in a drink order
She catches Bernie's eye
Nods
Bernie smiles
was speaking to this orthopedic surgeon over at Vegas Memorial
He tells me they can replace a man's entire kneecap with titanium
It's the kinda thing that costs a shitload, but since the man's into us for five hundred large, 'm sure we could -- (stealing glances at Natalie) told you, 'm not gonna be around after Sunday
(sighs) Where you gonna go, Bernie
Where the fuck are you gonna go that's better'n here
got you covered in this town
People, they know you work for me, that's currency in your pocket
That's fuckin' respect when you walk the floor
Where you gonna get that anyplace else
(sighs) Seven days, Shelly
Seven days and 'm out from under
beautiful  in a low cut dress, sashays her way past them, heading for a high rollers craps table
Shelly reaches out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm
Hands her his card
She snatches it, looks it over
Immediately loses all attitude
Oh shit
That's right
like to know who's shopping it in my neighborhood
You wanna keep working the Shangri-la, you come see me tomorrow morning in my office
We'll go over the rules together
And before you come, you bring me a clean bill of health
The hooker just nods
All right, get outta here
She takes off
At the same time Natalie leaves with her drink order
They walk in the same direction
Shelly mistakes Bernie's wandering look for interest in the hooker
You want that, Bernie
She's yours
Anytime
'll keep a tab running for you
(Bernie shakes his head) What's a matter
Not your type
Bernie just stares after Natalie, Shelly finally picking up on it
Things are getting hot on fourteen
gotta go
He limps off
Shelly stares after him
predator seizing up his prey
Calculating
- Bernie's 1958 Buick Electra pulls into the parking lot of a flea-bag motel
Next door to the motel, we see a convenience store with the name,    in pink glowing neon
It's actually supposed to read: The  , but the last two letters of "Market" have burned out
-  - One of those center pool style motels
hard luck oasis, if ever there was one
As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent , approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard with a huge-ass  in tow
They converge at their doors at the same time
There's a weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town
She winks at Bernie
He nods at her
Then casts a furtive glance over at the John
The man flips him off
The hooker mouths, "Sorry
" Bernie hastily enters his apartment
'   - Bernie flips on the light
dim overhead bulb hardly makes a dent in the gloomy surroundings
Typical drab motel furnishings
We notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to the window
single place setting on the counter
Something odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor
No sign of a cat
Go figure
Bernie heads over to the dresser
half-filled bottle of gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side
He pours himself a shot
Turns on the
religious channel
Shitty reception
: an Appalachian Pentecostal service
The members of the congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits viewer donations
Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel
He takes a seat on his bed, props himself up against a pair of pillows, stretches out
From next door, the sounds of wild humping
(
) Oh yeah, baby, give it to me
Oh yeah, that's the spot
Do it to me harder, you big stud
Oooooh
Bernie closes his eyes, tries to ignore the -rated soundtrack coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls
The hooker's moans are starting to get to him
He raises his fist to the wall, then stops himself
He's just not the confrontational type
Instead, he heads over to the , cranks the volume up
The hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre remix that could only exist in the world of Bernie Lootz
Bernie emits a deep sigh, closes his eyes
-   - Big action at the craps tables tonight
The players cheer as makes another pass
He exudes
Natalie arrives with his drink
Seven and Seven
Pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off the table
He throws a hard six
The crowd cheers again
He turns around, stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt and slyly cops a feel
Thanks, dollface
Natalie shudders in disgust
She spins around to leave
runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him
Oh shit
Sorry
'm such a klutz
Bernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces
It's all right
Happens
Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more
Sorry, this guy
fuckin' hands, you know
'okay
You might want to stick around
Bernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton
He gives the stickman a certain look
Excuse me, Mr
Pinkerton
You have no hard eight
(throwing in a chip) Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight
Bernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice
Eight the hard way
The players go nuts
The stickman taps the felt in front of the shooter
Nine hundred dollars to Mr
Pinkerton
Parlay
Parlay
The Boxman seated at the center looks up at him
'mon
You can take that action
The Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval
That's what 'm talking about
None of this low limit bullshit
Just as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips a dollar chip over toward the center of the table
Natalie peers between them to catch a glimpse
Dollar hard eight
The chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet
He releases the dice from his stubby little fingers
Eight easy
Easy eight
Hard eight comes down
The players cry out in defeat
Pinkerton grumbles to himself
He fingers his rail of chips
Five hundred dollar hard eight
And press my nine up two units
He throws in the chips
The croupier places his bets
The dice are fed back to him
He throws
Easy way eight
Eight easy
Pinkerton is fit to be tied
After a passing moment of clarity he empties his entire rail
Hard eight
The entire table stops down for a second
(
) Way to go, Pinkie
Bet the farm
Pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly
Seven out
Pinkerton slams his fist down on the table
He turns to leave the table to find Natalie smiling at him
What the fuck you smiling at, bitch
Pinkerton starts to lose it
Security moves in, right on time
Natalie shoots Bernie a satisfied look
He averts his eyes shyly and limps away
She stares after him for a moment
- , the Paradise Lounge's star attraction, is performing on stage
He's a poor man's Tony Bennett
Mid to late 60's
staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years
The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, almost tripping over his microphone cable
Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, delivering the requisite eye contact
When their companions react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in a boxer's defensive stance
It's classic Buddy Stafford schtick
From somewhere across the lounge, an   jumps up and throws her panties at Buddy
Buddy catches them and waves them in the air
just as another pair whizzes by
We   to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty
as he focuses on Buddy
smile threatens his patented stoicism
He's flashing back on the old days
While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes
We take on '  of Buddy -- - of
The with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy
Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny jewels against his microphone
Buddy's tired eyes
Shaking hands around the mic
to real time  as Buddy reaches the end of the song
Larry is the only one not clapping
to Shelly as he picks up on this
-   - Shelly approaches Buddy's dressing room
He enters without knocking
'   - to find a trembling Buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging himself
Buddy immediately sits up
Shelly
was a goddamn embarrassment tonight
shouldn'a let you talk me into going on
(massages his throat) It's definitely strep
You were velvet out there, pops
Silk
Shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to Buddy
We see a room number scribbled on the crotch area
They were hanging on the door outside
Forget your tonsils
When the muff confetti stops coming, that's when you got yourself a problem
(dangling the panties on his finger) You get a receipt
Excuse me
Charmayne's in the lobby
They got these on sale in the window
Victoria Secret's Valentine's Collection
And the broad waiting in the room, what she set you back
Always Grade- for Ol' Buddy
Are you kidding me
Gimme that
(snatches the panties away from Buddy) You don't fucking deserve this
All those ladies going home with a sweet breeze between their legs because you still do it for them and you're fingering me for some kinda Buddy Stafford ego pimp
Hey, fuck you, old man
Shelly feigns as if he's leaving
(affectionately) Get back here, you prick
Hand it over
Shelly throws the panties back at Buddy
Buddy just stares at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else
Sweat mirror balls his wrinkled forehead
Shelly nods
Removes a foil package from his pocket
Hands it to Buddy
The singer rushes over to his dressing table
Unwraps his works
Rubber tubes his forearm
Trembling hands juggle lighter and hypodermic
Shelly takes a seat on the sofa
Buddy, euphoric as the dope hits the spot
Tears in his eyes
He picks up on Shelly's somber expression in the mirror
Whassimatter, kid
You got that Nostradamus look
Shelly shakes his head
You ever watch those nature shows on Shelly shakes his head
've seen this one a dozen times
It's about lions
Cycle of life thing
The leader of the pack
Pride
It's called a pride
Yeah, pride
The leader of the pride
when he gets on in years
It's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him
They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him
It's humiliating
In front of all the females, this goes down
And after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush
Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense of humor
No shit
It's fucking tragic because the old lion can't figure it out on his own
That he's past it
It'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation
That's like admitting to yourself that you're already dead
prefer nature's way
(a beat) Yeah
Me, too
Shelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror
-   - Shelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on him
He's accompanied by a good looking
Shelly, got a minute
Shelly's expression: no
But he heads over anyway
Shelly, this is Johnny Capella
How ya doin', Shelly
Johnny extends his hand
Shelly ignores the gesture
know you from somewhere, right
Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage
Sony's talking about signing him to a three album deal
They're positioning him as the new Ricki Martin
And  should be interested in this, why
Johnny's looking to headline
told him we might be interested
(icy) We
Hey, if this is a bad time
Even if  were interested, Buddy's got ink with us through 2003
just renegotiated his contract last year
Sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page
(to Larry) If  don't hear from you by Thursday, 'm taking the Stardust's offer
Johnny nods at Shelly, takes off
Shelly and Larry eyeball each other for a long, cold beat
Shelly's about to say something, when Nicky and Marty approach
Larry shrugs, flashes a chilling smile
Where's Buddy
wanna buy the old fart a drink
Buddy asked me to send you his regards, Nicky
He's not feeling so great
think he's got that stomach flu that's going around
Oh yeah
That's too bad
(Shelly isn't fooling him) Well, another time then
Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls
Something with class
Shelly eyeballs Marty for a tense, extended beat
What do look like, some fuckin' pimp, college boy
Just as Marty's starting to get real uncomfortable, Shelly cracks a smile
Sure, no problem
You got any preferences
(jumps in) Yeah
Something with big headlights, nice rims and low mileage
You got any Asian babes
Shelly looks to Larry
think 'll just stick with the tables
We linger on Shelly's unsettled look
This guy is bad news
-   - Bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car
Arriving at his Buick, he's startled to find Natalie leaning against it
She holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her
Buy you a drink
Off of Bernie's surprised expression
: - Cheesy Polynesian decor
Mood lighting = an excuse to keep the electric down
Basically, a joint where people come to lose themselves
Natalie and Bernie are seated in a booth near the back
She sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin
Natalie has an astrological chart in front of her
In between sips, she makes annotations to the chart
(almost to herself) Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 12
5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion
Which tells me that you're a slow starter when it comes to romance
(off Bernie's taken aback expression) You know what
This is real unprofessional of me
shouldn't discuss your chart with you until 'm all done
can tell by that look, you think this is all a lot of No
just know what the outcome's going to be
The outcome
There's not, like, one particular outcome
lot of things enter into it
The planets, moon phases
The outcome won't change with me
It'll be all bad
God,  have never met anyone who was so down on themselves
used to be down on myself,
don't go there anymore
've got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff, then 'll have my certificate and everything
And you know how got
(deadpan) You had your chart done
Yes, as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct
Do you know what  do at the Shangri- la
asked around
You're a "cooler
" You turn winners into losers
And do you know how  do that
know there's stuff that goes on in casinos all the time -- do it by being myself
People get next to me and their luck turns
It's always been that way
That sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy
There's a whole chapter on that in my course
Anyways, can see a big factor in your life is that you're lacking companionship
There's nobody to deflect off
If you've got, as you put it, bad karma, then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it
Well, that's my take on it anyway
Bernie maintains eye contact with Natalie for an extended beat
Then drops his head, gazes at his glass
don't know about you, but 'm real tired
Natalie nods
Bernie motions to stand
Natalie just remains seated
Keeps talking
have this recurring dream where 'm on some beautiful island in the Bahamas
'm sitting on the beach, taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand (gestures to her drink) and then it starts to rain
And wake up and it's my roof leaking on me
Yeah, 'm also real tired, Bernie
(not even sure why he's telling her this) only got six more days
Well, almost five really
Then 'll be leaving town
Only five more days
(a beat) Then we shouldn't waste any more time
Natalie covers Bernie's hand with hers
Why don't we go back to your place
(completely caught off-guard) , uh
If this is
don't know
don't know if  can afford
Natalie flinches slightly
Then swiftly regains her composure
It's Vegas
An honest mistake
Oh god
'm so sorry
didn't mean
You see -- that's exactly what 'm talking about
've gone and "cooled" the damn table
Ah, just shut up, Bernie
You haven't gone and cooled anything
Not by a long shot
'   - Natalie's hand flips on the television
Another bizarre religious service
We pull back from the screen as she tries to change the channel
Just gets a whole lot of static
Bernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room
You should complain about this
'm not here that much
Drink
Sorry, all  got's gin
Nah
've had my fill
Go ahead
Bernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot
Natalie glances around
She notices Bernie's dead plants
You know, once they're dead, they don't really grow back
In case, that's what you're waiting for
Her eyes land on the empty cat bowl
She's about to say something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression
Let's not even go there
She gestures to an old record player in the corner
So
got any music
Bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards
Bare shelves
except for a lone  up on top
He brings it down
It's a Sinatra album
Never been opened
Natalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record from its sleeve
He blows a few particles of dust from its surface
Then delicately lays it on the turntable
The way he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious
With as much care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon
Natalie can't help but smile
Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record
Everything seems to be going so well, until
The needle skids across the surface of the record with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard
Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace
and a delicious laugh comes out
It's Natalie's laugh
Talk about a tension breaker
Bernie turns to her, shrugs
He tries again
This time the needle catches
and Sinatra takes command of the room
He's singing "This Town," a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas
Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch
Natalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger
He picks up his glass, shuffles over
Sit
Relax
promise you, at least one of us has done this before
This is not my first -- Sssh
Surprise me
She starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary moans from him
Bernie is almost in tears
Nobody's touched him like this in years
And it shows
Natalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, then sets it on the floor
She drops down next to Bernie
Starts kissing him
Takes it slow
You're doing real good
They fall back onto the mattress
Natalie taking the reigns, maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties
Bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt
pair of dice
Both twos
In seconds, Natalie has separated Bernie from his pants and underwear, taking him inside of her, Ol' Blue Eyes keeping the rhythm
Natalie moans uninhibitedly
Surprise: she's a real screamer
Moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the wall
Some John telling them to keep it down
Bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at Natalie
for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp
Frank winds down "This Town" a few seconds later
Poor Bernie, he didn't even make it through the song
Sorry
Natalie wraps her arms around him
Don't worry, Bernie
've had worse
We'll try again later
Bernie rests his head on her breasts
Closes his eyes
We hold on him
few seconds pass
and he breaks into a smile
Fade to black
'   - on Bernie sleeping
He still has that goofy smile on his lips
beat or two later, he opens his eyes
We to reveal that he's alone in the bed
No sign of Natalie
Bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in it
Takes a deep breath
Moans at her scent
Ambrosia
He still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, when Natalie steps out of the bathroom
Big smile
Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast
Bernie just looks up at her; replay on the goofy smile
Heaven
(
) --  did six months at Rikers for running numbers
It was Shelly's thing, but  took the rap for it
- Bernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast
After  get out,  call up Shelly and he tells me to come out here figure he's going to set me up good at the Shangri-la
But he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons
So he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts -- trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money
lasted two weeks
As Bernie talks, Natalie spies a very   (20's) coming out of the restroom
Her eyes follow the girl back to a table where a   (20's) waits on her
Already,  was getting in deep
Finally it got so bad,  had to beg Shelly to take on my markers around town
That just bought me more time to keep losing
put Shelly in an awkward position
understand why he did what he did
(taps his knee) He did that to you
What, he shot you
Baseball bat
(off her cringing expression) got off easy
That's getting off easy
was out of control
But he maimed you
Let me tell you something
'm grateful for what he did
(off her stunned look) No kidding
Every time  get an urge to play off the clock -- to so much as drop a quarter in a slot -- reach down and squeeze what's left of my cartilage
It's one helluva reminder
Jesus
thought stuff like that didn't happen no more
Like that was just in the movies or something
Bernie holds her gaze her for a moment
Anyway, Shelly and  worked out a payment plan
Two years off the books at the Shangri-la, cooling tables
Five more days and  walk
Before Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start to moan out loud
The waitress rushes over
(clutching her belly) Oh shit,  think 'm going into labor
The young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion
All this without paying the bill
As they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips over Natalie's purse
Bernie quickly helps her up
That's when he notices the young man
(shocked) Mikey
Bernie
There's a quick moment of confusion
Bernie feels a bit thrown by it all
-   - Bernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step
Once out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have subsided
Natalie walks with the girl to try and help
'm  now
False alarm
Thanks
Bernie pulls Mikey aside
Mikey
Is that
You're not the
(nods) Bull's eye
One time
Obviously runs in the family
guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie
They reach the couple's car
rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine
By the looks of it, they've been living out of it
This you
Hey, what the fuck, it runs
Anyways, we gotta be somewhere
How's your mom doing
'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you, she's getting by
As long as she's wasted
Bernie nods
He gazes past Mikey to the girl
Name's Charlene, in case you were wondering
Looks like she's carrying a whole litter in there, don't it
When was the last time you saw a doctor
Charlene sidles up alongside Mikey
This clinic in Jersey
Maybe six months ago
wasn't about to go back after they treated me like cattle
Just because  didn't have no insurance
And those places, they're crawling with
from all 'em spies
So, you're in town
Maybe a week or so
Got some business to take care of
If you want, stop by the Lucky Star Motel
Give us a chance to catch up
'm on three to eleven shift at the Shangri-la
work the floor
No shit
Well, how 'bout that
Yeah, maybe 'll do that
We can play catch up
For the kid's sake
Gotta split
(to Charlene) Take care
Mikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat
They drive off
Natalie looks to Bernie
She's curious, but doesn't ask
He appears thankful for that
-   - on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the felt
We see the owner of the chips strike a match
His last one
It fizzles out quickly
to the ' with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips
hand quickly reaches in, lights the cigarette with a Zippo
to reveal Bernie
Thanks
Don't mention it
Bernie sits at the table
(he knows the routine) Hundred dollar minimum here, sir
Bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold
Lays it on the felt
Money plays one hundred
(to Bernie) No offense, pal, but there's twenty other tables
What do you wanna come sit on my head for
Just wanna play one hand
Feeling lucky tonight
got this voice in my head, says this is the table
know this is the table
'm already doing good here
It's my fucking table -- (touching him) Hey, heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who owns that big great dane outside
" man at the end of the bar raises his hand
" do
" The fella says, "Yeah
Well, my dog just killed it
" The dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal
"Whaddya mean your dog just killed my great dane
What kinda dog you have
" The fella just shrugs and says, " chihuahua
" "You tellin' me your chihuahua just killed my great dane
How
" (a beat) " dunno," the fella says, " think he got stuck in his throat
" Bernie starts laughing
The player is less than tickled
Just then the dealer interrupts them
Insurance
We see the dealer's got an ace showing
God damnit
The player waves off the insurance, as does Bernie
The dealer checks
Nothing
As the hand plays through the dealer busts out
Bernie glances over at the dealer
What the hell
Bernie places his chips again
You said, one hand
(agitated; to dealer) Keep going
The dealer plays
Bernie and the high roller win again
Bernie glances around him uncomfortably
We see Shelly approaching
Shelly just has a nose for when things aren't running smoothly
Larry is lurking behind him
The dealer turns up some cards
And again, Bernie and the high roller win
Bernie looks absolutely perturbed
Shelly gestures something with his head
Bernie cashes out
Hey, stick around, pal
You and me, we make a great team
Bernie strolls over to Shelly
Shelly guides him away from the table under Larry's watchful eye
What was that
Bernie shrugs, still confused
Well, what fucking gives
Is it McGann
He's been with us twelve years
The man's as standup as my dick
(thinking to himself) Maybe he's got money problems
'm gonna pull him
He wasn't counting 'em, was he
The mook with the streak
Bernie shakes his head
Larry sidles over
Is there a problem
(zero tolerance) No, there's no problem
Fella's on a streak, is all
(re: Bernie) Let me guess
This is one of your "coolers
" Why don't you announce it to the whole fucking joint
(lowers his voice) Man, they told me you were a stickler for the old ways
But coolers
What is this guy, some kind of degenerate gambler
Reformed card shark
He doesn't look too effective to me
He's the best
Take it from me
Sure
Whatever
But there ways -- subtle ways -- to keep things in our favor
'm talking more forward thinking methods
That right
suppose you got a whole fucking prospectus on the subject
As a matter of fact  do
Like, right off the bat,  can tell you this wallpaper isn't going to cut it
It's too uplifting
would go with more muted tones
Yeah
Wallpaper
And personally,  think the waitresses can all pop another button or two
Myself,  wouldn't hire anything less than a  cup
Shelly looks to Bernie
You believe this mook
Larry extracts a  from his jacket
Know what this is
Music to be sure
Pleasant, non-intrusive
But blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra
"Lose
lose
lose
" And that's just skimming the surface
We really need to talk, Shelly
Shelly is close to losing it
When , the manager of the Paradise, comes running up
Shelly, you better come quick
- Shelly, Larry and Bernie following behind Morrie as he hastily leads them down a hallway of the Shangri-la's best suites
They arrive at an open door, the sound of a beckoning them inside
'  - Starting on the  set: "Lost Horizon" (1937) is playing
It's the scene where Robert Conway (Ronald Coleman), his brother and Maria are leaving the lost city in the end
Conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise
to a pair of naked feet on the floor next to the bed
revealing Buddy slumped against the side of the mattress
a hypodermic needle protruding from his arm
Death glaze fixated on the screen
Bernie slumps back against the wall
Catches his breath
Shelly just stares at Buddy, a slight tremor of grief threatening his granite features
He glances over at Larry, who takes in Buddy's deathly repose without a hint of emotion
Larry meets Shelly's eye with a subtle smirk of one-upmanship
An incendiary beat passes between them
Then
(to Morrie) Get a hold of his daughter
Assist her with the arrangements
The Shangri- la will take care of everything
What about the Paradise
She goes dark tonight
That won't be necessary
Shelly and Larry exchange looks again
Bernie picks up on it
The tension in the room threatens nuclear fission loud   reverberates on the soundtrack
accompanied by jungle-like percussion
as we  : - "now performing" poster on a metal stand: live at the Paradise Lounge
off the sign and following a  through the doors into the theater
our eye drawn to the stage
troupe of gorgeous in leopard print -strings, grinding their hips to the muscular rhythm
Flanking them are a pair of strutting  in elevated cages
An    and
and   makes his entrance
Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up every light in the house and throws it back at the audience
Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr
and the moves of Ricki Martin
The energy this guy brings to the stage makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem like suspended animation
The women in the audience start fanning themselves with delight
It's a new dawn in Paradise
And the panties are coming fast and furious
We see Shelly watching from the back of the room
He shifts his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table
They're having a grand time
Nicky pats Larry on the back of the head
"Good work, kid
" Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly
Shelly stares right through him
declaration of war
- Bernie and Natalie wander around the midway
middle-aged at the ring toss booth gets her attention
Over here, young lady
'mon, give it a try
Eight for a dollar
Natalie drags Bernie over
She pays her money and the worker hands her the rings
Natalie throws, and misses all eight
The man pats her on the shoulder
Sorry there, sweetheart
Better luck next time
Wanna try again
Natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches Bernie's eye
His look suggests she's being played for a sucker
She decides against it
They walk off down the midway
Bernie chuckles to himself
What
Nothing
What
Nothing
You're just an easy mark, is all
An easy mark
Yeah
Easy mark
You never heard that term
Natalie shakes her head
When we were kids, Shelly and me, we used to work Coney Island during the summer
When a guy would walk up and seemed eager to open his wallet, we would always mark him with chalk
We'd pat him on the back or arm with the chalk
Like, 'Hey buddy, good job
' (pats Natalie) Meanwhile, he had no clue the other guys saw him coming a mile away
Easy mark
Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her
She brushes it for effect
Bernie smiles
They take a seat at the end of the midway
Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed  being dragged around by his   and the brother's
The kid has a glazed look in his eyes
Natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression
Bernie picks up on it
You
You notice last night, that tattoo on my butt
(are you kidding
) Little Joe
Yeah, two twos
Little Joe
Natalie hides her face behind her soda cup
Looks off in the distance
had a son
His name was Joe
was his mother for a year
You know, you don't have to tell me this
want to, Bernie
Better you know the worst of me up front
Later, when 'm already invested in you, it'll be too hard to come clean
After  tell you this, you'll probably
mean, 'll understand
She tears her eyes away from Bernie
Bernie can't believe what he's hearing
That she wants to be invested in him
What could be so bad
gave my son up for adoption just wanted my life back
was seventeen going on eighteen and was selfish
My family, they didn't want to have nothing to do with me after that
So  hitched a ride out here
Figured  could make it as a showgirl
Ten years later
(shrugs; starts to break up) like to think that if it happened when  was older -- with some guy cared about -- maybe things would have been different
think about my Little Joe
And,  do know he's better off
'm convinced of that
She lowers her soda
Turns to Bernie
He studies her for a lengthy beat, stoic features
She wipes away her tears
Oh well, that's that
Bernie stands up
Looks around
focuses on the arcade clock
It reads 1:40 a
m
He turns to her
So, you wanna go try your hand at the dime pitch
It's early still
Off Natalie's tear-filled features
She breaks into a laugh- cry
: '   - Bernie and Natalie making love
Slow, tender
Natalie doesn't make with the "Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great" encouragement
Just some low key moans
Bernie doesn't come too soon either
He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts
In contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away through the walls
An escalating ostinato of "Oh Baby's
" Until Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against the wall
Big smile from both of them
- Bernie and Natalie returning from breakfast in Bernie's Buick
Bernie can't find a parking spot
Natalie climbs out, heads for the room
Natalie arrives at the room
She's about to stab the key in the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar
She hesitates for a moment, then pushes it open
'   - to find Mikey and Charlene waiting on them
Charlene is puffing away on a Marlboro when Natalie enters
She immediately stubs it out
Rises, heads for the bathroom
gotta go pee
'm always peeing
She closes the door after her
(to Mikey) How did you get in here
told the desk clerk Bernie was my old man
He let us wait inside
That a problem
Bernie's looking for a parking space
(chuckles) Shit
musta taken the last one
Mikey steps up to Natalie
She hasn't moved from the doorway
Her dislike for Mikey is evident
Tell me something, Natalie
Is he paying you
Excuse me
My old man, is he renting your ass
'Cause otherwise  just don't get it
loser like my pops in the company of some primo  &
It don't compute
Natalie doesn't dignify Mikey with an answer
She stares him down unflinchingly
Mikey reaches out to Natalie's ear, "pulls" out a $20 dollar chip
This enough to get me a taste
Family discount
He drops the chip down Natalie's cleavage
Natalie still doesn't react
Mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face
She flinches
Right then, the door swings open
Bernie enters
Mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand
He extends it to Natalie
She ignores the gesture, steps aside
Mikey
Hey, Bernie
told you  was gonna stop by
Yeah
figured you'd call ahead
We were out at breakfast
Charlene emerges from the bathroom
Natalie heads over
She doesn't want to be around Mikey
She stops in front of Charlene, points to a sprinkling of white powder on the side of her nose
You missed some
Charlene immediately swats the coke off
Natalie enters the bathroom
Closes the door
You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're kinda strapped
mean, Charly here's expecting like yesterday, and we don't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an' all
So,  was wondering if you would care to invest a little in your grandchild's future
his well being
Bernie scratches his head, thinks on it for a moment or two
Then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard
Pulls down a coffee can
Extracts a thick wad of bills
Hands them over to Mikey
There's about three grand there
That's all  got
Bless you, Bernie
(pats her belly) You know, Michael,   -- think we should name her Bernadette
After your father
You mean, Bernie
Trust me, it's a boy
Bernie seems quite moved by it all
(to Bernie) Wanna feel her
don't think
don't want anything to hap
Ooh,  just felt her kick
'mon, Bernie, gimme your hand
She places Bernie's hand over her stomach
Feel that
(not sure) don't know
think so
Mikey takes Charlene by the arm
We'll catch you later, Bernie think 'm gonna take Charly over to the hospital right now
Get her checked up real good
Charlene kisses Bernie on the cheek
He blushes
Take care, Pop
Mikey
Mikey turns in the doorway, eyebrows raised
Yeah
You're not going to try anything stupid while you're in town
Mikey plays it dumb
Huh
You mess up and they'll cut you no slack
That's all 'm saying
You got a kid to think about
Mikey nods, backs out of the room
Charlene giggles
They disappear into the parking lot
Natalie emerges from the bathroom
She lights up a cigarette, just stares at him as if to say: sucker
Bernie shrugs
'  - Shelly enters to find Larry seated behind his desk
Larry immediately leaps to his feet, phony apologetic grin
Nicky and Marty are lounging on Shelly's sofa
Shelly's gaze is drawn to a table in the middle of the room
There's something on it, covered in a plastic sheet
He raises a "what gives
" eyebrow
Shelly,  hope you don't mind
What's going on, Nicky
'm sorry we didn't say nothing about this earlier
but the deal wasn't closed yet
Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna love it
Nicky gestures to Larry
Larry whisks the plastic sheet off the table
to reveal an impressive   of a redesigned - The model boasts huge snow-capped Himalayan peaks a la "Lost Horizon," surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and casino
Matterhorn-like rollercoaster traverses the mountain top
Gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise to raise the bar on Las Vegas opulence
We're looking at a hundred million dollar investment easy
The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino
We break ground on her in six months
Off Shelly's startled expression -- know what you're thinking
Where's she gonna go
You need space to expand, right
Well, that's been taken care of
We're now the proud owners of The Golden Frontier next door
(gesturing to the model) She's perfect
Three floors of gaming, theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, you name it
She'll pay for herself in three years, and then it's easy money
Isn't she great, Shell
Shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner mounting the scaffolding
We see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming pool
In "Lost Horizon," these people, their plane crashes in the Himalayas -- and they get rescued and taken to this Utopia in the mountains
Shangri- la
It's beautiful
The place is completely isolated
Untouched by the outside world
There's no war, no greed, no bullshit
Time is slowed down
People, they don't age
It's
paradise
That's what Shangri- la is
Paradise
Yeah, we've all seen the movie
And your point is
Shelly whirls around, yells: You don't fuck with paradise
All'a ya
Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly
We're not trying to fuck with it
We're trying to make it better
How
how, Nicky, could it be any better
Right now it's perfect
It's the last of its kind
It's pure
and this
(points to the model; weary) this is just
it's a mockery
An insult
Trying to make something of it that it isn't
What are you talking about
It's right outta the movie
Whose talking about a fuckin' movie
This ain't a fuckin' movie
This is my life
This is my house of worship
You people are shittin' on all that's sacred to me
tense silence ensues
Nicky, Larry and Marty exchange looks
(tired laugh) got just one question
Where you gonna be when they decide to change it back
When the people, they come looking for the real Vegas, from before all this Epcott Center bullshit
Who's gonna it give it to them
You guys
don't think so
You know who
The same fucks who started this shit in the first place
It's all gonna come full circle and bite you in the ass
Mark my words
Shelly falls silent
Massages his forehead
Shit, that wasn't the way to handle it
Nicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to Shelly, places a hand on his shoulder
Shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away
You make some good points, Shelly
Maybe it'll swing back the other way, who knows
But the smart money suggests we roll the dice
'm not gonna bullshit you; naturally there's gonna be a lot of restructuring in the months to come, but  want you to know, you'll always have a place with us
Where's that
Behind the bar
(laughs) Behind the bar, that's a good one
think you should take some time and think things through
All this, it's a lot to digest, y'know
Speaking of things to digest, 'm starving
How's that buffet they got in the Valley of the Blue Moon
You recommend their prime rib, Shell
Shelly stares right through Marty
Choke and die on it, motherfucker
It's food
Hey, my arteries can use a workout
Lead us to the trough, Shell
Shelly nods at Nicky, then shifts his gaze to Larry
Larry's all smiles
He steps forward to join them, his hand dropping down and caressing the surface of Shelly's desk behind him
subtle gesture not lost on Shelly
Shelly mentally unloads a full chamber into Larry's chest
Returns the smile
-   - As Shelly and the group pass a hot craps table, Nicky is drawn to it
Wait up a second
thought we were gonna eat
Only now do we see Bernie has arrived to cool the table of its hot shooter --  , pudgy, overdressed
Shelly eyes Bernie
Maybe we wanna play over there
Less crowded
Nah, let's play here
This is my lucky table
always play here
(to the others) Go on ahead
know where to find you guys
Shelly signals Bernie to back off
Bernie steps back
Shelly, Larry and Marty head for the restaurant
Nicky quickly slaps down some green
The stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is shooting
He scuttles the dice
They bounce up over the rail and spike Nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the felt
The players chuckle
Out
Seven, line away seven
Nicky rubs his forehead, glares at the suburbanite
He fires back
"mon, pops
What the hell
coulda paid my mortgage with the money just lost
Nicky says nothing
The table is quickly cleared by the dealers
The stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the dice to Nicky
Hey
'm supposed to be next
File a grievance, shithead
Suburbanite is still fuming over his loss
Nicky places a couple hundred on the passline
We're coming out
Crap Eleven, any seven
Nicky throws in some chips to the center
Hundred dollar big red
Suburbanite watches as Nicky runs through a lengthy pre-shot routine
Lots of hand jive and cuff shooting
Hurry it up, gramps
Your soup's getting cold
Nicky throws
Crap, Ace Deuce
Line down
The croupiers takes down the pass line
Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try shuffleboard
Nicky is fed the dice again
Same routine
Nicky just fires an incendiary look back at the suburbanite
Uncle Palsy
Shake'em this direction
Nicky throws
Four, hard four
The point is four
The players make their bets
Good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die, old man
Nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly
Happy birthday to me
Happy Birthday to me
Jesus, fuck, 'm another year older already
Nicky throws
Seven
Line away
Nicky claps his hands dealer style -- for effect -- and with a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table
Nicky's chips are quickly swept up by the croupier
Don't take it so hard, pops
Everybody craps out
Nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite
Then flashes a smile that suggests he's going to brush it off
He turns away from the table
Now go change your fucking Depends
Nicky makes like it's all in good jest
Yeah, that's real cute
He heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds out his hand as if to say: Hey, no hard feelings
The suburbanite shrugs
What the fuck
was just playing with you, pops
He reaches for Nicky's hand
when Nicky suddenly headbutts him
Before anyone can react, Nicky starts laying into the suburbanite
The man goes down and
Nicky continues pummeling him
Who's laughing now, huh
ya fuckin
prick
'mon, crack wise again
Ya fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no- dick, suburbanite scum
How's that for a game
Shelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table
He takes immediate control of the situation
Snaps his fingers at security
The suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful of comps and a bruised ego
Shelly takes Nicky aside, attempts to calm him
Nicky keeps railing at Shelly: That ain't right, Shelly
Guy fucks up my game like that
Who the fuck does he think he is
You're right
He's just a piece of shit
Forget about him
thought this joint had more class
Used to be, we wouldn't even let bums like that in
Nicky catches himself
He looks at Shelly for a beat
There's an unspoken understanding between them
"The good old days
" We see Bernie in the b
g
, looking more than a bit shocked
- Bernie seated with Natalie
This town
You know, Natalie, all want to do is go some place where can tell day from night
Where they got clocks on the wall
can't breathe around here no more
Four days and 'm gone
'm not even sure can hold out that long
(a beat) So where does that leave us
week ago,  didn't remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me
'm still pinching myself, expecting to wake-up from
(just blurts it out) Come with me, Natalie
want you to come with me
God, Bernie, that's
'm sorry
didn't mean to spring that on you
Bernie
want to be with you do
But  don't know if  can leave with you
Bernie's look: Why
was working on a compatibility chart for the two of us
And it looks good, really, it does
So, what's the problem
That's with us here
In Vegas
Bernie's expression: Oh
Maybe  was being presumptuous, 'cause knew you were leaving
and tried working it in different ways
It wasn't good, Bernie
got scared
But that's just for now, for the immediate future
Once the planets realign, maybe a year from now
Natalie
can't
Not another year
Not another week
somber mood falls on the table
Bernie reaches for Natalie's hand
Instead, he knocks the salt over
It spills out in front of them
think
we probably shouldn't see each other anymore
Why, Bernie
We only got a couple days left together
Why not make the most of them
(a long beat) Because if  spend one more night in your arms, 'm not going anywhere
And that's so bad
Bernie just stares at her, shrouded in sadness
Natalie stubs out her cigarette, rises
Take care, Bernie
Bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front of him
Nods
few beats later he raises his head
Natalie, don't
Gone
appears
(
) Get you another
(nods) think you better bring me the bottle
Please
-   / - Once again, we see Bernie's feet limp across the casino floor
He walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee
Doris brings it over
Short on the cream again
He just sips it black
Gloom and doom features
Life sucks
His master's  sounds over the intercom: (
) Chang, party of fifteen, your table is ready, Chang party of fifteen
Bernie looks to Doris
Sighs
Only three more days
-   - He heads for the crap tables, the sound of raucous becomes audible
large crowd starting to gather
Bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd
As soon as he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table, he tenses up
Oh shit
It's
With Charlene
Charlene is making one hell of a racket
Playing up her extremely maternal state
Just then Natalie sidles up to Bernie with the Chivas Regal
Without thinking about it, he grabs the glass off the tray, downs it in a single gulp
(clutching her tummy) Come on, Mikey
This is our future
Don't blow it
Mikey throws down a bet for the dealer
Put this on the line for the boys
The stickman thanks him as they place the bet
Mikey throws down more money
We can see Mikey has bets all over the table
With shoes
Dealer's got shoes
Hands high, the dice are out
The point is nine
Come on all you's
Put a good thought in for our baby
As everyone dotes over Charlene, Mikey quickly swaps the dice before anyone can see
He throws
Six the hard way
Mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is Charlene
Bernie stands frozen
He doesn't bother trying to get any closer to the table
He knows it'll do no good
Oh my god,  just felt him kick
He knows
He knows you're all pulling for him
God bless you all
Natalie looks over at Charlene
Their eyes meet for a second
It's as though Natalie knows it's a scam and Charlene's acknowledging it
Mikey throws again
Six the hard way
Look out, we got a shooter
Another nine grand
Mikey's rail is nearly full
Charlene hops around awkwardly causing more distraction
Bernie is really sweating it out now
Then Shelly arrives
Larry is hot on his tail
How much
Eighteen thousand since  stepped up
'm sorry, Shelly,  guess 've been hit and miss lately
Shelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure
Something definitely isn't kosher
As Charlene chatters on, Mikey switches the dice back
Shelly makes him
(sotto) Fucking amateurs
Mikey throws
Seven out
Line away
The players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud Mikey's achievement
(bowing) thank you
My wife thanks you
My unborn child thanks you
Mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt
Color me up will ya
Larry notices Shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves
You've gotta be kidding me
(off Shelly's steely glare) That's not how  propose we handle it
We'll turn the matter over to the authorities
They'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined
(gets in Larry's face) And then we'll give 'em both a lollipop for the ride home
Come watch and learn, Harvard
little lesson on how to protect your investment -- the old school way
Shelly walks over to Mikey and Charlene, Larry lingering behind him
Hey, that was some run you had back there
Uh, thanks
Just lucky  guess
Mikey steals a tense glance at Charlene
She starts to fidget nervously
Why don't we go do this in my office
don't like to hand out all this amount of cash on the floor
Security (Tony and Lou) corrals the couple
Leads them away
Bernie watches as they pass by
Mikey looks into Bernie's eyes
They both know he's been made
Natalie doesn't say anything, just looks at Bernie
- Slot machines everywhere -- some on the way out, some on the way in
Crates of casino supplies
Bernie rushes in with Natalie behind him
Heading for an aural beacon of  landing on flesh
, arriving to find Tony and Lou kicking the shit out of Mikey on the floor
Charlene lies clutching her belly a few feet away
Shelly swings a baseball bat, warming up for some blood sport
Larry watches from the sidelines -- at once appalled and enthralled
Oh my God
can feel the contractions coming on
Bernie rushes over to Shelly
Shelly, stop them
Don't do this
Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing to do with you
It's got everything to do with me
He's my son
Everyone stops dead
Freeze frame
Shelly gets a weird look in his eye
fuse has just been lit
What did you say
said, he's my -- Who
This little prick
Shelly smashes Mikey across the shoulder with the bat
Shelly raises the bat to cream Mikey again
Bernie grabs Shelly's arm
Shelly shoves him back
Raises the bat again
Pop, help me
Shelly, don't you fucking do it
Shelly freezes
He lowers the bat, throws it aside
Grabs Bernie by his collar
Were you in on this
Jesus, you better come clean with me
God, no
didn't know nothing about it
Shelly releases Bernie
There's a strange look in Shelly's eye
We see the wheels turning
How much you think their lives are worth, Bernie
Myself,  don't think they're worth piss
But, hey, it ain't my kid
Bernie sees where Shelly's going with this
We can almost hear the cell door slamming in his head
Let me see: they were up almost a hundred and fifty grand
That's 150 's someone's gonna have to account for
What do you say, Bernie, seventy- five grand a piece
Bernie glances over at Natalie
She has tears in her eyes
He looks to Shelly pleadingly
Please don't do this
Hey,  know you don't have that kind of cash
But, since you're a friend of the house, 'm willing to front you
Shelly, they didn't get away with the money
You didn't lose anything
Shelly glances over at Lou, nods
Lou kicks Mikey in the face
His nose snaps like a twig
Oh Jesus
Yes
All right
It's on me
150 's
Charlene clutches her belly, moans
Oh god, oh god
you gotta get me to the hospital
contractions
Shelly, please help her
That's my grandson
Hey, why don't we all break out the champagne
Lootz is about to become a granddaddy
(walks over to her) How you doin' there, sweetheart
Must hurt like crap, huh
(nods) Hurts so bad
Yeah
Suddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly
She screeches out
Oh God
Jesus
Even Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed
Larry is aghast
Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows on him
Shelly swats him off
He drops down next to the squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her stomach
to reveal a mound of fake padding
He tears the padding away from her, throws it at Bernie
Here
It's a fuckin' boy
Anyone got a cigar
The muscle start laughing it up
Relief
Larry emits a nervous giggle
Natalie's jaw hits the floor
Bernie takes a step back
He's about to go into serious shock
Charlene curls over, sobbing
(to Bernie) You sure you still want to be good for it
Because if you want to change your mind,  don't blame you
Bernie looks over at Mikey
He stares up at his father, trembling
'll make it up to you, Pop, swear
Bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat
He's almost tempted to
He just shrugs and nods at Shelly
It's on me
(shakes his head) That's the worst fucking call you ever made in your life
at that moment
We can tell she agrees with Shelly
but thinks all the more of Bernie for it
That might even be love in her eyes
Shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor
Walks over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing Mikey's left kneecap
Oh man, the scream
What are you doing
thought we had -- 150 's buys their lives
This is just a little slap on the wrist to remember me by
Natalie turns her head
She's about to throw up
Larry watches, unflinchingly
Charlene is making with some serious pleading now
Oh god
it wasn't my idea
Shelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in the palm of his hand
He smiles reassuringly at her
You know, motherhood is a beautiful thing
This
you made a mockery out of it
Maybe you'll get to experience it for real one day
(nods, sobbing) want
to be a mother
please don't hurt me
'm not going to hurt you
Shelly turns his back on her
Charlene starts sobbing relief
They're not going to hurt her
It's going to be all right
Wrong
Shelly throws the bat to Lou
The heavy steps up to the plate (as we   to Shelly walking away) -- followed by the girl's
Natalie buries her head in Bernie's shoulder
(to Tony and Lou) Get 'em outta here
You ever see them in this joint again, kill 'em
(to Bernie and Natalie) You two, you're still on shift
Shelly catches Larry's eye:  hope you were taking notes
'   - Bernie's seated on the edge of his bed, drowning his sorrows with a bottle of gin
Moonlight paints him in jail bars of shadow
Natalie lingers in the b
g
did this to myself
planted the seed
When Angela took off with Mikey, didn't
never made an effort to get back in his life
figured, the kid don't need a loser for a father
Now it's all come full circle
give him the money,  open the door to all this
musta had it coming
Payback
Natalie's hand lowers the needle onto the Sinatra record
"Nice 'n' Easy" starts up
She walks over to Bernie, takes the bottle away
Helps him to his feet
He gives himself over to her reassuring embrace
Natalie raises Bernie's face to her's
Bernie, it's a big world out there
If you just took off -- if we took off
Bernie shakes his head
It's too late for that now
: '   -  - Natalie staring up at the ceiling, Bernie nuzzled against her
Her features appear softer than ever
Luminous in the moonlight
Realization moist in her eyes
You awake, Bernie
He grunts something inaudible
-- think  love you
Bernie tenses up
Huh
No,  don't think
'm pretty certain of it
Bernie raises his head, not quite sure he heard her right
Natalie sits up, hugs her knees
Bernie finds himself staring at her back
You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz never saw this coming
You shouldn't do that to a girl
Bernie reaches out, caresses her back
She emits a shiver
There's still things you don't know
should know
don't want to ruin it
Bernie pulls Natalie back toward him
It won't make any difference, Natalie
Whatever you come clean about, 'm not gonna feel any different about you
'd say the words, but with my luck
Say 'em anyway
To hell with rotten luck
That's overs
(a beat) love you, Natalie
Natalie smothers her lips against Bernie's
He enshrouds her in his arms
Fade out
'   - Fade into
Slowing taking form
' seen in extreme close-up
-- to reveal the cat resting on Bernie's chest
She as he stirs awake
He's stunned to see her there
Trixie
The cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty food bowl
Meows again
Bernie breaks into a wide smile
Trix
You came back
Bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming in through the blinds
Huh
This is a first for him
He's never gotten direct sunlight in his room before
What's the deal
Did the world just turn on its axis
He glances over his shoulder
No Natalie
Just her impression in the sheets
And a note on her pillow
For a moment his heart stops
He conjures up the worst
Grabs up the note, unfolds it
We see a lipstick kiss and the words: Bernie lets out a joyful whoop
Leaps out of bed
: '   -  - -: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl
We hear the record player needle drop on "Luck Be  Lady
" Cut to: Bernie's feet gliding around the room
to Bernie dancing with himself
He's positively aglow
He snatches up a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra
It's true -- love makes the world go around
It obviously also gives life to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung up overnight above his radiator
But we won't dwell on that
-    - Bernie struts into the casino a changed man (still to the tune of "Luck Be a Lady")
Even his limp seems less pronounced as he greets fellow workers as they pass
He catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror
Maybe for the first time, he likes what he sees
In the reflection he notices Natalie smiling at him
He meets her eyes
She averts them quickly, keeps walking
'  - Shelly watches Bernie from the video monitor
He appears less than delighted over Bernie's sunny disposition
He picks up the phone, dials
(into phone) Yeah, it's me
Get Bernie over to crap table six
- Per usual, Bernie walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee
Doris slides it over
(looking around) Got any cre -- Before he can answer, Doris hands him a container of cream
full container
Taken aback, he starts pouring it into his cup, when he hears a  over the intercom: (
) Lovett, party of six, your table is ready, Lovett, party of six
Bernie looks to Doris
Duty calls
-  - -- Bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just in time for the dealer to bust out
The crowd goes crazy
-- Bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of a slot machine
Suddenly, the woman playing it hits a jackpot
-- Everywhere he seems to go, people continue to win
-- Bernie, despite the spooky irony, can't help but smile as mountains of chips pile up on the tables
Shelly appears behind him
Not a happy camper
He gestures Bernie to follow him
- They head over to a section of slots
As they pass one of those huge million dollar slots, the   cuts in front of them
Hey, Shelly, check it out
The new Mega-Million
call her Marnie, 'cause she's one frigid broad
Sure, once in a while she'll flash you a bit of tit, but your chances of hitting a home run -- one in twenty million
Here, give her a shot
He hands Shelly a cup of quarters, takes off
Shelly looks to Bernie
He's trying to keep a lid on his anger
(feeding Marnie quarters) You wanna tell me what's going on out there
don't know
Shelly pulls the lever
What do you mean
Marnie immediately spits out a small jackpot
(reacts with surprise) What do you mean, you don't know
We're down almost a mil out there
Doesn't seem strange to you
(shrugs) Guess 'm having an off day
You don't have off days, Lootz
You're shitty luck incarnate
What's wrong
You coming down with something
You've got this look about you
Shelly starts feeding Marnie again
Nothing's wrong
Fact is, 've never felt better
What's that supposed to mean
She loves me, Shelly
She told me last night
Natalie
On the mention of Natalie's name, we hear a shrieking , followed by a deafening toll of slot bells
Shelly's just landed the million dollar jackpot
Shelly stares at the slot in surprise -- then looks over at Bernie
Realization hits hard
Fuck
The floor manager staggers over
His expression is priceless
Sweet Jesus
you popped her cherries
have gathered to witness the deflowering of Marnie
They gaze reverently upon her, as if witnessing the "Close Encounters" mothership for the first time
Shelly drags Bernie out of earshot
Natalie
She told you, she loves you
Bernie nods, a huge grin wrenching his cheeks apart
He's about to go helium on us
- Natalie's serving drinks to a table of high rollers, when Tony and Lou appear behind her
'  - The door to Shelly's office slams behind Natalie
Shelly glares at her from behind his desk
We see him thumbing his steel abacus
The beads drifting toward the center
Natalie shakily lights up a cigarette
Put that fucking thing out
Natalie, startled, drops her cigarettes
She kneels to gather them up
Sorry
You should be
You've gone and fucked it up big time
paid you to be his cooze companion, not his fucking true love
But, no, you had to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck
(mimics female voice) " love you, Bernie
" You know what you've gone and done, sweetheart
Those four little words of endearment have already cost this casino a million and counting today
don't understand
(jumps to his feet) Lady luck
You never heard'a lady luck
That's what's goin' on out there
Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick
He should have 'em throwing ice cubes out there, but instead  got a fuckin' meltdown on my hands
Shelly walks around his desk to Natalie
, here's what's gonna happen
You're outta his life by the time he gets home
Don't even tell him to his face, just leave a note
'll make some calls, situate you at another joint
can't do that
(right in her face) Excuse me
It wasn't an act
meant it
love him
(close to losing it) What's there to fuckin' love
He's a loser
Always has been, always will be
thought you were his friend
And  thought you were a smart cookie when  picked you out
You do not want to fuck me over, darlin'
'll see to it that your next John's a rattlesnake out in the desert
Now get the fuck outta here
Natalie rushes from the office in tears
Shelly closes his eyes for a moment -- gotta keep it together
-  - Bernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off duty
Hi
Any of you seen Natalie around
'm supposed to give her a ride home
#1 think she left already
She wasn't feelin' too good
We been covering for her
Off Bernie's expression: Oh
- Bernie's Buick pulls into the lot
He parks, heads for his room
'   - Bernie enters
Flips on the light
No Natalie
(calls to the bathroom) Natalie
You in there
No answer
He heads over
Finds it empty
Concern spreads across his features
He glances around the room
Notices the closet wide open
Natalie's clothes missing
(sotto) Natalie
That's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser mirror
He rushes over, rips it off
'
' ,
Bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief
Starts to tremble
Then rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs
Christ, make it stop hurting
: '   - Bernie seated at the foot of the bed, drinking bourbon from a solitary glass
He's almost gone through an entire bottle
He glances down, notices a pair of Natalie's stockings sticking out from under the bed
He brings them up to his face
Breathes her in, only to exhale a sorry breath
-  -  - Bernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee
Doris starts to pour the cream
whoops
empty
Bernie shrugs
Par for the course
Time to go to work
- We see Bernie back in top form
Forget Mr
Cool, he's turned into Mr
Freeze with a vengeance
The high rollers are facing a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to Bernie
--  man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full of hubris
Bernie pulls up a chair next to him
-- We see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps table
The cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are flung
Players groan as they jettison the table, leaving just Bernie
-- We see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players sit with twelves and thirteens
They sit stunned as their money is swept away
The same man with the hefty bankroll unclips the last of his green
He throws it over to the dealer to change in
-- Larry, roaming the floor, is visibly disturbed by Bernie's cooling ability
It's something he can't quantify and it unsettles him
He glances up toward Shelly's observation window, knows the man is gloating
Good call
From behind the glass, Shelly lights up a stogey
Hint of a smile
You go, Bernie
- Johnny Cappella rocks the house
to Shelly and Bernie seated in Shelly's booth
Shelly is in a jovial mood, while Bernie is a portrait of misery
want you to tell me the truth, Shelly
Did you say something to Natalie
Did you muscle her -- Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think of me
That  would fuck with your happiness
That hurts
Bernie shrugs an apology, shifts his gaze to Johnny Cappella
This guy's all flash
No soul miss Buddy
Place isn't the same without him
Buddy was tired
gave him an easy out
It coulda been a lot worse
(confused) You gave him an easy out
What are you talkin' about
thought he
Shelly looks almost
tortured
Something he needs to get off his chest
He woulda never taken the buy-out offer
Buddy woulda stuck to his guns, no matter what
And they woulda ended up hurting him
couldn't let that happen
Jesus
you
How can you sit here and justify it
Like you were Dr
Kevorkian or something
Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- loved that sonofabitch
But his time was up
What  was supposed to do, leave him to those corporate wolves
What  did, it was the humanitarian thing
That  have no doubt about
Afterwards,  held him in my arms and  cried like a fucking baby
What
You got this look -- what's this fucking look
Off Bernie's shocked expression -- '   - Bernie sits watching , a bottle of Ten High next to him on the bed
Same religious channel
This time it's a mass baptism taking place on some river bank
He's about to doze off, when he hears a light rapping on the door
He cocks his head, not sure if it's the booze talking
Bernie throws open the door -- Natalie standing there
lonely angel framed in the doorway
Suitcase at her feet
24 carat tears glistening in the dark
They just stare at each other for an extended beat
Then Natalie stumbles into Bernie's arms
Clingwraps herself to him
Bernie squeezes his eyes closed
Holds on for dear life
It's a different kind of pain now; one that hurts so good
from over Bernie's shoulder
There's a bittersweet look about her
Nothing good can come of this
But that's tomorrow long ways off
'  - Bernie and Natalie lie in each other's arms
Bernie seems at ease
Natalie eyeballs the ceiling, smoke wisping up from a cigarette
Bernie
You awake
Yeah
Let's just take off
Bernie looks over at her
mean it
Let's just pack up and go
Tonight
(closes his eyes) can't do that
've got an obligation to Shelly
There's no -- Fuck Shelly
He doesn't give a shit about you
Let's just climb into your car and get the hell out of here
Bernie cuts her off
can't do that, Natalie
They'd come after me
And because you were with me
wouldn't want that on me
Natalie finishes her cigarette
Well, she's made her bed
Bernie starts nuzzling her
She turns away
Just hold me
- Shelly looking on as a high roller cleans up at craps
With Bernie standing right there next to the guy
Which only seems to make it worse, as Bernie's presence spurs the player on to an even bigger win
Bernie has that goofy "my heart is full" look about him
Which can mean only one thing in Shelly's book
The man looks about ready to split an atom
We see Larry hovering nearby with a smug grin
Off of Shelly's enraged expression
- Lou's black Oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot
Shelly and the boys climb out, head for
- Natalie's sunning herself at the pool
The only other people around are a middle-aged couple and a young boy
Shelly (slipping on his leather gloves), followed by Lou and Tony, strides purposefully up to Natalie -- no hellos, nothing -- just grabs her by the hair
Hey
Ouch
What are you
He drags Natalie over to Bernie's room, kicks the door open, shoves Natalie inside
'   - Shelly throws Natalie onto the bed
Lou closes the door and draws the blinds
You got no fucking right
What did  tell you
What did fuckin' tell you
tried
couldn't
don't give a fuck
Shelly heads over to the closet, rips it open, pulls out a suitcase
He starts throwing Natalie's clothes into the case
You're gone, sweetheart
History
Kiss paradise goodbye
(hysterical) can't leave
won't
love him
Doesn't that mean anything to you, you heartless fuck
Shelly stops packing
He grabs Natalie up off the bed, starts smacking her around
Who the fuck do you think you are
You ain't nobody
could make you disappear like this
(snaps his fingers) And nobody would ever notice you were gone
Nobody
(yells) Bernie would
got friends
You don't fuckin' own me
You got no right -- Shelly lifts Natalie up, throws her across the room into the dresser mirror
She crumbles to the floor, glass showering her
Natalie grabs up a shard, rushes Shelly with it
Fuck you
She slashes Shelly across the arm
Ouch, fuck
Before Tony and Lou can make a move, Shelly ensnares her wrist -- snaps it backwards --
Shelly snatches up the shard, shoves her back on the bed
We see her terror reflected in the jagged glass against her cheek
You fuckin' cunt
He slices her cheek open
Tony and Lou look on with mutual expressions: Shelly's getting a little carried away here
Shelly staggers to his feet
You think that's bad
That's just a taste, bitch
You're still here when Bernie gets home and 'll finish the job
'll cut you into so many fuckin' pieces, the vultures'll be trading on you for a month
Shelly reaches into his jacket, pulls out a wad of bills
Throws them at Natalie
Here
go get yourself some cosmetic surgery
Shelly gestures to Tony and Lou
They exit the room, leaving Natalie sobbing into one of Bernie's pillows
- Bernie parks
Heads for his room
He's about to reach for his key, when he realizes the door is slightly ajar
He pushes his way into
'   - darkness
Natalie
Bernie fumbles for the light switch
(
) No, don't
've got a headache
(closing the door) Did you take something
got some aspirin in the -- Yeah
already took something
There's just enough moonlight in the room for Bernie to make out Natalie curled over on the bed
As he approaches, he trips over Natalie's suitcase on the floor
Ouch
He cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he staggers to his feet
Which draws his attention to the mirror
Moonlight glows off the edges
That's all there is -- edges
On the dresser: his bottle of Ten High
Empty
Confused, Bernie fumbles his way over to Natalie on the bed
Natalie, what happened
The mirror
He reaches out to touch her face
instead his hand makes contact with a lump
Natalie
He jerks back, flips on the nightstand lamp
Bernie, no
Shit
Bernie chokes at the sight of her
She clutches a bloody rag to her cheek
Blood on the pillow
blood on the sheets
And tears
Oh Jesus
Natalie, who did this to you
We need to call the police
love you, Bernie
just want you to know that
fell in love with you
That wasn't part of the plan thought
easy money
What are you saying
Shelly
He paid me to get next to you
To keep you around
Whatever it took
(a whisper) Shelly
You got it right the first night was for sale
Bought and paid for
You were the easy mark, Bernie
Bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed
Sucker-punched
Trying to make sense of it
At first you were just another John
But then  started to take a closer look
For the first time, here was someone who wasn't trying to hustle me
Wasn't pretending to be somebody he wasn't
Just a decent guy trying to get back on track
And it didn't hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal
It sure puts the gutter into perspective
(still in disbelief) Shelly
Shelly wants me gone
He says  bring you luck
Lady luck
stayed
to tell you to your face
and then you wouldn't want me no more
and could just go
Bernie stands shakily
We gotta get you to the hospital
We'll talk about this later
Just tell me one thing, Bernie
Tell me there's gonna be a later
Bernie doesn't answer her
-     - on Bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on Natalie
He tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions
Natalie's betrayal has finally sunken in
The man's in pain
His natural instinct is to just take off
Run
Fuck Natalie
Fuck Shelly
Fuck this whole goddamn town
Suddenly he looks up
couple of people pass by in front of him
and then there she is
Standing a few feet away, face patched-up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to approach him or not
The sight of her just breaks Bernie's heart
He stands slowly, legs like jelly -- and in that instant it's all so clear to him
He walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in hers
She tries to say something
He shakes his head
Ssshh
They embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their atoms into a single being
'  -  - Bernie drives down a quiet Vegas street
It's spooky
Almost too quiet
All the lights are green as they cruise into the night
Tell me again, Bernie
Tell me it's all gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be fine
This is our time
This is you and me and we're going for it
Natalie leans over and kisses him
As she does so, she catches sight of her face in the mirror
Starts to tear up
You look in the mirror, you don't like what you see, don't believe it
You look in my eyes
That's the only mirror you gonna need
Look in my eyes, Natalie
She looks into Bernie's eyes
Sees the most beautiful girl in the world
Tears roll down her cheeks
love you
Marry me
Off Natalie's startled reaction
: - : "
24 " as Bernie carries Natalie out of the chapel, their lips fused together
'  -  - Bernie and Natalie burn down the highway
The lights of the big city just a glimmer in the rearview
Up ahead, a billboard reads:  -
on Bernie
His expression turns grim
Natalie picks up on it
She shakes her head
Silently pleading: Bernie, no
Bernie tries to shrug it off
But the spectre of Shelly sits firmly on his shoulder
There's no escaping him
We see Bernie fighting it
Losing
In the next instant, Bernie pulls a quick -turn across the middle shoulder, starts back toward Vegas
- Bernie pulls into the parking lot
Kills his lights
'  - Bernie reaches for the door
Natalie grabs his arm
You don't have to do this, Bernie
Yeah,  do
have to tell him right to his face
will not look over my shoulder for the rest of my life -- our lives
Bernie, your chart
that first night
wasn't being straight with you
It's the worst chart 've ever seen
There's nothing in the cards for you
'm scared
Don't you see, that was before you opened your heart to me
Everything's different now
got lady luck on my side
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me
Natalie shakily opens her purse, pulls out a handful of hundreds
Pushes the money at Bernie
It's three thousand dollars
Take it
Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a down payment
We can send him the rest in installments
after we get settled
don't think -- Take it
Bernie stuffs the cash in his jacket
Climbs out
Whatever happens,  -- (abrupt) know, Bernie
She turns away
Stares out the window, tears streaming down her cheeks
(sotto; gentle) know
- Bernie makes for the Paradise Lounge as he imagines Shelly laying into Natalie
Fast cuts
Reverberating sound echoes
Just the fuel Bernie needs to make his stand
By the time he arrives at - He's practically foaming at the mouth with rage
He barges in to find Shelly at a table in agitated conversation with Nicky, Larry and Marty
They fall silent, realizing something is wrong
Bernie, what's the matter
You look a little fucking spooked
Bernie throws something in Shelly's face
It's that bloody rag Natalie was holding to her cheek
It lands on the table in front of everyone
Shelly swats it away with disgust
Jumps to his feet
Bernie slugs him one
As Shelly doubles over, Bernie gets in his face
You lay another finger on her, swear to God 'll kill you
You hear me
'll fuckin' kill you
Shelly's goons quickly move in, grab Bernie
Drag him away
Shelly composes himself, turns to his guests
Will you excuse me for a moment
He rushes off
Nicky shoots Larry a resigned look
'  - Lou shoves Bernie inside
Bernie kisses floor
Shelly strides past, leans against his desk
Bernie slowly drags himself to his feet
(a hoarse whisper) Why
Why, Shelly
Because you never give up a good thing, Bernie
You are a good thing
The best fuckin' cooler there ever was
And  need him back
He ain't never comin' back
That's a dead man talking
'm through with this joint, Shelly
Natalie and me, we just got married
We're outta here
'll get a job out there in the world
Send you half my paycheck every month
Make good on my obligations
(gets in Bernie's face) You try to walk on me, Bernie, and 'll fuckin' bury you
The both of you
don't think so
Shelly's expression: Oh yeah
You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't the world's biggest loser no more
That honor's gonna fall upon you, Shelly
And maybe you had it all along
What the fuck
Me
'm the loser
What you got
What do you got in your life besides this joint
What the fuck more do  need
You got nothin', Shelly
This place -- your legacy -- it's a mirage
You turn your back and it don't even exist
There's no day, there's no night, it's all just one big fuckin' blur and it don't count for nothin'
Shelly looks to Tony and Lou: You believe this fuckin' guy
Bernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly
first
feel real sorry for you
Yeah, you got this fear of germs thing
But it goes deeper than that
You can't get close to no one
On an emotional level
You're the worst kind of gambler there ever was: too scared to put his chips on the table
Too scared to open his heart
to extend any real kinda friendship
Always afraid it's gonna end out in the desert
Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, pal, 'cause 'm out and if that's where it ends, that's where it ends
Bernie turns his back on Shelly, strides over to the door
That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz
All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face intensity
You almost sold me
(massages his throat) Man, 've got a fucking lump in my throat
(a beat) But it still don't change things
You bail on me without making good on my 150 's and 'm gonna be forced to close the books on you
You and the broad
You leave me no choice
Bernie turns, looks at Shelly
Shelly's dead serious
They hard stare each other for a beat
Bernie doesn't say anything
At least, not out loud
His eyes do all the talking: " guess you leave me no choice either
"  on Bernie's steely resolve
- This could be the opening of the film -- Bernie standing with his back to us, facing the gold elevator doors
Murky reflection
The floor lights ascending fast
The doors open and the soundtrack goes on him as he takes in the action -- a gladiator about to enter the Coliseum
Something comes alive in his eyes spark of determination
This is not the expression of a loser
- as his foot steps onto the casino floor -- An explosion of amplified   shatters the previous silence
- We follow Bernie as he wanders through the casino like he's done a thousand times -- but this time with conviction
-   - Bernie steps up to an empty table, throws down the whole three grand onto the felt
Change only
The  working the table stop down as they realize who it is
The table is dead
Bernie couldn't be needed
The croupier slowly gathers up the green, hands it to the boxman
Check change three thousand
The boxman counts the cash
This a pleasure cruise, Bernie
You could say that
Well, it'll be a short one
Table's dead
It is now, anyway
The others chuckle
The boxman counts out the chips; they're given to Bernie
He places them all on the passline
The stickman pushes over the dice
Bernie picks a couple
He throws
Yo Eleven
Pay the line
Bernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings
He lets it ride
The table quickly fills up with hungry players
Bernie throws the dice again
Winner seven
Bernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line bet
The other players also collect their winnings
They can feel something in the air
Bernie, forehead beaded with sweat, rubs the felt a little before he picks up the dice
He throws
Six easy
Easy way six
Bernie takes double odds on his bet
The boxman isn't sure what to do
Does he stop him
Does he dare
In the b
g
, people gather to watch the action
Whatever it is, it's catching
The table next to them bursts into applause
- -- Close on a slot machine as it pays out
The woman grabs the payout feverishly
--  group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer busts out
-- The line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer
--
Stacks and stacks of chips, being meticulously counted
--  quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number twenty-one
The dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large stack of chips in the twenty-one square
-   - shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the outcome of the throw
Followed by a thunderous release as the point is made
In the center of it all
Bernie Lootz
His rail is nearly full of chips
The other players pat him on the back and shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line
He's a winner
And it's infectious
He's gone and "contaminated" the entire casino
The slots are ringing out of control
of delight
This much excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off
Bernie just gazes around in amazement
If only Natalie could see him now
(sotto) Natalie
this is you
Bernie takes a thousand dollars in chips, tosses it gently to the croupier
For the boys
The entire crew stop for a moment out of respect
Bernie notices
They all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money
Okay, we're coming out
Get your bets, &, any seven
'  -   - Shelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable
He looks pre-occupied
Almost melancholic
Bernie's assessment of his life having hit home
Suddenly the door is thrown open
It's Tony
Shelly, take a look at number 4
-   - Shelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the crowd
He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get a closer look
(to the boxman) How much is he up
The boxman looks up nervously
Around three hundred thousand
Shelly mouths the words under his breath
Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses call me
We tried
You weren't picking up
Besides, it was Bernie
The game resumes
Alright
We're coming out folks, hands high
Bernie stops
Wait
Everybody quiets down to listen
Color me up a hundred fifty thousand
(beat) And give it to him
Bernie points to Shelly standing in the pit
The crowd watches the drama play out
That's what  owe you, Shelly
There it is
We're square
(to the table) Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives up to his obligations
The boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays them out on the table
He counts it and claps his hands together for the cameras
One hundred fifty thousand, coming in
Shelly stands motionless
Staring into Bernie's eyes
The whole crowd watches
After what seems like an eternity, Shelly nods
Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone
Larry appears next to Shelly
Nicky and Marty watching from the sidelines -- dour expressions
What's the matter with you
He's one of ours and he's taking us to the fucking cleaners
Lootz's off the clock
As long as he's off the clock, he's free to play
Just like every other schmuck in this joint
It smells wrong
'm shutting him down
He's not leaving here with a dime -- Shelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of his fingers
Larry gasps, starts to cave
Shelly keeps him upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room
Nicky and Marty looking on in amazement
'  - The door flies open, Larry catapults into frame
Bounces off the wall
Shelly's right behind him
He drags Larry to his feet
Slams him into the wall again -- gets right up in his face
Now you listen real good, you Harvard turd
Lootz is on the up-and-up
He leaves here tonight with whatever he comes out with
You so much as touch a hair on his head and 'll fucking wallpaper this joint with your ass
Muted tones, right
(slams him hard) What's that
don't hear nothing
Wait a minute -- yeah, now  hear it
Blended in at a subsonic level
Some kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain
Shelly headbutts Larry
It's like the sound of a walnut cracking
Larry slumps to the floor
Shelly takes a deep breath
Control, control, control
He heads over to the sink, washes his hands -- over and over
Larry moaning in the b
g
Shelly adjusts his tie in the mirror
Control
-   - Shelly exits the men's room, makes his way back to the craps table where Bernie is
Just in time to see Bernie lay twenty five grand on the pass line
waitress hands a drink off to Bernie
He takes a healthy swig
Then picks up the dice
Throws
Crap ace deuce
Line down
The crowd gasps in horror as Bernie's twenty five grand is quickly raked in
He replaces it with another stack of chips
The dice are pushed over to him
He rubs the felt real gently before throwing
Then lets loose the dice
All eyes follow the dice
They hit the felt and bounce around behind a stack of chips
The stickman can't spot them
Call it
croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to get a look
Twelve crap
The crowd groans again
It appears the streak is over
Bernie looks out over the felt
This is his moment of truth
He unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field
He yells out
Fifty thousand dollars
The crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun
(
) On the field
What're you fucking nuts
(
) Don't do it
2 (
) Shake it, don't break it, baby
The dice are slowly pushed over to Bernie
The crowd is feeling it
The entire casino is feeling it
Bernie lets out a long soulful sigh
His whole life depends on the next throw and everyone knows it
Bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show a six and a six
He picks them up
Come on sixty-six
Locks eyes with Shelly -- then lets loose
The dice fly from his hand
Slowly, ever so slowly we watch them sail across the table
The entire table holds their breath in anticipation
: -    -   - Bernie throws open the doors, stumbles out
His limp seems more pronounced
He wears a miserable expression
At the car Bernie steps up
Opens the door, slides in behind the wheel
'  - Natalie throws her arms around him
Thank God
thought for sure
Bernie just looks at her
Pale, mournful features
It's okay, right
You guys worked it out
He took the three grand
Tell me it's okay, Bernie
He doesn't answer
Just starts up the car
'  - On the surveillance monitors: the epidemic continues -- players winning at every table
The Shangri-la's been wiped out
There's no way they can cover this amount of winning action
to Shelly
Defeated
The phone rings incessantly in the b
g
Shelly ignores it
Lou pokes his head into the office: Want me to get that, Shelly
Shelly doesn't respond
He reaches into his desk drawer for that bottle and a glass
Is about to pour himself a shot
Fuck it
Pushes the glass aside
Takes it straight from the bottle
The phone keeps ringing
On the scale model of the newly proposed Shangri-la
Hold on it
chair enters frame, shatters "paradise
" : Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance
Kicking the debris around the office
Drenched in sweat, Shelly staggers over to his desk
Swats the empty gin bottle to the floor
Picks up his disinfectant spray, gives his desk one last wipedown
Immaculate
Stands, walks out
'  -  - We see the lights of the city receding in Bernie's rearview mirror
Once outside of the city limits Bernie pulls the car over
What are you stopping for
Bernie throws open his door
think 'm gonna
Throw up
And he does
It's as if he's choking up the entire city
Everything that's bad about it
Finally, he pulls himself back into the car
Slams the door
Natalie touches his cheek, a reassuring look in her eyes
Suddenly, he's smiling
He opens his coat and a huge wad of cash tumbles out
He throws it up into the air
Natalie almost chokes with surprise
Bahamas, here we come, baby
She throws her arms around him
Suddenly an
flashlight
In the hand of a
He raps on the window
Step out of the car please
(lowers the window) What's the problem, officer
The cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering the car interior
Just step out of the car, please
Both of you
Bernie and Natalie exchange unsettled looks
The cop lowers his hand to his gun
Bernie nods at Natalie
They climb out
He directs them off to the side
Shines his light in their faces
If my driving
if  was going a little fast --  was just over excited, officer
See, we just had a big win at the Shangri-la -- You didn't win nothing
The cop pulls out his revolver, trains it on them
: -    - Shelly opens the door to his Cadillac
Climbs behind the wheel
His keys are already waiting in the ignition
Who's gonna steal Shelly Kaplow's car, right
Shelly doesn't start her up
He just leans back in his seat, emits a deep sigh
He glances up at the rearview mirror
Catches sight of a  in the back
: - Bernie and Natalie staring into the barrel of the cop's revolver
Natalie clutches Bernie's arm
Bernie nods
So there you have it
Oh Jesus, Bernie,  knew it
It was too good to be true
Who were we kidding
Get down on your knees
Both of you
They look at him in shock
He gestures them to the ground behind Bernie's car
We   a shot from the highway: just the cop standing at the tail-end of Bernie's car, Natalie and Bernie hidden from view
down on their knees
Bernie places his arm around Natalie, pulls her close to him
Paralyzed with terror, she still manages a bittersweet smile
Bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but his overwhelming love for Natalie in his eyes
It's a two way current
This is their last moment together; everything that needs to be said is being transmitted through a look
look that says: no regrets
: '  - Nicky leans forward out of the shadows
Shelly holds his gaze in the mirror
Nicky just shrugs
The kid wants you should know, Shelly, he's just protecting our investment -- the old school way
See you around
Shelly nods
He knows the score
flash of steel appears against his head
Muzzle strobe --
So long, Shelly Kaplow
- The cop looms over Bernie and Natalie
Cocks his pistol
Lowers the gun to the back of Bernie's head
They appear oblivious to it
They're already in another place
Sunning themselves in the Bahamas
The cop squeezes back the trigger
still looking at each other
Suddenly the piercing shriek of followed by a reverberating, bone crunching -- -- and a
Bernie and Natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not quite sure what's just transpired
Only that they're still breathing
They look around, startled to see the tail lights of a -  about ten yards away
The cop, their would- be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels
All this in the blink of an eye
Natalie clutches Bernie's arm
Suppresses a hysterical, shock- induced giggle
Bernie just looks dumbfounded
He staggers to his feet, rushes over to the pick-up truck
The driver's head is protruding through the shattered windshield
Death-glazed eyes
Bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure
Shakes his head
We see a dozen Coors empties on the seat and floor of the truck
Natalie checks the cop
Likewise
Bernie comes over
They regard each other breathlessly
He was drunk
It was just freak luck
(catches himself
) Don't give it a name, Bernie
It scares me
All  know is, you're still running hot and that's a good thing
But we're only winners if we keep going
No looking back
Lady luck, Natalie
'm calling it
Lady luck
And we got it as long as we're together
They can't touch us now
He kisses her furiously
Then drags her over to his car
They climb in
Drive off

'  - Bernie's Buick racing into the sunrise
Racing toward the dream
Bernie, eyes fixed on the road ahead, with the contented smile of a man who has gambled on love -- and won
His prize, resting her head against his shoulder
The money, well, that ain't half bad as well
smoky, trumpet driven Chet Baker-like piece accentuates the triumphant mood on the soundtrack, as we
- a little flash-forward into the future
Larry sits with a group of
Gentlemen
(beat) thank you for your vote of confidence
As the Shangri-la's new Director of Casino Operations, 'm gonna make a personal guarantee to each and every one of you
Your investment in this casino will be well looked after
The future looks bright, gentlemen
Very, very bright
They raise their glasses to him
Congenial smiles, one and all
Smiles that don't transcend to their eyes
Promises, promises
We'll see
'  -  - on  and  speeding away from Sin City,   and  above them (helicopter shot) as we  stock footage of all the old school casinos being demolished
As we leave Vegas in the past
