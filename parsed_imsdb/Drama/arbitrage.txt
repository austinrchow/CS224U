He places all of his bloodied clothes and the video discs into the incinerator, pouring   on top of them

Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter

Fingerprints,

What about cell phone records
Did this person make any calls from the area
Not from a cell phone, no
Then they won't be able to place him there
What would you advise such a person to do
To confess immediately
Failing which
To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible
But let me tell you something, and 'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of
And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him

Okay, so now, back to the gallery
Did you see her with anyone
See her with anyone-- what do you mean
You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with
Not that  noticed
No
No, no
Reason  ask, is, that we haven't located the driver
The driver
Yeah, someone else was driving

Well not an employee

Why'd you invest
Why did  invest
Yeah, why'd you invest
She had a great eye
She found me () those Bryce Marden's there
They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that  agreed to fund some of the gallery
(after a beat) Would you mind if we searched her apartment
Why would  mind
It's in your company's name
Oh, right
Yeah
Of course
Sure, go ahead
Now, Mr
Miller
Mmm-hmm
Goldenrod - 4

Why would you lease an apartment for Ms
Cote
Is that something you normally do for your employees
Actually  said that she wasn't an employee, but--  think she'd just come over from Paris if  remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers
So you leased her this apartment
It was through our holding company
You seem a little confused by all this
() am
But 'll get there
Gimme time
Alright
Now,  don't mean to be indelicate
But you're going to be indelicate
Well, from what 've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star
mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but
Oh, okay,  get it, so why would invest in her and help her find a place
Something like that, yeah
It's very simple, detective
invest in people  believe in
thought she'd do well, so  backed her, she did
It's is simple as that

Because we were going broke

How
How does that happen
You remember Alexanderov
Well he came to see me one day last year
He said "Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months
" So, go check it out
And the geological survey's right, friendly government
And to lock it in, you hedge it, right
Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune
(beat, then real fast) () Goldenrod - 4

(') But then there's something  hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so  gotta make it up,  gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge
But 'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe
You can't stop it
And, yes, 'm the oracle, 've done housing, 've arb'd credit swaps,  have done it all, and yes, again,  know it's outside the charter, but it is ' Until
Until it's not
The money's trapped
You can't get it out
Probably never will

It just happens
Well it does not just happen
Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes
It
And like every father  pray that it doesn't  to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you
Thanks to you, we may all be arrested
Nobody's getting arrested
That's why borrowed the money from Jeffrey
Plug the hole,  put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, transfer the company,  pay back Jeffrey-- with interest

It's up to you to move with it or against it
But 'm the patriarch; that's my role
And  have to play it

She walks off
Hold on Robert alone in the park

Bryer exits his sedan and walks over to him

'm not threatening you
'm just asking you -- take a ride with me
Jimmy considers, gets into Bryer's car
- They drive a while in silence
Alright, man, what
Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple know you went to pick him up
This is what you wanna talk about
told you  ain't makin' no more statements
And  know why
Somebody cares
Take a look at this
(hands him a case folder) 've got his phone calls,  got his text messages
've got the relationship with the girl
And they were fucking, by the way
() And then 've got you
've got the time log from the pay phone
've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough
Jimmy thumbs through the
There's no tollbooth

That's bullshit, cause  didn't do it
That's impossible

You lied to the police
You obstructed justice
Talk to Earl, Detective
Fuck Earl
You see this
(holds up the grand jury ) This means that tomorrow, grand jury hears your case in court
And tomorrow in court 'm gonna ask for a felony obstruction indictment, and with with your prior, you are going to prison for fifteen fucking years
You might get out in ten
You'll be what then
Thirty-three, with no job, no girl, no life
Bryer pulls the car over
(') Look:  know you think Miller's your friend
Who's Miller
know about your father
(beat, then hard) You don't know a Goddamn thing about my father
know Miller paid his bills while he was dying
know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge
That doesn't add up to this
You done
Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call
Calls you
Why do you think that is
( ) () Goldenrod - 4
17
11 70
(') `Cause you're disposable- you're the one person he could call that just doesn't fuckin' matter
You're a- you're a throwaway
You're just another part of his transaction
(tries to open the locked door) Will you open the door
So what, what
You're his new nigger now
Jimmy grabs at the door violently
It's locked
Open--
You didn't kill that girl
He did
(containing his rage) Will you -- open -- the door
He's using you
know it - you know it
Do the right thing
Now get outta my fuckin' car
Bryer unlocks the door
Jimmy exits and walks up the block
'  - It's nearly empty
Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at a
Robert sits with Syd in the next room
He's gonna walk
You're certain
Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be
phone call doesn't make him a liar
(off Robert's nod) But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands
Goldenrod - 4

Is that a good thing

She's good
Fine

Yes
She met with Gil Deuchman
The estate lawyer
Yeah
Has she mentioned anything
Not to me

The prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions
Earl Monroe sits next to Jimmy
That was the early morning of April 11th
Yes
Goldenrod - 4

11 72
You received a phone call
Yes
Who called you
Jimmy stares at DeFerlito
It was a wrong number
That's a lie, isn't it, Mr
Grant
No
You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes
Mr
Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why
Why are you lying to this court
'm not lying
DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table
He picks up a  and hands it to a
'm going to introduce into evidence People's
This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge
Mr
Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner
Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief
This is crazy
(whispers in Jimmy's ear) You're gonna have to answer that
Mr
Grant, please answer the question
Goldenrod - 4
17
11 73
April 11th, two thirty-three am
Mr
Grant, directing your attention to the same photograph, would you please read the license plate number of the vehicle passing through the toll
five five four two
(handing in another sheet) This is People's , a printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles plate registry
Mr
Grant, directing your attention to that printout, are those numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate
Jimmy's still staring at the picture
Earl watches, concerned
(') Mr
Grant
Yes
Yes, the numbers are the same
Yes
How do you explain that
can't
But that is your car in this photograph, isn't it
No
No, that is not your car
(off his silence) Answer the question, Mr
Grant
Goldenrod - 4
17
11 74
This is not my car in this picture
don't know how you all did that, but this is not my car
You expect this grand jury to believe that that is not your car when there is a printout from the department of motor vehicles
That's asked and answered, Mr
Deferlito
Mr
Monroe, you are aware that you're not permitted to go on record
- Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl
Jimmy
Jimmy-- what was that
They're lying
Okay, now here's what
Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over to them
can halt the decision
We need a minute, Detective
What about you, Jimmy
You need a minute
Jimmy doesn't answer
Bryer sits down next to them
(') Cause if you do we could
You can get the fuck outta my face
How `bout that
Goldenrod - 4
17
11 75
So you wanna keep playing games
Or you ready to tell me something
Detective,  need to talk to my client
Now if you would just please
How you- How you all just gonna lie like that
Huh
How you all just gonna lie
We didn't lie
You lied
That wasn't my car
Jimmy, don't say anything else
Sure it wasn't
And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone
He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale
That picture was some bullshit
Jimmy, stop
Detective, what's going on
Well, tell him
Go ahead, Jimmy
Tell him
See how the boss'll like this one
Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting
The bell

Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards Brooklyn
In the distance, the Woolworth building
- About thirty people in a room too big for them
At the front are tasteful flower  surrounding Julie's
Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art opening, including Julie's gallery assistant
She looks at him quietly, then quickly looks away
There is no organized service; people are just walking up to the casket and saying prayers
Robert takes his place and holds a moment at the casket
The gallery assistant comes up behind him
Mr
Miller
would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine
beautiful woman in her 50's, , sits crying
Robert approaches as she stands
am so, so sorry
(nods, then) just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter
(shaking his head softly) No
You believed in her, and you gave her a chance
She was happy
know she was happy
It's just
() not fair, is it
Sandrine starts to tear
Robert moves in and  her, hard

She looked totally different

Everything okay with you and Tom
We're fine
Are you worried about the deal closing
( ) No
You want me to guess

Brooke stabs "Stop" on the machine, quickly cooling down

No
Ellen stops her machine
Why not
Issues related to the closing
We don't lie to each other, Brooke
'm not lying to you
It's complicated; you wouldn't understand
Ellen crosses closer to Brooke blocking her exit
( ) Uh,  know that a policeman showed up at the office
Do you know what that's about
honestly have no idea
What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now (starts to tear) For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift
Does that seem a little strange to you
Of course it's strange
So tell me what's happening

He's my dad

With the intricacies of my operation so that you can

You've also lost approximately - --  -   -   - Let's just calm down

Before  go -- how much would you have paid
Six hundred

Four seventy-five
So we made a good deal

How'd you get so fuckin' rich again

What business

What's an Applebee's
It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant
You bought an Applebee's in Virginia
Is this really what you came here to talk about
What are you gonna do
() It's not really that simple, Jimmy

What situation

right now, if  were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt
Jobs, families

And yeah,  know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right
Now you know  care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all
walk away
They just want to know who  went to pick up
() Why are you putting me in this position, man
Why are you putting me in this situation
( ) Can you just hang tight
Just a little longer
Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours
After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose

'll be back with you as soon as  can

He says he didn't take the toll
(
) And you believe him
(after a beat) Does Standard have clawback
(
) What
What do you mean
Let's just say  decide to go in
(
) Have you lost your mind
No, just listen, listen to me
If were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal
(
) (after a beat) No, what's done is done
There's no intent to defraud
You haven't warranted any behavior
So it's just money
Four years, you think

Aha
No, 'm sure

Earl climbs inside, removing a  from his breast pocket as he talks
Okay, they won't release tapes without a court order, but they did give me a print out, the same kind they used at Jimmy's indictment
Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the  he got from the toll authority

Then he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to- right until -- He passes back by the license plate area and stops -- The lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all slightly-pixelated

Hmmm
In light of these developments, and  would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr
Monroe's approval 'm going to offer Mr
Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment
