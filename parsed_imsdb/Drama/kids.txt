Kids Harmony Korine The very loud sound of people having sex
The sounds of deep moaning and sexual huffs and puffs
After a few seconds the sound grows even louder
It should sound as if the two people are fucking into a microphone
The sounds should be painful and raw
(
) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
- The face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair
Her face is inches from the , the  is above her, looking down, almost like the  of the person she's having sex with
She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is red-hot and sweaty
Every time she moves, she makes a deep moaning noise
She looks likes she's on the verge of pain and ecstasy
Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly
The  backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the girl
Telly is seventeen years old
He is short, dirty, slightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a street-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of them are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post smashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical moaning of the two
- Telly is in bed with the girl
The two of them are sitting up in the big bed that is raised high of the ground
Telly is naked except for a tight pair of white underwater
He is sitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart
The girl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one of her nipples is poking through
The two of them are very sweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great feeling of heat and wetness
The windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of outside traffic is circulating
There is a small fan on her dresser that is blowing from side to side
Socks, shirts, and pants are lying on her hard wood floor
The room is neat except for the clothing
large poster of the Beastie Boys hangs on the wall
She has many stuffed animals on her bed and dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the corner
Telly and the girl are looking at each other
The girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent beauty about her
You know what  want to do
Yeah
What do  want to do
You want to fuck me
But you can't fuck me
(smiling) Why
Because, you know why
You know
Because your a virgin
Because 'm a virgin and  don't want no baby
You think  want a baby
When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff
Why is that
Because  like you
think you're beautiful
think if we fucked you would love it
You wouldn't even believe it
wouldn't believe it
don't know
just think that you would love it
But,  don't know
'm just scared that things would change
Between us
What things
'm telling you, nothing's going to change
(he begins to caress her cheek and hair) want to make you happy
That's all
Telly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her
He sticks his tongue in her mouth
They kiss
(whispering) You know it won't hurt
'll be gentle
promise
(whispering) Do you care about me
(whispering) Of course  do
' As she screams in total agony
Telly and the girl are on the bed having sex
All the lights are on
This scene should look very white and bleached out, very electric and shocking
Everything should be exposed as Telly takes advantage of the virgin girl
(
) (slowly) Virgins
love 'em
No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank
No nothin
Just pure pleasure
As soon as the scene ends, so does the sound of the two having sex
Very fast, very hard-paced music accompanies the credits
The music should be strong enough to maintain the intensity of the scene, Hard-core, Punk
: -  - Telly gently shuts the door
He has a huge smile on his face
He looks down the center of the staircase and spits
He watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the floor
He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as possible
He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into the side of the wall
He is very happy
He runs down the skinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes
-  - Telly exits the building
is sitting on a middle step
He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz
Bottle of malt liquor
The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack
As he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book
Casper is Telly's second half
The two have been best friends since grade school
Casper is small and funny, everyone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't scared to fight someone twice his size
Telly provides Casper with a sense of adolescent wisdom
Casper makes Telly happy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an assortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth
Telly and Casper are always together, They help each other to survive
Telly smacks Casper on the back of his head
Casper is startled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes
Shit
(smiling) Was up bitch
Casper looks at Telly smiling
Oh shit what happened
Casper is very excited
He stands up and pulls Telly's arm
What do you think
You fucked it
Telly laughs and Casper jumps up and down
knew you fucked it
sat out her for like two hours
That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up
(pounding his chest) Who am
Who am
The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon
They both start to laugh
They move off the stairs and start walking down the sidewalk
The two of them are walking down the street, obvious to everything but themselves talking
Well, how was it
Oh my god, so good
That girl can fuck
She can fuck
Hell yeah
That bitch was bleeding
When  first put it in she screamed real loud
saw her bite down on the pillow
Oh shit
How long did it take
Did what take
How long did you fuck her
They cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars
Casper is listening to every word that Telly says
Casper seems much happier than Telly
Telly is laid-back
Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm
Well it took me longer than  thought it would take
It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it
But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour
had to keep taking it out and putting it back in
It hurts the first time
Yeah
But then when she got into it
She really got into it
It was good
How did she smell
Did her puss stink
Telly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose
Take a whiff
Casper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch
Hell's yeah
She was so clean
Oh man, that's the best
You could tell she took care of herself
She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom
Let me smell it again
Telly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor
That's why virgins are the best
love that smell
As they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by
You know what else
What
can tell that she had just entered puberty
How
Well,  was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right
Right
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something
And  said, you were cut when you were little
Yeah
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago
look younger without my makeup
Casper starts to crack up
And  looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby
Yeah
And for a second  felt a little bit guilty
You know, because she's young and all
And then  was like, oh shit, that turns me on
wanna fuck this little baby girl
They both laugh
Fuckin perverted bastard
They continue to laugh and walk
'm telling you Casper
think 'm getting addicted to that shit
To what
Virgins
Yeah
It's like all  think about now
Not just that, it's like lately during sex,  start dreaming about these complex fantasies
What do you mean
mean 'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit
You mean like fucking two virgins at once
(laughing) That would be good
But  mean more like
don't know
Like when  was having sex with her,  kept thinking how much  would like to put it in her ass
Just to see what would happen
(laughing) She's probably smash you in the fucking face
don't know about that
She was pretty into it
But  wasn't gonna try
The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow
Show 'em some respect
Did you tell her that you loved her
Like
Like
Never love
Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys
They stop walking
Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can
He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street
Shit
What do you want
Get another forty
(burps) Smoke a blunt
Are you hungry
Hell yeah
Fuckin starvin
Wait up a sec
Casper takes two steps away and starts urinating in someone's bushes
People walk by and stare
You wanna go to Paul's house
What for
That guys a dick
'm sue he's got food
He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer
You think he's got any herb
don't know, he quit dealin but 'll bet he'll smoke us out
You think
Probably
He lives on 76th
78th
Den less go Joe
He zips up his pants
They start walking again
Casper is carrying a folded up comic book in his hand
Telly
Yeah
Did she suck your dick
little bit
But  didn't really want her to
Why
don't know
That's too easy
mean getting a virgin to suck your dick
That's so easy
It is right
want to knock her guard down
mean there's a whole philosophy behind it
Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost
It's no big deal, right
Right
But when you deflower a girl, that's it
You did it
You were the one
No one else can ever do it
Yeah
The way  see it
My outlook on the this situation is
(they both start laughing) It's like getting fame, you know what 'm saying
It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first
Yep
They're gonna tell their grand kids
(mimicking an old lady) That Telly
He sure was good in the sack
The two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited
They walk in front of a Korean grocery
The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc
with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool
You thirsty
Yeah,  feel dehydrated
You got any money
Three pennies and a ball of lint
You down with the boost
(whispers) Unzip my pack, yo
He turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack
- The grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch buffet
Behind the cash register is a middle-aged
He is watching a small black and white television set
The two boys enter
Casper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer
Telly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash register
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg
Whah
Diss digg
'm curious if you have it
Whah is dissdee
Casper is going through the beer section
He pulls out two 40oz
bottles of and puts them on the floor
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg
no understand you
Maybe crazy
round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into his backpack
'll ask you one last time
Do you have diss digg
Whah you say
Dissdee
Casper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch
He said This Dick, mutha fucka
Can't you understand English
The two of them both run out the door
Telly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside
The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket
The two boys run off
The Korean man gets off his stool
He pulls his headphones off his ears
Stupy fucky boys
Fucky
He looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot that Casper previously stole from
-  - Casper and Telly are walking down the street
Casper is eating a peach and drinking his 40oz
beer
Telly is also drinking
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything
The cartoon
Yeah
"The Wonder Twins"
You know
(mimics the cartoon) Activate in the form of, a glass of water
Yeah
Well, those guys share everything, right
Right
And once  saw this episode where they pretended they were each other
Where they lived the other's life for a day
You know those guys share everything, right
Right
And it got me thinkin
How fun it would be to share each other's girl
(laughing) Yeah, that would be fun but  don't like any of the girls you go out with
Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring
No, 'm serious man
'm dead ass
Do you wanna try
We could be like the fuckin -rated "Wonder Twins"
The two of them start laughing and jumping on each other
Telly spits out a mouthful of beer
(laughing) Can you do it man
(laughing) Can  do it
just brooke her cherry
imagine  can make her do anything
Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire
Casper is jumping up and down on Telly's shoulder
Oh man
fucking love this guy
The two of them walk off laughing
'   - medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side
Cars are speeding by the front of the building
Cabs drive by and beep their horns
Telly and Casper are sitting on the front steps
Telly rings one of the buttons
The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and "Legalize Marijuana" stickers
Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it
Telly rings it again
It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies
(from box) Hello
It's me
Telly
(from box) Hello
(loudly) Paul it's Telly
Open up
buzz is heard
There is a little girl sitting on the bottom step, playing with a doll
Casper runs down and gives her a peach
Then he runs back up
Telly and Casper enter the building
The little girl tosses the peach to the ground
'   - There are about ten guys in the apartment
There is almost no furniture, just two white couches and a few plants in the corner
There is a big  in the center of the floor
Nintendo with several wires is hooked up to it
There are various games spread out
couple of boys are huddled around the game, as they watch the guy play, they breathe in the wip-it's
The boys are all young and spread out
There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its
They are all colors and sizes
Casper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake
Some people they hug
They say "Was up," to everyone
They both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers
Paul sits down besides them
What are you guys doing
Nothing
We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to
You want a wip-it
Nah
Yeah
Paul puts his hand on his big pocket and gives Casper a cartridge
Casper breathes in the wip-it and then smiles really big
love these shits
They're good for you
Vitamin  for the new generation
Paul hands Casper another cartridge
That's why  like 'em
They wake my brain up
Casper does the wip-it
, a tall black kid with dreads, walks out of the kitchen
He has a cordless phone in his hand
Casper continues to do wip-it's
One after another
So, how many people live here now
don't know, eight or nine
Where does everyone sleep
Everywhere
Fuckin flophouse
We're still short on the rent
If you want, you and Casper can move in
You guys can share the bathtub
Yo Telly
Jennie says what's up
Jennie who
Jennie
You know
That girl you boned last year
Remember
Man  haven't seen her in forever
What the fuck's she up to
'  - Five girls are sitting in a small room
They are smoking
They're all in a circle laughing
The girls are all good friends
few of them have rings in their lips and eyebrows
big dirty fish tank is on one of the bookshelves
Ruby is a nice looking girl, age 17
She is Spanish, her hair is slicked back, she chain-smokes
Jennie is a 15 year old high school sophomore
She is white
She is very pretty, with an uncommon touch of innocence about her
The next episode is going to jump-cut back and forth between Paul's apartment and Rubby's room
These scenes should be handheld
Ruby hangs up the phone
Telly says was up

That dick
You still mad at him
Of course
How am  gonna forgive him after what he did
What did he do
Ruby cuts of Jennie
He stole her virginity
He took it away and now it's gone forever
Laughter
Yeah
But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me
It's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me again
He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out
That's the kinda shit he's into
Telly is known for that stuff
He fucked Amber the same way
And Susan too
But he was all like, Oh Jennie  like you so much
Trust me you'll love it, 'm not gonna use you
promise
He was poppin mad jazz
More laughter from the group
They all speak very quickly, almost to the point where you can't understand them
First times are always wacked
Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car
That shit is nothin
remember,  had just turned 14
With this fuckin asshole who was like 18
don't even remember his name

remember he had a brother named Lentil because  would always joke and call him Lentil Bean
This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit
Oh yeah
Laughter
And we did it in the bush
Like outside around midnight

And we thought everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren't because everybody knew
And it was out on the grass somewhere
And it hurt like a motha, oh my god the pain
Laughter

Yep
Making love is like

It's like this animal instinct is taking over you
It's like
Passion
Boom
Boom
'  - Some of the guys are sitting in front of the couch doing wip-its
Casper is chewing on a microwave burrito and watching the guy next to him play Nintendo
He is blowing into the burrito
They are in the midst of a conversation
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the one thing
They expect you to be so gentle, so kind
When most of time you just wanna be all
Pounding on that shit
That would be the best if you could just be
Excuse me can  borrow your hole Miss
It'll only take a little while
'll give it right back
Laughter
But that's the thing
Girl's like it slow
They like romance
They like things to be sweet and romantic
Yep
mean 've been with a lot of girls  know
Yeah me too nigga
'  - In the midst of their conversation
You know
You know a lot of times sex gets in the way
Has that ever happened to you
Yep
You know
Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good
And then when it actually comes time for sex
It's like the worst letdown
Yep, yep
But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going
Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know
Hell yeah, they don't know
They all start laughing and clapping hands and snapping fingers
Like where are your erogenous zones
Mine
Mine are like my neck and my chest
Yeah
Mine are my toes
Oh my God if someone sucks my toes 'll come in like ten seconds
Yeah
It depends
Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house
And Smash  and  Flipper was there
Oh shit
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney
And he just pulled me over to the bed
And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco Right
And we were like underneath the sheets
We were going at it like crazy
Oh my God that shit was so good
It was like hard
Yeah
He was like sucking my tits

They all crack up
You know why  decided to go out with Alex
Why
(starts laughing) He has the best fucking fingers 've ever had
She holds up her middle two fingers and starts shaking them back and forth
Everyone is cracking up
(still laughing) was like yes
'm going out with him
That's right
That's why foreplay is better than sex
Yep
Because he can like climax you up to that
Point
Yep
Where just one more move and you would be like crazy
She snaps her fingers
Yep
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened
What the hell happened
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment
Yeah
And it takes them either too long or too short to come
Have you ever had someone that took forever To come
Yeah

Yeah
The shit gets wacked
Fifteen minutes
Yeah
Fifteen minutes to a half an hour
Hard and deep
Me

Laughter
'  - Continued talking
Casper is playing the video game
He is playing with a great deal of intensity
You know what  notice

It's like a secret pastime hobby for them
Or somethin'
Some girls
All girls
They love it
know
Casper's game finishes
(under his breath) hate this game
No
Casper's right
Girls love it
They just act like they don't in front of their friends
Yeah
But when it's just you and them
That's like the first thing they go for
Casper starts a new game
know
They love it
That's why girls live longer than guys
'Cause sperm has vitamin
'  - In the midst of their conversation
hate sucking dick
Yeah
'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging
Yeah
And then it hits that little thing
(pointing to the back of her throat) That little punch bag
What is it
The tonsils
The esophagus, whatever
Yeah
And you're not getting anything out of it
And it's like
How much more can  bob here
You know
And you don't get shit out of it
Have you ever swallowed it before
No
Me neither
have
They all laugh
It was
it was
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter
No, no, no
You can't get that taste out of your mouth
Until you eat something
Yeah
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out
It's so disgusting
Laughter
(') The only way you can get it out is like if you eat like a real meal
'  - Continuing the conversation
Telly is looking straight into the
All  know is that condoms suck
They don't work
They break
They slip off
It's impossible to feel anything
They make your dick shrink
But  still use 'em
Or at least  did once
'  - Laughter accompanies their conversation
mean
Telly is the only guy 've ever had sex with
You knew that
No
didn't know that
thought you got with
too
No, we just messed around
'  - Continued talking
That's the whole thing
You know if you look at it
mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that
And everyone's dying
And you better wear a condom or else
But the truth is
don't know any kids with
No one  know has ever died from that shit
It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes
Yep
Playing the video game
Yeah
It's a great big fraud
'  - Continued talking
've known the past of all the people 've fucked without a condom
Like  know one of the people got tested and was negative
Yeah
And  know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so  knew he was safe
Yeah
And the other person  just fucked, which was a mistake
But  went to the clinic last week with Jennie
Jennie looks embarrassed
made her get tested with me because  didn't want to go alone
Did they ask you a lot of questions
- Ruby is sitting across from a
The nurse has a clipboard in her hand
She is sitting at a small desk that is cluttered with papers and pictures of her kids
The room is decorated on shades of bright yellow
There are pictures of clowns on the wall
There is a large paper diagram on the wall that traces, step by step, the process of inserting a condom
Ruby is chewing gum and tapping her feet
She scratches her elbow
The black nurse is very overweight; she talks with a strong New York accent
She sips a coffee mug that reads " love Mom
" How old you

The room is dirty
Jennie is sitting in a chair
She looks very pretty and child-like
She is facing downward and her hair is falling into her face
Jennie speaks in a low voice
How old are you
15
- The black nurse scratches her scalp and it makes a noise
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with
Umm
Altogether
Yes
Altogether
Hmm
'd say eight, maybe nine
How many times have you gone unprotected
With four of them,  didn't use any kind of protection
Wait, maybe it was three
- The white nurse scribbles something down
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with
One
Were you protected
Pause
No
An   shot of a pencil checking the  box
- The black nurse takes a long sip from her mug
Have you ever had anal intercourse
Yes
With how many people
Umm
Three  believe
But 'm not sure
Were they wearing condoms
Uh
Yes
Twice they weren't
Two times they didn't
- The white nurse sticks her head a few inches from the fan and lets the wind blow her sweaty face
Have you ever had anal intercourse
No
- The black nurse has a big smile on her face
Okee dokey
You should come back in seven days and we should have your results
- of Jennie's face
(timidly) Thanks
- Casper and Telly run down the stairwell
People enter and exit
- Casper and Telly run down the stairs
They look around to see if there is any transit security
They simultaneously walk up to the turnstile and pull back the revolving metal guard
Then they slip through very nonchalantly
short   is playing the accordion
He is standing up and tapping his feet
He's playing "Danny Boy"
In front of his feet is a large leather briefcase with dollar bills and scattered change
Casper and Telly walk up to the Blind Guy
They watch him for a second, then Casper starts to clap with his beer in his hand
He starts to smile really big
Telly sees Casper smiling and then he begins to smile
Man, this guy is really good
He looks like my uncle
Casper looks at the money collection
bet he makes hella money
train comes speeding by
Casper walks next to the Blind Guy and starts dancing really funny

Big sofas and chairs
table is in the middle of the floor, magazines and pocketbooks
water jug is in the corner
ceiling fan is circling fast up above
An assortment of men and women of different races and colors
They look mainly middle class
Jennie and Ruby are the youngest people in the room
man in a three-piece suit slowly walks by
Jennie tries to see his face but he is turned the wrong way
Ruby continues to talk
The same fat black nurse walks out with a clipboard
She begins to cough tremendously
don't know,  think he's mad at me, but who cares
Ruby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse
She is coughing uncontrollably
She looks like a large shaking figure
skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing
The black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery
She turns and looks at Ruby
Woowee
It must have been something  ate
(coughs then smiles) Ruby, follow me
Ruby stands up and looks at Jennie
Ruby crosses both her fingers and raises them in the air
Wish me luck
Good luck
Ruby follows the black nurse
This should be one long shot, as Ruby follows the nurse through the hectic testing clinic
The two of them enter the same room as before
- The skinny white nurse picks up a folder with Jennie's name on it
She opens the door to the waiting room and looks at Jennie sitting down with her eyes closed
Jennie
Jennie stands up and smiles
She walks towards the door
- Ruby is sitting down in a chair
The black nurse picks up a file from the back of the door
She opens it and smiles
(cough, pause) Well, girl
You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections
Yes
You're clean
Oh my God
can't tell you how nervous 've been
couldn't sleep last night
Now you gotta be careful
The black nurse pulls out a bunch of pamphlets
Here take these pamphlets home and read them
- Jennie is standing up
She is hugging herself
The white nurse is sitting down at her desk
The nurse looks real closely at the folder and then shuts it
Jennie
You've tested positive for the  infection
What
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate
You should
tested positive
'm sorry
But  only had sex with Telly
The nurse is quiet
just got tested to keep Ruby company
- Telly and Casper are sitting side by side
Casper is holding a 40oz
bottle of beer
The train is semi-crowded; all seats are taken and there are a few people standing up
The train shakes
They are headed downtown
Casper and Telly are looking at the couple directly across from them
They are two unattractive lower-class Spanish people, they are holding hands and kissing
wanna fuck Darcy
Who
Darcy
Benny's little sister
Oh
You like her
Yeah
like her
've wanted to get with her for a while now
Darcy
Yeah
She's so little, so pretty, and innocent
Yeah
She's only 13
It's funny
Last weekend at that block party
Remember
Yeah
She was handing out those watermelon slices
And  sat down over on the other side, And  watched her
(excited) Yeah
watched her eat the watermelon
And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt
(smiling) Yeah
And after about two seconds,  got the biggest hard-on
Casper starts laughing
'm not joking
wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there
At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection
know what you mean
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin
She hangs out at Nasa
She promotes for them
'm gonna fuck her tonight
swear to God 'm gonna fuck her
(laughing) How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day
That shits gotta be against the law
don't care motha fucka
'll bet you money she fucks me
Bet
The two of them shake hands
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing
Get zooted
guess so
gotta stop off home too
At this point the sound of the subway door is heard
black man with no legs pushes himself through with his hands
He has a large container filled with change
As he enters, his cup of change is heard smashing back and forth
His face is even with people's knees
random few stuff change and dollar bills into his cup
He sings as he pushes his way through the cat
He has an afro pick sticking out the back of his head
He is wearing a shirt that says "  ' "
(singing) have no legs
have no legs
have no legs
have no legs
As he pushes his way closer, Casper starts checking his all his pockets
When he gets about three feet away, Casper stands up and throws some pennies into his cup
He sits back down next to Telly
The legless man stops and smiles at Casper
Thank you
God bless you
Yeah
Bless you back
The legless man makes his way into the next car
don't understand why you do that
Why  do what
That
Why  give pennies
Yeah
Why you give money
Did you look at that guy
What the fuck
He had no legs
(motions to his waist) He had no half his lower body
He's gotta shit out of his ribcage
That's just it
It's elitist
It's reverse elitism
Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up
notice what you do
What are you talking about
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards
You give them money
But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by
So
So
These people live on the same streets
It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up
The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks
So
You never know when you can end up like that
Right
'll tell you why
Because when  was little,  had a fat cousin, cousin Luke
And he used to make fun of the handicapped
And one day he had a bad stomachache
So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off
Shut up
'm telling you the truth
And after that, 've always givin' my money to retards
Because that's the reverse of what he did
Telly is laughing
So really, it's good luck
Good luck
Yeah, good luck
mean what the fuck
The guy had no legs
They both laugh
- Ruby and Jennie are squeezed into a telephone booth
They are on a busy street
People are walking by the cars are in a standstill gridlock
It is very loud outside
Everyone is beeping their horns and screaming out windows
Ruby looks very dazed and confused
Jennie is nervous and shaky
Jennie picks up the phone and puts it to her ear
She searches her pockets for a quarter and comes up empty
She begins shaking her hands back and forth
Ruby
Do you have a quarter
Ruby hands her a quarter
Jennie dials her house
(into phone) Peter, is Mom there
No,  need to speak to Mommy
Peter where's Mommy
No,  can't talk to you right now
Yeah

look just tell her
No never mind
Go watch television
She hangs up the phone and starts to cry
Ruby puts her arm around Jennie
Shh

That's it
'm gonna have to tell my little brother, 'm gonna die
can't make him his lunches anymore
Come on
Don't cry
We'll work it out

man with a beeper walks up and taps on the phone booth
You usin the phone

Don't go anywhere
Stay with me

Jennie squeezes by Ruby and pushes open the door to the booth
'm coming
No

Ruby grabs Jennie's arm and Jennie pulls away
Jennie starts walking and wiping the tears out of her eyes
Jen
Jennie looks back at Ruby and then starts running down the street
(screaming) Jennie
Jennie is running down the street full speed
She is passing all the people on the sidewalk
Then she darts across the street and through the traffic
Some people stare
She continues to run as the  follows her for a full block
She bumps into people and pushes them away
'  - Telly and Casper walk up to the house
Telly lives in a flat on St
Marks; downtown
Two Spanish hoodlums are sitting on the front steps
Telly and Casper walk up and slap their hands
Casper looks for some place to hide his beer
One of the hoodlums puts his hand out and Casper gives it to him
Telly opens the door with his key and Casper follows close behind
They walk straight to the end of the hallway and enter
Telly's house is cluttered
The house is nice but organized
The kitchen has pots and pans hanging from the ceiling
There is a Matisse poster hanging in a frame
Large bookshelves filled to the gills with books
Big plush couches in the living room, a rocking chair in the corner
small wooden piano
scattered game of Monopoly is on the dinning room table, a few cats roam the house
On the wall are pictures of Telly as a young boy, and large family portraits
Telly and Casper walk into the living room, then enter the kitchen
Telly's mom is in the kitchen breast-feeding a small baby
She has her hair pulled back and her breast out
There is a small television set on the kitchen counter that she is watching
Hi mom
Hi Telly
Where you been
Hi
Hi Casper
Telly goes to the refrigerator and takes out a big jug of Kool-Aid
Casper gets the glasses down from the cabinet
We were out trying to find a job
Pouring the Kool-Aid
Any luck
No none
So, what are you gonna do for money this summer
don't know
Find a job
(pause) Hey can  borrow some money
Casper is staring at Telly's mom as she breast-feeds
Sorry
Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job
But then  won't need your money
That's right
Casper is staring at Telly's mom's breast
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big
Yeah
Telly walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs, Casper slowly staggers behind
As they walk up the stairs, Telly pulls his shirt off and wipes his underarms and chest
Casper pulls Telly's arm
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties
Shut the fuck up
The two of them enter Telly's parents room
' '  - The bedroom is messy
There are clothes lying on the bed and floor
There is an exercise bike in the corner
Museum posters are on the wall
Tampons on the dresser
Casper follows Telly into the bedroom
Telly sticks his head out the door to make sure his mother isn't coming
Casper picks up a tampon and starts playing with it
Telly opens his mother's shoe closet
All her shoes hand from a big wooden door
He goes directly to a pair of black dress pumps
He pulls out the shoes and puts them under his arm, then he puts his hand in the shot slot and pulls out a pair of shoulder pads with a rubber band rapped around them
He pulls off the rubber brand, and in between the shoulder pads is a small wad of cash
He takes out the cash and sits on the bed counting it
Casper is pushing the tampon back and forth inside the plastic shell
How do these things work
Telly is counting the cash
Twent, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty
Casper is looking at himself in the mirror
How much you gonna take
don't know
How much do you want
Casper is looking at teeth in the mirror
About ten
Fifteen is good
Fifteen for me
He puts fifteen dollars in his back pocket
Ten for you
Casper is scrapping his teeth with the tampon while looking in the mirror
Telly stands up and hands Casper the ten dollars
Caper puts the money in his back pocket
Telly picks up his mother's shoulder pads and puts the remaining cash between them
He stuffs the shoulder pads into the shoe slot
He picks up his mother's black pumps and puts them into the slot
He shuts the door
Telly picks up his shirt and walks out of the room
Casper throws the tampon into the trash and follows Telly
'  - His room is a total mess, worse than imaginable
His clothes, the furniture, piles of porno magazines and science books, are all covered with candy wrappers and potato chip bags
His television is on a scrambled station
He has one big poster of Albert Einstein on his wall
He has a water bed
He has a few small plants next to his windowsill
There is a cat sleeping next to his bed
Get the fuck out of here cat
Telly kicks the cat out his door
Casper shuts the door
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight
Yeah probably
Telly picks up the small spray bottle used for watering plants, he begins to spray his face and chest
Yo, you got any weed around here
Naw
But we should run by the park and get a dime
Maybe Darcy will be at the park
Casper is sitting on the water bed, he is pumping one of Telly's small ten pound dumbbells
Yo
'm gonna get buff dude
You are
Yeah
The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me 'd look good with muscles
Casper is pumping and making faces
'm gonna get mad diesel
'm gonna fuck any nigga that tries to step to me
Telly is wiping his body off with a towel from the floor
He sniffs his arms and then picks up a stick of deodorant and applies it
You want some
Casper is still pumping
Nah
Why not
You stink
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach
like my odor
It's fuckin natural
The  stays on Casper while he continues to pump his dumbbell and look at his arm
'  - Mom is watching a soap opera on television
The baby is in a small rocker on the counter
She is rocking it back and forth with one hand while smoking a cigarette
Mom
Shh

When are you gonna be back
Not too late
Four-thirty in the morning
Not too late
Casper and Telly walk to the door
Hey Mom

Just a few bucks
If  had it, maybe
But right now  don't have a penny to my name
All right
Casper waves good-bye
Bye
Casper and Telly leave
Telly slams the door behind him
The baby wakes up and starts to cry
Shit
'   - Jennie walks up the stairs to Paul's apartment
She takes her finger down the list of names
She rings his bell
Paul sounds really messed up
(from the speaker, laughter and noise) Hello
Hello Paul

(laughing) Is Telly there

little white girl is sitting on the bottom stair, playing with a black doll
The doll has no hair and it's dress is ripped
She looks up at Jennie
My dolly is black
Lucy
The girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it
- Casper and Telly are standing by the chess tables
The park is very busy
Every chess table is being used
People are riding bikes and roller-blading
Strong men are doing pull-ups on the monkey bars while guys walk by with ghetto blasters
state of public frenzy
Rastafarian drug dealer with a big dread cap is standing a little bit away from Telly and Casper
He is approaching everyone as they walk by him
(fast and slurred) Sess
Smoke, hash, shrooms, valium, coke

Another guy trying to sell drugs walks up, but Ras just pushes him away
Telly pulls the money out of his back pocket
Ras pulls out a dime bag and pushes it open
He looks around and then puts it in Casper's face
Fucking good skunk
Smells delicious
Casper starts to laugh
Telly goes to hand the drug dealer the money
Ras looks around to make sure it's safe
Throw it down
He points to the floor; then throws the weed on the ground
Telly drops two five dollar bills
Thanks Ras
Caspa
Ras laughs
The two of them slap hands
Ras slaps Telly's hand and walks away
-    - The park is extremely crowded
The kids hang out in front of the arch by the fountain and around the sides
There are about ten kids skateboarding
The fountain is on and the mist is spraying the kids
Girls in hip-hop fashion are lined up all around
few kids are drawing graffiti in little black books
There are maybe twenty kids hanging out around the fountain, in front of the arch
Casper and Telly walk up to the center of the action
They greet their friends sitting on the edge of the fountain
Skateboarders ride up and slap their hands
As they greet their friends, they kiss the girls on the cheek and a few of them on the lips, they slap hands with the guys and embrace some with a hug
Telly and Casper go down the line, greeting everyone
This process takes a while, as they interact with everyone down the line
is a skinny black skateboarder with a funny face
He rides up to Casper and hugs him
Casper

Yo Cass, you got any boom
Telly is sitting on the cement benches talking to , a pretty young girl with a belly button pierce
Yep
You got a Phillie
Presto
Hamilton pulls out a long Phillie cigar
Then he squeezes in between Casper and another guy
Casper pulls out his dime bag and sniffs it
The he puts it in front of Hamilton's nose
You got that here in the park
Yep
Break that shit up
Casper is smushing the pot up
Hamilton is taking the plastic of the cigar
In this shot they go through the complete process of rolling a blunt
The next sequence should be done with fast edits
Cut it
Hamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long thumbnail
Scrape it
He then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto the ground
Lick it
He then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp
Dump it
Casper starts putting the weed inside, Hamilton licks it, then pulls out a lighter and dries it
And smoke it
Hamilton puts it in his mouth
You wanna start off
Hamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face
Naw, you got it Ham
Hamilton smiles
All right
He puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it
big flame shoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie
Hamilton takes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away
Take two pulls and pass
Hamilton passes the blunt to Casper
bunch of kids start huddling around Casper as he puffs
, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks up
Yo can  fuck wit dat
Casper smiles and blows smoke in his face
Yeah boy
Casper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits
Two male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands
Steven turns his head and notices them
He exhales the smoke out of his nose
Look at that
That shit is sick
Fuckin faggots
(screaming at the top of his lungs) Fuckin faggots
Everyone starts laughing
(as loud as possible) Faggots
Casper rubs his throat
People continue to laugh
My throat
Telly is sitting away on the cement benches under the tree
He is talking to Misha
How can you hang out with Casper
He's such a jerk
You think so
Yeah
've always hated that kid
He used to eat glue in like seventh grade
He still does
hate 'em
It's not his fault
He had a hard life
Yeah
You've heard the stories right
No
- Back in time
Casper is a little boy, age 11
He is walking down the sidewalk with a lunch box and a "Casper the Friendly Ghost" -shirt
He is wearing his hat on backwards
Music accompanies this entire episode
(
) Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home
Casper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter
He pulls out a key and opens the door
He enters his home
'  - The house is dark
Plastic on all the furniture
velvet picture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway
Very simple and plain, a generic adobe
Casper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch
(
) So he walks into his house and hears some strange noises
The sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs
' (screaming from upstairs) Get away
Get away
Help
You monster
Please help
Casper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair to listen to his mother's screams
(
) The noises were coming from upstairs
In his parents room
Casper's mom continues to scream from upstairs
(
) So, this freaked the hell out of Casper
He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do
Casper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen
(
) So he ran and got a big knife
The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with
He opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife
He picks it up, and it shines on his face
As his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand
' (screaming from upstairs) Stop
Please stop
Oooh help
Casper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out
(
) So he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble
It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed
Like someone was kicking her in the head
Casper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents room
What he sees is very shocking
His face becomes extremely animated
Casper's mom is on the bed
She is completely naked except for a pair of bright red high heel shoes
In between her legs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask and motorcycle boots
He is having sex with Casper's mom
He has her arms pinned down on the bed
He is grunting like a pig
Casper watches for a moment in awe
Bitch
You fuckin bitch
Fuckin bitch
Slutty whore
The man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass
' (screaming) No
Stop
Get off me
She is struggling to get loose
(
) So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother
What a sight for an 11 year old kid
Casper runs up to the bed
He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother
And they don't even notice Casper at first
(
) And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed
And for a second he just looks and watches
Casper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over
His mother is kicking and trying to stop him
All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out
(
) And you know
Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her
So he started stabbing this guy, over and over
But it was a mistake
Casper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man
Casper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man
The man falls off the bed and onto the floor
Casper's mom is going totally nuts
She is completely naked, with blood all over her body
There is blood all over the sheets
His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics
' You fuck
It's your father
We were playing a game you fuck
That's your father
We were just playing
Casper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother
He has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his -shirt and cheek
Casper's mom continues to yell at him
' Casper, you fucker
Oh, my god
Help me God
Casper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on the floor
He bends down and takes off the mask
It's his father
(calmly) That's my dad
' (crying) You fuck
You killed your father
(
) So Casper killed his father
He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops
It was a very embarrassing thing
-     - Telly is in the same spot talking to Misha
So that's why Casper is how he is
Oh god
That's horrible
quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his friends
Yep
Holy shi
That's all true
No
was just kidding
(outraged) What
lied
His dad is still alive
He works for the post office
-    - Casper and all his friends are passing around the blunt, which by now is almost gone
All that is left is a roach and Casper is sucking on it really hard
Casper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to Hamilton
Yo, that weed is mad good
Hamilton gets ready to puff
Hells yeah
Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic
Casper rubs his eyes
Hamilton puffs on the little roach
Casper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it
He starts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks
The other kids continue to smoke
They watch Casper and laugh
Casper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned that he just falls off
As he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any attention to where he's going
tall  with gold front teeth is walking by
He is wearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband
He is biting down on a chew stick
The hoodlum walks by
He has a certain ominous strut
He is looking at the ground as he walks
He takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by
He makes a little noise with his mouth
As the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention
He rolls into the hoodlum's heels
Casper falls down and laughs
Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha
Casper jumps up and grabs his skateboard
The hoodlum is turned around
Casper walks up to him with a smile
Yo, sorry money
The hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper
He puts his arms out like he's upset
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate
You know what 'm saying
(smiling) Yeah, watch where you walk dukes
What
Nuffin
Just forget it
What the fuck yo
You wanna catch a beat down
Casper throws his skateboard down
He quickly turns around and pulls his pants up
He runs right up to the hoodlum and he looks up at him
Sup then
Sup
Come on bitch
Throw your fists up
- Telly and Misha are watching
Telly stands up
Uh oh
Casper's in the mix
He quickly walks up
- All the guys jump up and start screaming
Oh shit
Throw down
Steven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum
They all start screaming taunts
"Fuck 'em up Casper
" Casper is inches from the hoodlum
They are both in a fighting stance
Casper keeps pulling his pants up
Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world
Sup
Sup
Come on nigga
Sup, sup then
Stop faking moves
'm gonna fuck you up bitch
They are both right about to swing
Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head
huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees
Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can
Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum
They're all screaming
Even the girls are screaming
"Fuck 'em up
" Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard
Hitting him on the legs and stomach
Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head
(everytime he kicks the guy he says this) Suck my dick
Suck my dick
Suck my dick
All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over
The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him
The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders
How much they are enjoying this
They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey
This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum
Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy
Telly looks up to the sky
He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus
Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum
His face is completely cracked and bloody
Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face
Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face
Suck my dick, Suck my dick
Suck my dick
Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him
He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead
Casper bends over, right in his face
(smiling) Now get in my way
Bitch

The taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh

(he punches the roof of the cab) was lonesome
missed him
So  got a tattoo
He pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his forearm
It says "Bruno" in big letters
Now how do you like that
Now he's with me forever
The light turns and he starts driving
swear to God
Sometimes he barks
can hear him straight off my arm
Ruff, ruff, he goes
Yeah
Yeah
'm not saying you should get a tattoo
But you should make yourself happy
What if you can't make yourself happy
What if everything falls apart
Well then,  don't know
You know what you do then
You forget
Block it out
remember when  was a little boy
My grandmother told me to be happy
She said
She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson
If you want to be happy don't think
Don't bump into any walls
If you stutter
Don't talk" And  took her advice
And look at me now
Couldn't be happier
He starts to laugh
quick shot of his identification badge
He has a really goofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt
That's life
Jennie is smiling
Your a real philosopher
Yeah
was gonna write a book but  can't spell
He pulls up on Washington Square Park
He slams on the brakes and turns around in his seat
Well here we are, Miss
Jennie pulls some money out
Aw, don't worry 'bout it
The rides on me
Jennie has the money up to the glass
All right, all right, 'll take it
But forget about the tip
He takes her money
Thanks
Bye
The taxi driver sticks his head out the window
Oh yeah
Oh Miss
Miss
When you smile, God notices
That's why the sun is shining
He points up to the sky before pulling away
-   - Telly is standing in the road in front of Darcy's apartment building
Casper, Harold, Steven, and two other girls named  and  are all leaning against and sitting on a parked car
Casper and Steven both have a quart of malt liquor in their hands
Telly is looking straight up
He puts his hands together and raises them to his mouth
(screaming) Darcy
(pause) Darcy
Bennie, a skinny 18 year old, sticks his chest out the window
He's chewing on an apple and not wearing a shirt
He looks down at Telly (yelling) Hey Bennie
What's up
Bennie is munching on his apple
Nuffin

Everyone starts laughing
Telly pulls the beer our of Casper's hand and starts chugging it

Telly hands the bottle back to Casper
Yo, you think we killed that guy

But all  know is that  kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken

Casper slaps hands with Harold
Darcy walks out of her apartment building
She is wearing a bikini top with baggy denim jean shorts
Her hair is pushed back and she has a backpack on
As she walks out of the building, Telly's eyes light up
Ready
Telly walks up to Darcy and kisses her on the cheek
You look nice
- Jennie is standing under the arch
She is looking for Telly
Misha is sitting on the fountain talking to some guy
Jennie walks up to Misha
Hey girl was up
Jennie kisses Misha on the cheek
Just a lot of crazy shit

Speaking of stupid shit
Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid

Why you lookin for him
You like him now or sometin
Jennie just looks at Misha
- The pool is closed
Large black gates surround the premises
All the kids are climbing up the gates
Casper is the first one to the top and just jumps over
Eventually everyone follows
They all walk up to the pool and start taking their clothes off
Casper pulls his shirt and pants off
He looks over at Kim, who is wearing -string underwear
Geez Kim
Your body looks fuckin good
Thanks
It's funny how sometimes you can't tell if a girl has a nice body until you see her without her clothes
Kim smiles
Harold starts imitating a strong man
He starts flexing his muscles
He's wearing a pair of baggy boxer shorts
Then he turns to Joy
Hey Joy
You ever see a black man's lasso
What
Harold pulls out his penis and starts twirling it around
She starts jumping up and down
Everyone is cracking up
Harold has his dick in his hand
Hi ho Silver and away
Harold jumps in
Steven pushes Casper in and Casper takes Steven with him
Joy and Kim jump in together
Oh shit it's fuckin cold
They start splashing each other
Darcy and Telly walk over to the other side and sit down on the edge of the pool with their feet in the water
Telly starts smiling at Darcy
He cups a little bit of water in his hands and pours it on her thigh
Everyone else is in the water making noise and splashing around
Ooh
You're gonna give me goose bumps
Is it cold
Darcy puts some water in her hand and does the same thing
You know 've been thinking about you lately
(surprised) You have
Yeah
After  saw you last week
At the block party
Yeah
Darcy smiles
She looks a little bit embarrassed
was lookin for you all day today
You were
Sure
even thought about you when  woke up
quick three second flashback of him having sex earlier that day with the young virgin girl
It's very loud as she screams
was like
gotta find Darcy
Where is she at
was lookin all over
Darcy smiles
Joy and Kim are sitting next to each other on the steps in the shallow end of the pool
Steven, Harold, and Casper are in the water in front of the girls
Joy and Kim are both wearing bras
'll give you a dollar if you let me suck on your tit
Kim kicks water in his face
No 'm serious
Can  suck your tit
Either of you guys
don't care
Yeah me too
Casper, why do you think  would let you suck on my boobs
don't know
Your just sitting there
And your tits look clean to me
It makes me  want to suck on 'em
Telly is sitting in the same spot, talking to Darcy
thought you had a girlfriend
Naw
'm not seeing anybody
What about you
No
can't
My mom won't let me have boyfriends
She won't
Why not
don't know
guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15
She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me
Yeah
can understand that
Back to the shallow end with Casper, Steven, Harold, Kim, and Joy
truth or dare you guys to kiss each other
Sure
We kiss all the time
They both smile at each other and kiss softly on the lips
As they part, they smile
You guys are dykes right
No
No
Then how can you kiss each other like that
Harold makes a strange face
Yeah
How can you do that shit
It doesn't matter
It just feels good
That's all
Yeah
It's not like we're gay
It's just kissing another person, a friend
Joy grabs Kim's hand
Yeah
It's no big deal
don't know
just never seen girls that did that shit before
But  think it looks nice
Yeah
Do it again
Telly and Darcy
You should come back with me to Steven's house
Tonight

His parents are away
It's gonna be a bug out

She looks at him
Come on
It'll be fun
We'll just bug  out
There should be a bunch of people
It'll be fun  promise
Yeah
Yeah
It'll be nice
It'll be a change of pace
That club shit gets boring
-  - This is the line to Nasa
People are lined up and down the block waiting to get inside
All the kids are wearing rave clothing which resembles clown suits with stack shoes and huge colorful hats
It looks like a hip-hop circus
Jennie is walking quickly past everyone on line
She comes to the front
, a short gay Chinese boy with orange hair, is carrying a clipboard guest list under his arm and has a Sesame Street purse in his other hand
When he sees Jennie, he walks up and unclips the rope
Jennie
Was up girl
Sid bends over and gives Jennie a kiss
Hi Sid
After Jennie walks in, Sid reclips the rope
Jennie walks up the stairs and past the security guards and metal detectors
Hi Jennie
Jennie smiles and walks by
Nasa is like a giant warehouse
It has hallways and rooms
Kids invade every inch of the club
As Jennie walks in, the Techno music grows very loud
The music should sound as if you were stuck in a fast-paced video game
Kids are running around everywhere
The  follows Jennie through the club as if it is seeing everything Jennie sees
The dance floor is packed with kids holding flashlights and sucking on pacifiers
As she walks through the darkened hallways, people are against the walls making out
As she gets to the end of the hallway, there is a big crowd of people
She jumps to see what everyone is looking at
, a short white guy who is very hyper and speaks very quickly, runs up to Jennie and grabs her wrist
Jennie, Jennie
How do you feel
Fine Fidget
What's all this
Oh man
You gotta see this
It's a spectacle
real spectacle
Fidget pulls Jennie through the crowd
Now look at that
Amazing sexual exploration
There are three girls and one boy making out against the back wall
The boy is wearing an afro wig
They all have their clothes on, but they are all going at it like crazy
Two of the girls are making out with each other while they rub the boy
The other girl is kissing the boy while he is feeling on her body
Jennie looks surprised
The other kids are laughing and yelling at them
One of the girls making out looks at the crowd and sticks her tongue out
You don't have to look at us
It's not a free show
She continues making out
Everyone laughs
The music is loud and adds to the intensity of the scene
Who are they
don't know
've never seen any of them before
Cornballs from Jersey on
Feelin the effex
Fidget looks at Jennie, she looks depressed
Come on Jennie
Jen
He pulls her by the wrist
He takes her into the bathroom
In the bathroom there are kids in big circles smoking pot and buying pills
got a present for you
He digs in his pocket
What is it
Bang up stuff
He pulls out a pill
This makes Special  look weak
It's a euphoric blockbuster
No, Fidget,
Come on Jennie
You look sad
Just take it
No
Here
Swallow
He puts the pill in her mouth, and she reluctantly takes it
Now you'll be floatin up in Techno heaven
Don't worry, tricks are for kids
'  - Steven's house
It's a big mess
Almost no furniture except for a ratty couch and a television set
Hip-hop music is playing
There are about 15 kids in total, mainly boys
Everyone is running around and drinking
Some kid is throwing water balloons out the window
Another kid is jumping off the couch and trying to put footprints on the ceiling
Another boy is urinating into a plant in the corner of the kitchen
There are a bunch of boys and girls on the ground lying on top of each other laughing
Everyone is smoking and drinking
chubby girl with braces is talking to Casper
She is drunk
Hey Casper
Why do they call you Casper
'Cause Casper is my name
But that's not your real name
No one's name is Casper
Damn bitch
That's my name
Why do you always ask me the same shit
Why don't you go lose some fucking weight
Harold is in the corner with one shoe off
He is sitting next to a pretty oriental girl
He is holding a beer in his hand
Come on
Let me kiss you
She turns her head
Just let me kiss you
Lemme kiss your neck
You look pretty
He starts pulling her head, she is resisting
Come on
Just one kiss

He starts kissing her neck and chin

- The car is very dark
Jennie is in the backseat, scooted all the way in the corner
It is silent except for the sound of the bumpy ride
Everything is silent for a while as Jennie looks more and more upset
She has a quart in her hand
(silently as she looks out the window) 'm not gonna die
Jennie sheds a few tears and then wipes them off with the hand she is holding the beer with
'  - The lights are all almost out in Steven's apartment
Music is still playing
Everyone is either making out or passed out
The chubby girl is watching television and eating potato chips

- Jennie is drinking a beer in the backseat of the taxi
She looks upset
' '  - The bedroom is very neat and orderly
Telly walks in and immediately turns off all the lights
He turns on the small light by the bed
It casts a dim glow
He turns around and pushes her against the door
He starts kissing her really hard
She is responding but a bit slow and shy

Jennie runs out of the bathroom
(to himself) What are you worried about for him
' '  - All the blankets are off the bed
The room is lit only by the lamp next to the bed
Darcy and Telly are under the covers having sex
Darcy looks like she's in a considerable amount of pain
The two of them are breathing loudly in unison
The door next to the bed creaks open
Jennie looks through the crack
- Jennie is looking at Telly having sex
- The headboard is smacking back and forth
Darcy is moaning
That's it
You're doin fine
Come on Darcy
That's it
He looks up at the door and notices someone is watching
Shut the fucking door
Jennie slams the door shut
Telly continues having sex with Darcy
- Jennie is weak and crying
She runs to the empty couch and continues to cry
She puts her feet against her chest like a little baby
She continues to cry
Everyone else is asleep
The  watches her crying on the couch
The sound of her crying mixes with the scream of Telly having an orgasm
When it fades back in, everybody is asleep
It is completely quiet
The television is on fuzz
People are sleeping on top of each other
Jennie is asleep on the couch
Even Steven's cat is asleep in front of a small fan on the kitchen table
The house is completely quiet
- Casper is awake
He climbs out of the tub and steps over Hamilton's legs
He looks at Hamilton asleep on the toilet
Then Casper bends over and flushes it
It makes a loud noise but Hamilton doesn't budge
- Casper stumbles out of the bathroom
He walks into the living room and looks around at everyone
Casper walks into the kitchen
There are a bunch of empty quart bottles lying on the butcher block
He picks one up and twirls it around, but it's empty
Then he picks up another one and drinks the remaining fuzz
little bit of fuzz runs down his cheeks
Casper walks back into the living room
He walks over to where Harold is asleep and just looks at him for a second
Then Casper walks down the hallway to the door in front of Steven's parent's bedroom
He opens the door wide and looks at the two, both naked and asleep in each other's arm
(to himself) Lucky fuckin bastard
Casper shuts the door
He walks back through the hallway and into the living room
When he gets in the living room, he looks around, then he flops down beside Jennie on the couch
He puts his hands down his pants and starts itching
Casper looks beside his feet and sees Steven sleeping with his head on top of Kim's stomach
Casper continues to scratch his balls
Then he looks over beside him at Jennie scrunched up asleep
Casper looks around to see if anyone is awake in the room
Everybody is asleep
He scoots up close to Jennie and looks at her
Casper nudges her shoulder
(whispering) Jennie
Jennie
Jennie does not respond
As Casper takes his hand off her shoulder, he gently rubs her breasts
He moves his hand down her stomach and gently between her thighs
He caresses her
She does not feel anything
Casper bends over and puts his face by her ear
(whispering) Jennie
Please wake up
It's me Casper
Jennie
She does not respond
Casper starts kissing Jennie's ear
She swats her shoulder
Casper gets up and looks at her
He stares at her stomach and crotch
He puts his hands on her jeans and then he undoes her belt
He is very careful not to make any abrupt movements
As he unclips her jeans he watches her face to see if there is any kind of response
(whispering) Jennie
Don't worry
It's me Casper
He slowly pulls her pants down
She is wearing teddy bear underwear
Casper throws her pants to the ground and then he looks at her legs
With his fingertips he starts caressing her soft skin
Then he gets off the couch and onto his knees
He puts one leg on his shoulder and the other on the couch
He looks at her and then pulls her panties off
Casper quickly undoes his pants and gets in betwen her legs
He puts her hands around his shoulders
Jennie is sort of coming to but she has no energy
She makes some noise but she is passed out and powerless
Her eyes are closed the whole time
She is not aware of what is happening
(slurred and unconscious) Don't
Please don't
No
No
Casper starts situating himself
She is totally limp
Shh
Don't worry Jennie
It's me Casper
Casper has his knees on the floor as he takes advantage of Jennie
Jennie moves her arms a little bit
Casper is breathing fast and heavy
As the scene ends in blackness, the sound of Casper's heavy breathing persists
Then it slowly fades out and everything is silent
- The birds are chirping
People are going to work
Stores are opening
Homeless people are just waking up from doorway slumber
Morning in Manhattan
As Telly does his
, the  will show everyone asleep in the apartment
It will go all around the room as daylight enters through the windows
The  also watches Telly and Darcy asleep in each other's arm's
(
) When you're young
Not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When your young
lot of the time fucking is all you have, hen you go to sleep at night, you dream of pussy
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's in your face, in your dreams, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young, the only place to go is inside
That's just it
Fucking is what  love
Take that away from me, and  really got nothin
The  focuses on Casper
He is sitting up awake on the couch
All his clothes are off
He looks straight into the
Jesus Christ
What happened
