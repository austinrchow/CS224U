by Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman adapted from the book by Susan Orlean September 24, 1999 Second Draft - Endless barren landscape
No sign of life
The atmosphere is hazy, toxic-looking
Volcanoes erupt
Meteors bombard
Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water
Silence
- : , , Beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace
few birthday cards on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son on His Fortieth Birthday
" Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the room
His incantational voice-over carpets the scene
(
) am old
am fat
am bald
My toenails have turned strange
am repulsive
How repulsive
don't know for  suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder
am fat, but am as fat as  think
My therapist says no, but people lie
believe others call me Fatty behind my back
Or Fatso
Or, facetiously, Slim
But  also believe this is simply my own perverted form of self-aggrandizement, that no one really talks about me at all
What possible interest is an old, bald, fat man to anyone
am repulsive
have never lived
blame myself
-- 29 - lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland
As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection
Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve
It's followed closely by an old green Ford
:   29, , - John Laroche drives
He's a skinny man with no front teeth
The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk
Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the seat next to Laroche
() 2
: It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing
Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing by
Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road turn-off
The cassette case flies from the seat and half- buries itself in an open bag of peat
- Nirvana blasts
Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead
Laroche is asleep at the wheel
Crazy White Man is now Drowsy White Man
They share a stoned laugh
- :  , Late night street
The click-click of typing
We move slowly up the building to the only glowing window
(
) (wistful) John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome despite the fact that he is missing all his front teeth
In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types
- We glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and come to rest on a woman typing
It's Susan Orlean: pale, delicate and blond
We lose ourselves in her melancholy beauty
She turns to the camera and talks to us
() 3
: Two years ago  went to Florida to meet Laroche after reading a small article about a white man and three Seminole men arrested with rare orchids they'd stolen out of a place called the
'  - - Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp
He sees the white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license plate on the Ford
He pulls over down the road, and whispers into his
We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the swamp
'm on Janes Scenic Drive just east of Logging Road Twelve
repeat, Indians in the swamp
Tony waits for a response
Nothing
(cont'd) Indians in the swamp
Nothing still
Tony clears his throat into the radio
don't know what you want me to say
Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks
If there are Indians in the swamp, they are in there for a reason
No response
Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches the vehicles through binoculars
Nothing
He straightens his cap
Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips
- Kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with Valerie, an attractive woman in wire-rim glasses
They pick at salads
Kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her breasts
She looks up at him
He blanches, looks away
(
) 'm old
'm bald
'm repulsive
We think you're just great
() 4
: (with studied modesty) Oh, thank you
Valerie absently rubs her nose
Kaufman self-consciously rubs his nose in response
And we're thrilled you're interested
Valerie rubs her nose again
Kaufman pulls at his nostril
rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead
Valerie watches it
Kaufman sees her watching it
She sees him seeing her watching it
She looks at her salad
He quickly swabs
Oh, thanks, wow
That's nice to hear
You have a really unique voice
Well, thanks
That's
appreciate that
Very talented
Really
Thanks
Thank you
Thanks
(looking up) So -- Kaufman's brow is dripping again
He smiles, embarrassed
Sort of hot in here
(kindly) Yeah, it is a bit
So, why don't you tell me your thoughts on this crazy little project of ours
In one motion, Kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag
First,  think it's a great book
() 5
: (2) Laroche is a fun character, isn't he
Kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling
There's a smiling author photo of Susan Orlean on the inside back cover
And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating
Plus her musings on Florida, orchid poaching
Indians
Great, sprawling New Yorker stuff
'd want to remain true to that, let the movie exist rather than be artificially plot driven
Okay, great, great
guess 'm not exactly sure what that means
Oh
Well
'm not sure exactly yet either
So
y'know, it's
Oh
Okay
Great
So, um, what -- It's just,  don't want to compromise by making it a Hollywood product
An orchid heist movie
Or changing the orchids into poppies and turning it into a movie about drug running
'know
Oh, of course
We agree
Definitely
Or cramming in sex, or car chases, or guns
Or characters learning profound life lessons
Or characters growing or characters changing or characters learning to like each other or characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end
'know
Movie shit
Kaufman is sweating like crazy now
Valerie is quiet for a moment
See, we thought maybe Susan Orlean and Laroche could fall in love during the course of -- () 6
: (3) Alienated journalist writes about passionate backwoods guy and he teaches her to love
mean, it didn't happen, it wouldn't happen
It's Hollywood
- : , , The office is decorated with potted flowers, Audobon posters, lots of books
Kaufman, nervous and sweaty, watches Margaret, a soulful development executive, unpack boxes
So anyway  just wanted to stop by to congratulate you on your promotion
Well, thanks again
It's all so stupid
think it's great
Your photo in the trades and everything
Pretty cool
Anyway
Yeah
So what's up with you
'm considering jobs
Mostly crap
There's one you might like, about flowers
Flowers
Really
What is it
They want me to do an adaptation of a book called The Orchid Thief
Oh my God
You're kidding
read that
loved that book
Kaufman is thrilled; he's scored
Margaret pulls a copy of The Orchid Thief from her bookshelf
(cont'd) See, see, see
'm not lying to you
loved the book
() 7
: Oh, Charlie, orchids are the most amazing flowers
So complex
Margaret plops onto the couch next to Kaufman
know
They're really great
You should take this job
Doesn't it sound exciting, to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything about it
Blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower
And after you learn all this stuff, you can teach me
(thrilled but controlled) That'd be fun
God, they're such beautiful flowers
And so sexy
'know
(whispering) Did you know that orchid means -- Testicle
just read that
(shrieks with delight) Testicle
Can you believe it
Margaret giggles happily
Kaufman giggles weirdly
(cont'd) swear, it'd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie, man
Instead of this bullshit all the time
Something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories, people learning profound lessons
Jesus, isn't nature enough
- Hot, dirty, miserable
Laroche leads the Indians through waist-high black water
He points out a turtle on a rock
() 8
: Pseudemys floridana
Did you fellas know you fellas believe the world rests on the back of a turtle
Not you fellas specifically
Although, maybe you fellas specifically
That  can't speak to
The Indians ignore him
They trudge
Laroche spots something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree
He stops, circles the tree
His eyes widen in reverent awe
(cont'd) Polyrrhiza Lindenii
ghost
The Indians come around
Laroche stares at a single beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree
He tenderly caresses the petals
Then, business-like: (cont'd) Cut it down, Russell
Russell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree
- Kaufman still sweats as he talks to Valerie
plus  love the idea of learning all about orchids
really admire those guys who know everything about ants or fungus or whatever
'd like to be more like that
See,  tend to write self- involved, self-loathing
even masturbatory stuff
And it's wonderful, by the way
Thanks
That's nice to hear
But  need to challenge myself as a writer
've arrived at an age where  want to think about the world in a different way
Adapting someone else's work is certainly an opportunity to think differently
() 9
: Yes
And  welcome the challenge of taking a small subject, like orchids, something that would never draw people into a theater and making that fascinating
want to show people heaven in a wildflower
As Blake wrote
(1972) - :  , - serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium, studying the inhabitants
He turns to his frumpy mother, who's been following at a respectful distance
Any one at all, ma
She nods sweetly
The boy returns to his search
He stops at a small turtle in an aquarium
(cont'd) want this then
(hugging him) wonderful choice
And spiritually significant
Did you know that Native Americans believe the whole world rests on the back of a turtle
Cool
can't wait to tell the guys
- As Laroche supervises, Randy, Russell, and Vinson saw through tree branches supporting lovely flowering orchids
They unceremoniously stuff the flowers into bulging pillowcases
- Kaufman eats with Margaret
Margaret raises a glass
To a fucking awesome assignment, man
Kaufman, pleased, clicks glasses
He takes a breath
Hey, 'm going to an orchid show Sunday
For research
Maybe you'll come
() 10
: Absolutely
think David, this guy 'm seeing, would enjoy it, too
He's a real naturalist
Okay if he comes along
(covering heartbreak) Yeah, of course
Sure
He wants to meet you anyway
All  do is tell him how great you are
Oh, thanks
That's nice to hear
You'll like him
He's so honest and smart
It's rare to find someone in this town who thinks about things other than this fucking business, y'know
Yeah
That's great
He sounds great
Like the other day we were in bed discussing Hegel
Hegel
In bed
It was fucking amazing
Have you read much
'know, a long time ago
bit
'know
Well, anyway, David and  were discussing his Philosophy of History and  was
The entrees arrive
(cont'd) struck by his notion that history is a human construct
Kaufman begins the laborious task of getting through his plate of food
He can no longer look up at Margaret
Yeah
that nature doesn't exist historically, but rather cyclically
() () 11
: (2) (cont'd) So whereas human history spirals forward, building upon itself, nature
- Kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf, carries them to the register, along with a book on Hegel, which features an engraving of the philosopher on the cover
Kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him
He studies their interaction, the way she looks at him
Her eyes, her lips
The guy leaves and the cashier waves Kaufman over
As she rings him up, she expresses no interest in him
He's hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm
She catches him, pulls down her sleeve
- Tony waits, sweaty and mosquito bitten
The radio crackles
How's that Injun round-up going, Tony
Fuck you, Barry, you fuckin'
Rustling near the parked cars
Tony tenses
Laroche steps from the swamp with the Indians, who haul the pillowcases
(cont'd) We got poachers
(into the radio, pleased) We got fuckin' poachers, Barry
Ha
Tony jumps into the truck and turns it around
'  - Orlean types
Her delicate fingers move with a pianist's grace across the computer keyboard
(
) Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation
- :  , An overturned boat and uprooted orchids float on the river
(
) The Victorian-era orchid hunter William Arnold drowned on a collecting expedition
12
- : man lies at the bottom of a cliff, clutching a flower
(
) Schroeder fell to his death
- : man lies face down near an unplucked orchid
(
) Endres was shot dead in Rio Hacha
- : An emaciated, limping, wheezing man with a makeshift bandage wrapped around his head, docks his boat
(
) Augustus Margary survived toothache, rheumatism, pleurisy, and dysentery
Someone steps from behind a bush, stabs him, steals his boat
(
) (cont'd) only to be murdered when he completed his mission and traveled beyond Bhamo
The murderer sails down river
(
) (cont'd) Laroche loved orchids but  came to believe he loved the difficulty and fatality of getting them almost as much as he loved the orchids themselves
- Tony steps out of his truck
Laroche smiles warmly
Morning
May  ask what you gentlemen have in those pillowcases
Yes, sir, you absolutely may
() 13
: Laroche goes back to directing the Indians
Tony's confused
Okay, 'm asking then
Oh, Okay then
Let's see
(peeking in bags) Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia, nine orchid varieties
About a hundred and thirty plants all told, which my colleagues have removed from the swamp
You're aware that it's illegal to remove plants or animals from state owned land
And don't forget these plants are all endangered, sir
Every one of them
Exactly
Well, that's exactly the issue
This is a state preserve
Yes, sir, it is
(afterthought) Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole Indians
Did  mention that
You're familiar, 'm sure, with the State of Florida v
James
Billie
Tony nods, even though he has no idea
(cont'd) So you know that even though Seminole Chief Billie killed a Florida panther, one of, what, forty in the entire world
Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation
They give it
(cont'd) The state couldn't successfully prosecute him
Because he's an Indian and it's his right
As repugnant as you or  as white conservationists might find his actions
But -- () 14
: (2) Not to mention the failed attempts on three separate occasions to prosecute Seminoles for poaching palm fronds, which,  believe, they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional chickee huts
Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation
He's right
That's exactly what we use them for
Chickee huts
Tony looks at the Indians
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, but  don't
can't let you fellas go yet
Just hold on while
(into radio) Hey, Barry, can  get some help
Barry
- We watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport parking lot, onto the freeway, past congestion and billboards
Her mournful face glows beautifully, dramatically with golden sunlight
She talks to us
Nothing in Florida seems hard or permanent
The developed places are just little clearings in the jungle, but the jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything is always growing or expanding
At the same time, the wilderness disappears before your eyes
Orlean gets quiet
Her eyes tear
- : , , () 15
: Lush color
seven year old girl is gleeful as her parents push her on a swing
She watches from the air as her mother and father, deeply in love, kiss between pushes
-  - Kaufman gets out of his car with his books
Two teenage girls walk by
Kaufman watches as one whispers to the other
He thinks he hears the word "Fatso
" The girls giggle
- Kaufman passes a hall mirror, regards himself glumly, and climbs the stairs
(
) am fat
am repulsive
cannot bear my own reflection
At the landing Kaufman comes upon Donald, his identical twin brother, on his back in pajama bottoms, opening a gift box
Did you open your present from mom yet
What's with you
My back
Kaufman nods vaguely, continues down the hall
Donald pulls a purple sweater from the box, calls after Kaufman
(cont'd) Hey, Charles, you'll be glad,  have a plan to get me out of your house pronto
job is a plan
Is your plan a job
(big build up) 'm gonna be a screenwriter
Like you
Kaufman doesn't respond, enters his bedroom
(cont'd) know you think this is just one of my get-rich-quick schemes
But 'm doing it right this time
'm taking a seminar
16
- Kaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor
(
) It's only five hundred bucks
(muffled by pillow) Screenwriting seminars are bullshit
Kaufman pulls a copy of Variety, open to a photo of Margaret, from under his pillow
He gets lost in the picture
(
) In theory  agree with you
But this one is highly regarded within the industry
Donald, don't say "industry
" Donald, now in the sweater, appears on all fours in the doorway
Kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow
'm sorry,  forgot
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting
People from all over come to study his method
'll pay you back, man
As soon as  sell -- Let me explain something to you
Yeah, okay
Anybody who says he's got "the answer" is going to attract desperate people
Be it in the world of religion -- (indicating his back) just need to lie down while you explain this to me
Sorry
apologize
(lies down, stares at ceiling) Okay, go ahead
Sorry
Okay
Go
There are no rules to follow, Donald, and anybody who says there are, is just -- () 17
: Not rules, principles
McKee writes: " rule says, you must do it this way principle says, this works
and has through all remembered time
" The script 'm starting, it's about flowers
No one's ever done a movie about flowers before
So, there're no guidelines, and that's good because -- What about Flowers for Algernon
That's not about flowers
And it's not a movie
Oh, okay,  never saw it
Go ahead
My point is, those teachers are dangerous if your goal is to do something new
And a writer should always have that goal
Writing is a journey into the unknown
It's not building a model airplane
Donald stares at the ceiling, fuming
Kaufman waits
Getting no no response, he pulls out his Hegel book and reads: (
) Each being is, because posited, an op- posited, a conditional and conditioning, the Understanding completes these its limitations by positing the opposite
Kaufman's head is spinning
He puts the book down
Both brothers stare at the ceiling
Donald finally speaks McKee is a former Fulbright scholar
Are you a former Fulbright scholar, Charles
(1972) - The young boy eats with his family
His father wears a backbrace, his sister is weak and anemic
Only his sweet mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly
() 18
: Turtles are of the order Testudine
Really
Testudine
Yeah
And they're found on every continent
Except Antarptica
Antarctica
Every continent, huh
Uh-huh
The turtle shell has remained unchanged for two hundred million years
And there's all different kinds, Pelusio gabonensis, Phyrnops rufipes, Chitra indica, Dermochelys coriacea coriacea
- Ranger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the van and Ford
Lots of sweating, uniformed people
The pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black plastic sheets
guy sprinkles water on them
Laroche enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the flowers
The Indians lean against their car, bored and smoking
Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window
and what we have here, my friend, is thirteen Encyclia Cochleata
four Encyclia Tampensis -- 'm sorry, Encyclia what
(pointing to each) Coch-le-ata
Tem-pen-sis
(checks Owen's spelling) Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum Nocturnum
very good haul
Two Catopsi Floribunda
Three Polyrrhiza Lindenii, the ghost orchid
What really came for
These sweeties grow nowhere in the
except in your swamp
That true
Boy, you really know your plants, Mr
Laroche
() 19
: Yeah
do
'm one of the world's foremost experts
But that'll all be revealed at the hearing
- Kaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading an orchid book
Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie and reading a copy of Story by Robert McKee
(
) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with
Kaufman, bored, looks over at Donald, whose cheeks are stuffed with food
(
) The most memorable, fascinating characters tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire
Although these characters are unaware of their subconscious need
Maybe you should watch what you eat, Donald
Did you ever consider maybe you're a bit fat
Does it ever occur to you, you kind of represent me in the world
That people look at you and think, he's Charlie's twin, therefore that's what Charlie must look like
By the way, mom's paying for the seminar
Did you even hear what  said
Yeah
Anyway
pitched mom my screenplay -- Jesus, don't say "pitch
" Sorry
Anyway, she loved my
telling of my story to her
She said it's like "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Psycho
" () 20
: Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate
hear she's really good with structure
You think you're so superior, Charles
Well, 'm really gonna write this
And you'll see
And, and
you suck, okay
The two glare at each other
They go back to their books
(
) Florida is a landscape of transition
(
) Do not proliferate characters; do not multiply locations
Rather than hopscotching through time, space, and people, discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and world
- Orlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into swampland
She talks to us
Florida is a landscape of transition and mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and orderliness, nature and artifice
She brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind her small, pretty ear
We linger on the ear, which grows pink with sunlight
Orlean catches us and smiles shyly
- Kaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road 29 along a Florida road map
He turns to his typewriter, and types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style
(
) We open on State Road 29
lonely stretch of road cutting through untamed swampland
Suddenly a beat-up white van barrels around a curve
It's driver: a skinny man with no front teeth
- The proceedings are in progress
Orlean hurries in, sits in the back
() 21
: Laroche, in a Miami Hurricanes cap, wrap-around Mylar sunglasses, and a Hawaiian shirt, is on the stand
Alan Lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him
Finally, Mr
Laroche, what is your experience in the area of horticulture
Okay, 've been a professional horticulturist for twelve years
've owned a plant nursery of my own which was destroyed by the hurricane
'm a professional plant lecturer
've given at least sixty lectures on the cultivation of plants
'm a published author, both in magazine and book form
have extensive experience with orchids, and the asexual micropropagation of orchids under aseptic cultures
This is laboratory work, not at all like your nursery work
(grins) 'm probably the smartest person  know
Thank you
You're very welcome
- As she rings up his books, Kaufman admires the cashier's flower tattoo
She catches him and smiles with red, wet, pierced lips
She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast with a heart tattoo
sweet heartbeat turns to knocking
- Kaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door
What
The door opens
Donald stands there for a moment in shadows
Look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what
Go away
God damn it
() 22
: (lost) 'know, 'm just trying to do something
Kaufman squints at his brother, sits up, waits
(') Hey, thanks a lot, man
Cool
(flicks on light, then in pitch mode:) Okay, there's this serial killer, right -- Kaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face
(') No, wait
See, he's being hunted by a cop
And he's taunting the cop, right
Sending clues who his next victim is
He's already holding her hostage in his creepy basement
So the cop gets obsessed with figuring out her identity, and in the process he falls in love with her
Even though he's never even met her
She becomes, like, the unattainable, like the Holy Grail
(through a blanket) It's a little obvious, don't you think
Okay, but there's a twist
See, we find out the killer suffers from multiple personality disorder
Okay
See, he's really also the cop and the girl
All of them
It's all him
Isn't that crazy
Donald waits, proud
Kaufman pulls off the covers
Look, the only idea more overused than serial killers, is multiple personality
On top of that you explore the notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person
See every cop movie ever made for other examples of this
Mom called it psychologically taut
() 23
: (2) The other thing is, there's no way to write this
Did you consider that mean, how exactly would you show a character holding himself hostage
Trick photography
Okay, that's not what 'm asking
What 'm asking is in the reality of this movie, if there's only one character, right
Okay
How could you
What exactly would the scene
How
Donald waits blankly
Kaufman gives up, gets out of bed, dresses
(cont'd) agree with mom
Very taut
Sybil meets
dunno, something very taut
Kaufman exits
- Orlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the tribe's business operations
They're all smoking intently
They're gonna fucking crucify me
'll go into the Fakahatchee with a chainsaw
swear to God
Buster, for crying out loud,  reminded her the Indians used to own Fakahatchee
Look, we'll deal with all this at trial
Buster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away
Vinson shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster
Lerner and Laroche stand there a moment
Lerner walks off
Laroche cracks his neck
charmingly shy Orlean approaches
Mr
Laroche
Orlean smiles, apologetic for the intrusion
() 24
: (') My name's Susan Orlean, 'm a writer for the New Yorker
It's a maga -- 'm familiar with the New Yorker
The New Yorker, yes, the New Yorker
Right
Right
So  was interested in doing a piece about your situation down here
Laroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test: Yeah
Put this in:  don't care what goes on here
'm right, and 'll take this all the way to the Supreme Court
That judge can screw herself
Orlean scribbles on her pad
Laroche twists his head to see that she's writing "Judge can screw herself
" (cont'd) That for real would go in
Orlean nods
Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean
- : lush, profound orchestral piece
glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic time-lapse
We slowly, lovingly circle the flower
The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family of perennial plants with one fertile stamen and a three petalled flower
In most orchid species, one petal is enlarged into a lip and is the most conspicuous part of the flower
- Kaufman, in a booth, reads his orchid book, takes notes
(
) The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient
He's bored, looks up, watches a waitress with glorious, orange hair, pouty lips, soulful eyes, and a voluptuous form turning slowly around, scanning her station
() 25
: She sees Kaufman, approaches, and smiles warmly down at him
Her badge reads: Alice, Arcadia,
Kaufman sweats
So what looks good today
Um
Hi
Thank you
The key lime pie, please
small slice
'm watching my
And a coffee, please
Skim milk
(sees book) Orchids
absolutely love orchids
He goes blank
Yes
They're really great
He flinches at his response
small awkward pause
So, 'll be right back with your pie
She smiles warmly again and leaves
Kaufman is humiliated
- Alice the waitress and Kaufman walk hand-in-hand, inspecting sexy orchids together
She smiles warmly at him
( love you) absolutely love orchids
- Kaufman finishes jerking off
He lies lonely in the dark
- Dark and muted
The seven year old girl is pushed on the swing by her father
From the air she sees her mother, tiny and lost, sitting across the yard smoking
- Orlean leans against a car and smokes
tiny, lost figure
There's a honk
Orlean snaps out of her reverie to see Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van
() 26
: (to camera) few days after the hearing, Laroche took me to an orchid show in Miami
She opens the passenger door
(cont'd) Hi
Thanks for picking -- want you to know this van is a piece of shit
When  hit the jackpot, 'll buy myself an awesome car, maybe an Aurora
Orlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit
(cont'd) Sit on top of that
You won't hurt it
She situates herself on the seat
Laroche lurches off
- Laroche drives manically
Orlean watches the road and holds one hand against the dashboard
The thing you gotta know is my whole life is looking for a goddamn profitable plant
And that's the ghost
Why the ghost orchid
The sucker's rare
Collectors covet what is not available
'm the only one in the world who knows how to cultivate it
He looks at her and smiles
Orlean smiles back and indicates, with a small jerk of the head, that he might want to watch the road
He doesn't take the hint
(cont'd) The plan was, get the Indians to pull it from the swamp
researched it
As long as  don't touch the plants, Florida can't touch us
Then 'd clone hundreds of them babies in my lab, sell 'em, and make the Seminoles a shitload of change
() 27
: In handwriting made jerky by the bouncing van, Orlean writes "shitload of change" on her notepad
(cont'd) And  stop future poaching by making the flowers readily available in stores
Then  give a big speech at the trial about how the legislature should get rid of loopholes smart people like me can find
'm a hero
The flowers are saved
Laroche and nature win

Hunters in the Fakahatchee hauled out thousands of orchids in horse-drawn flatbed carts
The camera swoops down, close to the men
As it does, the image transforms
It turns to color, the men become mannequins, the horse becomes papier-mache: it's a display
live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids in the cardboard cart
- Kaufman drives slowly past Barnes and Noble, squints in the window, sees the tattooed cashier
He passes Burger King, sees a pretty employee, the same at Starbucks
Glassed-in women on display, different types, different attitudes
Kaufman stops in front of the California Pizza Kitchen
Alice and her orange hair glow through the window
He hesitates, then drives off
- Kaufman sits on the floor and types
(
) beautiful orange orchid blooms in time- lapse -- Donald enters
Kaufman ignores him, continues typing
Donald dawdles, picks up The Orchid Thief, flips through it
() 28
: (
) (cont'd) The camera circles it, revealing how lovely and perfect and sweet and inviting and delicate and
Cool
What do you want, Donald
Nothing
just read about that Swamp Ape that supposedly lives in the swamp
Like bigfoot
You should put that in your script, like, killing people or something
That'd be very, very cool
Why are you in here now
Nothing,  was just
Oh, one thing, need a cool way to kill people
Don't worry
For my script
Ha ha
Kaufman stares at Donald, rubs his eyes, then: Um, okay, killer's a literature professor who cuts off little chunks of his victims' bodies until they die
He'd be known in the tabloids as "The Deconstructionist
" That's kinda good
like that
See,  was kidding, Donald
Oh, okay
Sorry
You got me
Heh-heh
Do you mind if  use it, though
'  (1972) - There are now many turtles in aquariums
Many turtle books and posters
The boy, in a turtle -shirt, looks out the window into the darkness
His eyes are troubled
29
(1972) - The boy comes downstairs
His father, in his backbrace, watches ; his sister lies on the couch, semi-conscious, more pale than before
His mother pats the girl's head with a damp cloth
There's a little Hindu altar with candles
(praying softly) For certain is death for the born/And certain is birth for the dead/Therefore over the inevitable/Thou shouldst not grieve
Sweet, sweet Diane
The boy surveys the sad scene
His mother looks up, smiles
(') slice of pie for my turtle expert
The boy beams with pride, then gets solemn
Mom, there's something  feel  have to do
don't know how to do this, but feel in my stomach that  have to
What do you have to do, honey
Collect one of every turtle in the world
(beat) It's a long list, ma
Cuora galbinifrons, Graptemys versa, Callagur borneoensis, all the Galapagos species, people think there's only one, but that's hardly the case
Cycloderma frenatum, Cuora pani
(sighs) don't think my life is worth living if can't do this
The boy and his mother look at each other
Well, we'd better get started, huh, baby
The boy nods his head solemnly
- Laroche drives, solemnly nodding his head
Orlean studies him for a moment, her sad eyes wet and glistening
() 30
: Wow, that's some story
So how many turtles did you end up collecting
(matter-of-fact) Oh,  lost interest right after that
Oh
dropped turtles when  fell in love with Ice Age fossils
Learned everything about them
Collected the shit out of 'em
Fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking world
'know
They drive in silence
Orlean watches a flying heron
(') Then fossils were over when  found lapidary, which  just adored
Okay, now what is lap -- Ditched lapidary for resilvering old mirrors
Did that with my mom for a while
We had the largest collection of 19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet
Perhaps you read about us
Mirror World October '88
have a copy somewhere
Laroche fishes through junk as he drives
So, did you ever miss the turtles
The only thing that made you ten year old life worth living
'll tell you a story
once fell deeply, profoundly in love with tropical fish
had sixty goddamn fish tanks in my house
'd skin-dive to find just the right ones
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus
You name it
Then one day say, fuck fish
renounce fish
() () 31
: (2) (cont'd) vow to never set foot in the ocean again, that's how much fuck fish
That was seventeen years ago and  have never since stuck so much as a toe into that ocean
And  love the ocean
(beat) But why
(shrugs) Done with fish
'  - Kaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist
So -- 'm still obsessed with that girl
The Burger King girl
Dimples and sparkly eyes
California Pizza Kitchen
Oh
Red hair and nice
Likes orchids
Yeah
She's really nice
feel pretty certain she likes me maybe
So do you think you'll talk to this one
- Kaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching Alice
He tenses as she comes up to him
She smiles warmly
Hi
Hey
Some key lime pie for ya today
() 32
: (thrilled she remembered) Okay, yeah
That sounds great
Yeah
'll pick you out an extra large piece
Preferred customer
She winks at him
He's so in love
Thank you
That's really sweet of you
Still reading about orchids,  hope
Yes,  am, in fact
Beautiful flowers
friend of mine has a pretty little pink one, grows right on a tree branch
That's what's called an epiphyte
(pointing at him excitedly) Right
Boy, you know your stuff, huh
Not really
'm just learning
Epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not parasites
They get all their nourishment from the air and rain
Well, 'm impressed
That's great
Awkward pause
There are more than thirty thousand kinds of orchids in the world
Wow, that's a lot, huh
Okay, then, so 'll be right back with a nice big slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert
He beams
She smiles and turns to leave
Kaufman blurts: () 33
: (2) But, so, anyway,  was also wondering
Alice turns back, still smiling
(cont'd) 'm going up to this orchid show on Saturday in Santa Barbara and  -- Alice's smile slips away
Her warmth dissipates
Oh, um, well -- 'm sorry
apologize
'm sorry
(nodding) So 'll be right back with your pie then
He nods, watches Alice walk away and say something to another waitress
The other waitress looks over at him
He sweats
(
) am fat
am old
am repulsive
The other waitress brings his pie
He smiles a thank you
- Orlean sits at her desk and talks to us
There are more than thirty thousand known orchid species
One species looks like a German shepherd
- Kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts, past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign
He tries to study the flowers
They are dull
He forces himself to look
(
) one looks like an onion, one looks like an octopus
One looks
Kaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women: all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing
() 34
: (
) (cont'd) like a school teacher, one looks like a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern beauty queen, one looks like a New York intellectual with whom you'd do the Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed
One looks like that girl in high school with creamy skin
One has eyes that dance
One has eyes that contain the sadness of the world
He is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind
(
) (cont'd) Nothing in science can account for the way some people feel about orchids
Those love them, love them madly
One by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm
Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers
- Teenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp
He carries a camera on a tripod
They spot a beautiful flower
Laroche is in awe
Encyclia tempensis
The butterfly
Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower
His mother almost cries at the flower's beauty
"You will find something more in woods than in books
Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters
" Saint Bernard said that
That's pretty, ma
Diane would've loved this flower, Johnny
Maybe somehow she can see it
'know
(beat) So
after this one how many, honey
() 35
: Laroche snaps the photo, makes a check in his notebook
Only one hundred and seventeen more
And you have to have a photo of every single type of orchid in Florida
have to, ma
You know that
She smiles at him, rubs his neck
'  - Kaufman talks to the therapist
'm successful, right
mean,  could say to a woman, 'm a screenwriter and she'd look at me differently
could get laid
But  want someone to like me
For me
'know
The way  like them
The way 'd do anything for that woman walking down the street
million women walking down the street
don't need to know what their jobs are
No one will ever love me like that
Like  love almost every woman  see
Kaufman glances down at his therapist's breasts
He does it fast and unintentionally
He quickly shifts back to her face
His therapist wraps her shawl around her
- Crowded with orchid lovers
Noisy chatter and calliope music
Elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel, plastic clowns, and a booth that looks like a circus big top
Once you get the sickness, it takes over your life
started out just photographing 'em
Now look at me
(dramatic pause) It'll happen to you
You'll see

Darwin wrote about this one
Charles Darwin
Evolution guy
Hello
(annoyed) know who Darwin is
- depressed Kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever increasing pile of books: books about turtles, mirror resilvering, tropical fish, Hegel, etc
He picks up The Portable Darwin
The cover features a daguerreotype of Darwin
Kaufman paces and reads
-  - : , Sepia
sickly Darwin writes at his desk
(
) Therefore  should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed
- Kaufman looks off into space, thinking
Silence
Suddenly, he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal
Okay, opening of movie
Four billion years ago
Life has not begun
Endless, barren terrain
Silence
Silence
- Blasting music
Crowds
Laroche shows the flower to Orlean
See that nectary all the way down there
Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it
Everyone thought he was a loon
Then, sure enough, they found this moth with a twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means nose, by the way -- and -- () 37
: know what proboscis means
Every one of these flowers has a specific relationship with the insect that pollinates it
There's an orchid that looks exactly like this particular insect
So the bug humps the flower and gets covered with its pollen
Thusly
Laroche mimes humping
get it
That's called pseudo-copulation
These flowers are smart
You gotta fall in love with them
Once you learn anything about orchids, you'll devote your life to learning everything about them
Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals, staring deep into nectaries
People jabber passionately, people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants
Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array of colors and shapes, but remains detached
- Orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board
She can't find a way in
She looks over at her husband reading
He smiles at her
She smiles back, but there's a terrible distance between them
She looks at us sadly
wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants but it isn't part of my constitution
Orlean stares out the window at the empty street below plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze
She inhales
(cont'd) suppose  do have one unembarrassed passion
(beat, looks back at us) want to know how it feels to care about something passionately
38
- The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself
From high up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house, her father in a window at the other end
Both stare blankly in opposite directions
The swing completes it's arc and the girl descends, losing sight of her parents
- Kaufman types furiously
He's a sweaty mess
(
) then, after the entire history of life on the planet, in the last seconds of the montage, we see the whole of human history: tool-making, hunting, farming, war, lust, religion, self-consciousness
Yearning
Then, bam
cut to Susan Orlean writing a book about orchids
And the story begins
It's perfect
It's circular
It's everything
He reads back what he's written

McKee is a genius
And hilarious
He just comes up with these great jokes, and everyone laughs
But he's serious, too
You'd love him
He's all for originality, just like you
But he says, we have to realize we all write in a genre, so we must find originality within that genre
See, it turns out there hasn't been a new genre since Fellini invented the mockumentary
(sadly, quietly) You and  share the same
Is there anything more lonely than that
'  - Orlean eats a silent dinner with her husband
You want to do something tonight
() 39
: should work
've got stuff
He nods
She smiles, picks up her dish, puts it in the sink
'  - Orlean looks at the photo of Laroche, sits sadly for a moment, then types
(
) Laroche is an optimist
That is, he sees a profitable outcome in every situation
When he was a young man he worked in construction
- :  , younger Laroche, in a hard hat, walks atop a half-built house
He spots a flower in a backyard across the street
(pleased with himself) Asclepiadaceae
From thirty yards
Yes
He loses his footing, falls two storeys, lands on his back
- Laroche talks
Orlean takes notes
(laughing) broke my back
Exactly how my dad did
Isn't that a psycho coincidence
(far away) 'know, the way  see it, we're a family of ailments and pain
(suddenly excited
) But, anyway, it was a godsend
Laroche scarfs his pie
Orlean watches him
(
) Laroche once spilled toxic pesticide into a cut on his hand
It resulted in permanent heart and liver damage
Most people would consider this a terrible accident
Laroche considered it a success
40
- prim woman reads a magazine article by Laroche entitled, "Would You Die For Your Plants
" There's a smiling photo of a frail, emaciated Laroche next to his byline
(
) because he sold an article about it

Orlean takes notes

Laroche wears a cumbersome back brace
The camera flashes

His hand is covered with loose hairs
He whines

() 41
: People started coming out of the woodwork, to ask me stuff, to admire my plants, to admire me
- Lots of lonely-looking customers admiring orchids
Laroche is in the midst of them, happily chatting with whomever approaches him
One guy pulls Laroche aside

Sure

Orlean looks out at the dark night
() 42
: believe some folks'd call me up to talk and just talk because they were lonely
Orlean looks at him
After a long silence, Laroche muses: (cont'd) You know why  love plants
Because they're so mutable, so adaptable
Adaptation is such a profound process
(beat) Adaptation means you figure out how to survive in the world
People aren't too good at that sometimes
'  - Kaufman sits with his agent Jerry in a glass-walled office
don't know how to adapt this should've just stuck with my own stuff
don't know why  thought  could -- See her
fucked her up the ass
Jerry waves at a passing beauty
She waves back, keeps walking
Kaufman follows the girl's ass with his eyes
Just kidding
Hey, maybe  can help
What's the problem, buddy
Kaufman looks at Jerry
Will he accept help from an agent
It's about flowers
It's not only about flowers
It's got that crazy plant nut guy
He's funny, right
Kaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping, reads: "There is not nearly enough of him to fill a book," blah blah blah, so Orlean "digresses in long passes" blah blah blah "no narrative really unites these passages
" Blah blah blah blah blah

It's that sprawling New Yorker shit
Jerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by
Oh man
'd fuck her up the ass
There's no story
The book has no story
So make one up
The book's a jumping off point
No one in town can make up a crazy story like you
You're the king
didn't want to do that this time
It's someone else's material

Anyway,  wanted to grow as a writer, do something profound and simple
Show people how amazing flowers are
Are they amazing
don't know
think they are

Jumble of images: Laroche talking, flowers, Indians, Orlean, the trial
The rapid fire click-click of typing
(
) Okay, okay, we open with Laroche
He's funny
Okay, he says, okay, he says, love to mutate plants, he says, mutation is fun
Okay, we show flowers and, okay, we have to have the court case
Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, was mutated as baby, that's why 'm so smart
that's funny
Okay we open at the beginning of time

Enthusiastic off-screen typing
Kaufman peers through the darkness at the books, papers coffee cups, and dirty plates all around

It's dark, tangled with foliage, and foreboding
Two pioneers slog waist-high through the water
Alligators regard them menacingly

But  wasn't gonna give them a conventional little potted-plant place
So  came up with the "ghost" plan was gonna give them something amazing
- Kaufman, beer in hand, stands off in the corner of a room crowded with young Hollywood types
He talks nervously to a pretty young woman see, Laroche researched it and found that Indians have the legal right to take endangered plants off state lands
What an amazing opening
So then it's a courtroom drama
Few Good Men
And all those Indian rights issues are so complex
There are valid arguments on both sides
mean we took their land
We gave them smallpox
Well, actually, there wasn't much of a trial
Florida got 'em on a technicality, about cutting down non- endangered trees
Even the Indians aren't allowed to do that
They all plead no contest
Laroche got fined five hundred bucks and banned from the Fakahatchee for six months

So, like, then what happens
Nothing much

Ranger Mike Owen answers
Charlie
It's Kaufman standing there
(tremulous) Yes
Hi
- The sky is overcast
Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool swamp, which is completely dry
The two men walk easily on peaty ground
Kaufman, slathered with sun screen and covered head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing, tries to be interested in Owen's lecture
So the whole ecosystem is six thousand years old
Five to six thousand years old
About that
Five or six
Okay
Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all the cyrpess strands, probably in the world
don't know of any cypress strand bigger
It's about twenty miles long, or nineteen, nineteen to twenty, nineteen
and right here it's about five miles wide, four and a half, five
So, again, it's twenty miles long, three to five miles wide
And over here -- - Mike Owen holds a handful of peat
Kaufman looks at it
The oldest carbon dating they've done on any of the peat out here is fifty-seven hundred years
That's with carbon-14
() () 53
: (cont'd) That's in the right age where you can really date things accurately with carbon- 14, because it's half-life is fifty-five hundred years, so they must have found have of it gone and figured that
Why isn't it wet
Orlean wrote about wading through black, corrosive water
She said it was the scariest experience of her life
And when  spoke to you on the phone, you said wear heavy boots, long pants and
There's usually water
We've been going through a bit of a drought

That's a good movie about protecting nature
It shows there could be something important in a rain forest we don't even know about, like a cure for cancer
It's not even hot
was expecting it to be awful
Sun beating down, wading through water, looking out for snakes, wild hogs
was thinking it would be dramatic
Alligators
Something
The alligators are over by the lakes
The temperature's a blessing for us
This time of year can get uncomfortably hot
(pointing excitedly) Green anole
Florida's most common
Kaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard hanging on a tree
Mike Owen jots it down in his notebook
(cont'd) try to keep a log of sightings
- Mike Owen drives
Kaufman stares out the window at boring trees
(
) It had been a hard day and  hadn't seen what 'd come to see
Maybe the ghost orchid was a ghost after all
() () 54
: (
) (cont'd) There are certainly ghosts in the Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were murdered years ago by illegal plume hunters, and of loggers who were cut to pieces in fights, and for years there has been an apparition wandering the swamp, the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven feet tall and seven hundred pounds and have the physique of a human, the posture of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk
- Kaufman and Owen stand by Kaufman's car
What Laroche did was wrong
Those flowers belong to all of us, all 250 million of us -- 250
think it's up to 270 now -- And belonging to all of us means they belong to none of us
Nobody has a right to take them
Not me, not you, not John Laroche, not
Kaufman is desperate for something else
He blurts: Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a legendary creature called a Swamp Ape
Have you ever heard stories or -- (pissy) Tourist garbage
don't know why people need to invent silly creatures to make nature fascinating
Isn't nature amazing enough
(shamed) just asked because she mentioned it
- Orlean, still dirty from the swamp, holds a phone to her ear and talks to us
She has cute little dirt smudges on her face
That night  called Laroche
(into phone) didn't see anything but bare roots
() () 55
: (cont'd) And  had this thought
Maybe the ghost orchid only blooms in the minds of people who've walked too long in the swamp
'  - Orlean types
It's pouring and sheets of rain beat against her window
She glances at her husband, across the room reading a book
She sighs, continues typing
(
) What  didn't say to him is that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach
- Kaufman drives down a Florida strip-malled highway
He passes a Barnes and Noble, a Burger King, a Starbucks
He parks in front of a California Pizza Kitchen
() - Kaufman watches the waitresses
One approaches his booth
Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa,
She smiles at Kaufman as she looks right through him
- morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief
(
) What  didn't say to him was that life seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach
Kaufman is deeply moved
He hi-lites the passage, then looks at the smiling photo of Orlean
He finds himself lost in it
- Orlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone
( ) (beat,clears throat) Jesus Christ, of course there are ghost orchids out there
've stolen them
() () 56
: ( ) (cont'd) (beat, a cleared throat) You should have gone with me
- The line: "
then he cleared his throat and said: 'You should have gone with me
'" (
) Beautifully written
really unique piece
: - Busy lunch crowd
Valerie sits at a table with Orlean and an open New Yorker magazine
Thank you
Thanks very much
We're big fans
Oh, thank you
And Laroche is such a fun character
Yeah, John's a character all right
It's funny and fresh
And sad in a way
Well, thanks
Thank you
So we were wondering, what's next
Oh, um, Random House wants me to expand it into a book
So 'll be doing that
And there'll be more of Laroche
Yeah
More John, more orchids
() 57
: 'know, we'd really like to option it
(laughing) You want to make this into a movie
Laroche is such a fun character
So
- Laroche, wearing a Cleveland Indians -shirt, drives crazily thorugh the Hollywood Seminole reservation
Orlean holds on
No shit 'm a fun character
(beat) Who's gonna play me
've got to write it first
Someone's gotta write the screenplay
Most things never get made
It's premature to -- think  should play me
Laroche swerves into a parking space in the nursery lot
- Laroche and Orlean get out of the van
've got all the right qualities
While you write, 'll take an acting class
few young Indian guys are hauling bags of potting soil
They look at Laroche sourly
Laroche indicates the giant cartoon Indian on his -shirt
wear this just to screw with 'em
- Laroche enters his office, looks at some papers on his desk
Most of them don't even bother calling me John anymore
It's "Crazy White Man" now
() () 58
: (cont'd) "Crazy White Man" is a good title for the movie
Call the book "Crazy White Man
" Or,  don't know, "Collector of Hearts" or something
Before Orlean can respond, Laroche picks up the phone and dials an impossibly long number
He waits, gestures for Orlean to sit on a chair piled high with junk
(cont'd) You won't hurt anything
Orlean moves the junk over, shares the seat with it
(cont'd) (Yelling into phone) Hello
Hello
Hi
This is John Laroche from the Seminole Nursery
Sem-ih-nole
(to Orlean) How do you say Seminole in Spanish
(into phone) That's right, yes
Yeah,  want to order some more of those pink string beans
Pink string beans
(yelling) Pink String Beans
Pink String Beans
Buster appears in the door
(cont'd) (into phone) 'll call back
(hangs up) Hey, Buster
John
was trying to order some pink string beans from Argentina
No kidding
figure just because Project Ghost Orchid is dead, we're not closing shop
Listen, John -- () 59
: (2) We'll get into plant multiplication
Buy little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell 'em at a profit
Simple plant multiplication for the masses
John, we're thinking maybe now's a good time for you to take a few weeks
don't need a vacation, Buster
It's a good time
Things are slow
Laroche stares at Buster
Buster stares back
'know, the guys on my crew here, all they do is smoke weed all day
been meaning to talk to you about that
So if it's a question of productivity -- - Laroche weaves through traffic
Orlean holds on
They're gonna fire me
Goddamn politics
Crazy White Man's bad publicity
(pounds steering wheel) can't believe 'm dealing with this
(pounds steering wheel) Like  could give a damn
If they fire me, 'll sue
already did some legal research on this when  was doing the other shit
They can't fire me
And ain't going to quit
Gray skies
Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's house
He drives through swampy terrain
He walks around at an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture
It's all dull
He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach, staring out at the ocean
- Orlean dials the phone
It rings for a long time
Finally: () 60
: ( ) (groggy) Yeah
John, it's Susan
(waits for response) Orlean
(waits) So,  was just wondering if you might be willing to talk some more
( ) What about
Orlean rolls her eyes
'mon, John, 'm trying to put together a book
Don't just abandon me down here
'm no longer interested in orchids
'm pursuing other avenues
apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you
Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table
Thank you for your time
Laroche hangs up
Orlean sits there for a moment, flips through her list of orchid collector names
- Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean
An attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German
He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something
He doesn't get it
They're gone
tan older man sits on the bench, lights a cigarette
Kaufman continues to look at the ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him
He doesn't want to engage
We could use the rain, huh
Kaufman nods, looking at the ocean
Pause
(cont'd) So you from around here
Kaufman shakes his head "no
"   Pause
() 61
: (cont'd) So where then
California
(excitedly) Yeah
'm moving to
just wrote a screenplay
sent it to a lot of agents
But if they turn me down, 'll go there and market it myself
used to be in marketing in New York, so  know exactly how to sell this thing
(beat) Where's a nice place to live if you don't have a car
You kind of need a car
guess West Hollywood would be okay
So you recommend West Hollywood then
'm not recommending it
Pause
moved down here for a change, and wrote the screenplay
Just like that
It's a great idea
The old guy waits for a response
He gets none
(cont'd) It's about a mob guy, but it's not your regular mob story
There's a twist cop tells this mob guy's wife that the mob guy's cheating on her
But the truth is, the cop's lying because he wants her for himself
See, they used to go together in high school
(waits for response, then:) You know anything about screenplays
Kaufman shakes his head
() 62
: (2) (cont'd) Well, the object is to make people think you're going in one direction, then you twist it to keep 'em surprised
came up with all these amazing twists out of nowhere
Well, not nowhere
(beat) 'm a born again Christian
(beat) You have faith
No
Not really
You don't believe in anything
Kaufman shrugs
(cont'd) don't know how you can look out at this beautiful ocean and not believe there's an intelligence that created it
don't know
Well, you can't know until you experience it
That requires accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior
Believe me
Lookit, if  was to show you a bottle of clear liquid and told you it was vodka, how would you know if it really was or if it was water
There's only one way
'd smell it
(annoyed) No
You can't smell vodka
You'd have to taste it, right
It could be poison
don't know you
(angry) Look, let's go with the analogy 'm drawing here
It's not poison
Okay
(resuming control) () () 63
: (3) (cont'd) So you'd have to taste it to know
Right
That's my point
Right
That's all 'm saying
(beat) So West Hollywood, huh
think 'll make it out this year
Because how long can you look at an ocean, y'know
Susan Orlean talks to various orchid enthusiasts, visits nurseries, sits in lecture halls, attends orchid shows, sits in the library reading orchid books
She is bored and distracted
- stewardess places a cup and an airline-sized bottle of vodka down in front of a lost Kaufman
He smiles at her
No response
He opens the bottle and smells the vodka
- Kaufman sits in the back seat and stares out the window
The driver looks at him a couple of times in his rearview mirror
(
) have failed
have nothing to say am fat
am not a writer
Mr
Kaufman, do you mind if  ask what type of work you do for Sony
'm a writer
(impressed) song writer
No, 'm a screenwriter
Oh, wow
Good for you
You mind if ask what your movie's about
() 64
: It's about flowers
No response
Kaufman tries to make it interesting
(cont'd) It's about this poacher who steals orchids out of a swamp
heard about that
Drug flowers, right
Yeah
That's it
heard about that
That's great
Action-adventure is my favorite genre
- Kaufman enters with his bags and heads to the stairs
Donald, typing furiously at his desk, looks up
How was Florida, man
(climbing the stairs) Okay
Cool
Hey, my script's going amazing
Right now 'm working out an Image System
Bob calls it an invaluable asset
Because of my multiple personality theme, 've chosen the motif of broken mirrors to show my protagonist's fragmented self
Bob teaches that an Image System greatly increases the complexity of an aesthetic emotion
You sound like you're in a cult
Kaufman disappears upstairs
No, it's just good writing technique
(types, then:) () () 65
: (cont'd) Oh,  made you a copy of McKee's Ten Commandments
've posted one over both our work areas
- Kaufman tears down '
Donald appears backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening
You shouldn't have done that
They look at each other
Donald breaks the tension, smiles
(cont'd) 'Cause it's extremely helpful
(lies down on floor) Hey, any sign of that Swamp Ape
There is no Swamp Ape
It was invented for people who can't find the actual world fascinating
'know
Oh, okay
didn't know that
Sorry
Hey,  got a song
"Happy Together
" was worried about putting a song in a thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the greatest screenplay ever written, did exactly that
Mixed genres
need to go to bed, Donald
haven't slept in a week
Okay
Donald remains on the floor
Mishmash of images: alligators snapping, Laroche jabbering, Orlean typing, 19th century orchid poachers slogging, orchids blooming, Mike Owen lecturing
(
) so we open the swamp
okay, flashback to young Laroche had turtles
Okay, Susan says What Is Passion
And okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a white van comes tearing around
66
- Kaufman lies half-awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting back and forth
He looks over at the clock
It's 3:32
Damn it
Donald snores happily off-screen
Kaufman switches on a lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it
There are now many yellow hi-lited passages
He reads one
(
) There are too many ideas and things and people, too many directions to go
was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size
Such sweet, sad insights
So true
Kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo
And you're
like looking at you
He stares at the photo
Its smile broadens
It talks
like looking at you, too
Charlie
The photo smiles warmly at him
Kaufman begins to jerk-off
He closes his eyes
Then: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making love
She smiles at him throughout
They finish
Then: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving
He looks at the still smiling photo
It somehow seems sleepy now
don't know how to do this
'm afraid 'll disappoint you
You've written a beautiful book
can't sleep
'm losing my hair
'm fat and repulsive -- Shhh
You're not
Whittle it down, focus on one thing in the story, find the thing you care passionately about and write about that
() 67
: Kaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face
He's in love
(cont'd) (sweet, flirty smile) figured there might be something
- Kaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini-recorder
We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile, beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing at her desk
She looks at the camera and talks to us: "John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch- shouldered
" Donald enters in his underwear, pours coffee
Morning
Hey, hey
You seem chipper
'm good
have some new ideas
Cool
Me too
'm putting in a chase sequence now
The killer flees on horseback with the girl
The cop is after them on a motorcycle
It's like a battle between motors and horses
They're all still one person, right
Yeah, hey, that's the big pay-off
(nice) Well, it sounds exciting
Thanks, man
Thanks
68
- Orlean drives through swampy landscape
She talks to us
suppose what 'd been doing in Florida was trying to understand how people found order and contentment and a sense of purpose in the universe by fixing their sighs on one single desire
Now  was also trying to understand how someone could end such intense desire without a trace
Orlean stops at a payphone and dials
It rings for a while
( ) (groggy) Yeah what
Hello, John, it's Susan
( ) Yeah hi
So, how's everything going
( ) Great
'm training myself on the internet
It's fascinating
'm doing pornography
It's amazing how much these suckers will pay for photographs of chicks
And it doesn't matter if they're fat or ugly or what
That sounds good
( ) It's great is what it is
So 've been meeting a lot of orchid people, going to shows,  thought you might want to hear about it
( ) Sorry
am officially no longer interested in orchids or the losers who are still interested in them
The end
() 69
: Laroche hangs up
Orlean looks off into the flat distance
If you really loved something, wouldn't a little of it always linger
She turns to the camera
- Kaufman holds The Orchid Thief open with one hand and types with the other
(
) Susan Orlean drives
The golden light of the afternoon sun caresses her sweet face
She talks to us
(copying from book) "Florida is a landscape of transition and mutation, a hybrid of
" Kaufman's hand slips, the book shuts
He opens it to the wrong page and sees an About The Author paragraph
The last line jumps off the page: "She now lives in New York City with her husband
" - Kaufman wanders the street, distraught
passing woman snickers
- Kaufman types
(
) Susan and her husband eat dinner in silence
dying relationship
Husband: You want to do something tonight
Susan: should work
'know
got stuff
- Kaufman and Orlean move furniture into the room
It now looks warm and inviting
Orlean wears a bandana kerchief
'm so thrilled  get to adapt your book, get to merge my thoughts with yours love that
It's intimate, like a marriage
() 70
: Not like a marriage
Maybe what marriage could be
Her eyes tear up
She kisses him
Isn't it ironic
You adapting my book
My three years in Florida meditating on my inability to experience passion resulted in my finding it with you
- Kaufman paces with his mini-recorder
Off-screen typing
and in the final sequence Susan as a young girl swings alone in the backyard
From high in the air she sees her parents in separate rooms staring blankly in opposite directions
This symbolizes the profound scarring their waning passion has had on the girl's psyche, how she became afraid to ever really love something because it would go away
Kaufman is immensely pleased
He smiles at Orlean's photo
(cont'd) This is good
'm finding you
The phone rings
Yallo
( ) Hi, Charlie
It's Valerie
Just bugging you again
How's everything going
Good
think really good now
( ) Great
So  spoke to Susan yesterday
(beat) Oh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
() 71
: ( ) told her you were making terrific progress and she's really excited to read the script
Sweat appears on Kaufman's brow
Oh
Good
( ) And she said she'd love to meet you
All color drains from Kaufman's face
Um, well, y'know, for me it's distracting to
or confusing to discuss what 'm exploring in the screenplay at this point
before  finish
it
So
( ) That's fair
'll let her know
Tell Susan 'd be very happy to meet her at a future date
As she sees fit
( ) Okay
Good enough
And tell her how much  love her book
Say  think she's such a great writer
(cont'd) Will do
Just keep us posted, Charlie
Okay
Nice talking to you
Okay then
Kaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of Orlean
It's still smiling, but not at him
It's not glowing
Maybe it's even smirking
Kaufman paces frantically, holding his stomach
Donald's off-screen typing grows louder
- Donald types at his desk on his computer
Kaufman storms in
() 72
: You can sit here and pretend to be a writer, mocking the seriousness of what do, like some kind of fucking funhouse mirror version of me
But let me tell you, you don't know what writing is
Kaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over
- Kaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an
He watches a slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a small room across the hall
She glances over in his direction
He smiles
She looks through him
(
) She thinks 'm repulsive
He lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up
- Kaufman types passionately on his computer
(
) Movie opens
: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old, bald, paces the room
His voice-over carpets the scene
" am old
am fat
am bald
My toenails have turned strange
am repulsive
How repulsive
don't know for  suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder
" '  - Kaufman, looking tired and wild-eyed, sits with his agent
we need to talk about the orchid script
Valerie called yesterday
They're getting antsy
think 've got it on track now
Good
She said you sounded weird
No Hollywood bullshit
Just raw truth
Sometimes that takes a while to find
() 73
: Okay
What's the time frame here
It's goddamned honest, Jerry
It's true
Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked- up internet thing
It's a girl taking a shit, but a trout comes out
You got e- mail yet
'll send it to you
This is more honest than anything anyone's ever done before in a movie, 'll tell you that
The only truth we can offer is the truth that's our own experience of the world
"The great poet, in writing himself, writes his time
"
Eliot
It sounds good, buddy
But we do need to give Valerie a ballpark -- 'm sick of their constant harassment
- Black and white shot of Laroche and the Indians slogging through Fakahatchee
The camera swoops down and the scene turns into a mannequin version
(
) On December 21, 1993 John Laroche and three Seminoles illegally removed one hundred and thirty rare plants from the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve
- It's an enormous hall filled with people setting up elaborate displays
Martin Motes and his assistant work on the Laroche display
Orlean watches them
Motes looks up
You've been checking out the displays
Yeah
() 74
: It's the Miami centennial, we're supposed to illustrate something about Florida history
Right
Now Laroche is part of Florida history
As a mannequin
It's a world of words to the end of it
/In which nothing solid is its solid self
You'll have to forgive me, 'm a reformed poetry professor
Orlean is moved by the quote
Who is that
Wallace Stevens
- Orlean stands in the poetry section and reads a Wallace Stevens book
(
) The greatest poverty is not to live/In a physical world, to feel that one's desire/is too difficult to tell from despair
- Kaufman is on the floor typing
His mini-recorder is on
'  ( ) Kaufman sits across from Valerie, a pretty film executive
He eyes her as she picks at her salad
She looks up and he looks down
He sweats
She compliments him on his work
She rubs her nose
He pulls at his nostrils
He tries to sound like he knows what he's talking about
He's full of shit
- Orlean dials the phone
() 75
: ( ) Yeah
John, it's Susan
( ) know
went to the Orchid Society Show a couple of days ago
( ) 'm not interested
There was a display of you stealing the ghost orchids
You're famous
( ) 'm not involved in that world now
So, look, John,  still haven't seen a ghost
And  was wondering -- ( ) Yeah, yeah
'll take you in
Really
Thank you so much
just
( ) Tomorrow
Pick me up at 5:30 am or it'll get too hot
'll buy all the supplies we'll need
- Kaufman types
(
) Kaufman jerks off to the book jacket photo of Susan Orlean
Donald appears in the doorway with a script
What
What do you want
finished
My script
'm done
() 76
: Kaufman stares at his typewriter, doesn't say anything
(cont'd) So would you show it to your agent
Kaufman grabs Donald's script and throws it on his bed
(cont'd) Thanks
Also,  wanted to thank you for your idea
It was very helpful changed it a little
Now the killer cuts off body pieces and makes the victims eat them
It's, like,  once saw this picture of a snake swallowing it's tail -- Kaufman collapses, puts his head in his hands
Ourobouros
don't know what that means
The snake is called Ourobouros
don't think so
But it's cool for my killer to have this modus operandi
Because at the end when he forces the woman, who's really just him, to eat herself, he's also eating himself to death
'm insane
'm Ourobouros
don't know what that is
've written myself into my screenplay
It's eating itself
'm eating myself
Oh
That's kinda weird
It's self-indulgent
It's narcissistic
It's solipsistic
It's pathetic
'm pathetic
'm fat and pathetic
() 77
: (2) 'm sure you had a good reason, Charles
You're an artist
The reason is 'm too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book
Because 'm pathetic
Because  have no idea how to write
Because  can't make flowers fascinating
Because  suck
Hey, am  in the script, too
'm going to New York
'll meet her
That's it
That's what  have to do
Don't get mad at me for saying this, Charles, but Bob's got a seminar in New York this weekend
So if you're stuck -- Kaufman shoots Donald a look
- The lights are off
Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully
- Kaufman reads Ann Landers's column in a paper dated July 4th
(
) Give yourself a reality check
Phoniness is transparent, and it is tiresome
Take pleasure in the beauty and wonders of nature
flower is God's miracle
Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below, like small flowers blooming on the black earth
His eyes well with tears
- Kaufman sleeps fitfully
- Orlean walks through alone, panicked
All the vegetation is greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before
Things slither by in the water, brush up against her
() 78
: She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself
She falls face forward into the black water
- Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs
She heaves, looks at the clock
It's 3:30
She stares at the ceiling
She looks at the clock again
It's 3:30
She looks at the clock again
It's 4:10
She closes her eyes
She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with murky water, the bed an island of dryness
An alligator pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the bed
Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard
The room is back to normal
The clock reads 4:23
She closes her eyes
The alarm goes off
'  - Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes hat
He opens the door and climbs in
Where are our supplies
Got everything  need right here
Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket
Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering wheel
Laroche shrugs
(cont'd) Look, don't worry about it
We'll get crap at the Indian trading post on Alligator Alley
Hey, want me to drive
- The sun has come up strong
It looks hot
Laroche speeds along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention to the road
The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily corrects it
Orlean is tense
remember one time when  was a kid, fifteen or so, my mother and  came to the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to photograph
We walked for hours, through the most intense heat 'd ever felt
We couldn't find one
wanted to turn back
But my mom said, no
() () 79
: (cont'd) She said, John, if you keep searching for something past doubt, past hopelessness, past the absolute certainty that you'll never find it, if you keep searching past that, there it'll be
So we walked had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet
And we found ourselves in this charred prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know
And there in the middle of it was this one gorgeous, snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii
They drive in silence for a little while
She watches him
- Orlean types at her desk
She turns to us and talks
He made it sound like a Bible story, the hopeful journey through darkness into light
never thought many people in the world were like John, but  was realizing more and more that Laroche was an extreme, not an aberration -- most people in some way or another do strive for something exceptional, something to pursue, even at their peril, rather than abide an ordinary life
- Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along
He arrives at the New Yorker building and enters with steely determination
- Kaufman waits for the elevator, sweating even more profusely
The elevator doors open
People get off, people get on, the elevator doors close
Kaufman still stands there
- Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water
They sink to their knees
The ground is soft; it's a struggle to pull their feet up to walk
Things slither past in the water
Something big runs by in the distance
Bees, and dragonflies hover
Gnats and mosquitoes bite
Birds screech
Frogs croak
Laroche points to a yellow flower
Here we go
Encyclia tempensis
Laroche lights a cigarette
() 80
: (cont'd) Nice little sucker, isn't it
Orlean examines it from a distance
Cute
Laroche continues walking and Orlean attempts to keep pace
He points at a tiny orchid on another tree
Clamshell orchid
You know that
Uh-huh
See,  found you two already
'll show you every orchid you want today
'll find you a fucking ghost if it kills me
(pointing to another orchid) Rigid Epidendrum
That's an ugly-ass orchid
But 'm no snob
'm interested in all orchids
Not just pretty ones
- miserable Kaufman sits in the window, sipping coffee and watching the New Yorker building across the street
He steels himself, exits the coffee shop
- Kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator
It stops a few times; people get off and on
Kaufman sweats
The doors open
The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite the elevator
Nobody gets off or on
The doors close
The elevator continues up
Kaufman hates himself
Soon the elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman
It begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker
This time Orlean gets on
Kaufman is absolutely panicked
Orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces front
Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head
The elevator arrives at the lobby
Orlean gets out
Kaufman hesitates, then follows
- Orlean walks along
Kaufman follows her
81
- The sun is much higher in the sky
Orlean is a sweaty mess, frizzed hair, anxious, scraped, dirty
(peppy) They're right nearby
Just follow me
- Orlean sits by herself, reading Vanity Fair
Kaufman sits a few tables away
He scribbles in his notebook
(
) Reads Vanity Fair
Funny detail: New Yorker writer reads Vanity Fair
Use
waitress brings a tuna sandwich and an ice tea to Orlean
(
) (cont'd) Likes tuna, drinks ice tea
Good character details
Good stuff
Orlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress
Thanks
Could  get some lemon please
The waitress nods and leaves
Kaufman scribbles
(
) Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not at all what  imagined
Interesting
- Orlean follows Laroche
She watches him start off in one direction, stop, start off another direction, then go straight ahead
Orlean seems depressed
Laroche, can  ask you a personal question
Laroche turns and scowls at her
We're not lost
- Orlean window shops at a shoe store
Kaufman takes notes
() 82
: (
) Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps
Okay
Orlean heads down the street
Kaufman follows
She enters the New Yorker building
Kaufman waits outside
- The sun is hot
Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean
She watches him march forward with great authority
She massages her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face
- Kaufman reviews his notes
He is sweaty and wild-eyed
(
) have nothing
am nothing
am fat
am over
am lost
- The sun is high
Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground
She stares at him
Laroche won't look at her
He busies himself opening the backpack and pulling out food
Finally, Laroche speaks without looking up
We're not lost
Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it
(cont'd) 'm just turned around a little
He looks up at her, sees her staring at him
He pokes around on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig
(cont'd) sundial
'll just set this up, wait a few minutes, and we'll be able to tell which way the sun is moving
We want to be heading southeast
Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it
(cont'd) This is no big deal
You should eat something
Orlean takes a cracker
This relaxes Laroche
He stretches his legs, knocks over the twig
Without looking at Orlean, he puts the twig back
() 83
: (cont'd) So do you collect anything
(non-responsive) Not really
Well, y'know it's not really about collecting the thing, it's about -- The sundial isn't working
Laroche looks down at it
It is so working
Orlean stares at the twig in the ground
She looks at Laroche
Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean
Rage and panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls
Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her brain
Laroche seems unaware
(cont'd) The thing about computers
The thing like is that 'm immersed in it but it's not a living thing that's going to leave or die or something
prefer having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life
Orlean's anger softens
She looks sadly at Laroche
So, John
Okay, fuck the sundial
We'll just go straight and eventually we'll get there
They rise
(cont'd) What  mean is we'll get somewhere
Out of here
mean, logically, we have to get out as long as we walk straight
Laroche points them in a direction and they walk
84
- Kaufman is sleeping
It looks like it's been a rough night
The phone rings
He reaches for it
Hello
( ) Hey, it's Jerry
woke you
No, it's okay
( ) How's it going
Has it been helpful to talk to the writer
What's her name
Yeah
Susan Orlean
( ) Well,  mean, are you making headway
Valerie's breathing down my neck
You can't rush inspiration
'know
( ) Okay, fine
Um, the other reason 'm calling is to tell you Me, Myself, and is just amazing
What the hell is Me, Myself, and
( ) Your brother's script
It's tight, inventive
smart, edgy thriller
The best spec script 've read this year
Oh
Good
( ) 'm gonna sell it for a shitload
Two fucking talented guys in one family
'know, maybe you could bring Donald on to help you finish the orchid thing
Jerry, don't say that
mean -- () 85
: ( ) Just a thought, buddy
He's really goddamn amazing at structure
Jerry,  gotta go
have an appointment
gotta go
( ) Adios, buddy
Finish
Finish
() - Kaufman wanders
He eyes other sad-looking, balding, overweight men wandering the streets also
(
) am fat
can't write
am repulsive
am old
have accomplished nothing
am just one more old, fat, bald man on the street
- Laroche leads the way
There's a sadness, a sense of defeat and humiliation that he tries to conceal
Orlean is stony
've done this a million times
Whenever everything's killing me,  just say to myself, screw it, and go straight ahead
Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush
- Kaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the sun
He walks toward it
- The lobby of an auditorium, crowded with enthusiastic people signing up for something
Kaufman waits in line
He watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an attractive female registrar
The guy moves on and the attractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman
May  help you
Kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze; they come to rest on a pile of McKee's book Story next to her
86
- Kaufman sits in the packed room
McKee paces the stage with a mic clipped to his lapel
Years from now you'll be standing around a posh cocktail party congratulating yourself on how you spent an entire weekend locked in a room with an asshole, an opinionated arrogant asshole, for your art
The audience laughs, except for Kaufman who looks pained
(
) am pathetic
am a loser
am fat
So
what is the substance of writing
Nothing as trivial as words is at the heart of this great art, my friends
McKee continues to talk but his voice goes under
(
) have failed
am panicked
am fat
have sold out
am worthless
Literary talent is not enough
First, last, and always, the imperative is to tell a story
Kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes
Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle said, when storytelling goes bad in a society, the result is decadence
(deadpan) Well, just look around you
Everyone, except Kaufman, laughs giddily at McKee's joke
(cont'd) Aristotle also said:  story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end
The students nod in appreciation at this profundity
87
- McKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead projector
It's some kind of complicated time-line with act- breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated
The audience members take copious notes
Kaufman sweats
(
) It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of conviction that brings me here with all these desperate idiots lapping up everything this bag of wind spouts
Easy answers
Rules to short-cut yourself to success
And here  am, because my jaunt into the abyss brought me nothing
Well, isn't that the risk one takes for attempting something new
should leave here right now
'll start over -- (starts to rise) need to face this project head on and -- and God help you if you use voice- over in your work, my friends
Kaufman stops, looks up, startled
McKee seems to be looking at him
God fucking help you
It's flaccid, sloppy writing
Any idiot can write voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character
You must present the internal conflicts of your character in image, in symbol
Film is a medium of movement and image
Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks
"Any idiot
" writes the guy on one side of him
"Flaccid
" writes the guy on the other side
(cont'd) Okay, one hour for lunch
- Students exit onto the street in small groups
Kaufman wanders by himself
His face is troubled
There is no sound
88
- McKee lectures
Kaufman sits and listens
copy of Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap
The book features a bust of Aristotle on the cover
You want your writing to be original
You want to have an original voice like Neil Simon or Nora Ephron
Well, let me tell you something, my friends
The key to originality is not eccentricity
guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm
" : - It's late
The audience is tired, but still attentive
Now Kaufman takes serious notes
McKee, energetic as ever, wears his sweater tied around his shoulders
We stay firmly planted on his face as he talks and talks
Long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema
The Greeks called it stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of ideas
long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute
Look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience
The ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid
Life is rarely vivid
And that's an important point
We are not recreating life on the screen
Writers are not tape recorders
Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop
Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is
Real people are not interesting
There's not a person in this world -- and include myself in this -- who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character
: 89
- McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee
Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty
He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then: (cont'd) (deadpan) Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends, that there's a fucking God
The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter
Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little
(cont'd) Okay
That's it for tonight
Remember, there'll be a  and  tomorrow morning before class starts
- Kaufman tosses and turns in bed
: -  - The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight
- Kaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back
McKee paces
Anyone else
Kaufman timidly raises his hand
(cont'd) Yes
() 90
: You talked about Crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies
They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved
More a reflection of the real world -- The real world
The real fucking world
First of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears
Secondly: Nothing happens in the real world
Are you out of your fucking mind
People are murdered every day
There's genocide and war and corruption
Every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else
Every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else
People find love
People lose it, for Christ's sake
child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church
Someone goes hungry
Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman
If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life
And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie
don't have any use for it don't have any bloody use for it
Okay, thanks
- The last of the students are filing out
Kaufman waits, leaning against the building
McKee emerges, carrying his brown leather bag
shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him
Mr
McKee
Yes
'm the guy you yelled at this morning
() 91
: (trying to recall) need more
was the one who thought things didn't happen in life
Oh, right, okay
Nice to see you
need to talk
make it a rule not to give private tutorials to my seminar students
It wouldn't be fair to the others
Mr
McKee, please
My even standing here is very scary
don't meet people well
'm self-conscious and timid
But what you said this morning shook me to the bone
What you said was bigger than my screenwriting choices
It's about my choices as a human being
Please
McKee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his arm around Kaufman
could use a drink, my friend
- Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose, looking only straight ahead
As they walk the sounds and colors become subdued
Soon there is silence
(
) We turned to the right and saw only more cypress and palm and sawgrass They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight
(
) (cont'd) So we turned to the left, and there, far down the diagonal of the levee, we could see the gleam of a fender
We followed it like a beacon all the way to the road
Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car
92
- Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers
Kaufman reads from his copy of The Orchid Thief
We followed it like a beacon all the way to the road
Kaufman closes the book
There's a pause
Then what happens
That's the book
wanted to present it simply, without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story
wanted to show flowers as God's miracles wanted to show that Orlean never saw the blooming ghost orchid
It's about disappointment
see
That's not a movie
You must go back and put in the drama
(pause) 've got pages of false starts and wrong approaches
'm way past my deadline can't go back
Ah, the everpresent deadline
Yes,  was doing a Kojak once and
it was hell
McKee sips his beer, eyes Kaufman
(cont'd) Tell you a secret
The last act makes the film
You can have an uninvolving, tedious movie, but wow them at the end, and you've got a hit
Find an ending
Use what you've learned this weekend
Give them that and you'll be fine
Tears form in Kaufman's eyes
You promise
McKee smiles
Kaufman hugs him
McKee recognizes his bulk
() 93
: You've taken my course before
My brother did
My twin brother Donald
He's the one who got me to come
Twin screenwriters
Julius and Philip Epstein,who wrote Casablanca were twins
You mentioned that in class
The finest screenplay ever written
- drunken Kaufman paces, tries to read Story
McKee's Ten Commandments are taped to the wall
As is a photo of Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine
(
) Climax
revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony -- a value swing at maximum charge that's absolute and irreversible
Kaufman is lost
He rubs his temples
He dials the phone
( ) Great writers residence
Donald
( ) Hey, how's the trip
Gettin' it on with that lady journalist
You dog you
Yeah
Listen, 'm calling to say congratulations on your script
( ) Isn't that cool
Jerry says he can make me, like, high-sixes against a mill-five
That's great, Donald
() 94
: ( ) want to thank you for all your help
wasn't any help
( ) 'mon, you let me stay in your place and your integrity inspired me to even try
Well, look, 've been thinking, maybe you'd be interested in hanging out with me in New York for a few days
( ) Oh my God, yes
'm flattered
- Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the script
Kaufman paces
Donald finishes, is quiet
So, like, what would you do
Script kind of makes fun of me, huh
Sorry
was trying something
-- Hey,  don't mind
It's funny
Okay
So, what would you do
You and me are so different, Charles
We're different talents
know
Just for fun
How would the great Donald end this script
(giggling) The great Donald
(serious) Well,  mean
do you need the whole court case
() 95
: Uh, it's what happened to Laroche
It's kind of important
It's boring
No offense
courtroom scene should be dramatic
Stick the ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe
Um
Okay
Too much about orchids
Get rid of it
Pare that stuff down to a minimum
Frankly, 'd focus more on the relationship between the brothers think that's the gold here
No one cares about orchids
The book's about orchids
That's a problem
But don't let it ruin the movie
mean, for example, use the orchids in a more dramatic way
Have some kind of bang-up, crazy action sequence in the swamp
Use the swamp better
It's a tremendous fictional world
setting of great dramatic possibility
That's true
But -- And put some twists in
Reveal some surprising thing about Laroche
God, what am  doing giving suggestions to you
mean you're like a seasoned professional
You're an artist
'mon, you're the "mill-five" kid
(enjoying this) Shut up
(thinks) love the Laroche porno web-site stuff
Is that real
Maybe make a bigger deal of that
don't know
() 96
: (2) think it's real
haven't actually seen the site
It's sex, man
Incorporate it
- The front door opens and Kaufman enters
The lights are off, but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop computer
Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in front of the computer
Donald looks up, caught
Oh, hi,  was doing some research found Laroche's site and
'm embarrassed
Jesus, Donald
Kaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the screen
He's stunned
It's Orlean smiling at him
What
She's kinda cute
You don't like her
dunno,  think she's okay
It's not like 'm marrying her
Kaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo
(cont'd) Oh, wow
That's kind of a twist, huh
Jesus
Jesus
think this is maybe a good thing for the script
Go ask her about this
'm not gonna ask her about this
You want me to
don't mind
No,  don't want you to
could easily pretend 'm you
() 97
: No
No
- Donald, dressed like Kaufman, waits by the elevators
Orlean emerges
He's about to talk to her, when she pulls out a cell phone and dials
Donald decides to be a spy and follows her out of the building
- Orlean talks on the phone
Donald trails close behind her
So you'll pick me up
Yeah, tomorrow
Orlean stops to look in a shoe store window
Donald stops and looks in the window also
Orlean doesn't notice him
(cont'd) Ten-twenty
Yes, of course  will
Donald walks off
- Donald is focused on the computer
Kaufman sits in a chair in the corner
Both men are in pajamas
What was she wearing
don't know
Like a dress maybe
Did she look at me
At you
Finally
Da-da-da-daaaaah
Orlean, flight 651
Arriving Miami 10:20 tomorrow morning
Donald turns and smiles across the room to Kaufman
don't want to do this, Donald
We'll go together
It'll be good
() 98
: Kaufman looks squeamish
Donald picks up a hairbrush, holds it to his mouth
He starts to sing "Happy Together
" Kaufman smiles sheepishly, shrugs Donald off
Donald persists
Finally Kaufman joins in
They do the whole number and fall laughing into each other's arms
- Orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal
The beat- up white van pulls up
Orlean gets in, the van speeds off
Another car pulls away from the curb and follows it
- Donald drives, keeping up with the van, which speeds and swerves through traffic
Kaufman is sweaty, nervous
It's so weird to actually see that van in real life
So you want to build the symbolic charge of the story's imagery from the particular to the universal
Okay
Okay, but when you're creating an image system, how do you know -- - The van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class house
Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean and Laroche emerge from the van
Orlean seems different now: more exotic
She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong
Donald drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches as Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house
'll get a closer look
You wait here
(momentously) No,  want to go
should go
mean, it should be me, right
mean
Go for it, bro
You the man
Kaufman gets out of the car
Donald gets in, peruses Kaufman's script
Kaufman walks past the house, trying to peer in windows
He sees nothing
He slinks around back
() 99
: In the yard, Kaufman finds a greenhouse
It's filled with row upon row of ghost orchids
Holy
There's movement in a window in the house
Kaufman ducks
(
) Darlin',  dunno what's come over you
Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the window
Orlean and Laroche are laughing, kissing, groping, and undressing each other
Kaufman is heartbroken but transfixed
Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman
Don't stop, Johnny
Laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door
(') Johnny
Where are you going
Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house
Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house
- Laroche throws Kaufman down into a chair
The chair slides across the floor, tips over
Orlean seems uninterested
She kisses Laroche's leg
Who the hell are you
Kaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth
just
nobody,  just -- Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut
Who the fuck are you
Um
'm just
was at the wrong house
'm looking for the Johnson family
got your Johnson family right here
() 100
: Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head
Orlean kisses Laroche's back
Kaufman whimpers
Honey, come back to bed
Who the hell sent you
Rudy
'm not -- Again Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head
His scalp bleeds
(cont'd) 'm the screenwriter
What the fuck does that mean
'm the guy adapting her book
Her book about you
This registers with Laroche
Jesus Fucking Christ
(then, trying to make sense) Why the fuck were you in my backyard
was, um, trying
don't know
Orlean is unforgiving
Who's the bloody fat guy
This is the fellow adapting your book for the movies, darling'
(excited) Really
wanted to meet -- (realizing) Oh
What does he know
don't know anything
swear
() 101
: (2) He knows about the greenhouse
(to Orlean) We can't have this appear on the silver screen
It won't
don't even under -- Johnny, 'm so tired now
Orlean lies down
Laroche paces
Donald peers, unseen, into the back window
He needs to be gotten rid of
What
Donald's eyes widen
Laroche paces
Orlean watches Laroche, fascinated by his every muscle movement
Small article in newspaper
Orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation, becomes fixated on his voice, his lips
(cont'd) Screenwriter doing research for movie about notorious orchid poacher was found drowned in the Fakahatchee after accidentally slipping and hitting his head on a rock
End of story
Is that credible from a journalistic standpoint
Johnny, come lie on top of me
Focus, darling'
Is this credible
(concentrates) Um, oh
this screenwriter was killed doing research in Jamaica a few years ago
(to Kaufman) Screenwriter, you have a car
() 102
: (3) , um, no,  -- Laroche gets ready to kick him again
(cont'd) rental, a rental
We drive his car there, leave it on the side of the swamp
That works
Good
like that
(to Kaufman) Sorry
Please
Donald disappears from the window
- Kaufman drives
The headlights shine on Laroche's van ahead
Orlean, no longer stoned, sits next to him, holding a gun
She skims Kaufman's screenplay
thought  had a sense of you from your book
(beat) had a little crush on you, to tell the truth
You're different than  thought
Huh
Look,  don't care what you two are you doing
Please don't kill me
Hey, here's one of my lines
(mockingly reading from screen) "Isn't it ironic
You adapting my book
My three years in Florida meditating on my inability to experience passion resulted in my finding it with you
" () 103
: was trying to do something
Well, it's kind of pathetic, dontcha think
They drive in silence
Orlean reads more of the screenplay
Here's me
Here's me again
(mocking) " wanted to know what it's like to care about something passionately
" Orlean laughs derisively
You can laugh, but  didn't make that line up
That's a quote from your book
Yeah,  know, Charlie-boy
Chill
'm laughing at who  used to be
It's sad
So now you learned about passion
(jealous) From Weirdo Laroche
Bully for you
You can't learn about passion
You can be passion
And it wasn't John who made me passion
It was orchids
thought you didn't even like orchids
lied about what happened at the end of the book
On the way out of the swamp
- Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp
He spots something on a tree, circles it, and stands there, awestruck
Orlean comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from the tree
The jewel of the Fakahatchee
Orlean looks at it, tries to feel some passion for it, can't
() 104
: still don't get it
mean, there it is
can see it's pretty, but -- You'll get it
Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch
- There's a makeshift lab
Laroche is extracting some gooey substance from the nectary
(
) Back in John's basement he explained his real plans for the ghost
He'd discovered a chemical inside with psychoactive properties
His plan had always been to clone the flower and make a fortune marketing this drug
It was Laroche's kind of plan, it wasn't a controlled substance because the government didn't know it existed
'   - Orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee table while Laroche watches
She talks to the camera
The first time  tried it, the split second it took effect,  understood orchids
loved them with a passion 'd never felt for anything
For anyone
The drug takes effect and Orlean turns away from us, becomes fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her
She smells it, caresses it, cries at its beauty
- Isn't it curious
An orchid made me passionate about orchids
You're throwing the truth away for a chemical confusion of your synapses -- With this powder  am passionate about everything
() () 105
: (cont'd) 'm alive in a profound world now
It sizzles with beauty and horror and sex
Now writing is -- words are -- a way to remove yourself from passion
So 'm done with writing
John and  are making a fortune with this extract
It's big in the Miami club scene
We call it "Passion
" (giggles) Isn't that cute
Up ahead, Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign
(cont'd) Follow him, please
- Laroche parks
Kaufman parks behind him
Orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out
As Kaufman comes around the car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat
Laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder
Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him
Kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high water
They slog through silently
Laroche stops
This spot looks good
(thinking aloud) Now how do we do this
Hit him in the head with a rock first
Keeping in mind we can only hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him slipping and falling onto the rock
Laroche paces
Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock
She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it
Kaufman shivers
Orlean's drugs kick in
Holy Jesus
Holy
Hey, baby, hey
Orlean trails off
Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean
Should we drown him, then hit him on the head
Uh-uh
body bleeds different if the heart's stopped
These new forensic guys are very smart
We really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes
() () 106
: (cont'd) Maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead
No, darlin'
They'll know he didn't drown
See, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not -- do not -- fill with water in a drowning
What happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes
This creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe
Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit
It's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning
There's a lot to be aware of, Susie
Shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers
Tire tracks
They all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists
(to Kaufman) What do you think
You're a writer
How would you do it
What's a good way to kill somebody
don't write this kind of bullshit
Don't get all huffy,  was simply -- Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water
Orlean looks up, spaced
She's confused by a second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil
Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road
Laroche pulls himself from the water
(cont'd) Fuck
(receptively) Yeah, let's, baby
She staggers moonily toward Laroche
He pushes her away
Not now
We got to kill that guy
And now  guess that other guy as well
(disappointed) Ohhh
107
- Kaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road
For Christ's sake, why didn't you do something while we were in the car
My back had seized
couldn't move
Laroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind
Shit
It rams them again, this time sending them down into the swamp
The van stops
Donald tries to back the car onto the road; the wheels just spin
Laroche steps out of the van
We've gotta ditch this thing
(hysterical) It's a rental
It's a rental
Now
Kaufman and Donald climb from the car, make their way deep into the swamp
Laroche follows them in on foot, dragging Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life
That's beautiful
What's that, Johnny
What's that one called
just so want to fuck that flower, don't you
Asclepias lanceolata
Red milkweed
Extremely fuckable
But we don't have time
Laroche shoots at the brothers
Kaufman whines
(to Orlean) What's his name
Um, y'know
Charlie or something
() 108
: Charlie
Listen, let's talk
This pie is big enough for four people
(to Orlean) Why are there two of him
Orlean shrugs
Identical twigs
(laughs crazily) Did  say twigs
meant twins
Kaufman and Donald run through a colony of sawgrass
It slices them like razor blades
Kaufman yells in pain
Blood oozes through their shirts and pants
Cladium jamaicense, guys
Sawgrass
You want to watch out for that
That's some evil shit
Cut you up
Fuck you, Laroche
Just tryin' to be helpful
Walk with us and 'll be sure you avoid all the pitfalls
know these swamps forwards and backwards
There's alligators and poisonous snakes, fellas
Wild hogs
Kaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water
Nowhere to go
Laroche and Orlean close in
The brothers run along the periphery of the lake
Donald stops
Wait
Do you hear something
Kaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing
Donald, that sounds bad
The brothers run in the opposite direction
The galloping gets louder
It's wild pigs
Donald spots an airboat on the shore
They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it
The pigs get closer
Laroche and Orlean get closer
Donald finds a button, presses it, the engine starts
They pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up
One pig leaps on board, squealing
Kaufman kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat
kick connects and the pig flies into the water
() 109
: (2) Laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle
It nicks the boat
Donald looks back and the boat heads for a cypress stand
Watch out, watch out, watch out
Donald gets the boat back on course
Laroche and Orlean have been left far behind
Donald slows the boat
think we're okay
Suddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and speeds along the road at the water's edge
Orlean shoots at the boat from the van window
(cont'd) Hold on
Donald speeds up
The van keeps up, the shooting continues
Bullets whiz
Kaufman puts his head in his hands
bullet hits the airboat's gas tank
It explodes in a ball of flame, illuminating the whole swamp
Kaufman and Donald are thrown, along with flaming pieces of debris
Donald treads water, looks all around for Kaufman
(cont'd) Charles
Charles
Where are you
Underwater
dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings
The murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the surface
An alligator appears
Kaufman panics, surfaces
On the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water, then get jerked back down
Donald dives
Underwater
The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the leg
Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken propeller blade
He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs Kaufman, and brings him to the surface
Donald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow
Another shot is fired
It skims the water near Kaufman
Fuck
Fuck, Donald, we're dead
We're okay
How's your leg
don't know
How's your back
() 110
: (3) It's fine
My back is fine
Laroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting
Mike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames
Donald makes it to shore
He climbs out and is helping Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls
Donald
Kaufman sloshes to shore
His right leg is bloody and mangled
He lifts his brother's head onto his lap
You're gonna be okay
No
But don't let them get you, too
(weak smile) You got a fucking awesome third act
(crying) Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing to say and an awful time to say it, but 'm sorry  didn't get to know you better
'm so sorry
'm so sorry
It's really
You've been really nice
See, it's just  thought  knew you already
thought you were me
And hated me
Donald touches Kaufman's face
Kaufman looks at his brother
Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light
Well, don't do that anymore
Okay
Okay
Donald dies
Kaufman screams heavenward
The van appears out of the bush, barreling for them
Kaufman rolls his brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough
The van follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt
() 111
: (4) Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights
Out of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns
They follow Kaufman into the swamp
Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van
He gets out, surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground
Jesus, that writer guy
Owen grabs his
, tries to radio for help
It's broken
He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off
Kaufman limps through the dark water
Laroche and Orlean follow the sound of his sloshing
Water sounds so sparkly
Like lemon plastic jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline
Dontcha think
Darlin', please
Can we fuck now, baby
Fuck like lemons
Owen tears along the dirt road
Up ahead, Kaufman limps out of the swamp, into the truck's headlights
Owen is confused
He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp
Kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck
Owen climbs out
You gotta help me
You gotta help me
What the hell is going on here
They're after me
They've got guns
They killed my brother
Who's got guns
What are you -- Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over
Donald's body flies into the water
There, staring Kaufman and Owen down, is a giant man-like beast
It's repulsive, covered in algae-matted fur
(cont'd) Holy shit
() 112
: (5) The two men turn and run
(cont'd) It's real
can't believe it,  never -- The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick
Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder
He runs right into the arms of Orlean
Hey, it's the screenwriter
There's a thing back there
You don't want to be here
Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back
Nothing there
You're right,  don't want to be here
'm tired, let's get this over with
Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head
Kaufman tenses
Orlean studies Laroche's gun
Her nose is practically touching the barrel
love your gun, baby
Can we trade
Stand back, sweetness
Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away
Suddenly the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp
(cont'd) Susie
Susie
Orlean looks around
Where'd Johnny go
(
) Susie
Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the darkness
Something slumps forward in the water
Orlean steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman
The creature is dead, so is Laroche
() 113
: (6) (crying softly) Oh, Johnny
She sits next to Laroche and pets his head
Kaufman watches her
The sun is coming up
'd just stare at your picture, and you looked so sweet
read your words and thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me
And the way you wrote about Laroche
You said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth -- Oh, Johnny
Johnny's teeth
Oh
figured you could look at me and see something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would be nicer than the one write day in and day out in my head
(hopefully) Would it be
Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze to him
She stares at him for a long while, then: You're really so wonderful
Really
So wonderful
can see inside your soul
It glows with orange sadness
It's raining inside you
want to run through your dripply dripples
It's so beautiful
love you
do
Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock
It's the drugs
Orlean stands and walks toward Kaufman
() 114
: (7) No, it's me
It's the real me
Look at you
just want to hold you and -- Oh, crap, it's wearing off
Crap
She paces, unfolds her little square of paper
(cont'd) 'm out
'm fucking cleaned out
Kaufman watches her for a moment
Okay, bye
can't let you go, fatty
can't let you make this public
Kaufman keeps walking
(cont'd) You hear me
You pathetic, fat, bald
You don't even know how to write
You're not even
You're not leaving here
(screaming, crying) need a fix
Everything's so ugly
Orlean screams in anguish
Kaufman keeps walking
Orlean shakily aims the gun at his back
She shoots
Kaufman falls, gets up, keeps walking
She aims again through her tears
Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet figure
Kaufman turns
Donald
Kaufman limps back
Donald and Orlean roll on the ground
My brother is not fat
He's not bald
My brother is a great writer
He was trying to do something important
The gun fires
Orlean slumps over Donald
Kaufman arrives
Both Donald and Orlean are dead
Kaufman falls to his knees
- The sun is high
Fires smoulder
tow-truck extricates one of the crashed vehicles
State police cars, ambulances, ranger trucks abound
Kaufman is wrapped in a blanket
() 115
: He is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black plastic tarp
That's Mike Owen
John Laroche
Susan Orlean
don't know what that is think it might be a Swamp Ape
And that's Donald, my twin brother
He saved my life
Kaufman cries a little
The cop waits sympathetically, then: You two really look alike
(proudly) Yeah
Yes, we do
- Kaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad
He's a little scraped-up, a little tougher
copy of Story by McKee is among his reference material
Alice, the waitress, walks by and glances at the table
Oh,  love McKee
(recognizes Kaufman, gets reserved) Oh, hi
Haven't seen you in a while
Hi
Yeah, 've been away
So you studying screenwriting
'm actually finishing one up
Good for you
Me too
God, it's so hard to get in, huh
Everyone and their brother is writing a screenplay
Yeah
Actually 'm writing this one for Sony Pictures
Really
Wow
Really
That's so cool
(beat) () () 116
: (cont'd) Wow
So what's it about, if you don't mind my asking
That's tough
Let's see
about being yourself, maybe
It's about learning that if you can't love yourself, you can't really love anyone
That's true
God, that's so true
It's such an important message, y'know
See, my twin brother was murdered recently -- Oh God
'm sorry
That's so horrible
Thanks
Like part of me ripped away
Forever
It was a wake up call
'm so sorry
You poor man
Anyway, it helped put things in perspective
Life is a miracle
All life, from the flower to the human being
You
Me
And  want to show people that
For my brother
For everyone
There's a pause
Alice just stares at him, in awe
Listen, do you mind if  sit for a sec
But you're working
(shrugs) It's a stupid job, y'know
'm Alice
Charlie
like that name
Charlie
've always really liked that name
Charlie
Alice smiles, sits
The two of them begin to talk
117
- : , , An enormous chunk of rock, dimly lit by faraway stars, floats by
Silence
: "Let me have men about me that are fat; Sleek-headed men and such that sleep o' nights
