-- , twenty-nine, drives his '69 Cutlass while smoking a cigarette
One could describe his appearance as punk/arty, but neither would do him justice
He is a man of obvious intelligence, and his face is amiable
There is only one key on his keyring, and it is in the ignition
(voice over) Garbage
started thinking about what happens to all the garbage
mean, where do we put all of it, we have to run out of places to put it eventually, don't we
This happened to me before when that barge with all the garbage was stranded and nobody would take it
Remember that
2
'  -- , twenty-six, sits opposite her therapist
She is an extremely attractive woman, dressed in a mature preppy style
There is a wedding ring on her left hand
Yes,  remember
What do you do when these moods overtake you
Nothing
mean, nothing
try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that
Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day
No,  didn't
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage
'd really like to know where it's all going to go
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and  started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening
Ann, do you see a pattern here
What do you mean
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem
Yeah, so
If you think about it,  think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are
mean, maybe they do, but doubt those people are in therapy
Besides, being happy isn't all that great
My figure is always at its best when 'm depressed
The last time  was really happy put on twenty-five pounds thought John was going to have a stroke
(voice over) It's true, 'm telling you
3
-- , twenty-nine, sits at his desk talking on the telephone
He is dressed very well, sporting real suspenders with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit
He fingers the wedding ring on his left hand
As soon as you've got a ring on your finger, you start getting serious attention from the opposite gender
Seriously,  wish  had Super Bowl seats for every time had some filly just come up and start talking to me without the slightest provocation
That never happened before  got married
Shit, if 'd known that, 'd have gone out and bought me a ring when  was eighteen and saved myself a lot of time and money
John looks at his watch
Shit,  gotta be someplace
(quickly) Look, racquetball Thursday
You're the coolest
John presses the intercom button while putting on his jacket
Uh, Janet, re-schedule Kirkland
Tell him to come in Friday at 1:30
(voice over, to Ann) Are you still keeping these thoughts from John
(voice over) Yes
4
-- John brushes his teeth and combs his hair very carefully
(voice over, to Ann) Are you afraid of his reaction
Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things
(voice over) No
don't know
haven't told him about the garbage thing because 'm pissed off at him right now
He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it
mean,  would've said yes,  just wish he would've asked
5
' - What upsets you about that
guess 'm upset because  can't really justify being upset,  mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework
Yeah,  know
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John
(shrugs) Fine,  guess
Except right now m going through this where don't want him to touch me
6
'  -- , Ann's , opens her door to reveal the freshly coifed John Millaney
They kiss passionately and begin to disrobe
Cynthia bears a slight resemblance to Ann, but is not as overtly attractive
She does, however, have a definite carnal appeal and air of confidence that Ann lacks
(voice over) When did you begin having this feeling
(voice over) About a week ago
don't know what brought it on,  just started feeling like  didn't want him to touch me
(voice over, to Ann) Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him
(voice over) Oh, yeah
(pause) But see, 've never really been into sex that much,  mean,  like it and everything, it just does't freak me out,  wouldn't miss it, you know
But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all
Like  said, it's not that miss it, but  m curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden
John and Cynthia are now having sex
(voice over) Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched
(voice over) But see, he stopped before  got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me
mean, 'm sure he wishes  would initiate things once in awhile, and  would except it never occurs to me, 'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that have felt like starting something was by myself
(voice over) Did you do anything
pause
(voice over) What do you mean
(voice over) Did you masturbate
7
'  -- (taken aback) God, no
take it you've never masturbated
(slightly uncomfortable) Well,  kind of tried once
It just seemed stupid,  kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh,  don't know, and then  was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know
So it was recently that you tried this
(exhales, head down) Well, kind of recently,  guess
But not too recently
There is a pause
'm really not up to having a guest in the house
8
'  -- John and Cynthia are lying in bed, bathed in sweat
've got to get back to the office
only get one today
Gee, how exciting
John rolls over and begins to put his clothes on
can't let my lunch hour go on too long
've already skipped one meeting
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit
If you want to leave, leave
My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what 'm saying
John shakes his head
Why don't you just tell me how you really feel
John stands and begins putting on his clothes
have a friend coming in from out of town, 'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right
Right
silent shrug from Cynthia
John is almost completely dressed
wish you'd quit that bartending job
Why
hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time
can handle it
Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute
And you are in no position to be jealous
Who said  was jealous
did
John says nothing
You know, 'd like to try your house sometime
The idea of doing it in my sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill
John thinks about that
wish  could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay
Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney
Could be risky
Well, maybe  could just start a rumor, then
No,  mean doing it at my house
Afraid of getting caught
Maybe
You should be
Can  meet this friend of yours
Cynthia,  don't think you want to,  mean, you should see the way he dresses
really think he's in a bad way
'm intrigued
You're intrigued
Sure
Maybe he's the man 'm looking for
Then  won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time
John looks at her for a moment before heading for the door
Bye
9
'  -- Graham has parked in the Millaney's driveway
He opens the trunk, revealing a Sony 8mm Video rig and a single black duffle bag
He grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk
Graham knocks at the door
He is stubbing out a cigarette with his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door
She is unable to hide her suprise at his appearance
Ann
Yes
(extends his hand) Graham Dalton
Ann shakes his hand
Can  use your bathroom
Ann withdraws her hand
Yes
Yes, come in, please
Graham moves inside
10
'  -- Ann closes the door and motions Graham to the rear of the house
Straight back, first door on the left
Graham heads for the bathroom
Ann heads for the phone
She dials John's office
Forman, Brent, and Millaney
John Millaney, please
This is his wife
Graham exits the bathroom
Ann quickly hangs up the phone
That was quick
False alarm
Oh
Well, please sit down
Graham sits, his manner pleasantly animated
He gets his Gitanes from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks around for an ashtray
Ann swallows uncomfortably
We
don't usually let people smoke in the house
We have a patio if you -- Oh, no problem
It can wait
moment of silence
Graham looks at Ann directly
It is not a challenging stare, he's just trying to ascertain what kind of person she is
Ann, to her credit, somehow meets his gaze
Something subtle passes between them
(looks at duffle bag) Do you have other things
Yes
(pause) Oh, you mean to bring in
No
Yes, have some other things, no, don't need to bring them in
This is all  need to stay here
Oh
Graham smiles
He has an unusual face, a face that fluctuates between remarkably handsome and just plain strange
Have you ever been on television
Televison
Yes
No
Why
(shrugs) Curious
The central air-conditioning switches on
Ann smiles
Graham is an unusual name
Yeah,  guess it is
My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby
She probably heard the name in some movie
She's a prisoner of public television now
Oh, uh-huh
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance
(downplaying) No,  think you look
fine
(smiles) Oh
Well, maybe 'm uncomfortable with my appearance
feel a little out of place in these surroundings
Well
used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it
Didn't you do that when you were younger
(thinks) No, not really
Oh
Well,  did
was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible
You play an instrument
No,  was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone
The whole thing was really
irrelevant
How do you like being married
(caught slightly off guard) Oh,  like it
like it very much
What about it do you like
'm not being critical, 'd really like to know
Well
well, the cliche about the security of it, that's really true
We own a house, and  really like that, you know
And  like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some
Ann looks at Graham and stops
He smiles again
free-lance
You know
Yes
So you feel security, stability
Like things are going to last awhile
Oh, definitely
mean, just this past year has gone by like phew
hardly even knew it passed
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule
Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows
And then there are sections of time
Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality (if you have one)
For instance, when  was twelve, had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship
Now, 'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes
Ann is fascinated, if a bit overwhelmed
Oh, uh-huh
(smiles) Anyway,  think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
You mean like "time flies"
Exactly
would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things
Or could mean lots of things
How long has it been since you've seen John
Nine years
Nine years
Yes
was surprised that he accepted when  asked if  could stay here until  found a place
Why
Didn't you know him well
knew him very well
We were extremely close until  dropped out
pause
Why'd you drop out
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring
But, up until  dropped out, John and  were
very much alike
That's hard to believe
The two of you seem so different
would imagine that we are, now
think 'm ready to use the bathroom, finally
Graham gets up and heads for the toilet
Ann watches him go, a bemused smile on her face
After she hears the door close, she can't resist the impulse to take a closer look at Graham's bag
, Graham pokes around, looking through the medicine cabinet and sniffing towels
(voice over) Call the cops
11
'  -- John, Ann and Graham are eating dinner
(to Graham) That's the first thing that ran through my mind when  saw you
thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade
(to Graham) You did that
Everybody has a past
(smiles at Graham) What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing
bonfire, probably
John takes a sip of Chivas
(to Ann) This food is excellent
Thank you
Yeah, it's not bad
Usually Ann has some serious salt action going
keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out
(to Ann) You have family here also
(nods, chewing) Mother, father, sister
Sister older or younger
Younger
John takes a large swig of Chivas
Are you close
Graham sees Ann and John exchange looks
'm sorry
Am  prying again
You were prying before
Yes, this afternoon
was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon
(smiles) Really
How'd it go
She held up very well
Ann laughs
(to Ann) So  was asking about your sister
Ann's smile fades
John resumes eating
Oh, we get along okay
She's just very
she's an extrovert
think she's loud
She probably wouldn't agree
Definitely wouldn't agree
(to Graham) Are you going to see Elizabeth while you re here
An almost imperceptible reaction by Graham
don't know
(interested) Who's Elizabeth
Girl Graham dated
Still lives here, far as  know
Graham eats in silence
Graham and  were talking about apartments and  told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff
(to Graham) Stay away from the Garden District
Serious crime
don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere
wish  didn't have to live someplace
(laughs) What do you mean
Graham thinks a moment, then puts his keyring with its single key onto the table
Well, see, right now  have this one key, and  really like that
Everything  own is in my car
If  get an apartment, that's two keys
If  get a job, maybe have to open and close once in awhile, that's more keys
Or buy some stuff and  m worried about getting ripped off, so get some locks, and that's more keys
just really like having the one key
It's clean, you know
Graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key
like having the car, the car is important
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry
Or go someplace in a hurry
Ann takes her plate into the kitchen
(smiles at Graham) Do you pay taxes
Graham also stands, empty plate in hand
Do  pay taxes
Of course  pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, 'm not a liar
liar is the second lowest form of human being
(from the kitchen) What's the first
Lawyers
John smiles, thinking
Graham follows Ann into the kitchen
John shouts after them
Hey, Ann, why don't you go with Graham to hunt for apartments
Show him how the city has changed
Ann looks at Graham
Would you mind
No
(shouts back to John) Okay,  will
John, sitting at the table and now toying with his keyring, nods
12
'  -- Everyone but Ann is asleep
She gets up from her bed and sneaks quietly into the guest bedroom where Graham is staying
She walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps
Moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully
Exhaling, he turns over slowly, his back to Ann
She picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the surface
She brings the jacket to her nose, inhaling his presence
She then sets the jacket down
13
'  -- The phone rings
Cynthia answers
Hello
Cynthia
John
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour
You are scum
'll be there
14
- Graham and Ann walk around the room, their footfalls heavy on the hardwood floors
, the landlord, stands nearby
He looks fairly interested in Ann
Plenty of room for two people
It'll just be me
Student
No
(pause) You said three-fifty
Plus first and last month deposit
Will you lease month-to-month
Not for three-fifty
How about for five hundred
Mr
Miller looks at Ann, then back at Graham
That  can do
15
'  -- Cynthia lets herself in
She looks around
John
(offscreen) In here
Cynthia walks to the bedroom, where John lies naked on the bed
She smiles, kicking off her shoes
Ain't you a picture
Cynthia begins taking her clothes off
She places her diamond stud earring in her jacket pocket, and then drops the jacket on the floor
She moves onto the bed with John
(voice over) Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes
(voice over) How do you mean
16
- Graham and Ann are having lunch
Ann looks to have had a lot of wine
Graham drinks club soda with a twist
It's hard to explain
It's like
John treats everybody the same, you know
mean, he acts just as excited about seeing somebody he hardly knows as he does when he sees me
And so  feel like, what's different about me, if 'm treated exactly the same as some acquaintance
If  don't like somebody,  don't act like  do
guess that's why a lot of people think 'm a bitch
She takes a sip of wine
Yeah,  know
mean, 'm not saying  know people think you're a bitch, 'm saying  know what you mean
And  don't even know that people think you're a bitch
Do they
feel like they do
Hmm
Well, maybe you are
Really, wouldn't pay much attention
Ann smiles
know that  just don't feel a connection with very many people, so  don't waste time with people don't feel one with
Right, right
don't feel connected to many people, either
Other than John
Graham nods
Can  tell you something personal
feel like  can
It's something couldn't tell John
Or wouldn't, anyway
It's up to you
But  warn you, if you tell me something personal, might do the same
Okay
think
think sex is overrated
think people place way too much importance on it
And  think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap
m not saying women don't want it,  just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do
(smiles) 'm getting confused
Graham smiles
Do you understand what 'm trying to say
think so
remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love
Yes
Yes
think that's very true
Very
Graham watches Ann take a sip of wine
So what about kids
Kids
What about them
Do you want them
Yeah, actually,  do
But John doesn't
At least not right now
Why is that
don't know, he just said he wants to wait
quit asking
Graham nods
So what's your personal thing
Are you really going to tell me something personal
Do you want me to
As long as it's not
gross, you know
Like some scar or something
It has to be like mine, like something about you
Agreed
Graham takes a sip of club soda
'm impotent
Ann looks at him closely
You're what
Impotent
You are
Well, let me put it this way: cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person
So, for all practical purposes, am impotent
Ann takes a large sip of wine
Graham lights a cigarette
Does it bother you
(exhales) Not usually
mean, honestly, haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so  feel 'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes
Well
are you self-conscious about it
am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are
You have got to be the most attractive self-conscious person 've ever seen
Why do you say 'm self-conscious
Well, 've been watching you
've watched you eat, 've watched you speak, 've watched the way you move, and  see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at
think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time
And you know what
What
They are looking at you
Ann, you are truly breathtaking
don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people
Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you
And those that don't or can't resent you
And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse
(thinks) My therapist said that-- You're in therapy
Aren't you
Hah
No, 'm not
Actually,  used to be, but the therapist  had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems
Of course,  lied to him constantly, so  guess  can't hold him totally responsible
So you don't believe in therapy
believe in it for some people
mean, for me it was silly, was confused going in
So  just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately
Well, my therapist knows me intimately
(surprised) You had sex with you therapist
Of course not
Oh, see,  meant someone you've had sex with
That's part of the theory
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know
(smiles) Well,  wasn't always impotent
Ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right
Basically, yes
17
'  -- Cynthia is leaving the house
She gives John a big kiss
(voice over) So since 've never had sex with you, by your own advice  shouldn't accept your advice
(voice over) That's correct
(pause) Bit of a dilemma, isn't it
Cynthia is not wearing her diamond stud earring
18
'  -- Well,  don't know
The week started off okay, but then  was outside watering the plants, and started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so  went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until  started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and-- Radon leakage
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and--you've never heard of this
No,  haven't
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you
(pause) knew  shouldn't have watered those plants
Did you confront John about the visitor
What visitor
The friend of John's that was staying at your house
Oh, Graham
No,  didn't talk to him about that
Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting
expected Graham to be this
well, like John, you know
mean, he said they had gone to school together, so  was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff
But he turned out to be this
this kind of character, mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know
Is he still at your house
No, he left last week
Did you find him attractive
What do you mean, like physically
Let me rephrase
Were you attracted to him
(thinks) guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything
He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with
'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know
It's just boring
don't know, he was just different
And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and like that,  felt comfortable around him
(pause) After he left  had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room
(voice over) So where's he from
19
'  -- Ann stands watching Cynthia get dressed for work
don't know
He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around
Must be nice
So, what's he like, is he like John
No, not at all
Actually,  don't think John likes him much anymore
He said he thought Graham had gotten strange
pause
Is he
Strange,  mean
Not really
Maybe if  just saw him on the street 'd have said that, but after talking to him
he's just kind of
don't know, unusual
Uh-huh
So what's he look like
Why
just want to know what he looks like, is all
Why, so you can go after him
Jesus, Ann, get a life
just asked what he looked like
Ann says nothing
Besides, even if  decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours
Do you have to say that
What
You know what
You say it just to irritate me
say it because it's descriptive
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway
Ann, you always underestimate me
Well,  wonder why
think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together
think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me
Oh, for God's sake
Really, Cynthia, really,  don't think he's your type
"My type"
What is this bullshit
How would you know what "my type" is
have a pretty good idea
Ann, you don't have a clue
Look, don't even know why we're discussing this, 'll just call him myself
He doesn't have a phone
Well, 'll call him when he does
But he won't
What are you talking about
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone
Oh, please
Okay,' so give me the Zen master's address, 'll think of a reason to stop by
Let me talk to him first
Why
Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved
don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
And what
And
do whatever it is you do
Cynthia laughs loudly
Ann, not happy, watches her dig through the jewelry box
Lose something
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday
don't know, 'll get her a card or something
card
For her fiftieth birthday
What's wrong with that
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card
mean, the woman gave birth to you
It s her fiftieth birthday-- Will you stop
Jesus
just thought it might-- Okay, Ann, okay
How about this: you buy her something nice, and 'll pay for half
All right
Fine
Good
Now, if you'll pardon me, have to go to work
20
'  -- was thinking maybe  shouldn't be in therapy anymore
What brought this on
've been thinking about it for awhile, and then  was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me
(smiles) thought that's what  did
Who was it that you talked to
That guy Graham  told you about
He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was
well, he said a lot of stuff
The Doctor exhales, thinking for a moment
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas
(pause) Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy
What do you mean
don't understand
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists
Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does
Do you think that's possible
guess
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time
Yes
That you are under no obligation to me
Yes
Do you want to leave therapy
Not really
Do you feel there is more progress to be made
Yes
'm glad you feel that way, because feel that way, too
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right
The Doctor laughs
Ann does not laugh with him
21
'  -- On a television monitor we see images originating from an 8mm Video deck
Graham sits naked in a sheet-covered chair facing the screen
He watches the tape, which is footage of himself interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences
The photography on the tape is handheld, relentless
As the questions get more detailed, Graham becomes more aroused
There is a knock on Graham's door
He calmly shuts off the videotape player and stands, wrapping the sheet around himself
It's open
Graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes
Ann opens the door and walks into the apartment
Hi
(off) Ann
Hello
Are you in the middle of something
(off) Nothing  can't finish later
(looks) just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
(Off) Not much to see, 'm afraid
'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe
Somehow  imagined books
thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time
Graham enters
do read a lot
But  check everything out of the library
Graham picks up an Anais Nin diary and opens it to show Ann the library sleeve inside
Cheaper that way
And cuts down on the clutter
Ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up
Graham watches her closely
She looks into a large box of 8mm videotapes
On the side of each tape is a label
The labels look like this: / 11  86 / 1:07:36 And so on
There are thirty or forty tapes, total
What are these
Videotapes
(smiles) can see that
What are they
Graham exhales
It's a personal project 'm working on
What kind of personal project
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project
Mine's just a little more personal
Who's Donna
Donna
Donna
On this tape it says "Donna"
(thinking) Donna was a girl  knew in Florida
You went out with her
Not really
Ann looks in the box again
How come all these are girl's names
Graham thinks for a moment
Because  enjoy interviewing women more than men
All of these are interviews
Yes
Can we look at one
No
Why not
Because  promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me
Ann looks at Graham for a long moment, then back at the tapes
What
what are these interviews about
The
interviews are about sex, Ann
About sex
Yes
What about sex
Everything about sex
Like what
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked
Anything  can think of
You just ask them questions
Yes
And they just answer them
Mostly
Sometimes they do things
To you
No, not to me, for me, for the camera
(stunned) don't
why
why do you do this
'm sorry this came up
This is just
so
Maybe you want to go
Yes,  do
Ann nods and absently heads for the door
She gives Graham a puzzled look before leaving
22
'  -- Ann is talking to Cynthia on the telephone
(still shaken) don't
he doesn't want you to come over
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over
Did you tell him about me
No,  didn't
Why not
Because  never got around to it
Well, why
Because
Cynthia, look, John was right
Graham is strange
Very strange
You don't want to get involved with him
What the hell happened over there
Did he make a pass at you
No
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden
Is he drowning puppies, or what
No, it's nothing like that
Well, what
Is he dangerous
No, he's not dangerous
Not physically
Well, what, then
don't want to talk about it
Then why'd you call me
don't know
Ann hangs up
23
'  -- Cynthia gets out of the shower
The phone rings
She wraps herself in a towel and lifts the receiver
Hello
Cynthia
John
Not today
've got other plans
Oh
(pause) Well, when, then
How about inviting me over to dinner
You know what  mean
Yeah,  know what you mean
Cynthia hangs up the phone
24
'  -- Graham sits smoking a cigarette
There is a knock at his door
It's open
Cynthia enters
Graham looks up at her
Who are you
'm Cynthia Bishop
Do  know you
'm Ann Millaney's sister
The extrovert
(smiles) She must have been in a good mood when she said that
She usually calls me loud
She called you that, too
May ask why you re here
You want me to leave
just want to know why you're here
Well, like  said, Ann is my sister
Sisters talk
You can imagine the rest
No,  really can't
find it healthy never to characterize people  don't know or conversations  haven't heard
don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else
Last time  saw Ann she left here very
confused, would say
And upset
She still is
And are you here to berate me for making her that way
Nope
She didn't tell you why she was upset
Nope
She didn't give you my address
Nope
How did you find me
, uh, know a guy at the power company
don't understand
Why did you want to come here
mean,  can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me
Well,  don't really listen to her when it comes to men
mean, look at John, for crissake
Oh, you went to school with him didn't you
You're probably friends or something
Nope
think the man is a liar
(smiles) think you're right
So come on, came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened
(smiles) Spooked
He motions to the box of videotapes
That box of tapes is what got Ann so "spooked"
Cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long moment, studying the labels
Oh, okay
think  get it
What do you get
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit
Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something
Not exactly
Well, either you are or you aren't
Which is it
Why don't you let me tape you
Doing what
Talking
About what
Sex
Your sexual history, your sexual preferences
What makes you think 'd discuss that with you
Nothing
You just want to ask me questions
just want to ask you questions
And that's all
That's all
(a crooked smile) Is this how you get off or something
Taping women talking about their sexual experiences
Yes
Would anybody else see the tape
Absolutely not
They are for my private use only
How do we start
turn on the camera
You start talking
And you ask questions, right
Yes
How long will it take
That depends on you
One woman only used three minutes
Another filled up three two hour tapes
Can  see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what-- No
(thinks) Do  sit or stand
Whichever you prefer
'd rather sit
Are you ready
Just a moment
Graham grabs his 8mm Video camera, puts in a new tape, and turns it on
am now recording
Tell me your name
Cynthia Patrice Bishop
Describe for me your first sexual experience
My first sexual experience or the first time  had intercourse
Your first sexual experience
(thinks) was
eight years old
Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee
said he could if  could watch him take one, too
He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house
got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first
" So  pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before  even finished
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward
No
He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away
To Cleveland, actually
How unfortunate
So when did you finally get to see a penis
When  was fourteen
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort
Very much live
What did you think
Did it look like you expected
Not really
didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, thought it would be smooth, like a test tube
Were you disappointed
No
If anything, after  looked at it awhile, it got more interesting
It had character, you know
What about when you touched it
What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like
It was warmer than  thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked
It's weird
Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me
mean, after he pulled it out and  could look at it and touch it,  completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me
What did he say
He said that my hand felt good
Then what happened
Then  started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking
25
'  -- Cynthia, adjusting her clothes, opens the door to leave
She looks very aroused
She and Graham do not speak or touch
26
-- John Millaney picks up a telephone and presses a blinking button
John Millaney
want to see you
When
Right now
Jesus,  don't know if  can get away
've got a client waiting
'd have to do some heavy duty juggling
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here
She hangs up
John thinks a moment, then hits his intercom button
Janet, re-schedule Kirkland, see if he can come in Friday
Smooth things out, tell him an emergency came up
'll slip out the back
27
'  -- Graham watches Cynthia's tape, becoming excited
(voice on tape) Would you like me to take my pants off
(voice on tape) If you wish
(pause) You're not wearing any underwear
(voice on tape) Do you like the way  look
(voice on tape) Yes
(voice On tape) Do you think 'm pretty
(voice on tape) Yes
(voice on tape) Prettier than Ann
(voice on tape) Different
28
'  -- Cynthia and John are having sex
(to Graham, voice on tape) John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore
(voice On tape) Is that what he tells you
(voice on tape) He doesn't have to tell me
Cynthia has an intense orgasm
She rolls off of John, sweating
Jesus Christ
You are on fire today
Cynthia smiles
Yes
You can go now
(voice over) If you won't talk to me,  can't help you
moment of silence
John is starting to put his clothes on
Cynthia lies in bed, her eyes closed, her face serene
(voice over) hate my sister
29
'  -- Why
(rambling) Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and  just hate her she's such a little slut thought that in high school and think that now
Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal
mean, it's okay and everything, but don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that
30
'  -- Ann lies awake in bed beside John, who is sound asleep
(voice over) There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad
Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs
(voice over) know, but this
just feel like everybody  know right now is obsessed with sex
Ann looks over at John
She slowly reaches under the covers and grasps his penis
Without waking, he rolls over and turns his back to her
She returns to looking at the ceiling
(voice over) Except John,  guess
31
'  -- Ann is talking to Cynthia on the phone
Ann looks very morose
He just asked me questions
What kinds of questions
Questions about sex
Well, like what did he ask, exactly
pause
Well, like,  don't want to tell you, exactly
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister
Apparently
Did he ask you to take your clothes off
Did he ask me to take my clothes off
No, he didn't
Did you take your clothes off
Yes,  did
(floored) Cynthia
What
Why did you do that
Because  wanted to
But why did you want to
wanted him to see me
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up
He could be
bouncing it off some satellite or something
Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it
He wouldn't do that
You don't know that for sure
Well, it's too late now, isn't it
Did he touch you
No, but  did
You touched him
No,  touched me
Wait a minute
Do you mean
don't tell me you
in front of him
In front of him, Ann, yes
(serious) You are in trouble
(laughs) Listen to you
You sound like Mom
What are you talking about
(outraged) can t believe you did that
Why
mean,  couldn't do that in front of John, even
You couldn't do it, period
You know what  mean, you don't even know him
feel like  do
That doesn't mean you do
You can't possibly trust him, he's
perverted
He's harmless
He just sits around and looks at these tapes
What's the big deal
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves
That doesn't make you feel weird
No
don't think they all did what  did
You are in serious trouble
Ann,  don't understand why this freaks you out so much
You didn't do it,  did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you
don't want to discuss it
Then why do you keep asking about it
32
-- sparse daytime crowd
Cynthia serves a beer to some
He puts the money down on the bar and looks at her
(as Marlon Brando) Are you an assassin
Excuse me
(still Brando) You're an errand boy
sent by grocery clerks
to collect a bill
Ann enters the lounge, carrying a package
(to Cynthia) Brando, it's Brando, come on
It's great
Pardon me
Cynthia moves down the bar to meet Ann
wish you'd get an answering machine
There's a phone here
It was busy
Ann opens the package, revealing a lovely sun dress
Here it is
What is it
It's a sun dress
It looks like a tablecloth
It does not
Well, why would she want a sun dress
She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins
So will you, someday
Yeah, and when  do,  won't be wearing sun dresses
The lounge phone rings
was just trying to-- Hold on
Cynthia walks to the other end of the bar to answer the phone
The Dude watches her pass
Then he turns to Ann and gives her the once-over
He spots the present
Nice dress
Ann says nothing
Wanna hear my Walter Matthau
You'll love this
(as Matthau) "Feeelix, what are you, craaazee
" (back to normal) Pretty good, huh
Cynthia picks up the phone
Hello
Cynthia
John
Well, this is timely
Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her
She's there
What's she doing there
She came by to show me a present that she and  are buying for your mother-in-law
Oh
When can  see you
don't know
'm not sure  can duplicate the level of intensity had the other day
Nothing wrong with trying
don't think my sister would agree
pause
Do you want me to stop calling
Look, 'll call you, okay
Cynthia hangs up and walks back to Ann
So what's my share of the dress
Thirty-two dollars
Cynthia pulls thirty-five bucks out of her jeans
She watches Ann put the money away
Look, don't worry about the dress, 'm sure she'll love it
(to Ann and Cynthia) Hey
How about Tom Brokaw
Nobody does Brokaw
(as Tom Brokaw) "In Iran today
" 33 34
'  -- Graham sits reading a book
There is a knock at his door
It s open
Cynthia enters the room, looking very intent on something
Hello
Hi
Graham sets his book down
He looks at her for a moment, then drags on his cigarette
Look, 'm just going to come right out and tell you why 'm here, okay
Okay
'd like to make another tape
Graham thinks for a moment
No
No
Not even one more
never do more than one
'm sorry
can't talk you into it
No
You'll have to get somebody else
Now who the hell is going to do that for me
'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer
But  want you to do it,  want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything
Ouch
Okay,  deserved that
Cynthia, don't you understand
After the first time it's just not spontaneous
There's no edge anymore
Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label
have never taped anyone twice
So make an exception
No
How about if you record over the one we already made
You could have the same date and not use another tape
Who would know
would
Well, what the hell am  supposed to do
Cynthia,  don't know
can't believe you're doing this after  let you tape me
'm sorry
can't do it
Goddamit, give me my tape, then
No
Cynthia heads for the tape box
Graham leaps up to stop her
(digging through the box) It's my fucking tape, you asshole-- Graham grabs her wrists momentarily
(heated) No
told you what the parameters were and you agreed
It's my tape
look at it,  touch it, nobody else
Cynthia and Graham look at each other for a long moment
Please go, 'd like you to go now
Cynthia looks at him
Sure, okay
She leaves
35
'  -- John and Ann lie in bed
The lights are out
Ann is wide awake, while John is on the verge of sleep
He rolls over and puts his arm around her
She gets up and sits in a chair opposite the bed
John
Mmmmm
called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in
Do you remember where you were
: 36
'  -- John and Cynthia are in Cynthia's bed, kissing
On the floor, John's watch reads 3:11 pm
: 37
'  -- Tuesday
had a late lunch
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in
: 38
'  -- John leaves Cynthia's house and drives straight home, greeting Ann as he steps through the front door
: 39
'  -- Yes
just got busy
That's interesting, because didn't leave a message
John is waking up a little
Then maybe  saw an old message
There are a lot of them on my desk, you know
Who'd you have lunch with
ate by myself
pause
Something wrong
Are you having an affair
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from
have a late lunch by myself and now 'm fucking somebody
Well, are you
No, 'm not
Frankly, 'm offended at the accusation
If 'm right,  want to know
don't want you to lie
'd be very upset, but not as upset as if 'd found out you'd been lying
There's nothing to know, Ann
can't tell you how upset  would be if you were lying
Ann, you are completely paranoid
Not ten minutes ago  wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like 'm dipped in shit
You know,  think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on
My sister, for one
Is that who it is
For God's sake, Ann,  am not fucking your sister
don't find her that attractive, for one
Is that supposed to comfort me
was just saying, you know didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love
could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair
But 'm not
'm not either
Why don't  believe you
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous
Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition
Always the lawyer
Goddam right
mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, 'm positive this man is guilty
can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but  have this really strong feeling
" You've made your point
'm sorry
It's just
'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and  work all day,  come home,  look forward to seeing you, and
it hurts that you accuse me like that
pause
Ann exhales
'm sorry, too
get these ideas in my head, you know, and have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios
And then want to believe it so  don't think 've wasted the whole day
Last week  was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, don't know why
don't, either
mean, Cynthia, of all people
She's so
Loud
Yeah
Jeez, give me some credit
didn't say it was rational, just said  was convinced
Isn't therapy helping at all
don't know
Sometimes  feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia
know
pause
You never used to say "fucking"
40 41
'  -- John sits on the edge of Cynthia's bed, slowly undressing
It's just so blatantly stupid, have a hard time believing you did it
What's so stupid about it
That you
you don't even know the guy
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted
Shit, after what you've told me, don't know
should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat
like the way he dresses
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands
"The wrong hands"
We're not talking about military secrets, John
They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off
Jesus Christ
And he doesn't have sex with any of them
They just talk
Right
Jesus
could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something
Doesn't work
He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them
Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake
mean
pause
felt like it, so what
Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it
You told Ann about this
Of course
She is my sister tell her almost everything
wish you hadn't done that
Why not
It's just something 'd prefer she didn't know about
She's a grown-up, she can handle it
just
Ann is very
Hung up
It just wasn't a smart thing to do
Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes
No
You realize you have no recourse legally
This stuff could show up anywhere
It won't
trust him
(disbelieving) You trust him
Yeah,  do
helluva lot more than  trust you
What do you mean
Exactly what  said
'd trust him before 'd trust you
How much clearer can  be
It hurts that you would say that to me
(laughs) Oh, please
Come on, John
You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year
You're a liar
But at least  know you're a liar
It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out
By definition you're lying to Ann, too
That's right
But  never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister
Look, are we going to do it or not
Actually, no, 've changed my mind
shouldn't have called
(ingratiating) Well, 'm here now
'd like to do something
How about straightening up the living room
John doesn't smile
Come on, John
You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, 'm making it real easy on you
Just walk out of here and 'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime
Did he put you up to this
Who
Graham
No, he didn't put me up to this
Jesus,  don't need people to tell me what  should do
've just been thinking about things, that's all
can't believe  let him stay in my house
Right under my nose
That deviant fucker was right under my nose and  didn't see him
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure
(looks at her) God, you
you're mean
know
Will you please leave now
Maybe  don't want to leave
Maybe want to talk
John, we have nothing to talk about
knew it,  knew it
Things are getting complicated
No, John, things are getting real simple
42
'  -- Ann, dressed in some of John's work clothes (old cotton shirt, khaki pants) is cleaning the house
Not cleaning like a normal person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person
Scrubbing spots that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over and over, etc
Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise
Shutting the machine off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller
Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment
: Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having sex with John
The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces under the edge of the bed
: Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to pieces
She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a diamond
Ann looks down at herself
Suddenly realizing that she is dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and pants from her body as though the material were burning her skin
Popped buttons skid across the floor
Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle of the bedroom floor, arms around herself
43
'  -- Ann, now in jeans and t-shirt, stumbles to her car
Once inside, she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against the steering wheel
44
'  -- Ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up
She looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to Graham's
Slowly, she gets out of the car
45
'  -- Graham sits reading
There is a weak knock at the door
Graham listens, not sure he heard anything
There is a second weak knock
It's open
Nothing happens
Graham gets up and opens the door himself
Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her breathing deliberate
Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead her inside
Impulsively, she hugs him tightly
Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly at his side
Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits down
Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of water
He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite
Ann holds the glass in her hand, staring at it
It's bottled, not tap
weak smile from Ann
She drinks, swallowing with difficulty
'm not sure why  came here had kind of decided not to talk to you after
you know
know
pause
That son of a bitch
Ann looks at Graham
(sarcastic) John and Cynthia have been
"fucking"
know
(stunned) You know
Yes
How did you know
She said it on her tape
(angry) Why didn't you tell me
Ann, when would  have told you
We were not speaking, if you recall
Ann says nothing
But even if we had been speaking, wouldn't have told you
Why not
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann
You have to find out by yourself or from John directly
You have to trust me on this
Ann shakes her head
My life is
shit
It's all shit
It's like somebody saying, "Okay, chairs are not chairs, they're actually swimming pools"  mean, nothing is what  thought it was
What happened to me
Have  been asleep
vaguely remember the wedding, but a lot of it is just a blur
like  was watching from a distance
can't believe him
Why didn't  trust my intuition
Graham says nothing
And 'm vacuuming his goddam rug
His rug, that he paid to have put in his house
Nothing in that place belongs to me
wanted to put some of my grandmother's furniture in it, but he wouldn't let me
So  m vacuuming his rug
That bastard
Ann looks at Graham
want to make a tape
pause
Do you think that's such a good idea
Don't you want to make one
Yes
But  sense the element of revenge here
What difference does it make why do it
want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind
What would you know about a normal frame of mind
(impressed) That's a good question
What do you have to do to get ready
Load a new tape, turn the camera on
Then do it
Graham opens a new box of videotapes
How do you pay for all this mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment
have money
What will you do when the money runs out
It won't
Are you ready
Yes
Graham turns the camera on
Tell me your name
Ann Bishop Millaney
: : 46
'  -- Street lights are illuminated
Night is imminent
47
'  -- Graham stops the video recorder
The record meter is stopped at 46:02
Ann sits beside Graham on the couch
She looks into his eyes, stroking his hair
After a moment, she gets up to leave
48
'  -- John is talking on the phone as Ann walks through the door
He mumbles an apology into the receiver and hangs up as Ann moves to the couch, her expression calm
(worried) Jesus Christ
What the hell happened
came home and your car was gone, the door was open,  thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker,  was literally just calling the cops when you walked in
What happened
want out of this marriage
(genuinely shocked) What
(looks at him) want out of this marriage
Why
We'll call it uncontested or whatever
just want out
John moves to sit beside her on the couch
Ann does not look at him
(conciliatory) Ann, honey, please, tell me what's wrong
Don't just say you want out and leave me wondering
You can't just go without telling me why
Ann turns to look at him for a moment, then turns away
Fuck you
can do what  want
John's mouth literally hangs open in shock
He is dumbstruck
'll stay at my mother's
John gets up from the couch and begins pacing
Where did you go when you left here
drove around
Then  went to talk with Graham
John smacks his hand on his leg
Goddammit, goddammit
That son of a bitch
(thinking) Well, at least  know you didn't fuck him
No, but  wanted to
really wanted to, partially just to piss you off
John is seething
You're leaving me for him, aren't you
Well, that makes a sad sort of sense
He can't, and you won't
'm not going to discuss this with you anymore
You're making no sense
John walks over to Ann
Did you make one of those goddam tapes
Ann says nothing
Answer me, godammit
Did you make one of those tapes
Yes
John explodes, hitting the wall all around Ann
She cowers beneath the storm
John bolts from the house
'
49
'  - Graham stands in the middle of the room with a cigarette in his mouth, trying to teach himself to moonwalk
50
'  -- John screeches to a halt, parking haphazardly
He gets out of the car and runs to Graham's apartment
51
'  -- John bursts through the door without bothering to knock
Graham looks up, startled
Before he can even react, John has him by the lapels
Hi, John
Where are the tapes, Graham
What tapes
You know which tapes
Where are they
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property
So is my wife, asshole
She's not property, John, she's a person
Were you just going to keep right on lying to her
What the hell do you think love Ann
You think 'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that
God, you need help
need help
Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham
Not me, buddy
You're the fucking nut
Now show me those tapes
No
'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what  say
Give me those tapes
No
John punches Graham in the jaw, knocking him to the floor
Graham feels his mouth for blood as John picks him up by the shirt
Graham,  swear to Christ 'll kill your scrawny ass
Now give me those tapes
No
John roughly pushes Graham into one of the director's chairs, which topples over and throws Graham to the floor once again
John looks around
He sees the boxes of tapes and begins to go through the contents
Graham gets up and runs over to stop him
Get away from those
They belong to me
Graham and John struggle
John hits Graham in the stomach and pushes him to the floor
Give me your keys
My keys
John bends over and starts going through Graham's pockets
Your keys, asshole
Your two fucking keys
Give them to me
'm not going to give you my keys
John beats Graham until Graham can offer no resistance
He then drags Graham into the hallway and leaves him there
John then locks himself inside Graham's apartment
John walks over to the boxes of videotapes and begins to search through them spastically
He finds both Cynthia and Ann's tapes
After a brief deliberation, he decides to watch Ann's
He turns on the player and the monitor
After pulling a chair up to the screen, John presses the button marked "play"
In the hallway, Graham drags himself to the door of his apartment
Putting his ear to the inlet, he strains to hear what is going on inside
John watches the monitor come to life
The image is Ann, sitting in a chair
(on tape) Tell me your name
(on tape) Ann Bishop Millaney
(on tape) You are married, correct
Goddam right
(on tape) Yes
(on tape) Who usually initiates sex
John's jaw tightens
Bastard
(on tape) He does
(on tape) Do you talk to him
(on tape) When we're making love
(on tape) Yes
(on tape) Sometimes
Afterward
(on tape) Does he go down on you
(shouting at Graham) You son of a bitch
(on tape) Not very often
(on tape) would
John is literally so mad he can't speak
He watches the screen in mute anger, his hands wrapped tightly around the arms of the chair
Graham still listens from the hallway
(on tape) Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband
Goddamit
Ann hesitates
(to Ann's image) Answer him, goddammit
(on tape) You're hesitating
think that means you have
(to Graham on tape) Shut up
(on tape) You don't know what 'm thinking
(on tape) It's a simple question
Have you ever thought of having--making love with someone other than your husband
John leans forward
(on tape) Is he going to see this
(on tape) Absolutely not
sarcastic chuckle from John
In the hallway, Graham furrows his brow
(on tape) have thought about it, yes
(to Ann's image) You bitch
knew it
(on tape) Did you have sex before you were married
(on tape) Yes
(on tape) Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband
(to Graham) God damn you
(on tape) Yes
John stands and throws his chair against the door
Graham, still listening at the door, is startled
(on tape) And you have thought about
making love to that person again since you ve been married
John watches the monitor, his eyes beginning to water
(on tape) don't see what difference it makes,  mean,  can think what want
(pause) don't know if  want to do this anymore, 'm afraid
don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this
(on tape) At some level,  don't understand your nervousness
Have you decided to leave John
Ann thinks
John watches
(on tape) Yes,  have
will
(on tape) Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about
(on tape) guess not
(on tape) Do you want me to stop
John, absorbed in the image, absently shakes his head
(on tape) No
(on tape) Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about
pause
(on tape) Yes
Whenever
all right, look
Whenever  see a man that  think is attractive,  wonder what it would be like with him,  mean, 'm just curious,  don't act on it, but  hate that  think that
wish  could just forget about that stuff
(on tape) Why
(on tape) Because that's how Cynthia thinks
All she does is think about that stuff, and  hate that,  don't want to be like her,  don't want to be like her
(on tape) You're not like your sister
You couldn't be like her if you wanted to
(on tape) know
Deep down,  know that
It just bothers me, when  have feelings or impulses that she has
John picks up the chair he threw and sets it upright
He sits down and watches the screen impassively
Graham still listens from outside
(on tape) So you do fantasize
(on tape) Yes
(on tape) About who
(on tape) fantasized about you
(on tape) About me
(on tape) Yes
pause
(on tape) Have you fantasized about me
(on tape) thought  made that clear before, when  said  would go down on you
(on tape) remember
You could do that, couldn't you
Go down on me
(on tape) Yes
(on tape) If  asked you to, would you
Not on tape,  mean
(on tape) No
(on tape) On tape
(on tape) No
(on tape) Why not
(on tape) If  can't do it all,  don't want to do anything
And  can't do it all
(on tape) Can't or won't
pause
John is still watching the tape, his face betraying no emotion
Graham still listens from outside
: The previous afternoon
We are no longer looking at Ann on the monitor, but watching her and Graham
For instance, we can now see Graham from Ann's point of view, or the two of them at the same time, etc
Can't
You said you weren't always impotent
That's correct
So you have had sex
Yes
Who was the last person you had sex with
Her name was Elizabeth
So what happened
Was it so bad that it turned you off
No, it was wonderful
That wasn't the problem
What was the problem
The problem was me
was
was a pathological liar
Or am, should say
Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering"
So you lied to her
Yes
did
Willfully and repeatedly
How come
loved her for how good she made me feel, and  hated her for how good she made me feel
And at that time,  tended to express my feelings non-verbally
couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions
And now you can
Now  make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
Don't you get lonely
How could , with all these nice people stopping by
The fact is that 've lived by myself for so long,  can't imagine living with another person
It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by
And anyway, 'm asking the questions
Are you happy
don't know anymore
thought was, but obviously  was wrong
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him
Not yet
'm not sure  will just want out
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited
don't know
It all gets back to that Cynthia thing
don't like her
eagerness
There's nothing left to imagine, there's no
Subtlety
Subtlety, yes
No subtlety
Plus, 've never really felt able to open up with anyone
mean, that other person  told you about, enjoyed making love with him a lot, but  still wasn't able to really let go
always feel like 'm being watched and shouldn't embarrass myself
And you feel the same way with John
Kind of
mean, John's like this kind of
craftsman
Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables
But that's all he can make, and  don't need anymore tables
Interesting analogy
'm babbling
No, you're not
(thinking) God,  m so mad at him
You should be
He lied to you
So did Cynthia
Yeah,  know, but somehow  expect that from her,  mean, she'll do it with almost anybody,  don't know,  shouldn't stick up for her  guess, but him
He lied so
deeply
Ooo,  want to watch him die
Ann sits quietly for a moment
Graham watches her silently
The camera continues to roll
(looks up at Graham) You're really never going to make love again
'm not planning on it
pause
If you were in love with me, would you
'm not in love with you
But if you were
can't answer that precisely
But  feel like maybe  could be really comfortable with you
That's very flattering
So why won't you make love with me
Why wouldn't you,  mean
Ann
Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now
'm asking for real
want you to turn that camera off and make love with me
Will you
pause
can't
Why not
've told you
But  don't understand-- Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see
could start to-- But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig-- couldn't face her if  had slept with somebody else
pause
Who
Elizabeth
(uncomfortable) Yes
You mean you're still in contact with her
No
But you're planning to be
don't know
Possibly
Wait a minute, wait a minute
What's going on here
Did you come back here just to see her again
Not entirely
But that was part of it
Yes
Like maybe a big part
Possibly
Graham,  mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her
don't know
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed
Don't you think she will have changed
don't know
really would rather not talk about it
(has to laugh) Whoa
'm so glad we got that on tape
You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life
Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes
Are you going to tell her about them
can't imagine her being too understanding about that
But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something
As  said,  haven't decided what to do, exactly
Perhaps  won't do anything
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right
Graham says nothing
Ann looks at him
Oh, God, Graham, this is so
pathetic
You're not even what you pretend to be, you're a lie, you're a bigger lie than you ever were
Graham sets the camera down, though it continues to record
He is visibly upset
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann
Let's talk about lying to yourself
You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were
You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember
(heated) Yeah, you're right
But  never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories
'm still learning, know that
But  don't feel like 've wasted time
If  had to go through my marriage to get to where am right now, fine
Ann moves in closer, burrowing, her eyes on fire
But you
You have wasted nine years
mean, that has to be some sort of weird record or something, nine years
How does that feel
Graham says nothing
Ann picks up the camera and points it at him
Don't do that
Why not
Because
"Because"
That's not good enough
asked you a question, Graham
asked you "how does it feel"
How does it feel, Mr
Want To Go Down On You But  Can't
Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world
Including me
Come on, how does it feel
can't tell you like this
'm just going to keep asking until you answer
'm sure there's plenty of tape
don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting-- don't care
Graham reaches up for the camera
Ann knocks his hand away
Not until  get some answers
Tell what you feel
Not what you think, 've heard plenty of that
What you feel
Graham is on the verge of completely falling apart
Come on
All right
All right
You want to know
You want to know how feel
feel ashamed
Is that what you wanted to hear
pause
Graham regains his composure somewhat
Why are you ashamed
Jesus Christ, Ann
Why is anybody anything
think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of
You're not answering me
(heated) Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann
What is it exactly that you want to know
want to know why you are the way you are
And 'm telling you it's not any one thing that  can point to and say "That's why
" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy
It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count
Things just don't happen that way
But why can't you just put it all behind you
Can't you just forget it
All that stuff you did
No, Ann,  can't
can't forget it
It's not something  can fix
It's difficult
There s something in my mind
the way my brain works
[frustrated) God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you re
inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much
there's no protection
And
somebody could say, or do something to you while you re in this
state of
nakedness
And they could hurt you without even knowing it
In a way that you couldn't even see
(looks at Ann) And you would withdraw
To make sure it didn't happen again
Ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera down
She moves in front of Graham and kneels
want to touch you
Graham shakes his head
want to touch you
No
Ann reaches out, and Graham instinctively begins to move away
Graham
Something in her voice makes him stop
Their eyes lock
Graham slowly moves back toward her
Ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his
Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch
She caresses him
Slowly
Delicately
She touches his arms, his face, his hair
Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her face
She begins to lie him back on the couch
When he offers light resistance, she gently persists
Keep your eyes closed
Graham lies back, silently obeying
Ann touches his face
Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to unbutton his shirt
She watches his face, hoping that he will remain calm
He does
She rubs her hand on his chest
Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face
She moves his hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers
Soon each hand is exploring the other
Fingers search for and find hidden areas
Ann stands
Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed
Ann moves onto the couch with Graham
She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist
She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest
They move forward and back, like a lazy tide
She looks at Graham
His face is tranquil
Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his
Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching his features
She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him
She waits for a negative reaction
Getting none, she moves lower and kisses his eyes
Still receiving no discouragement, she moves to his nose
subtle movement from Graham
Ann waits for a moment
She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping his face
She kisses him lightly
She kisses him again
Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck
Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have reached her neck
He slowly pulls his face to hers
He kisses her
Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement
He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact
The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes more passionate
For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness
But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which continues to record
Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace
Reality slowly envelopes him
Graham
'm okay
It's okay
Ann reaches for his hand
He allows her to take it
(almost dazed) It's okay
Graham looks at Ann for a long moment
She sees the acceptance and gratitude in his eyes
She smiles lightly
Graham moves forward and shuts off the camera
: John watching the tape
There is video snow on the monitor now
The tape timer reads 46:02
John gets up slowly, ejects the tape from the player, and heads for the door
Graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the inlet
His eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in a curious position
John opens the door
He looks at Graham for a moment before reaching into his pocket for Graham's keys
He dangles them in his hand as he stands over Graham
never told you this, because thought it would crush you, but now  could give a shit
(pause) fucked Elizabeth
Before you broke up
Before you were having trouble, even
So you can stop making her into a saint
She was good in bed and she could keep a secret
And that's about all can say about her
John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves
Graham stands, fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment
He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player
He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape itself out, ruining it forever
He does the same to every other tape in both the boxes
Calmly
Deliberately
Methodically
He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of videotape behind him
He breaks the lens off the camera body, and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table
He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape, where it disappears
: : 52
-- John Millaney talks to his colleague
Man, not having to answer to anybody
feel like this huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders
mean, come on, if decide that 'd rather live alone, what's so bad about that
It's not like 've decided to live a life of crime, right
It's just how  feel, you can't help the way you feel, you just have to be honest about it
John dials a number on his telephone
(to phone) Brian Kirkland, please
May  ask who's calling
John Millaney
One moment
(to his colleague) Anyway, 've always said, the work is the thing
can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different
And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what 'm saying
mean, fuck
(looks at phone) Jesus, what's takin' this guy
The intercom clicks to life
(on speaker) Mr
Millaney
Yeah
(on speaker) Mr
Forman would like to see you in his office
Okay, in a minute, 'm on with a client
(on speaker) He said immediately
All right, jesus
The intercom clicks off
Mr
Millaney
Yes
Mr
Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me
John swallows
Thank you
there is no message
Thank you
John hangs up
He thinks for a moment, rubbing his forehead
The intercom clicks to life
(on speaker) Mr
Millaney, Mr
Forman is waiting
(voice over) Come on, 'm not asking too much, am
Just one little question
53
-- Cynthia is tending bar
The Dude from earlier is still there, puffing On a big cigar
Just tell me what time you get off
Work,  mean
What's the harm in that
Whaddaya say
Ann enters the lounge
Cynthia watches with apprehensive surprise as Ann approaches with a potted plant
(to Dude) Excuse me
Cynthia moves to meet Ann at the end of the bar
Ann sets the plant down on the counter
Her manner is diffident, but not hostile
know it's your birthday, and know you like plants
So  got you this
Cynthia is very moved, though she struggles valiantly to conceal her emotions
Thank you
Well
can't stay
Ann begins to leave
Can  call you
Ann turns back to face her
They look at each other for a moment
Do you have my work number
No
Ann writes the number down on a napkin
get real busy between two and four
Okay
Ann looks at Cynthia again before leaving
Bye
Bye
Ann leaves
Cynthia continues to look at the door long after Ann has left
Nice plant
Cynthia turns to him
Do me a favor
Don't come in here anymore
54 55
'  -- Graham sits reading
There is now some furniture in the apartment
Bookshelves, plants, etc
There are periodicals on the table where the video gear used to be
There are no cigarettes
There is a knock at Graham's door, which now has a deadbolt lock
Who is it
knock again
Graham sets his book down and goes to the door
He unlocks the deadbolt and opens it
Ann stands in the hallway
Graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her
She wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow breeze, her expression calm
Graham watches her go by
She stops in the middle of the room, her back to him
Graham moves toward her slowly
Sensing him behind her, her breathing becomes deep
Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her hair
She closes her eyes as their fingers entwine
