Written by Aaron Sorkin Revised Third Draft July 15, 1991 : -- -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere
Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower cut through the ground mist
We  all the unidentifiable sounds of night in the woods
We also , very, very faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence
And as this starts, we begin to     , more becomes visible now:
the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high
the steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure and leading to the lookout post, and finally , maybe forty feet off the ground
Standing the post is the silhouette of
He's holding a rifle and staring straight out
The drum cadence has been building slightly
: And we see by the moonlight that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into the distance

The drum cadence continues, and we : We  two pairs of footsteps and then : where we see that the footsteps belong to  and , two young marines who we'll get to know later
They stop when they get to a certain door
The drum cadence is still growing

He opens's the door and they walk into '  - , a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in his bunk
kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on ' shoulder and shakes him gently

He lunges out of the bed -- but forget about it
In one flash  and grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come out, 's shoved a piece of cloth into 's mouth
Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision and professionalism
--  strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto his mouth and eyes -- --  length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet
(quietly) You're lucky it's us, Willy
-- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking him, just holding his head still -- -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo
We  four sharp blasts from a whistle and we : - and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper Fidelis and it's coming from

As the  , we watch the  do their thing from various angles
Incredible precision is the name of the game

She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency to speak quickly
If she had any friends, they'd call her As she walks, she mutters to herself
'm requesting
'm
Captain, 'd like to request that  be the attorney assigned to rep -- 'd like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent -- (she stops) "That it be myself who is assigned to represent"
Good, Jo, that's confidence inspiring
We follow , still muttering, as she walks into the brick building which bears the seal of the -   ' : '  - As   enters
and two other officers, and , sit around a conference table
Jo, come on in
Thank you, sir
Captain West, this is Lt
Commander Galloway
Jo, you know Mike Lawrence
Yes sir
(to ) Captain,  appreciate your seeing me on such short notice
understand there was some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba
Yes sir
This past Friday evening
Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a  William Santiago and assaulted him
Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later
The agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident
They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon
What's the problem
Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screw-up
was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red
Jo lets this sink in a moment
(under his breath) Christ
'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel
Someone who can really look into this
Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military
In short, Captain, 'd like to suggest that
be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them
(beat) Myself
Jo looks around the room for a response
Joanne, why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee
Thank you, sir, 'm fine
Joanne, 'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back
Certainly, sir
gets up and walks out
thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore
With the marines at
Who the hell knows what goes on down there
Well lets find out before the rest of the world does, this thing could get messy
What about this woman
Jo's been working a desk at internal affairs for what, almost a year now
And before that
She disposed of three cases in two years
Three cases in two years
Who was she handling, the Rosenbergs
She's not cut out for litigation
She's a hall of an investigator, Jerry -- In Internal Affairs, sure
She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of 'em, but when it comes to trial work -- know
All passion, no street smarts
Bring her back in
goes to the door and motions for  to come back in
(continuing) Commander, we're gonna move the defendants up here in the morning
Thank you, sir
And 'll have Division assign them counsel
(beat) But
not me
From what  understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what 'm sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week's worth of paper work
Sir -- Don't worry about it
promise you, division'll assign the right man for the job
: - His name is      , and it's almost impossible not to like him
At the moment he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen  who are spread out on the softball field on a corner of the bass
The '27 Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own against a group of, say, Airforce dentists
's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it
He is, at this point in his life, passionate about nothing
except maybe softball
(calling out to the team) Alright, let's get two
He smacks one to the
The ball bounces right between his legs
Sorry
Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby
Just look the ball into your glove
He smacks one out to the same place
It bounces off the heel of 's glove and into center field
() Sorry
You gotta trust me, Sherby
You keep your eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten
, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, walks up behind the backstop
Kaffee
Let's try it again
Kaffee
(turning) Dave
You seem upset and distraught
We were supposed to meet in your office 15 minutes ago to talk about the McDermott case
You're stalling on this thing
Now we got this done and  mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 'll hang your boy from a fuckin' yardarm
yardarm
(calling out) Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms
(calling back) don't think so, Danny
(back to ) Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore
(back to the field) Let's go, let's get two
He goes back to hitting fungoes
'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty
Plead guilty and 'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay
It was oregano, Dave, it was ten dollars worth of oregano
Yeah, well your client thought it was marijuana
My client's a moron, that's not against the law
Swapp
The   takes one in the face
(continuing) Ow
That had to hurt
(calling out) Way to keep your head in the play, Lester
Walk it off
've got people to answer to just like you, 'm gonna charge him
With what, possession of a condiment
Kaffee -- Dave, 've tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for tall time, 'm gonna file a motion to dismiss
You won't got it
will get it
And if the  is denied, 'll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that 'm gonna file against pre-trial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano
Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig
Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty
don't know why 'm agreeing to this
'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years
Dave, can you play third base
- About 16     (several of whom are women) are taking their seats around a large conference table
is handing out folders and some photocopied papers to the
We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior Grade
Sam's serious and studious looking
If he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval officer
walks in
'Morning
(school class) 'Morning Captain Whitaker
Sam, how's the baby
think she's ready to say her first word any day now
How can you tell
She just looks like she has something to say
walks in
Excuse me, sorry 'm late
'm sure you don't have a good excuse, so  won't force you to come up with a bad one
Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of you
Sit-down, this first one's for you
He hands  some files
(continuing) You're moving up in the world, Danny, you've been requested by Division
"Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"' from the other
(Subtle Note: Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world
) Requested to do what
hands him a file
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline and into Cuban territory
What's a fenceline
Sam
big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys
Teachers pet
William Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson to the Naval investigative Service
Dawson and another member of his squad, Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's room, tie him up, and stuff a rag down his throat
An hour later, Santiago's dead
Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin
They poisoned the rag
Not according to them
What do they say
Not much
They're being flown up here tomorrow and on Thursday at 0600 you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day to find out what you can
Meantime, go across the yard and see Lt
Commander Joanne Galloway
She's the one who had 'em brought up here
She'll fill you in on whatever she has
Any questions
The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the morning, sir
It seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book, so 'm assigning co-counsel
Any volunteers
No
Sam
have a stack of paper on my desk -- Work with Kaffee on this
Doing what
Kaffee'll finish this up in four days
Do various
administrative
you know
things
Back-up
Whatever
In other words  have no responsibilities whatsoever
Right
My kinda case
: '  - sits behind her desk
and  stand in the doorway
knocks politely
looks up
Hi
(beat) 'm Daniel Kaffee
was told to meet with -- (checks notes) -- Commander Galloway
is staring at him
doesn't know why
(continuing) About a briefing
is finding this hard to believe
You're the attorney that Division assigned
'm lead counsel
This is Sam Weinberg
have no responsibilities here whatsoever
's deeply puzzled
(beat) Come in, please, have a seat
and  come into the office and sit
(continuing) Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy
Going on nine months now
And how long have you been out of law school
little over a year
(beat) see
Have  done something wrong
No
It's just that when  petitioned Division to have counsel assigned, was hoping 'd be taken seriously
and  exchange a look
(to ) No offense taken, if you were wondering
Commander, Lt
Kaffee's generally considered the best litigator in our office
He's successfully plea bargained 44 cases in nine months
One more, and  got a set of steak knives
Have you ever been in a courtroom
once had my drivers license suspended
Danny -- Commander, from what  understand, if this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest
No
They'll need a lawyer
During this, she'll hand  a series of files, which will pass To  without even glancing at them
(continuing) Dawson's family has been contacted
Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side, she hasn't been Contacted yet
None of this really means anything to
(continuing) Would you like me to take care of that
Sure, if you feel like it
takes another beat to size this guy up
One of the people you'll be speaking to down there is the barracks
, Colonel Nathan Jessep,  assume you've heard of him
(beat) Who hasn't
(to ) He's been in the papers lately
He's expected to be appointed Director of Operations for the National Security Counsel
Passing  another file -- These are letters that Santiago wrote in his 8 months at  -- (whispering to kaffee) Guantanamo Bay
know that one
He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet commander, , Atlantic, even his senator
He wanted a transfer
Nobody was listening
You with me
Yes
This last letter to the Naval investigative Service -- She hands it to  who hands it to Sam -- (continuing) -- where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort
Right
Is that all
(beat) Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago
Gotcha
(beat) And Santiago is
who
(beat) The victim
(to ) Write that down
(to ) Am  correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay
Yes, among other -- And am  further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy
Colonel Jessep, yes, but -- Twelve years
'm sorry
Twelve years
can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter
Twelve years
You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper
Pretty impressive, huh
You're gonna have to go deeper than just -- Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that  should know about
My job is to make sure you do your job
'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face
Read the letters
You're not under any obligation, but 'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba
Sure
gets up without waiting for  to say -- You're dismissed
Sorry,  always forget that
's gone
's standing in the doorway
He's a little preoccupied
(beat) The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week
Tell your friend not to get cute down there
The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical
About what
And in   we  -- (
) Dear Sir, About being marines
: - - And while we  the letter read in
, what we're seeing is this: 's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 months
He had a rough time of it
: --  running along at the rear of a group of
It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him to keep up with the group
falls, struggles to get back up and keep running, and : - --  doing push-ups alone in the rain
He's being supervised by a  who sees to it that his face hits the mud every time down and : - --  sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend within four seats of him and : - --  being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his squad and : - --  running with the squad of  again, this time down a rocky hill
It's hot as hell and it looks like he's gonna pass out
He stumbles, and the  picks him up and pushes him down the hill
He rolls about 30 feet before he stops
Over this, we (
) "
My name is  William
Santiago
am a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Delta
am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help
've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, 'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill
My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill
Then  saw all black and the last thing  remember is hitting the deck
was brought to the hospital where  was told  just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and  hyperventilate
ask you to help me
Please sir just need to be transferred out of Sincerely
William
Santiago
Marine Corps
" At this point, with 's letter still in
, we : '  - - It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding it
(
) "
In exchange for my transfer off the base, 'm willing to provide you with information about an illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2nd
" And as these last words are spoken, we , who drops the letter he's been reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters just like it
's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps
He's smart as a whip with a sense of humor to match
As soon as he drops the letter, he says Who the fuck is  William
Santiago
He's talking to his two senior officers is in his late 40's
He's a career marine and a nice guy in a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure as shit don't finish first
Lt
is 26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate
If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are guarded by the
Marine Corps
Sir, Santiago is a member of Second Platoon, Delta
Yeah, well, apparently he's not very happy down here at Shangri-La, cause he's written letters to everyone but Santa Claus asking for a transfer
And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting
He tosses the letter over to
is looking it over
is waiting for a response
(continuing) Matthew
'm appalled, sir
You're appalled
This kid broke the Chain of Command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact that he's a
Marine and it would appear that he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion
What the fuck's going on over at Windward, Matthew
Colonel,  think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private
That won't be necessary, Colonel, 'll handle the situation
The same way you handled the Curtis Barnes incident
You're doing something wrong, Lieutenant this -- My methods of leadership are -- Don't interrupt me, 'm still your superior officer
And 'm yours, Matthew
The room calms down for a moment
(continuing) want to know what we're gonna do about this
think Santiago should be transferred off the base
Right away
He's that bad, huh
Not only that, but word of this letter's bound to get out
The kid's gonna get his ass kicked
Transfer Santiago
Yes  suppose you're right
suppose that's the thing to do
Wait
Wait
've got a better idea
Let's transfer the whole squad off the base
Let's -- on second thought -- Windward
The whole Windward division, let's transfer 'em off the base
Jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence, they're packing their bags
(calling out) Tom
The  cones in from the outer office
Sir
Got me the President on the phone, we're surrendering our position in Cuba
Yes sir
Wait a minute, Tom
The  stops
(continuing) Don't call the President just yet
Maybe we should consider this for a second
Maybe -- and 'm just spit balling here -- but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago
Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals
Yes
'm certain once read that somewhere
And now 'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way
Santiago stays where he is
We're gonna train the lad
You're in charge, Jon
Santiago doesn't make 4
1 on his next fitness report, 'm gonna blame you
Then 'm gonna kill you
Yes sir
think that's a mistake, Colonel
Matthew,  believe  will have that word in private with you now
Jon, that's all
Why don't you and  have lunch at the "" club, we'll talk about the training of young William
Yes sir, 'd be delighted to hear any suggestions you have
Dismissed
is gone
(continuing) Matthew, sit, please
sits
(continuing) What do you think of Kendrick
(beat) don't know that -- think he's kind of a weasel, myself
But he's an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit
We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew
That's a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously
And  believe that taking a marine who's not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger
starts to stand -- (continuing) Matthew, siddown
(beat) We go back a while
We went to the Academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our tours in Vietnam together
But 've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have
Now if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you, well,  don't give a shit
We're in the business of saving lives, Captain Markinson
Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer
grabs his hat and walks out, leaving  sitting all alone, and we : -   - It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday
An is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans and a fourth unmarked car through the gate
The cars drive through and we : - Another red-brick building
few
Is stand out front as the cars pull up
As soon as they come to a stop, all the doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they escort  and , in handcuffs, out of the car
's a handsome, young, black corporal
Intense, controlled, and utterly professional
's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm
He's happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do
's his hero
The two prisoners stand still for a moment
They might as we'll be in Oz
Hal
doesn't say anything
(continuing) Is this Washington,
Alright, let's move
: - and 's at it again
Alright, let's get tough out there
walks up from behind the backstop
Excuse me
You want to suit up
We need all the help we can get
No, thank you,  can't throw and catch things
That's okay, neither can they
wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey
Say again
Dawson and Downey
(beat) Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but 'm just not -- Dawson
Downey
Your clients
The Cuba thing
Yes
Dawson and Downey
(beat) Right
(pause) 've done something wrong again, haven't
was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball
We need the practice
That wasn't funny
It was a little funny
Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if  recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel
Why
don't think you're fit to handle this defense
You don't even know me
Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover 'm not fit to handle a defense
Jo just stares
(continuing) Oh come on, that was damn funny
Jo moves close to  to say this with a degree of confidentiality
do know you
Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital
Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985
You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the  Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job
And if that's the situation, that's fine, won't tell anyone
But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed
And  wouldn't be doing my job if  allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance
can't help but be impressed by that speech
Wow
(beat) 'm sexually aroused, Commander
don't think your clients murdered anybody
What are you basing this on
There was no intent
The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning
(beat) Now,  don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad
Santiago died at one a
m
At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison
Oh, now  see what you're saying
It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick
'm gonna speak to your supervisor
Okay
You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue
It's a big white house with pillars in front
Thank you
don't think you'll have much luck, though
was assigned by Division, remember
Somebody over there thinks 'm a good lawyer
So while appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm,  think  can pretty much handle things myself
Do you know what a code red is
doesn't, but he doesn't say anything
(continuing) What a pity
: - And an
is leading  and  down to  and 's cell
Officer on deck, ten-hut
and  come to attention
Through the following, the
will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in
Sir, Lance Corporal Harold
Dawson, sir
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon, Delta
Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold
Sir, yes sir
Sir,  Louden Downey
'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinerg, you can sitdown
and  aren't too comfortable sitting in the presence of officers, but they do as they're told
's pulled out some documents, 's sitting on one of the cots taking notes
(continuing; to ) Is this your signature
Yes sir
You don't have to call me sir
(to ) Is this your signature
Sir, yes sir
And you certainly don't have to do it twice in one sentence
Harold, what's a Code Red
Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary engagement
What does that mean, exactly
Sir, a marine falls out of line, it's up to the men in his unit to get him back on track
What's a garden variety Code Red
Sir
Harold, you say sir and  turn around and look for my father
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee
Garden variety; typical
What's a basic Code Red
Sir, a marine has refused to bathe on a regular basis
The men in his squad would give him a
shower
What's that
Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel wool
Beautiful
Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red
Yes sir
(to ) Do you ever talk
Sir, Private Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him
Swell
Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was there poison on it
No sir
Silver polish, turpentine, anti- freeze
No sir
We were gonna shave his head, sir
When all of a sudden
We saw blood drippinq out of his mouth
Then we pulled the tape off, and there was blood all down his face, sir
That's when Corporal Dawson called the ambulance
tries not to make too big a deal out of this last piece of news
(to ) Did anyone see you call the ambulance
No sir
Were you there when the ambulance got there
Yes sir, that's when we were taken under arrest
kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for a moment
(to ) On the night of August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba
Yes sir
Why
My mirror engaged, sir
(to ) His mirror engaged
For each American sentry post there's a Cuban counterpart
They're called mirrors
The corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him
Santiago's letter to the  said you fired illegally
He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move
says nothing
(continuing) Oh, Harold
is staring at
(continuing) You see what 'm getting at
If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red
Because he broke the chain of command, sir
He what
He went outside his unit, sir
If he had a problem, he should've spoken to me, sir
Then his Sergeant, then Company Commander, then -- Yeah, yeah, alright
Harold, did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him
No sir
What was your intent
To train him, sir
Train him to do what
Train him to think of his unit before himself
To respect the code
What's the code
Unit Corps God Country
beg your pardon
Unit Corps God Country, sir
The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder
You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country
stares at
That's our code, sir
takes a long moment
He picks up his briefcase and he and  move to the door
We'll be back
You guys need anything
Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich
Sir
No thank you
Sir
smiles at
Harold,  think there's a concept you better start warming up to
Sir
'm the only friend you've got
And as  and  walk out the open cell door, and  come to attention and snap a salute
They hold the salute until  and  are well out of sight, and we : '  - He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the work day
Lt
, a marine lawyer maybe two years older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in
Dan Kaffee
Sailin' Jack Ross
Welcome to the big time
You think so
hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball
Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, don't do anything better than play softball
What are we lookin' at
They plead guilty to manslaughter, 'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming
20 years, they'll be home in half that time
want twelve
Can't do it
They called the ambulance, Jack
don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine
The rag was tested for poison
The autopsy, lab report, even the initial and
reports
They all say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not
The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure
What do you know about Code Reds
smiles and shakes his head
Oh man
He closes the office door
(continuing) Are we off the record
You tell me
(pause) 'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this: The platoon commander Lt
Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men
And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago
holds for a moment
Dawson and Downey neglected to mention this
He packs up his briefcase and cleats
'll talk to you when  get back
Hey, we got a little four-on-four going tomorrow night
When does your plane get in
: - It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work
We can see the flag being lowered in the background
's walking toward his car
intercepts him and starts walking along with him
Hi there
Any luck getting me replaced
Is there anyone in this command that you don't either drink or play softball with
Commander -- Listen,  came to make peace
We started off on the wrong foot
What do you say
Friends
Look,  don't -- By the way,  brought Downey some comic books he was asking for
The kid, Kaffee,  swear, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't even know why he's been arrested
Commander -- You can call me Joanne
Joanne -- or Jo
Jo
Yes
Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission, 'll have you disbarred
Friends
had authorization
From where
Downey's closest living relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny
gave her a call like you asked
Very nice woman, we talked for about an hour
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny
Perfectly within my province
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn
We can hold the trial there
can sew the costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge
Jo steps aside and lets  got into his car
'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow
And the hits just keep on comin'
on  and Jo
smiles
: - He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a sidewalk newsstand
He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and runs up to the newsstand
As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he engages in his daily ritual with , the newsstand operator
How's it goin', Luther
Another day, another dollar, captain
You gotta play 'em as they lay, Luther
What comes around, goes around, you know what 'm sayin'
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Hey, if you've got your health, you got everything
Love makes the world go round
'll see you tomorrow, Luther
And we : '   - baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal  is standing over the crib
's sitting on a beer
When Nancy gets back, you're my witness
The baby spoke
My daughter said a word
Your daughter made a sound, Sam, 'm not sure it was a word
Oh come on, it was a word
Okay
You heard her
The girl sat here, pointed, and said "Pa"
She did
She said "Pa"
She was pointing at a doorknob
That's right
Pointing, as if to say, "Pa, look, a doorknob"
joins  in the living room
Jack Ross came to see me today
He offered me twelve years
That's what you wanted
know, and 'll
guess,  mean -- (beat) 'll take it
So
It took albout 45 seconds
He barely put up a fight
(beat) Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift
finishes off his beer, and stands
You don't believe their story, do you
You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives
believe every word they said
And think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives
nods and puts down the empty beer bottle
'll see you tomorrow
Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the stoop for a moment
Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there
don't like the whites
Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August
You got Dramamine
Dramamine keeps you cool
Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly
get sick when  fly because 'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain,  don't think Dramamine'll help
've got some oregano,  hear that works pretty good
Yeah, right
starts toward his car, then turns around
(continuing) You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before  left
He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago
So
never mentioned Kendrick
don't even know who he is
(beat) What the hell
(beat) 'll see you tomorrow
We hold for a moment on  as he walks to his car, then : - The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy Yard, is ready to go to war
Fighter jets line the tarmac
Ground crews re-fuel planes
Hurried activity
36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a stair unit is brought up
, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the passengers begin to got off
Mostly , a few , a couple of , and ,  and
and are wearing their summer whites,  is in khakis
and  stare out at what they see: They're not in Kansas anymore
shouts over the noise from the planes
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg
(shouting) Yeah
Commander Galloway
'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, 'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base
Thank you
've got some camouflage jackets in the back of the jeep, sirs, 'll have to ask you both to put them on
Camouflage jackets
Regulations, sir
We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline
The Cubans see an officer wearing white, they think it's someone they might wanna take a shot at
turns and glares at
Good call, Sam
: -   - Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across
It's a section of Guantanamo Bay
(shouting) We'll just hop on the ferry and be over there in no time
(shouting) Whoa
Hold it
We gotta take a boat
Yes sir, to get to the other side of the bay
Nobody said anything about a boat
(shouting) Is there a problem, sir
(shouting) No
No problem
'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all
(shouting) Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud
(shouting) Nobody likes her very much
(shouting) Yes sir
The jeep drives on and we : ,  and  are standing as the are led in
Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown
Thank you
'm Daniel Kaffee, 'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey
This is Joanne Galloway, she's observing and evaluating -- (shaking hands) Colonel
Pleased to meet you, Commander
Sam Weinberg
He has no responsibility here whatsoever
've asked Captain Markinson and Lt
Kendrick to join us
Lt
Kaffee,  had the pleasure of seeing your father once
was a teenager and he spoke at my high school
smiles and nods
Lionel Kaffee
Yes sir
Well what do you know
Son, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods
Jefferson vs
Madison County School District
The folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all white school, Lionel Kaffee said we'll just see about that
How the hell is your dad
He passed away seven years ago, colonel
(pause) Well
don't  feel like the fuckin, asshole
Not at all, sir
Well, what can we do for you, Danny
Not much at all, sir, 'm afraid
This is really a formality more than anything else
The  Corps insists that  interview all the relevant witnesses
The  Corps can be demanding that way
smiles
Jonanthan'll take you out and show you what you wanna see, then we can all hook up for lunch, how does that sound
Fine, sir
: - jogs by as a jeep carrying  and the three  cruises down the road
We  the jeep
understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon
Yes
What'd you guys talk about
told the men that there was an informer among us
And that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution, Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way
What time was that meeting
Sixteen-hundred
turns around and looks at
(leaning forward) Four o'clock
: - leads the  down the corridor to Santiago's room
Two strips of tape which warn    - are crisscrossed over the closed door
They open the door and step under the tape and walk into '  - The room is exactly an it was left that night
The un-made bed, the chair knocked over
The  look around for a moment
The room is sparse
Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it:  row of uniforms hanging neatly
He thumbs through then for a second, but there's nothing there
He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear
all folded to marine corp precision
shaving kit, a couple of photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes
Kaffee closes the footlocker
Sam, somebody should see about getting this stuff to his parents
We don't need it anymore
Actually, the uniforms belong to the marine corps
The  take a moment
Lt
Kendrick -- can  call you Jon
No, you may not
(beat) Have  done something to offend you
No,  like all you Navy boys
Every time we've gotta go someplace and fight, you fellas always give us a ride
Lt
Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered
Commander,  believe in God, and in his son Jesus Christ, and because do,  can say this: Private Santiago is dead and that's a tragedy
But he's dead because he had no code
He's dead because he had no honor
And God was watching
turns to
How do you feel about that theory
(beat) Sounds good
Let's move on
and  walk out the door
stops
You planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour
(beat) 'm pacing myself
: - , ,  and the  are seated at a table in the corner
Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee
Jessep is finishing a story
And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to
laughs
joins him
and  force a laugh
forces a smile
remains silent
(continuing; to the ) That was delicious, men, thank you
Our pleasure, sir
Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th
Shoot
On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an  angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting
Yes
Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer
An getting this right
Yes
If you feel there are any details that 'm missing, you should free to speak up
's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak freely on his own base
Thank you
Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt
Kendrick into your office
Yes
And what happened then
We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base
Here's something else  didn't know
Neither did Jo
jots something down on a small notepad
doesn't flinch
Santiago was set to be transferred
On the first available flight to the states
Six the next morning
Three hours too late as it turned out
nods
Yeah
There's silence for a moment
takes a sip of his coffee
Then drains the cup and puts it down
(continuing) Alright, that's all  have
Thanks very much for your time
The corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip
(standing) Thank you
Wait a minute, 've got some questions
No you don't
Yes  do
No you don't
Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five
Jo -- Of course  met with the doctor
One of my men was dead
(to ) See
The man was dead
Let's go
(to ) was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red
Jo -- 've heard the term, yes
Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers
submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle
However, the directive having come from the , gave it its due attention
What's your point, Jo
She has no point
She often has no point
It's part of her charm
We're outta here
Thank you
My point is that  think code reds still go on down here
Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel
Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that
Yes he does
No, he really doesn't
Yeah, he really does
Colonel
You know it just hit me
She outranks you, Danny
Yes sir
want to tell you something Danny and listen up 'cause  mean this: You're the luckiest man in the world
There is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning
Promote 'em all  say
's not upset
's not mad
But she's gonna ask her question 'til she gets an answer
Colonel, the practice of code Reds is still condoned by officers on this base, isn't it
You see my problem is, of course, that 'm a Colonel
'll just have to keep taking cold showers 'til they elect some gal President
need an answer to my question, sir
Take caution in your tone, Commander
'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy
You want to know about code reds
On the record  tell you that discourage the practice in accordance with the  directive
Off the record tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it
run my base how  run my base
You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances
eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me
So don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous
moment of tense silence before -- Let's go
Colonel, 'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order
What's that
Santiago's transfer order
You guys have paper work on that kind of thing, just need it for the file
For the file
Yeah
(pause) Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order
For the file
'm here to help anyway  can
Thank you
You believe that, don't you
Danny
That 'm here to help anyway  can
Of course
The corporal'll run you by Ordinance on your way out to the airstrip
You can have all the transfer orders you want
(to  and ) Let's go
The  start to leave
But you have to ask me nicely
stops
Turns around
Sam and  stop and turn
beg your pardon
You have to ask me nicely
You see, Danny,  can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood
can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear
don't want money and don't want medals
What  want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform, and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin' courtesy
You gotta ask me nicely
and  are frozen
Everyone'staring at Kaffee; The  at their tables
makes his decision
Colonel Jessep
if it's not too much trouble, 'd like a copy of the transfer order
Sir
smiles
No problem
for a moment
's very disappointed
stands there and watches the  as they turn and leave the Officer's Club
(continuing) hate casualties, Matthew
There are casualties even in victory marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon, that marine's a hero
The foundation of the unit, the fabric of this base, the spirit of the Corps, they are things worth fighting for
looks at the ground
(continuing) Dawson and Downey, they don't know it, but they're smothering a grenade
looks up as we : - As a plane touches down on the runway
It's dusk in Washington and : '  - little one-bedroom
Just the essential furniture, barely even that
's sitting and watching a baseball came on t
v
He's holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble keeping his mind in it
He's holding a baseball bat and fiddling with it
The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him
His white uniform in a pile in the corner
There's a  at the door
's not expecting anyone
He goes to the door
Who is it
(
) It's me
opens the door and  walks in
've really missed you, Jo
was just saying to myself, "It's been almost three hours since  last saw -- Markinson resigned his commission
(pause) When
This afternoon
Sometime after we left
'll talk to him in the morning
already tried,  can't find him
You tried
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation
hands  the file she's been holding
'm Louden Downey's attorney
's stunned
He opens the file and begins to read
(continuing) Aunt Ginny
She said she feels like she's known me for years
suggested that she might feel more comfortable if  were directly involved with the case
She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago
looks up
Still too stunned to say anything
Then finally
suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me
Don't worry, 'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel
hands her back the file
Splendid
think Kendrick ordered the Code Red
(beat) So do you
: - and  come to attention as  and  are led in
Officer on deck, ten hut
starts in immediately
Did Kendrick order the code red
Sir
Don't say sir like  just asked you if you cleaned the latrine
You heard what  said
Did Lt
Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red
Yes sir
(to Downey) Did he
Yes sir
You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before
You didn't ask us, sir
Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal,  get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail
Yes sir
know you do, sir
Fuck you, Harold
There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by -- Alright
Let's sort this out
There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon
And Lt
Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago
Now is that true
want you to speak freely
Ma'am, that's correct
But then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms
And what happened then
Lt
Kendrick came to our room, ma'am
When
About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir
About 16:20
(continuing) And what happened then
Lt
Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red
: - is playing a game of full-court basketball with some other
door at the far end of the court opens and  and walk in
They head down the sideline toward Ross
shouts -- Jack
But  is into the game
(continuing) Jack
(waving him off) Hang on
They were given an order
stops cold and looks over at Kaffee
The game flies by him
He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the gym and the three of them make their way to privacy
How long have you known about the order
didn't -- (to ) Who is this
This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer
She's very pleased to meet you
What exactly are you accusing me of, commander
'm accusing you of -- They're in the - and  slams the door shut behind them
Jack didn't know about the order
Because if he did and he hadn't told us, Jack knows he'd be violating about 14 articles of the code of ethics
As it is, he's got enough to worry about
God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order
Kendrick specifically told the men not to touch Santiago
That's right
And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room and specifically told them to give him a code red
That's not what Kendrick said
Kendrick's lying
You have proof
have the defendants
And  have 23 marines who aren't accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation
Why did Markinson resign his commission
We'll never know
You don't think  can subpoena Markinson
You can try, but you won't find him
You know what Markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps
Counter Intelligence
Markinson's gone
There is no Markinson
Some of the wind has been taken Out of Kaffee's sails
(continuing) Jessep's star is on the rise
Division'll give me a lot of room to spare Jessep and the corps any embarrassment
How much room
'll knock it all down to assault
Two years
They're home in six months
No deal, we're going to a jury
Jo -- No you're not
Why not
'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it
And he knows that if we go to court, 'll have to go all the way, they'll be charged with the whole truckload
Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct Unbecoming, and even though he's got me by the balls out here, Dan knows that in a courtroom, he loses this case
Danny's an awfully talented lawyer, and he's not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months
This is now clear: Ross is as good as Kaffee
(continuing) That's the end of this negotiation
From this moment, we're on the record
'll see tomorrow morning at the arraignment
turns and heads back to the gym as we : - Kaffee and  are sitting at a table
Dawson and Downey are at parade rest
Kaffee lights a cigarette
Here's the story: The Goverment's offering Assault and Conduct Unbecoming
Two years
You'll be home in six months
and  say nothing
(continuing) "Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest lawyer in the world
How can we ever thank you
" Fellas, you hear what just said, you're going home in six months
'm afraid we can't do that, sir
Do what
Make a deal, sir
What are you talking about
We did nothing wrong, sir
We did our job
If that has consequences, then  accept them
But' won't say 'm guilty, sir
can't believe this
He looks over at
Did you -- (to  and ) Did she put you up to this
No
We have a code, sir
Well zippity-doo-dah
You and your code plead not guilty and you'll be in jail for the rest of your life
Do what 'm telling you and you'll be home in six months
just stares at him
(continuing) Do it, Harold
Six months
It's nothing
It's a hockey season
Permission to -- Speak
What do we do then, sir
When
After six months
We'd be dishonorably discharged, right sir
Yes
What do we do then, sir
We joined the corps 'cause we wanted to live our lives by a certain code
And we found it in the corps
And now you're asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor
You're asking us to say we're not marines
If a judge and jury decide that what we did was wrong, 'll accept whatever punishment they give
But  believe was riqht, sir
believe  did my job
And  won't dishonor myself, my unit, or the Corps, so that  can qo home in six months
(beat) Sir
the four of them for a moment, then Commander,  want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute
Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out -- (to Downey) Let's go in another room
Louden, everything's gonna be alright
The
has shown up and unlocked the cell door
(continuing; to
) We're gonna go into a holding room
Aye, aye, ma'am
, , and the
are gone
paces a moment before he says -- You don't like me that much, do you
(beat) Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter
paces another moment, then sits on the cot
He's trying to choose his tack carefully
(continuing) You know, Downey worships you
He's gonna do whatever you do
Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code
Harold
Do you think we were right
It doesn't matter what  -- Do you think we were right
gets up
(beat) think you'd lose
(beat) You're such a coward,  can't believe they let you wear a uniform
stares at
'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold
did everything could
You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what
don't give a shit
calls out -- (continuing) and  are staring each other down
The
shows up and unlocks the cell door
steps out to leave
(continuing) What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room
holds on
Then , a man who would rather die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts them in his pockets
The cell door closes and we : - One light is on at the end of the hall
: has joined  and
The mood is somber
Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me
Fine
If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business
'm not gonna hold his hand on the way down
(to ) want to get him a new lawyer
How do  do it
You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment
The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea
You tell him you want new counsel assigned
(beat) Then that's that
(beat) Yeah
One thing, though
When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely
What do you want from me
want you to let 'em be judged want you to stand up and make an argument
An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg
For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm
These guys aren't the Nazis
There's a pause in the room
Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument
(pause) Yeah
(beat) Tomorrow morning 'll get them a new attorney
Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer
Were daddy's expectations really that high
Please, spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit
Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer
Another lawyer won't be good enough
They need you
You know how to win
(beat) You know they have a case
And you know how to win
You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died
Do you believe they have a defense
You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland
It doesn't matter what believe, it only matters what  can prove
So please don't tell me what know and don't know
know the law
looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away
She turns back
You know nothing about the law
You're a used car salesman, Daniel
You're an ambulance chaser with a rank
You're nothing
(beat) Live with that
Jo walks off leaving  alone
We  on
He's not having a good night
: - sits at the bar
The place is crowded with and
's been drinking there a while now
Next to him is a  , regaling his  with the story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high stakes corporate law
We  on a  a moment longer, then So  told duncan if we leverage the acquisition of Biotech, the interrogatories would be there on demand
All  have to do is not pick up the phone and it'll run Flaherty ten thousand a day in court costs
: - sits on a bench in the night
He takes a sip from a bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag
: - bright, sunny morning
The  is performing for a group of day campers
: - and  are at the defense table,  is his place
walks in and joins  and  at their table
Papers are being passed back and forth between  and the Quiet activity
The door in the back of the courtroom opens and , a marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench
We can  the band in the background
All rise
Everyone present in the courtroom stands
Where are we
Docket number 411275
-5
United States versus Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private First Class Loudon Downey
Defendants are charged with Conspiracy to Commit Murder, Murder in the First Degree, and Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine
Does defense wish to enter a plea
stands
Yeah
(pause) They're not guilty
, , ,
it's hard to say who's the most surprised
It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile
The silence is broken by , who takes the two files, drops them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut
looks at  and , then turns to the Enter a plea of not guilty for the defendants
We'll adjourn until ten- hundred, three weeks from today, at which time this Court will reconvene as a General Court-Martial
He raps the gavel
walks out
walks up the aisle without a word to anyone
The
's come to escort  and  back to their cell
and  and  are the only ones remaining
is looking at  with question marks in his eyes
Why does a junior grade with six months experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case
(beat) Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom
picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the door
(continuing) We'll work out of my apartment
Every night, seven o'clock
Jo, before you come over tonight, pick up a carton of legal pads, a half-dozen boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes of black pens
Sam get a couple of desk lamps
need you to start on a preliminary medical profile and Jo, we need all the fitness reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago
The only thing  have to eat is Yoo-Hoo and SugarSnacks, so if you want anything else, bring it with you
Okay
Jo's still stunned
Yeah
's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all in for a moment
So this is what a courtroom looks like
He walks out the door, and we : '  - Among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the wall
Written across the top are three headings: Sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles
comes in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of Yoo-Hoo and joins Sam on the floor
Were you able to speak to your friend at
She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we're not gonna find him
She said  could be Markinson and you wouldn't know it
Are you Markinson
No
Well, 'm not Markinson, that's two down
doesn't laugh
(continuing) What
(pause) was wondering, now that Joanne's working on this
was wondering if you still need me
(pause) They were following an order, Sam
An illegal order
You think Dawson and Downey know it was an illegal order
It doesn't matter if they know, any decent human being would've refused to -- They're not permitted to question orders
Then what's the secret
What are the magic words
give orders every day, and nobody follows them
We have softball games and marching bands
They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot
Sam looks away
He doesn't buy it
(continuing; pause) need you
You're better at research than  am and you know how to prepare a witness
Jo lets herself in
She's carrying a huge stack of papers under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other
But we stay with  and Sam a moment longer
've got medical reports and Chinese food
say we eat first
's still looking at
nods his head
Did you get any dumplings
: '
-  - The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around

As he speaks, he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat
He refers to the blackboard
This is our defense
Intent: No one can prove there was poison on the raq
Code Red: They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay
The Order: (he writes) ) Kendrick gave it
) They had no choice but to follow it
(beat) That's it
What about motive
We're a little weak on motive
They had one
Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean -- Relax
We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up
For now we start here -- (pointing to ) don't know what made Santiago die, don't want to know
just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison
Jo, talk to doctors
Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis
Let's start prepping for Stone
As long as we're on the subject of the doctor -- Here we go
Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison
The doctor's covering up the truth
Oh, that's a relief
was afraid wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire" defense
We can't prove coercion
Alright, fitness reports and biographical information

And what happened after Kendrick came into your room
(beat) He ordered me and Corporal Dawson to give Willy a Code Red
(to Jo) His answers still have to come faster, Jo
The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth
(to Dawson & Downey) He's right, and from now on, "Willy" is Private Santiago
You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him

You don't have to
We've had our differences

And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course 'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it
You like me
won't make you say it
was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow

Good tip
We're ready

Too late

Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding
God save the United States of America
raps the gavel
without objection, the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record
No objection, your honor
No objection
Is the Government prepared to make an opening statement
(standing) Yes sir
walks to the jury box
(continuing) The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate,  William Santiago
They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat
few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding
He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight
These are the facts of the case
And they are undisputed
That's right
The story  just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey
Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill
(beat) Now, Lt
Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection
He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red
He might even cut into a few officers for you
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none
But it's gonna be entertaining
When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him
These are the facts of the case
(beat) And they are undisputed
walks back to his seat
Lt
Kaffee
Before 's even stood up, these words are coming out of his mouth
There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true
(beat) When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night
It's because it was what they were ordered to do
(beat) Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do
Now, out in the real world, that means nothing
And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more
But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags
(beat) Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job
walks back to the table and takes his seat
Is the Government ready to call its first witness
Please the Court, the Government calls Mr
McGuire
While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn in,  has sat back down
He leans over to  and whispers
How you doin'
doesn't change his expression
(continuing) Good
Mr
McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please
Robert
McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service
Mr
McGuire, did your office receive a letter from  William Santiago on 3 August of this year
We did
What did the letter say
That a member of Private Santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline
Was that marine identified in the letter
No sir
notified the barracks
, Colonel Jessep, that  would be coming down to investigate
And what did you find
For the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing
And who was that
Lance Corporal Harold Dawson
(continuing; to ) Your witness
goes back to his table
stands
Mr
McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting
Yes
He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy
But you don't believe him
It's not my place -- Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause
There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge
Thank you
sits
Mr
McGuire,  don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge
You had Willy Santiago's letter
Santiago was the only witness, but never had a chance to interview him
So  don't know what he saw
And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr
McGuire
No
No more questions
: , a young marine corporal, is being sworn in
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Charlie
Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lt
Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of second platoon
Yes sir
Would you tell the Court the substance of that meeting
Lt
Kendrick told us that we had an informer in our group
That Private Santiago had gone outside the chain of command and reported to the on a member of our platoon
Did that make you mad
(pause) You can tell the truth, corporal, it's alright
Did it make you mad
Yes sir
How mad
Private Santiago betrayed a code that we believe in very deeply, sir
Were the other members of the squad angry
Object -- Were Dawson and Downey
Please the Court, is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on August 6th
Sustained
Corporal, did Lt
Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting
Yes sir
What was it
Well it was clear that he didn't want us to take matters into our own hands, sir
What was the order
Sir, he said that Santiago wasn't to be touched
(to ) Your witness
Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks room ten minutes after this meeting
No sir
Thanks,  have no more questions
gets off the stand, and  watches while walks past  and
barely perceptible exchange occurs between the eyes of  and
makes a decision
The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas -- Please the Court,  understand Lt
Ross is planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify
In light of the defense that Lt
Kaffee is planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony
The defense is willing to concede that all 23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and Downey's room at 16:20 on August 6th
(to ) Lieutenant
The Government'll agree to the stipulation, sir
Then we'll adjourn for the day
You can call your next witness in the morning
: : -  , two  are raising the flag
: - , a Navy doctor in his mid-40's, is on the stand
And he was pronounced dead at zero-zero-thirty-seven
Dr
Stone, what's lactic acidosis
If the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced
That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed
How long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar
Twenty to thirty minutes
And what caused Santiago's muscles and other cells to start burning sugar
An ingested poison of some kind
Your Honor, we object at this point
The witness is speculating
Commander Stone is an expert medical witness, in this courtroom his opinion isn't considered speculation
Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive
point which 'm confident you'll illustrate to the jury under cross- examination, so 'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now
Not at all, sir
Objection withdrawn
sits
Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning
Absolutely
Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison
Yes  am
Then how do you justify -- There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable, both in the human body and on a fabric
The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue
Thank you, sir
gets up
Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal
Yes
Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically
says nothing for a moment
(continuing) Commander, is it possible
Certainly
What might some of those conditions be
(beat) If a person had a coronary disorder
or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid
Commander, if  had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out
It would have to be a very serious condition
Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam
Possibly
There would still be symptoms though
What kind of symptoms
There are hundreds of symptoms of a -- Chest pains
(beat) Yes
Shortness of breath
Yes
Fatigue
Of course
has gone back to his table where  has handed him some documents
He shows then to
Doctor, is this your signature
Yes it is
This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty
Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir
(reading) "Initial testing negative
Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue
Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week
" Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction
No
personally give the men a physical examination every three months
And every three months Private Santiago got a clean bill of health
And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander
'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor
Object
Move to strike
Sustained
Strike it
No more questions, judge
stands immediately
Dr
Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men
In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned
Jo stands
Your Honor, we re-new our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record
And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony
and  are dying, but they're trying to keep their poker-faces
' gonna try to be polite about this, but he thought he made himself clear
The objection's overruled, counsel
Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection
The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled
Exception
Noted
The witness is an expert and the court will hear his opinion
Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned
Yes
Thank you, sir,  have no more questions
Commander, you may step down
Please the Court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises, the Government rests
We'll stand in recess until ten- hundred hours this Monday, the l9th at which time the defense will call it's first witness
raps his gavel
Ten hut
And the courtroom begins clearing out
,  and are packing up their various papers
strenuously object
Is that how it works
Objection
Overruled
No, no, no, no,  strenuously object
Oh, well if you strenuously object, let me take a moment to reconsider
got it on the record
You also got it in the jury's head that we're afraid of the doctor
You object once so they can hear you say he's not a criminologist
You keep after it and it looks like this great cross we did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks
It's the difference between paper law and trial -- Sam -- Christ, you even had the Judge saying Stone was an expert
Sam, she made a mistake
Let's not relive it
There's an uncomfortable silence
'm gonna go call my wife
'll meet you tonight
Sam starts to leave
turns and says Why do you hate them so much
Sam stops and turns around
They beat up on a weakling, and that's all they did
The rest is just smokefilled coffee-house crap
They tortured and tormented a weaker kid
They didn't like him
And they killed him
And why
Because he couldn't run very fast
long silence
makes a decision
Alright
Everybody take the night off
(continuing) apologize, , -- It's alright
We've been working 20 hour days for three and a half weeks straight
Take the night off
Go see your wife, see your daughter
Jo, do whatever it is you do when you're not here
What day is tomorrow
Saturday
We'll start at ten
picks up his stuff and walks out
and  stand there uncomfortably for a moment
begins packing up her things
Why do you like them so much
(pause) 'Cause they stand on a wall
(beat) And they say "Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight
Not on my watch
" Despite their differences,  likes this woman
Don't worry about the doctor
This trial starts Monday

's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat
He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room
He's studying it
Studying it hard
There's a knock on the door
answers it
is standing in the doorway
'm sorry to bother you,  should've called first
No,  was just watching a baseball game
was wondering if -- how you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight
Jo, are you asking me out on a date
No
It sounded like you were asking me out on a date
wasn't
've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like
Do you like seafood
know a good seafood place
: - On the Virginia side of the Potomac
and  are sitting at a table, finishing up dinner
My third case was a Drunk and Disorderly
The trial lasted nine weeks
rounded up 31 people who were in the bar that night
Nine weeks on a  and
What was the prosecutor offering
15 days
(pause) Well, you sure hustled the shit outta him
After that, they moved me to internal affairs
Tough to blame them
Where 've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation
Why are you always giving me your resume
Because  want you to think 'm good lawyer
do
No you don't
(beat) think you're an exceptional lawyer
watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you
see you convincing them
think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you
(pause) Jo
think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose
(beat) Ross's opening speech, it was all true
(beat) mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order
We can't prove it ever happened
(beat) We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder
We'll find Markinson
Jo, we're gonna lose
And we're gonna lose huge
We  on then for a moment, and in   hear (
) Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
: , the young marine who drove the lawyers around Cuba, is on the stand
Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red
Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run
Have you ever received a code red
Yes sir
We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped
It's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and 'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught
And what happened
That night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes
Then they poured glue on my hands
And it worked, too, 'cause ain't never dropped my weapon since
Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings
Yes sir
Was his barracks ever in disorder
Yes sir
Did he ever fall back on a run
All the time, sir
Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red
No sir
(beat) Never
No, sir
You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty
Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir
Dawson wouldn't allow it
The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him
They were too afraid of Dawson, sir
Object
The witness is characterizing
'll rephrase
Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red
Yes sir
Why didn't you
'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir
Good enough
Lt
Ross is gonna ask you some questions now
takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on the table
He brings one to
Corporal Howard,  hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits
Are you familiar with this book
Yes sir
Have you read it
Yes sir
Good
(hands him the book) Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please
Sir
Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds
Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use -- it's just used down at , sir
don't know if it actually -- has produced another book
We're in luck, then
The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am  correct
No sir
No
Corporal Howard, 'm a marine
Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds
(pause) No sir
No books, sir
No further questions
sits
walks over to 's table and picks up one of the books
He brings it to
Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is
Lt
Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir
don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book
guess  just followed the crowd at chow time, sir
No more questions
chucks the book back on 's desk
Corporal Howard, you can step down
(greatly relieved) Thank you, sir
gives  a subtle "You Did Good, Kid" look, and we : - It's the end of the day's session
walks down the hall with  and
Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review
want to slam- dunk this guy
: - ' as it drives along a street in the
business district
it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting against a rain  pulls over at his usual newsstand
He hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and runs to the stand
Hey, Luther
Admiral, how's the big case goin'
Nose to the grindstone
No flies on you
rolling stone gathers no moss
Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat lady sings
Ain't that the truth
Catch you tomorrow
He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger seat, and turns on the ignition
And as soon as he does -- a hand is slapped over his mouth -- (
) It's Matthew Markinson
-- and  jumps out of his skin
Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is Jesus fucking Christ
-- You left the door unlocked
Scared the shit outta me
Drive
Are you aware you're under subpoena
Yes
'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands
If there was something  could do about that,  would, but since  can't, all  can do is help you
Why don't you drive, Lieutenant
begins driving down the street
What do you know
know everything
Was it a code red
Yes
Did Kendrick give the order
Yes
Did you witness it
didn't need to -- Did you witness it
No
Then how do you know
know
You know shit
He was never gonna be transferred off the base
And with this,  screeches the car over to the side of the road
He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up
He turns to Markinson
(continuing) Jessep was going to keep him on the base
He said he wanted him trained
We've got the transfer order
It's got your signature
know
signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba
Six days after Santiago died
's wheels are spinning
He's pumped
'm gonna get you a deal
Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor
In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me
Right now 'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning
don't want a deal
And  don't want immunity
shakes his head and laughs
(continuing) want you to know, 'm proud neither of what 've done nor what 'm doing
puts the car in gear and we : '  - Where  has just finished telling his story to an amazed and
There's silence
Then  has a total adrenaline rush
Where is he
The Route 23 Best Western
picks up the phone
want him guarded
That's probably a good idea
(into phone) This is Lt
Commander Joanne Galloway
My clearance code is 411273
is impressed
He turns to  -- Clearance code
Thank you
(to ) don't have a clearance code
Do you have a -- (into phone) It's Jo Galloway
need to secure a witness
Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them
Sam is writing down notes as fast as he can
He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base
Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier
hangs up the phone
Damn
That was impressive
Did you hear what  just said about the flight
Yes
Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right
We need the Tower Chief's Log for (to ) Get it
We're gonna win
Jo, don't get crazy about this
We don't know who Markinson is
We don't know what the log book's gonna say
You just concentrate on Downey
'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are
(sing-song) "Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now
" You are like seven of the strangest women  have ever met
: - sets two drinks down in front of  and , who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the back
That was nice work today
The redirect on Howard
have Markinson
only takes a moment digest this
Where is he
motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door
Take a sip of your drink
Damn
The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney
And Jessep's statement that the six a
m
flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log
But in the meantime 'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun
takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the line for Kaffee
have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to Court-Martial for professional misconduct
And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out
Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man
'm not saying this to intimidate you
'm being your lawyer
Thanks, Jack
And  wanna tell you that  think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane
And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something
Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform
'm your friend, Danny, and 'm telling you, don't think your clients belong in jail
But  don't get to make that decision
represent the Government of the United States
Without passion or prejudice
And my client has a case
(pause) want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence
've been so advised
stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table
You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny
By everyone
By Dawson, by Galloway, shit,  practically dared you
Not for a second have you believed you could win
You got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer
(pause) You're a lousy softball player, Jack
Your boys are going down
can't stop it anymore
: - People are filing in
is standing at the entrance to the courtroom
glides past him
Batter up,
watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom as we : - 's on the stand
What drives Kaffee's entire examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him
He's gonna win
At least this round
All he has to do is not let his emotions take control of his professional skill
will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he needs them
Lt
Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good marine
'd say he was about average
Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on Santiago
On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below Average
Yes
Private Santiago was Below Average  didn't see the need in trampling on a man's grave
We appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and  think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth
'm aware of my oath
's handed some more files
Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and  Downey
Downey received three straight marks of Exceptional
Dawson received two marks of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this year, he received a rating of Below Average
It's this last report that 'd like to discuss for a moment
That's fine
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after Infantry Training School was perfect
Records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has remained a lance corporal
Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report
'm sure it was
Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report
'm sure  don't
have many men in my charge, Lieutenant,  write many fitness reports
Do you recall an incident involving a  Curtis Barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officer's Club
Yes
Did you report private Barnes to the proper authorities
have two books at my bedside, Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct and the King James Bible
The only proper authorities 'm aware of are my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan Jessep and the Lord our God
Lt
Kendrick, at your request,  can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority
Objection
Argumentative
Sustained
(to ) Watch yourself, counselor
Did you report Private Barnes to your superiors
remember thinking very highly of Private Barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge
You preferred it to be handled within the unit
most certainly did
Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red is
Yes  do
Have you ever ordered a code red
No,  have not
Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days
That's a distortion of the truth
Private Barnes was placed on barracks restriction
He was given water and vitamin supplements, and  assure you that at no time was his health in danger
'm sure it was lovely for Private Barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you
And you did order the denial of food
Yes
Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red
(beat) Not necessarily
If  called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red
Please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say
We object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness
The Government's objection is sustained, Lt
Kaffee, and  would remind you that you're now questioning marine officer with an impeccable service record
Thank you judge
looks over at
They share a brief moment before turns back to
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to Private Barnes
(to ) Not so fast
(to ) Lieutenant
Corporal Dawson was found to be Below Average because he committed a crime
What crime did he commit
(beat) Lieutenant Kendrick
(beat) Dawson brought a hungry guy some food
What crime did he commit
He disobeyed an order
And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right
Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order
Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it
After all, it's peacetime
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill
or advance on a beachhead
mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable
(beat) Lt
Kendrick
(beat) Can he
Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow
(pause) No, he can not
lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am  right
would think so
You know so, don't you, Lieutenant
Object
Sustained
Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question: if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red
-- please the court -- told those men not to touch Santiago
-- is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again
Lieutenant, don't answer that
You don't have to, 'm through
doesn't even wait before he says -- Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red
But  isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee
(continuing) Lt
Kendrick, did you -- No  did not
Thank you
: - a nerf ball slams into a hoop
'  - and
's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam walks in with some bound papers under his arm
What's the word
This is the tower chief's log for that night
Jessep was telling the truth
The six a
m
flight was the first plane out
lets the ball drop out of his hands
Let me see that
: - , with
stenciled on the door, sits in front of one of the rooms, and the two   inside the car are reading the newspaper as '  pulls next to them and  jumps out
#1 sticks his head out the window and calls to  -- #1 Workin' late, lieutenant
pays no attention and bangs on 's door
The door opens and  walks into tosses the log book on the table
There was no flight out at eleven o'clock
What the fuck are you trying to pull
The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two
Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log
Why the hell did you think it would be
is silent
And now it begins to sink in
What are you telling me
(beat) He fixed the log book
Setback
Big setback
(continuing) Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but  can sure as hall prove that one landed
'll get the log book from Andrews
says nothing
But his face says that  was born yesterday
(continuing; beat) He made an entire flight disappear
Nathan Jessep is about to be named Director of Operations for the National Security Council
You don't get to that position without knowing how to side-step a few land mines
(beat) And putting me on the stand isn't gonna make him step on one
stares at him
Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off the table, and heads for the door
You're taking the stand
Thursday
leaves
on
: ' '  later that night and  and J0 have just heard the report him
There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight
ground crew member
Someone
Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day
kid from the ground crew isn't gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago
Forget the flight
We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order
That'll be enough
That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough
: - Jo is working with
He sits on a mock witness stand
Private Downey, why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th
To give Private Santiago a Code Red, ma'am
And why did you give him a Code Red
was ordered to give him a Code Red by the Executive officer for Rifle Security Company Windward, Lieutenent Jonathan James Kendrick
smiles
You're gonna do fine
smiles
You think they'll let us go back to our platoon soon, ma'am
(pause) Absolutely
: - Jo is going over last-minute details with
You remember the order of the questions
Yes
Are you sure
Yes
And you'll use small words
Yes
He gets rattled when he doesn't understand something
Jo -- 'm just saying go slow
'm gonna go slow
Okay
Alright
And get him off as fast as you can
Joanne
What
He's gonna be fine
They turn and head into the courtroom as we in
(
) "Dear Mr
and Mrs
Santiago
" : '  - is writing a letter and we  it in
(
) was William's company commander
knew your son vaguely, which is to say  knew his name
And while we continue to  Markinson's voice writing the letter, we begin a   :  is getting into his class  dress uniform, complete with medals, side arm, and military dress sabre
(
) In a matter of time, the trial of the two man charged with your son's death will be concluded, and seven men and two women whom you've never met will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead
For my part, 've done as much as  can to bring the truth to light
is finished dressing
He stands in the middle of the motel room
(
) (continuing) And the truth is this: your son is dead for only one reason
wasn't strong enough to stop it
takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the trigger
(
) Always, Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson
puts the pistol in his mouth -- (
) United states marine corps
We  the  of the gunshot as we : - Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey
Private,  want you to tell us one last time: Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th
code red was ordered by my platoon commander, Lt
Jonathan James Kendrick
Thank you
(to ) Your witness
Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct
'm sure it is, sir, they keep that log pretty good
How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks
It's a ways, sir, it's a hike
About how far by jeep
About ten, fifteen minutes, sir
Have you ever had to walk it
Yes sir
That day, sir
Friday
The Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up
also, 'cause he can get girls in New York City -- the Pick-up Private got a flat
At the defense table, , poker-faced, scribbles something down on a piece of paper and slides it to
looks at it: "Where's he going with this
"  scribbles "
" And hands it back to
(continuing) Right at 39
He pulled up and blam
blowout-with no spare
The two of us had to double-time it back to the barracks
And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, 'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am  right
Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, sir
Not bad
Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt
Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 16:20
knows what's coming
There's nothing he can do about it
And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury
Yes sir
Helpless
Panicked
But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 16:45
's confused
These are questions he hasn't been asked before
Sir
If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20
(pause) You see sir, there was a flat tire
Private, did you ever actually hear Lt
Kendrick order a Code Red
's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing he can do about it
And he knows it
(pause) No, sir
Jo leaps to her feet
Please the court, 'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client
Why did you go into Santiago's room
The witness has rights
The witness has been read his rights, commander
(confused) Hal
The question will be repeated
Why did you go into Santiago's room
Your honor -- Hal
Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it
Everyone is frozen
(continuing) He did, didn't he
Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red
looks at
Hal
Don't look at him
Hal
Private
Answer the Lieutenant's question
The room is still silent
does something we've never seen him do before
He straightens himself up and says this with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right thing
Yes, Lieutenant
was given an order by my squad leader, Lance Corporal Harold
Dawson of the
Marine Corps
And  followed it
let's it hang
He looks over at
won't meet his eyes
'  - and  are sitting in silence
It's dark outside
Where do you think he is
doesn't know
is beside herself, and trying to keep it together
(continuing) As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick
It didn't matter that he didn't hear it first hand
He doesn't distinguish between the two
understands, but he doesn't say anything
The door opens and  walks in
(continuing) Danny
'm sorry
seems to be in an incredibly normal mood
Don't worry about it
Sam and  were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses who'll talk about implied orders
or maybe we put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson
Maybe if we work at it we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination
studies  for a moment
Are you drunk
(a simple answer) Pretty much
Yeah
(pause) 'll make a pot of coffee
We have a long night's work ahead
She's gonna make coffee
That's nice
(beat) He wasn't in his room
(Kaffee's amazed) He wasn't even there
(beat) That was an important piece of information, don't you think
(pause) Danny, it was just a setback
'm sorry
But we'll fix it and then move on to Markinson
Markinson's dead
and  are frozen
says this with no particular feeling one way or the other
(continuing) You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy
(he almost has to laugh) It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife
This guy got, into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth
Jo and  don't say anything
(continuing) Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses,  thought 'd drink a little
still think we can win
Then maybe you should drink a little
Look, we'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance
24 hours
(beat) Why would we want to do that
To subpoena Colonel Jessep
What
Listen for a second -- No
Just hear me out -- No
won't listen to you and  won't hear you out
Your passion is comforting, Jo
It's also useless
Private Downey needed a trial lawyer today
(pause) You chicken-shit
You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up
It's over
Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order
What are you -- In Cuba
Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order
What does it matter -- Why
wanted the damn transfer order
Bullshit
You could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon
You didn't want the transfer order
You wanted to see Jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order
You had an instinct
And it was confirmed by Markinson
Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing
What possible good could come from putting Jessep on the stand
He told Kendrick to order the Code Red
He did
Why didn't you say so
That's qreat
And of course you have proof of that
-- Ah,  keep forgetting: You were sick the day they taught law at law school
You put him on the stand and you get it from him
Yes
No problem
We get it from him
(to ) Colonel, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago
Look, we're all a little -- 'm sorry, your time's run out
What do we have for the losers, Judge
Well, for our defendants it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth
And for defense counsel Kaffee
That's right -- it's -- a court -- martial
Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt
Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Columbo School for Women
Thank you for playing "Should We or Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid"
And with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk ton of papers, books, files, etc
, falls to the floor
There's dead silence
Maybe just the sound of  breathing after this exhausting outburst
Finally
'm sorry  lost you your set of steak knives
Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out
The door slams behind her
walks into the kitchen without a word
gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk
comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels
Stop cleaning up
But Sam continues
(continuing) Sam
Stop cleaning up
stops and sits in a chair
sits on the couch
(continuing) You want a drink
Yeah
takes a swig from the bottle
Is your father proud of you
Don't do this to yourself
'll bet he is
'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives
"Sam, made Law Review
He's got a big case he's making -- He's arguing making an argument
" (pause) think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school
(beat) think he would've liked that
an awful lot
Did  ever tell you that  wrote a paper on your father in college
Yeah
He was one of the best trial lawyers ever
Yes he was
And if  were Dawson and Downey and had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, 'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday
You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick
Would you put Jessep on the stand
No
You think my father would've
With the evidence we've got
Not in a million years
But here's the thing -- and there's really no way of getting around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of versus Dawson and Downey
So there's only one question
What would you do
We  on the two of them for a moment, then : - is walking through the night at a brisk pace
She's doing her best not to fall apart
appear coming down the street, and 's , with  driving and  riding shotgun, slows down alongside
rolls down his window
Joanne
ignores them and keeps walking
The car crawls along with her
starts walking faster
(continuing) Jo, we look ridiculous
(to ) Stop the car
hops out and calls -- (continuing) Joanne
keeps walking
(continuing) apologize
was angry and
'm sorry about what  said
But ' still walking
(continuing; calling) 'm gonna put Jessep on the stand
She stops
She turns around
: '  -  - nerf ball bounces off the wall
,  and  are sprawled out in the living room
For hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea
's mind seems to be on his basketball game
say we hit him with the phoney transfer order
What's the transfer order without a witness
We have a witness
dead witness
And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem
Look at this
Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound
'm getting my second wind
Siddown
Both of you
He sees that  and  were already sitting down
(continuing) Good
(beat) Jessep told Kendrick to order a code red
Kendrick did, and our clients followed the order
The cover-up isn't our case
To win, Jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red
And you think you can got him to just say it
think he wants to say it
think he's pissed off that he's gotta hide from us
think he wants to say that he made a command decision and that's the end of it
He eats breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one's gonna tell him how to run his base
Least of all the pushy broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard clown
need to shake him and put him on the defensive
and  are silent for a moment
That's it
That's the plan
That's the plan
You're gonna trip Jessep and he's gonna confess
'm not gonna trip him
'm gonna lead him right where he's dying to go
And how are you gonna do that
have no idea
need my bat
What
(looking around) need my bat
think better with my bat
Where's my bat
put it in the closet
You put it in the closet
heads to the closet
was tripping over it
(
) Don't ever put a bat in a closet
He thinks better with his bat
And we go to
(
) can understand that
used to have stuffed panda named Mr
Boob could never do my home work without him
During this, 's opened the closet door
He reaches in to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something: His clothes
His uniforms and his civilian clothes
Hanging neatly along the bar
He stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads back through the living room towards the front door
Stay here, 'm going to the office for a while
storms out
Boy, he does think better with that bat
: - small room at the end of a corridor at the office stands over a printer and watches it spit out something he's been waiting for
He tears the printout off and we : '  - is looking over the computer printout
From what we can tell, it resembles a large, military coded phone bill
picks up the phone and dials
(into phone) Sam
(beat) need you to do something
: ' hangs up the phone slowly
What's goin' on
've gotta go out to Andrews
: - The day's session is going to begin in a few minutes comes around the corner and runs into Jo
Is Sam here
Not yet
Where is he
He's on his way
Did he got the guys
Yes
Listen, can  talk to you for a second
: -    - closes the door behind them
How're you feeling
think he's gonna have his hands full today
Listen
(beat) Danny
(beat) When you're out there
If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it (beat) don't go for it
looks at her
(continuing) If you feel like
if you feel like
You could get in trouble
(beat) 'm special counsel for internal affairs, and 'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble
Why Lt
Commander Galloway
are you suggesting  back off a material witness
If you think you can't get him
(beat) Yeah
Do you think  can get him
(beat) think it doesn't matter what think
'm an administrator
(beat) can't seem to defend people
takes that in
He picks up his briefcase and grabs his jacket
Then he turns to
You're my hero, Joanne
(beat) From the first day, you were a lawyer
(beat) Live with that
And in   we  the
(
) All rise
: - Everyone stands at attention as  enters
is missing
(to ) Call your witness
Where's Sam
He'll be here
Lieutenant, call your witness
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep
is escorted in through a side door
He's wearing his dress uniforms, adorned with the appropriate medals
Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General Court-Martial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God
Yes  do
Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air
Colonel Nathan
Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please
sits
Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the , you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right
Yes
The Executive Officer, Lt
Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson
Yes
And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right
Objection
'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying
'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive
Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information
just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a 45 caliber pistol
And from the back of the room,  enters
He's escorting two young  in Airforce dress uniforms
shows the to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the defense table
Over this we  -- (
) The witness is aware, the Court is aware, and now the jury is aware
We thank you for bringing this to our attention
Move on Lieutenant
scribbles something on a piece of paper,  walks over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: Cecil 'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to
Yes sir
Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt
Kendrick an order, is that right
told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched
And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well
ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately
Why
felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out
Grave danger
Is there another kind
holds up a document from his table
We have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning
Was that the first flight off the bass
The six a
m
flight was the first flight off the base
nods and decides to move on
steals a quick glance at the two  sitting out in the courtroom
Colonel, you flew up to Washington early this morning, is that right
Yes
notice you're wearing your Class appearance in dress uniform for court today
(continuing) As are you, Lieutenant
Did you wear that uniform on the plane
Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular
The defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor
'd ask the Court for a little latitude
very little latitude
Colonel
wore fatigues on the plane
And you brought your dress uniform with you
Yes
And a toothbrush
shaving kit
Change of underwear
Your honor
(to ) Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security
Gentlemen
(to ) You better get somewhere fast with this, Lieutenant
Yes sir
Colonel
brought a change of clothes and some personal items
Thank you
gets a document from his table
(continuing) After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth, Santiago's barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried
(reading) Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki tee-shirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater -- Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future
Lt
Kaffee,  have to -- 'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed
That landed
On the , ,
(continuing) 'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute
hands  the computer printout
(continuing) This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours
After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls
Handing Jessep the printout -- (continuing) 've highlighted those calls in yellow
Do you recognize those numbers
called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va
wanted to let him know 'd be in town
The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth
Why did you make that call, sir
thought she might like to have dinner tonight
Judge -- 'm gonna put a stop to this now
Jo's handed  another printout and a stack of letters
Your honor, these are the telephone records from  for August 6th
And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer
(to ) Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called
Zero
Nobody
Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home
Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport
He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker
You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls
Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing
Can you explain that
The fact is there was no transfer order
Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel
Object
Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt
Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury
It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt
Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies
ponders this a moment
(pause) Overruled
Your honor -- The objection's noted
(beat) Colonel
Jessep's smiling
and now he can't help but let out a short laugh
(continuing) Is this funny, sir
No
It's not
It's tragic
Do you have an answer
Absolutely
My answer is  don't have the first damn clue
Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq
And maybe he didn't have any friends
'm an educated man, but 'm afraid  can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago
What do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600
Now are these really the questions  was called here to answer
Phone calls and footlockers
Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant
Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve
These two marines are on trial for their lives
Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill
(beat) Do you have any other questions for me, counselor
The courtroom is silenced
Jessep's slammed the door
looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting for him to do something
Lt
Kaffee
says nothing
He glances over to  ' and (continuing) Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness
doesn't respond
gets up to leave
(standing) Thanks, Danny
love Washington
And  starts to leave, but he's stopped by -- Excuse me,  didn't dismiss you
turns around
beg your pardon
'm not through with my examination
Sit down
Colonel
What's that
(to ) 'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir
believe 've earned it
Defense counsel will address the witness as Colonel or Sir
(to ) don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here
And the witness will address this Court as Judge or Your Honor
'm quite certain 've earned it
Take your seat, Colonel
Jessep goes back to the stand
(continuing) What would you like to discuss now
My favorite color
Colonel, the six a
m
flight, was the first one off the base
Yes
There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a
m
Lieutenant,  think we've covered this, haven't we
gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that  scribbled on
Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base
The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p
m
, and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a
m
'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits "" and ""
don't understand
You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed
We believe it did, sir
(glancing at the paper, then motioning to the ) Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil 'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez
They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a
m
on the seventh
Your Honor, these men weren't on the list
Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination
If you looked closely at , you could see a drop of sweat
'll allow the witnesses
This is ridiculous
Colonel, a moment ago -- Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake
We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir
moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago
That's right
And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted
Crystal
Any chance Kendrick ignored the order
Ignored the order
Any chance he just forgot about it
No
Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, "The 'old man's wrong"
No
When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him
Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son
No sir
Ever served in a forward area
No sir
Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours
No sir
We follow orders, son
We follow orders or people die
It's that simple
Are we clear
Yes sir
Are we clear
Crystal
speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from knowing you're about to drop your opponents (continuing; beat) Colonel,  have just one more question before  call Airman 'Malley and Airman Perez: If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base
And  has no answer
Nothing
He sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost
Private Santiago was a sub-standard marine
He was being transferred off the base because -- But that's not what you said
You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger
(pause) Yes
That's correct, but -- You said, "He was in danger"
said, "Grave danger"
You said -- Yes,  recall what -- can have the Court Reporter read back your -- know what  said
don't need it read back to me like 'm a damn -- Then why the two orders
(beat) Colonel
(beat) Why did you -- Sometimes men take matters into their own hands
No sir
You made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands
Your men follow orders or people die
So Santiago shouldn't have been in any danger at all, should he have, Colonel
Everyone's sweating now
Everyone but
You little bastard
Your Honor,  have to ask for a recess to -- 'd like an answer to the question, Judge
The Court'll wait for answer
If Kendrick told his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched, then why did he have to be transferred
Jessep is looking at ' and
(continuing) Colonel
says nothing
(continuing) Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't he
Because that's what you told Kendrick to do
Object
Counsel
will plow through the objections of  and the admonishments of
And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose
Your Honor -- That'll be all, counsel
You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order -- Judge -- You doctored the log books
Damnit Kaffee
'll ask for the forth time
You ordered -- You want answers
think 'm entitled to them
You want answers
want the truth
You can't handle the truth
And nobody moves
(continuing) Son, we live in a world that has walls
And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns
Who's gonna do it
You
You, Lt
Weinberg have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom
You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines
You have that luxury
You have the luxury of not knowing what know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives
(beat) You don't want the truth
Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall
You need me there
(boasting) We use words like honor, code, loyalty
we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something
You use 'em as a punchline
(beat) have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom  provide, then questions the manner in which provide it
'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way
Otherwise,  suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post
Either way, don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to
(quietly) Did you order the code red
(beat) did the job you sent me to do
Did you order the code red
(pause) You're goddamn right  did
Silence
From everyone
, , the
's, they're all frozen
and  are likewise
seems strangely, quietly relieved
simply takes control of the room now
Please the court,  suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session
The witness has rights
Silence
looks to
Lt
Ross
is frozen
He doesn't know what to do
(as a friend) Jack
looks at , then , then nods his head "yes" to
The Sergeant at Arms will take the jury to an ante-room where you'll wait until further instruction
The    begins leading the  out of the room
What the hell's going on
No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the room
(continuing; to captain) Captain, what the hell's going on did my job
'd do it again
Now 'm getting on a plane and going back to my base
's, guard the prisoner
The
's are tentative
They've never heard a marine colonel referred to as "the prisoner" before
They sure as hell have never been asked to guard one
Guard the prisoner
What the hell -- Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent
Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding
You have the right
continues reading  his rights, over -- 'm being charged with a crime
'm -- that's what this is -- (to Ross) Marine
(Ross keeps going) Marine
(Ross is doing his job
) 'm being charged with a crime
'm -- that's what's happening
This -- 'm -- this is funny, you know that, this is -- And  lunges at , and  would be dead but for the three
's who've leapt in to restrain
and  have come to their feet and stand behind
(continuing; to Kaffee) 'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull
You fucked with the wrong marine
is done reading  his rights
Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as  have just read then to you
saved lives
That boy was -- there was a weak link
saved lives, you hear me
The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst
Jessep shakes his head
(continuing) You fuckin' people
(beat) You have no idea how to defend a nation
(continuing; to ) All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee
That's all you did
You put people in danger
Sweet dreams, son
Don't call me son
(beat) 'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy
And you're under arrest you sonofabitch
stays on  a moment longer, then remembers -- (continuing) The witness is excused
The
's start leading  out, and  notices And
And
who are watching a man in a marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat from his hands
He takes a deep breath as we : - There's low murmur in the room as the  are being led back into their box
Everyone's in place
enters
Ten-hut
All rise
And sit when  sits
Have the jurors reached a verdict
We have, sir
The    takes all the slips of paper from the and brings them to
stands, and nods to  and  that they should do the same
and  stand as well
(reading) On the charge of Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty
It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but they do
(continuing; reading) On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty
looks up
Then reads from the last slip of paper
(continuing) On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine, the members find the defendants Guilty as Charged
little of the energy drains out of the room continues reading
(continuing; reading) The defendants are hereby sentenced by this court to time already served, and are ordered
clears his throat
(continuing) And are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the marine corps
(pause) This Court-Martial is adjourned
raps his gavel
Ten hut
All rise
's gone
(continuing) Dismissed
The
's move to  and  to unlock their handcuffs
is packing up his things, just another day at the office
Why
Harold, 'm sorry
Why
don't understand
Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red
know, but -- Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red, what did we do wrong
It's not as simple as -- What did we do wrong
We did nothing wrong
slaps his hands down on the table -- Yes you did
jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine
What does that mean
You're the lawyer
You're the marine
Not anymore
lets it hang
is staring at
His stare moves slowly to the floor
(continuing) never meant to hurt Willy
looks up at
The moment hangs there
before Kaffee, 've gotta take these guys over to personnel for some paper work
nods
(continuing; to Dawson & Downey) Gentleman
looks to
There's gotta be more
This can't be it
But  has nothing to say
and  walk to the    and begin to follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom
But before they get to the door,  turns around and calls Harold
They stop and turn around
Sir
(pause) You don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor
stares at  for a long moment
Ten-hut
and  come to attention
(continuing) There's an officer on deck
snaps a salute and holds it
stares back
Then stands up straight and returns their salute
With one last glance back at ,  turns and walks out the door, followed by
walks over to the defense table
Airmen Cecil 'Malley and Anthony Perez
What exactly were these guys gonna testify to
Unless 'm mistaken they were gonna testify, under oath, that they have absolutely no recollection of anything
smiles
Strong witnesses
And very handsome, too, don't you think
'll see you around the campus
've gotta go arrest Kendrick
Tell him  say "Hi"
Will do
: - ,  and  are walking down the steps
The  is practicing on the parade grounds
What do you say we take the rest of the day off
Go out someplace
Sam
Champagne
Yoo-Hoo
Thanks,  can't
'm gonna go home and talk to my daughter
think she's gotta be bilingual by now
And  heads off toward his car
So what's next for you
Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson
He went to the movies on company time
What about you
Me
Oh
you know
the usual
Just pretty much generally annoying people
Yeah
(pause) So what do you say
How 'bout a celebration
No
How 'bout a date
real date
Dinner
Attractive clothes
The works
Sounds good
Who do you think should call
'll pick you up at seven
What are you gonna do now
'm gonna get started on Henry Williamson
(beat) Stand my post for a while
holds out her hand
shakes it
kisses him
Wear matching socks
