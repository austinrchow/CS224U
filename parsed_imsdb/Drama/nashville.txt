They don't seem to be answering
The ambulance boys are here, though
Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot
That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going
Thank you, Bud
nods like he has been complimented

' - in doing some vocal exercising
listens for awhile
Is that what you're going to sing
She laughs
No -- That's exercises

Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger
That's the place where sing

She makes several phone calls and can't locate anyone
She sighs and hangs up
You want me to wait
No

He is stunned
If you'll wait Just a minute 'll get everything from the business office
146B He wanders to the waiting area
has been looking out the window at   getting into the bus
He comes back and begins to talk to  so caught up in her he doesn't register ' grief
(loudly) My mamma used to know her
They lived next door to each other
she said she was always nursing the sick animals
looks at him and nods
He's still got the vitamins in his hand
really learned all about her from my Momma -- She's been saving this scrap book about her since she got to be famous
nods
The one thing she said to me when joined was "When you're doing your travels you be sure you see Barbara Jean
You don't have to say anything about me but you be sure you see her
"  So that's what 've been doing
Now 'm going to hitch a ride so  can see her in Memphis
nods
You give my test to your wife1 nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the  calls from the desk
Mr
Green, the doctor is on his way and the business office has your bill ready

- works her way through a crowd of men trying to get into the banquet hall
There is a sign that says "Benefit Banquet
" finally makes it through the crowd and enters the room
152
- She walks past the tables and steps on the stage
She checks the curtain to find that there is no backstage
She enters the kitchen
153
- almost trips over  and  and another man who are talking
Hi, 'm Sueleen Gay
'm John Triplette
Excuse me got all caught up in looking at you
You'll be fine
Oh, why thank you
May  see your costume
She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day
stares blatantly and  can hardly keep his hands off her
starts into her routine as a matter of survival
You like it
Listen, where is the pianist
need to go over this with him
She hands over a stack of music
You all didn't say what you wanted to hear
smiles
Someday 'm gonna be a star like Barbara Jean
puts his arm around her and walks off
154 Sueleen, you're prettier and probably sing better
Besides, she is unusually sick
And tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen
They continue to walk past the many places
Have you ever done this before
She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air
Well, it's not too hard
You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing
They'll applaud like crazy 'cause  can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing
It really doesn't make much difference, really
But since you've never done this before, singing might help
They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the oven
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself
The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise
(like a robot) see
know that you are an artist and am sure you are very religious
She nods "yes
" Well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live
155 The waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef starts to carve the meat
We  one of the waiters into the banquet hall
156
- It is almost full
The pianist and the drummer are on the non- stage
At the far end of the roam, we  someone enter from the street, go to the sign and read it
157	  - It is  reading "banquet
" The door to the room closes and she goes down another corridor and disappears
158
- The men have finished their dinner and  finishes her song
The applause is thunderous
looks to the kitchen door
159 is applauding like crazy
in beside him
160 She blows kisses then runs to
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room
It's too late
The  speaks
We're ready to striiippppp
for cash, gentlemen
The time has come to dig deep
Our little Sueleen in going to dig deep for you
There are a few chortles
Suddenly she freezes
holds her and kisses her hair
Page missing 165 encases her in her coat
yells something about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy

She picks up ' clothes

-  '  - drives  home
He is drunk
He double-parks
Here we are, Sueleen
She looks out the window and nods
He gets out and opens the door as   walks past them on her way to the lounge
drives up behind ' double-parked ear and has to move around it
starts for her room, but  follows very close
Finally, he turns her around
Sueleen
Sueleen Gay
His look says what he wants
She is terrified
Oh, no
She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm
Wait a minute
want to look at you
'mon
Oh, please, Oh, God
He pushes her against one or the storefronts
'mon
Just wanna look
He squeezes her arm and she screams
167	: Good
wanna look really good
You know what  mean
Do you
Huh
She is about to pass out from terror, when all or a sudden he eases of
168 The   stands and watches a few feet away
' terror now is divided between the two men
can't handle the way the   looks at all
Oh
He releases , turns and runs up the street
She slides down and hugs herself
The   doesn't move
It'll be okay
It'll be okay know it'll be fine
After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to her room

She nods 'yes

She takes out her glasses and looks through them lorgnette style as  continues to talk

He saw us at Tammany Hall
The Hell he did

There is a large crowd, and several people gathered around the platform

Radio station personnel and musicians prepare for the show
Finally, the bus door opens and leads   to the platform
The musicians start and she sings
The sound comes from many huge speakers and people come from stores and shops to hear
segues from one song to another
179 stands to the side, talking to various people pulls his sleeve
Well, for heaven's sake
You're just about everywhere, aren't you
came out to see how you all were doing
think  should tell you  know why you're here
The answer is no we don't get involved in politics
(laughs good- naturedly) Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett
At least not according to Haven
Haven
Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen
guess that's why he thought you right want to help out
He knows better
Well, it's probably because it would help him
How is that
Everybody likes to be as good as their word
Whose word
His Word
His word
Are you telling me Haven promised you something
That's pretty close
He's going to be on the bill
Why not put Barbara Jean on with him
' last sentence is caught in silence as has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase
180 She holds the mike and looks at Barnett
Barnett
She faints
There in a moment of confusion, then  is on the stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out 181 vaults through the crowd pushing  aside
Get her feet up
He pulls himself on the stage
She is coming to and sees ' face looking at her and rubbing her hands
Okay, honey
He carries her to the bus
is forced to watch from a distance
182
- has come to and she and  are alone in the back of the bus
He studies her carefully for a minute and then decides she'll be all right
Oh, Barnett, 'm so sorry
Honey, it's okay
How do you feel now
All those people
She fights back the tears
Don't worry, 'll take care or it You're so good
He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus
183
- sends the nurses inside
has pushed to front of the crowd
grabs a hand mike
She's fine now, folks
Just too soon after the hospital,  guess
(he pauses) She won't be able to continue and she's in the bus crying her eyes out, because she doesn't want to disappoint the people who love her the most
There is a group groan
looks for some under-standing but there is none
There are several catcalls and , who in near , becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller
There is almost a fight, but  intervenes
He glances to Come on, come on
You don't want to waste your energy on that fool
184 Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience shouts against , who has turned his intensity to the crowd She's frail
You never saw anybody so frail
've seen her breathe hard just standing still, dammit
You're selfish
Worst selfish 've ever heard
What if she died
Would you like that
You'd probably say she faked it so they could make money
Well, you're just dumb
185 We could invite them to the park
What
They can come to the concert in the park
said 'no
' studies the angry crowd then , who is holding back  against them
The crowd is even more angry (to crowd) We're very Sorry

Triplette,  want to talk to you
Moves closer

Absolutely
Listen, Barnett, understand your position
No, you don't, so don't say you do
Bunch of damn liars
What do you get out or this
Nothing; Barnett
It's my job
Your job, huh
He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he speaks
She will not appear on the stage or support that Walker guy and you can't have any of his signs up while she sings
She'll be on first and out of the park before he shows up
There will be no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come
Any money she makes will go to the President of the United States
He calls over his secretary and makes  sign the statement
Then the secretary signs
We'll see you tomorrow
'll send her three songs over this afternoon
She'll be done about ten minutes after she starts and Walker better not show up till she's through
Now, get out of here
extends his hand expecting friendship
ignores it
As  leaves, a  who has been after ' attention steps up
turns to his secretary
Barnett
(sharply) What
Well, Barnett,  have this terrific song 've been working on
It would be a natural for Barbara Jean
Like you to take a look at it
looks at him suspiciously
'm very busy right now
(to secretary) Get me Haven
It'll just take a minute
Here, 'll even hold it for you
sighs and skims over the paper
Song stealing is the same as horse stealing to
He becomes enraged
don't know where you got this, but something tells me you stole it and  hate thieves
The  takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- yells after him
Aren't you an engineer
know you -- Don't you work at one of those cut a record places
Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it
Usually their last twenty-five
The  backs up and  follows him
They have entered the crowd
