' , thirtiesh, articulate, speaks over credit tableaus: (
) This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance
We who loved him no longer speak of Wade
It's as if he never existed
By telling his story like this, as his brother, separate myself from his family and those who loved him
Everything of importance -- that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story -- occurred during a single deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade was raised and so was
One night something changed and my relation to Wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood
mark this change by Wade's tone of voice during a phone call two nights after Halloween
Something  had not heard before
Let us imagine that around eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes a pale green eight-year-old Ford Fairlane with a police bubble on top
square-faced man wearing a trooper's cap is driving the vehicle
Beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face
The man is driving fast -- -- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night
pale green police Ford Fairlane drives past
/
- , driving, sits beside , his daughter, ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask
'm sorry for the screw-up
But couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now
couldn't help it  had to stop at Penny's for the costume
And you were hungry, remember
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours
You're the one in charge, Daddy
(shakes cigarette from pack) Yeah
Look
Those kids are still trick-or- treating
They're still out
Wade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette
Those are the Hoyts
don't care
They're out
Can't you see
look out there
Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore
It's too late
Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble
See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there
They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes
Little bastards
Jesus
Christ
Wade grimaces, holds his jaw
The Fairlane swerves around broken pumpkins under a caution light
Why do they do that
Do what
You know
Break stuff
Yeah
It's stupid
guess they're stupid
Did you do that when you were a kid
Well, yeah
Sort of
Nothing really mean
Me and my pals, me and my brothers
It was kind of funny then
Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows
Stuff like that
Was it funny
To us it was
But it's not funny now
It's not funny now
'm a cop and gotta listen to all the complaints people make
'm not a kid anymore
You change
bet you did lots of bad things
What are you talking about
just think you used to be bad
No
didn't used to be bad
No sir
Where do you get this stuff
From your mother
No
She doesn't talk about you anymore
Wade looks at her, wanting to lift her mask, see her face
: - The Fairlane approaches Town Hall, a square two-story building on the north side of the Common
Exhaust billows from idling cars as parents and children come and go
: - Clowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit room
Parents watch from the walls as  , a beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat-top, announces the costume contest
Wade nods to various townspeople
We're looking for the funniest costume
And the scariest
And the most imaginative
And the best costume of all
(nudges Jill) Got here just in time
Go ahead
Jump in line
Maybe you'll win a prize
Jill steps forward, retreats
Wade looks at her flaxen hair, her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume
His heart aches he loves her so
Go on, Jill
Some of those kids you still know
don't want to
Why
Why not
You know these kids from when you went to school here
It hasn't been that long
It's not that
What then
It's stupid
It's fun
(voice breaking) want to go home
(Wade kneels down) don't like it here
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you
Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up
Join the other kids
Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam
Wade inches her toward the circle of children
Gordon spots them: Wade
And who's that tiger
Is that Jill
Come and join us
Jill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children
former classmate calls her name
Wade, relieved, watches, then steps outside for a smoke
: - Wade steps outside, lights a cigarette
, 23, clean-cut, handsome, cocky, stands with   and , local boys
What are you boys up to
Same old shit
You see the damage these little sons- of bitches been raising tonight
(to Jack) You're going to have to move your pickup
know
(offers whiskey pint) Take a bite
Don't mind if  do
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there
Master of fucking ceremonies
Where's that gun you were bragging on today
Jack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes a Browning
30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade
No brag
Just fact
(admires gun) Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks
(passes it to Frankie) Nice
(to Wade) See you got Jill tonight
How'd you manage that
(turns) Don't forget to move your truck
(walks inside) : - On stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners
fairy godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in his mother's grip -- a hard loser
Wade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the losers; she's nowhere to be found
He heads toward a hall leading to the restrooms
Jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, forlorn
Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her before she had found a friend
Some party, huh
Sorry  lost sight of you
had to step outside for a smoke
You find anybody you know here
There must be some kids you used to know from school
You want to go tomorrow
See your old teachers
Be more fun than hanging out with me all day
No
No what
(lifts mask atop head) No  didn't see anybody  know
No don't want to go to school here tomorrow
want to go home
You are home
There are lots of kids you still know here
don't want to be here
Don't worry, love you, Daddy,  do
But  want to go home
(sighs) Jesus
Listen, Jill, tell you what
Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, 'll drive you down
'll get off work or something
(pause) called Mommy
What
You called Mommy
Just now
Yes
Jesus, why
because  want to go home
She said she'd come and get me
Come and get you
Shit
It's a damn half hour drive each way
Why didn't you talk to me about it first
See,  knew you'd be mad
Yeah
Yeah, right, 'm mad
What'd you tell her, for Christ sake
told her  wanted to come home
Daddy, don't be mad at me
Well,  guess  am
planned this, planned all this, you know
mean, it's sort of pathetic, but  planned it
You shouldn't have called your mother
(takes her arm) 'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves
: - Wade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading "", enters
Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the desk phone
More utility room than office
He waits
There's no answer
Jill looks down
She's gone already
(hangs up) Gone already
Couldn't wait
Yes
That's all you got to say
"Yes"
Yes
She won't be here for a half hour
Think you can stand it that long
Yes
Where do you expect to wait for her
Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough
Jill sits in a chair facing the dark window pane
Sit right there by yourself if you want
Wait for her by yourself
That's fine with me
Just dandy
'm going downstairs
That's fine with me too
When Mommy comes, tell her 'm up here
Wade Whitehouse stalks out
: - Wade steps outside, notices Jack Hewitt and his kewpie-doll girlfriend , 20, sitting in the cab of his double-parked pickup, sharing a joint, talking to LaCoy alongside
thought  told you to move that truck
Relax, Chief
We're leaving
You wanna toke
(steps over) You gotta be more careful about that shit
Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you
And 'll be outta a job
Some job
Here, have a hit
Don't be such a hardass
know you got problems, but everybody's got problems
(offers joint) Not here
LaCoy laughs: that Jack Hewitt, some guy
Wade holds his aching jaw
He looks at Jack's young athletic body, his pretty girlfriend, envies him
Well, c'mon, then
Get in and we'll take a little ride, my man
Wade looks up to the window where Jill waits, walks around the front of the truck, gets in
: /
'  - Jack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge
Jack lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie leans forward to hear the music
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season
Saturday 'll hunt for myself
Twombley something
- Er -- Evan
He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts
You're lucky
Don't know about lucky
The guy's a full-blown asshole
Pay's good, though
$100 a day
got to guarantee a kill, of course
Which  can do
There's some monster bucks hiding out up there
How'd you get the job
Gordon, he's always got some angle working
He wants to keep Twombley happy, 'm his boy
Wade grimaces as he passes the joint back
What's wrong with you
Toothache
(to Jack) You should get close to him
Make yourself irreplaceable
Guy's loaded
Like you and Gordon
Right
The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me
(laughs) Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him
(laughs) Right
car flashes past
Bastard's got his high beams on
(watching) Shit
What
My ex-wife Lillian and her husband
That was them in the Audi that just passed us
Audi's a good car
What's she up here for
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill
Me and Jill had a little argument
Jack, got to get back, get back to town
Move this thing, will you
See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay
Piece of fucking cake
Jack brakes, wheels the 4x4 around, heads back to town
: - Most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed children
Hewitt's burgundy pickup breaks alongside the Audi
Wade swings open the passenger door, jumps to the ground: Lillian
Where's Jill
, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat
Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite
Her dress and demeanor set her apart
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat
She felt kind of left out, guess, from not knowing some of the new kids -- Where is she now
Is she in the truck with your friends
Jack and Hettie neck inside the cab
She told me she wanted to wait for you
Inside
Jill at the window in her tiger mask
Lillian waves; Jill motions she'll be down
While you went off for a few beers with your friends
Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname
Yeah
She's grown up some, hasn't she
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you
It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake
, 45, Lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair and a Tyrolean hat, sees Jill at the entrance and heads toward her
Horner
Leave her be
This's got nothing to do with you, so just act like the chauffeur
Got it
Wade
Nobody wants any trouble
Horner greets Jill, walks her to the silver Audi
Passing parents, listening, give Wade a wide berth
don't want her to go, Lillian
Don't cause a scene
No one's trying to win any 'rounds'
Don't make it any worse
'm not making it any worse
You are
Me and Jill could've worked this thing out
It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it
Believe it or not
How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something
Horner opens the car door for Jill, shuts it
Wade shoves him: Just wait till we're through, goddamnit
Horner's hat falls
Lillian, icy, stares at Wade
He backs off
Wade sometimes wonders: how'd Lillian Pittman of Lawford, , get so much class
Don't you say a word
didn't hit him
'm not going to hit anybody
Horner sits behind the wheel
Lillian silently stares Wade up and down, gets in the car beside Jill
The automatic locks latch as the Audi drives away
Its taillights merge with vanishing traffic
Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, examines it, as if unsure of its function
Wade walks toward Town Hall
, exiting, greets him: New hat
(no answer) Jill's up,  see
(vague) For a while
How's she doing
Okay
She's fine
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay
'm off
, 45, Marg's boss, passes by: Like hell you are
Tomorrow's first day of deer season
'll need you at least in the morning
(shrugs) Well, that's that
(walks off) Take care, Wade
You be careful of that little bastard
He's dying to get in your pants, you know
(laughs) Don't worry
can protect my virtue
mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break
See you tomorrow, maybe
You okay
Yeah
Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall
At the door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him
Wade tosses Horner's hat inside
Tomorrow, Gordon
Watch this snow
It's coming down tonight
Wade nods as he lights a cigarette
Alone, he watches the last cars pull out
He holds his jaw
: '   - Pre-dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather-beaten mobile homes set off Route 29
Snow continues to fall
sheet of white stretches down Parker mountain
: '  - 6:40
clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock
Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy teeth, shuts off the music
He looks out the window, grunts: "Shit
" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch, dials
Wade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely cleans up
(on phone) Lugene
Wade
Hoya doin
(fumbles for cigarette) Look,  was wondering, with the snow and all, if you got school today
(lights cigarette) How the hell do  know
You're the principal
All 'm supposed to do is direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30
(listens) Yeah, okay, 'm sorry --  only just now saw it was snowing, that's all
My whole day is fucked
gotta plow all day
If  don't get over to LaRiviere's early enough, 'm stuck with the grader
was just hoping you'd have called school off
(beat) You check the weather bureau
(acquiesces) Okay,  hear you
'll be over in a bit
(hangs up) : '    - Jack Hewitt's 4x4 passes Wade's trailer, continues up 29
Tire chains splice the path
: '   - Jack behind the wheel
Beside him  , 60, fleshy, Irish, wearing brand new scarlet wool pants, jacket and cap
He feeds on the misfortunes of others
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards
No advantage there, kid
Don't worry, Mr
Twombley,  know where those suckers are
Rain or shine, snow or no snow
know deer
We'll kill us a buck today
Guaranteed
Before ten
Guaranteed, eh
Yep
Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles
The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks
(gestures to gun rack) This gun gets fired before ten o'clock
Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you
'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season
That's what you're paying me for, ain't it
Damn straight
Hewitt looks at Twombley's rifle: a Winchester -94 pump- action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it
Never fired, at least not by Twombley
Done much shooting with that rifle yet
(eyes him) Tell you what
You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it
If you get it
Yeah
You might not kill it
You think so
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag
Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun
may have to shoot it
You take care of your end, kid, 'll take care of mine
Mmm
You understand what 'm saying want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck
get it
(disdain) No sweat
You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead
And you'll have him by coffee time
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks
(smiles) Wonderful
The pickup disappears behind a curve of pine and spruce trees
: - Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district school bus into the parking lot
Noisy, jostling grade schoolers emerge from the bus
Jill's former classmates
Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic
Cars and trucks are backed up on the unplowed road
Horns honk and bleat; a woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day
" Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion
Oblivious -- or just plum contrary
shiny black  approaches, speeding, passing traffic on the shoulder
man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, two children in back
Whitehouse waves for it to stop
The  accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade and the traffic
It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust
Wade slips to one knee
Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes
Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls in
, 60, school principal, rushes over: Are you okay, Wade
What was wrong
Why were you holding everyone up
Did you see that sonofabitch in the He could've killed somebody
Did you get his number
know who it is
Good
Who
Mel Gordon
still don't understand -- From Boston
Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving
know where they're headed
Up the lake, Agaway
The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned
Wade sets his face, thinking
: - Snowprints lead from Jack's pickup to where he and Twombley walk, guns pointed skyward
They enter a line of trees
Jack watches Twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot
He looks from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching Twombley
They're alone
Safety on
Twombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground
His rifle lands silently
Jack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the Winchester
Hands it back
'm okay
Follow close
We'll cross the next meadow
Jack finds a path, one eye on Twombley: used to play ball
Yeah
Drafted by the Red Sox
You played for the Sox
Double
New Britain
Oh
Pitcher
"Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk
" Really
They said
Hmm
The only difference between me and that Clemens on  is luck, shit luck
What happened
Ruined my arm
Brought me along too fast
Why'd it have to be my fucking arm,  used to think
Then  realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm
Jack waits for Twombley as they enter a meadow
Jack aims his rifle at Twombley as he approaches
Hey, Hewitt
Slow the fuck down
Jack aims away, following an imaginary bird
Twombley steps alongside
Safety on
Yeah
This way
(walking loudly) Sun's gettin high
(fingers to lips) Deers have ears too
: - Milky sky flatters LaRiviere Co
, a sprawl of well-digging, septic and snow plow equipment
Billboard declaimes: "
--
" a motto repeated on every truck and piece of equipment
Wade's green Fairlane is parked outside the office
: - Wade, puffing a cigarette, passes ' (LaRiviere secretary) desk, her large red "No Smoking" sign, eases into an office modum chair
He unzips his jacket, slaps his cap against his thigh, spraying drops of melted snow
Gordon LaRiviere, speaking on the phone past a glass partition, calls to Wade: Told you the snow was coming down
Take the grader
Where's the plow
Jimmy took it
Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley
His son-in-law damn near killed me
(hangs up) Huh
At the school crossing
In his
Coulda hurt some kids
'm gonna bust his ass
Don't go playing policeman
What am  -- a security guard
You hired me, you and your Selectman friends
You don't want the extra police pay
'm not saying that
Get the grader
Go out 29 past Toby's
Don't let Lillian get to you
She didn't belong here
That's why she left
Fuck you
That's what  love about a small town
You know everybody
Wade exits toward the blue grader
: - Jack and Twombley walk through fresh snow
The hillside's thick with pine trees
Twombley, red-faced, puffing, leans to speak to Hewitt
Jack lifts a finger to his lips: Stay here, stand where  am
Twombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty feet below
Jack points: Fresh tracks
(sniffs) Deer shit
Big one
Here's your buck, Mr
Twombley
'll circle around
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks
Jack zig-zags down the incline, while Twombley, gun poised, waddles along the edge
Jack stops fifty feet away, watches Twombley, a cartoon character
stag pokes his nose through the pines, steps into a clearing
Jack aims his rifle, looks at Twombley
Twombley turns to see the buck, loses his footing, down the twenty-foot cliff
: '  - An open cab grader ("Our Business Is Going In The Hole") sits in the rutted lot outside Toby's, a beer joint with fake wood siding and 24-hour neon sign
four-wheel drive plow with the LaRiviere motto pulls in, parks beside the blue grader
, 40, gets out, glances at the grader as he enters
: '  - Jimmy joins Wade at the bar, calls for a beer
Frankie LaCoy bullshits with two long-haired locals at a nearby table; their conversation drifts in and out
Country music plays through a broken juke box speaker
Wade touches his tooth, grimaces
How's it goin
Cold
How you think
Sorry about that
Why's it every year, come first snow, you get stuck with the grader
School
Traffic crossing
(lights cigarette) gotta quit these things
What we doing after
Wells
(Wade nods) Don't work too fast
Business the way it is, Gordon's probably looking to lay me off earlier than usual this year
He's got too much money as it is
Why's it always the little guy that gets kicked in the butt in hard times
Wade shrugs
LaCoy's conversation has caught his ear
He turns to watch
That was no pisser
'll tell you who was a pisser
Glen Whitehouse
There was a real pisser
He was mean normal, but when he drank it was like he burst on fire
Canadian Club
Always drank
One Christmas there's this cord of wood out back he forgot about and he decides to have his two boys stack it
Except it's been out back two months and it's snowed and rained and froze so now the wood's all iced in
He takes the boys
He was drunk, of course
Wade's face as the story comes to life: : -  (1964) Thirty years before
(""), 42, pushes his boys, Wade (13) and Rolfe (10), toward snow-covered lumps of firewood behind the barn
He's drunk
The boys carry shovels and a pickaxe
Move it
Daylight in the swamps
Pop, the kids are waiting for us
(reproving) Rolfe
lesson in work and its rewards
You'll thank me for this one day
(to house) Sally, turn off that
His sons chip at the wood
Hopeless
Frozen solid
(to Rolfe) Just do it
Atta-go
Please, Pop
Let's go back
Wade notices his mother, , watching from the window
What are you, a quitter
: '  - LaCoy roars with laughter
- (puzzled) So what happened
Beats me
That's all  heard
Wade would know more about it
(calls) Wade
We were just talking about your Old Man
"What are you, a quitter
" Wade grabs his keys, walks over
Jimmy follows
Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better to do than sit around and tell stories
Pity is, some college student will come some day and believe this shit cause you're the only one dumb enough to talk to him
Take care
Wade and Jimmy head out
: - Wade, shivering in the open grader, plows a narrow winding road
He lights a cigarette, exhales steamy smoke
LaCoy's laugh triggers a memory: : -  (1964) The flashback continues: Glen Whitehouse pushes his sons inside
Sally steps from sight
Out back, the firewood lies frozen amid futile shovel marks
That was some job
We'll work at it everyday, promise
think we made the point
(mumbles) You just needed a drink
Pop, swigging Canadian Club, turns: What was that
(no answer) You got something to say, say it
Say it
(soft) Nothing
You no-good pup
Rolfe runs from the room screaming, "Mom
" : ' - The town's 24-hour restaurant
bright new sign reads: "Home Made Cooking
" Wade's grader out front
: ' - Wade, eating lunch at the counter, talks with Nick Wickham: It don't look right
What
The sign
It looks like it's spelled wrong or something
Fuck
Wade Whitehouse
It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering
Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it
'm not finding fault
It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town
Real modern too
This town sucks
Aw, c'mon,  was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all
The sign's fine
What it says is wrong
Margie Fogg heads over, sits: Who needs it
Everybody who comes here has been coming for years so what they need a sign for
Nick goes back to work
You okay
Yeah
'm sorry about what  said
Said what
About you and Jill and needing a third person
She went back to Lillian
Forget it
(touches his arm) 'm sorry
'm going to start one of those custody suits
don't give a fucking shit
You know
Wade's eyes well up
You don't mean that
Yeah
mean that
(arm around his shoulders) No you don't
You're pissed, that's all
You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian
You know
Work it out with her, tell her how you feel
Lillian's not out to get you
The hell she isn't
Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day  met her
'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged
've been thinking about it a lot
It's like she owns Jill or something
Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids
And  pay her
(calls) Marg
That goddamned woman
Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this
'm more than pissed, Margie
'm a whole lot more than pissed
been that plenty and know the difference
This is different
Marg
You got orders
Wade and Margie stand
She wants to kiss him
Call me
(genuine) Tonight
Let's get together
Okay
Wade meets Nick halfway to the door
You talked to Jack
Not since last night
He took a guy hunting
The fucker shot himself
Ker-bang
That's what it sounds like
Not on purpose
assume accidental
(shocked) Jack
The other guy
Where
how'd you hear that
Little while ago
One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the  calling for state troopers figured you'd know what really happened
The fucking guy kill himself
This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow
No,
've been out on the grader all morning
Twombley's summer people
Massachusetts
Friend of Gordon's
It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting
(suddenly engaged) gotta go
Margie steps over as Wade exits
He don't care for you
Stop being jealous
: - Elaine looks up from her desk as Wade pulls the grader into the lot, jumps out, heads for his car
Laviviere stands outside
What's the hurry
hunting accident
Jack and Twombley
Huh
figured you already heard
(urgent) Twombley, Jesus
We got to get moving: got to get up there
How would know
'mon, you drive
We'll take my truck
They head for LaRiviere's blue 4x4 Dodge
: /
'  - Gordon and Wade drive up the same road Jack took Twombley
Wade fiddles with the
No use: static
Fuck
Turn it off
(Wade does) All you heard was there was some kinda accident
Twombley's shot
heard that
Not Jack
He's okay,  assume
Fuck
You don't know how bad or anything
You mean Twombley
Yes, Wade,  mean Twombley
Put out that cigarette
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
LaRiviere grunts disapproval as Wade slips the butt out his window
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something
That's what usually happens
shoulda sent you instead of Jack
wish you had
'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader
You ain't the hunter Jack is
And he can't drive the grader worth shit
Like hell
Ahead, they see flashing lights and cars
white emergency vehicle passes, jolting the pickup
(frightened) That must've been Twombley
Jesus bet that was Twombley
You want me to follow them to Littleton
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first
He'll know what happened
He fucking better
If this coulda been avoided, 'll put that kid's ass in a sling
: - Wade pulls behind three state trooper cars
Jack stands joking with the , one of whom holds a German shepherd on a leash
LaRiviere and Wade jump out
Jack, suddenly serious, turns to LaRiviere: You heard the news
hear Twombley got shot
Yeah
Wade walks over to trooper  , pets the shepherd
Watch the dog, Wade
Takes a mind to, he'll tear your fucking head off
(to Jack) Bad
Thirty-thirty at close range
Jesus
Will he make it
(shakes head) Blew the bastard wide open
Had a hole in back you could put your head into
Pretty big hole in front too
You could've put your fist into that one
(to Jack) You see it
Nope
Heard it
We wasn't far apart
spotted this buck, then  heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone
looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit
Called it right in
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up
Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend
Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade
seen 'em
Near ran me over
You wanna tell 'em, Gordon
You knew the old man
What the fuck
My day's already ruined
(to Wade) Give me the keys
You can go back with Jack
You still got a shitload of plowing to do
It ain't done, if that's what you mean
Something bugging you
Yeah
few things
Well, right now we're not too interested
Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time
Brown walks off with shepherd
(to Jack) Might as well take the rest of the day off
You look sort of fucked up
You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right
Not exactly
mean, he never paid me
You'll get your money
Don't talk to any newspapers about this
Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know
Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment
Lawyer
don't need no lawyer, do No, of course not
Just say it, that's all
Wade watches LaRiviere get into his pickup, drive off
Where'd Twombley get shot
In the chest
(offers cigarette) No,  mean whereabouts
(points) half mile in, along the old lumber road
You bring him up yourself
That's a steep climb
The ambulance guys lugged him up
You stayed away
Yeah
Where'd you get the blood
What blood
On your sleeve
Musta
How'd  know
What're you doing, playing cop
gotta make a report to Fish and Game
was just wondering, that's all
What'd he do, to shoot himself, mean
Who the fuck knows
Musta slipped or something
just heard the gun go off
never seen a man shot before
Not even in the service
Must be something
Well,  didn't actually see him do it
Like  said
Sure you did
What
Saw him do it
What the fuck you telling me, Wade
never seen the guy get shot, told you that
You musta seen him get shot
know you did
Let's get the fuck outta here
You're not making any sense, man
They walk over to Jack's burgundy pickup
Wade eyes the rifles in the gun rack
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night
This must be Twombley's gun
Brand new
Very fancy tooling
Probably fired one time
It's a beautiful piece of work
(touches it) But what the hell, Jack,  guess you deserve it
Right's right
(starts engine) Yeah
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again
He sure as hell won't
: '  - Late
Wade Whitehouse, lying in bed with an icepack on his cheek, talks on the phone: Rolfe
(
) Wade
Yeah, brother, look,  was calling cause -- has there been anything on in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley
(
) There was something
It happened up your way
Yeah,  know him -- the kid that was with him
Maybe you do too
Jack Hewitt
He works for LaRiviere with me
He's my best friend
(
) Wade, it's late
know you're probably at Toby's, but 'm in bed reading
We got different habits
No, not tonight
'm in bed too
'm calling because  need you to listen
You're supposed to be a smart guy
You're a professor
got this theory
Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did
: - Wade's theory -- in black-and-white: Twombley's footing slips
Jack turns to watch
Twombley's gun hits frozen rocks, fires, blows a hole through his chest
: '  - It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it
(
) He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business
Who
(
) Twombley
No shit
(
) You think Jack shot him
Well, it was an accident
(
) They were out deer hunting, right
Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body
: - Another theory: Black-and-white
Jack sees a figure run from Twombley's body
: '  - Wade shifts the phone from ear to ear: Lillian was here
In Lawford
(
) Huh
The night before the shooting
(
) How was she
Picked up Jill
She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween
She wanted to go home
(
) Who
Jill
was thinking of getting a lawyer
Maybe you can help me
(
) What happened
divorce lawyer
custody lawyer
You know, 'cause of Jill
: '  - : mobile homes
: '  - (
) Don't think about it
You're exhausted
Yeah,  guess
(
) Get some sleep
get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night 'm going to bite back
swear it
(
) Haven't you already done a bit of that
No, no,  haven't
Not really
've growled a little, but  haven't bit
Sound of
: - Wade's bubble-top Fairlane drives through snow covered hills
: '  - The Fairlane is parked outside a substantial summer house with a wide porch and frozen pond
The "speeding"  in the drive
Wade knocks on the front door
An 8 year-old boy answers the door
Wade speaks; the boy goes back inside
, 30, delicate, beautiful, wearing a dark green robe, comes to the door
Her eyes are red-rimmed
Wade has seen her before, but not this close
He feels awkward
Who are you
was
'm Wade Whitehouse
was wondering, is your husband here
He's asleep
We were up very late
Well, yes, 'm
want to say that 'm real sorry about your father, Mrs
Twombley
Mrs
Gordon
Thank you
Well, yeah,  suppose
Sure
just had a little business to settle with Mr
Gordon
'm the local police officer
Something about my father
Oh, no
No, it's a
it's a traffic thing
No big deal
Can't it wait, then
, 40, dark-eyed, wearing a tartan robe, steps behind his wife
Whitehouse
Next time, phone ahead
How's that
Mel folds his arms
His wife goes inside
said, 'Next time, phone ahead
' Jesus Christ
Mr
Gordon, when come all the way to serve somebody a summons,  don't call ahead for an appointment
What the hell are you talking about
'm issuing you a ticket
Moving violation
Moving violation
just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket
Now
Are you nuts
Is that it, Whitehouse
You're nuts
(writing) Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you-- (stops Wade's arm) Hold on
(wrenches hand free) Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr
Gordon
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when  passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something
Don't give me a hard time, Mr
Gordon
'm just -- Doing your fucking job
know watch television too
Yes
Here's your ticket
(refusing ticket) You get the hell out of my house now, asshole
And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if haven't got you fired before the day is out
can do it with one phone call, and 'm pissed enough to do it now
Mel Gordon moves Wade out of the door, slams it
Wade steps away, looks back at the house
Mrs
Gordon watches him from the window
: '  - wood frame house off the main drag
Snowing
: '  - Wade and Margie, post-coital: Jack's sort of sensitive,  guess
More than most
But he'll be okay in a few weeks
There's something funny about that shooting
There's lots funny about it, actually
heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie
He drove off without her
'm sure, 'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did
Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry
He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed
Now he's like everyone else
've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself
've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose
Wade
How can you even think such a thing
Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose
: - Black-and-white
further theory: Jack bends over the fallen Twombley, holds a tarp to protect his chest from blood spray
He shoots Twombley with his own gun
: '  - Money
Jack doesn't need money
Everybody needs money
Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his
People like that
Jack wouldn't kill for it
Besides, who would pay him
Lots of people
Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead
The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia
(laughs) The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt
No,  just know Jack's lying about what happened
He just seemed -- know that kid, what he's like inside
He's a lot like  was at his age
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money
No
Not for money
But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- was pretty fucked up, you know
(smiles) But not now
Wade sits on the edge of the bed, sighs
Lapses into thought
Margie caresses his back, kisses it
He winces
When you gonna get that tooth fixed
Wade looks at her, brushes the hair off her face: can see what you looked like as a kid
You knew me as a kid
Yeah, but never what you looked like
Not really
Never really studied your face, like now
was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way
What way
After making love
like it
It's nice to see that in a grown-up person
It's nice
Wade walks naked to the kitchen, returns with two beers, one for Marg
He gets in bed
She, thinking, sips: Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now
'm her father -- supposed to be, but 'm not able to
Yes
Yes,  am
It may be the only thing in my life 've been so clear about wanting
Even if it takes a big fight
Then
guess you have to
(silence) There's another thing 've been thinking about
don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it
But 've been thinking lately, 've been thinking we should get married sometime
You and me
(uncertain) Oh, Wade
've been thinking about it, that's all
You've been married twice -- It was to the same woman
was just a kid
(Marg looks) It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought
Something for you and me to talk about and think about
You know
Alright
'll think about it
Good
He kisses her
His jaw winces in pain
: -  (1964) : Glen Whitehouse, plastered, yells at Wade, age 13: 've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God, have  got sons
Wade
Rolfe
Elbourne
You love me boys
Do you love your Pop
Of course you do
Wade, frightened, retreats as Sally enters in her housecoat
Glen, stop -- Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a Goddamned good person
Capital
You are so much better than  am, who am no good at all, you who are a truly good person, like a fucking saint
Beyond fucking com-pare
Glen reaches for the Canadian Club; Sally tries to block his hand
Glen pulls his arm from hers, clipping her cheek with the bottle
Sally gasps, grabs her cheek
Wade pushes between them, protecting his mother
My big boy bursting out of the seams of his jeans
Pop clenches his fist
Wade vainly looks Rolfe's direction for help
Don't
You little prick
Pop's fist comes crashing down
Wade raises his arms to protect himself
Wade's arm bone  with the blow
Wade grimaces in pain
Glen, stop
: '  - Margie gets into Wade's idling Ford
: /
'  - Wade, washed and changed, drives; Marg sits beside him
They head north
Deer rifles echo from the woods
Did you tell them
(no answer) That we were coming
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
know your parents
just want to pick up my divorce papers
For the lawyer
It won't take long
: - Sun slants over Parker Mountain; they pull up
The house, once white, is peeling
Polyurethane flaps over dark windows
The 1960 red Ford pickup sits long frozen in the open barn
(getting out) Are you sure they're home
Did you call
The truck's here
Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started
They stamp their feet on the porch; Wade turns the knob
Locked
It seems abandoned
Strange
Think they're alright
Of course
would've heard
How
don't know for Christ's sake
They round the house, try the back door
Wade knocks loudly
, 70, opens the door, stands inside
He wears long underwear, stained woolen trousers, slippers
: - Pop, Pop, you okay
Glen shuffles toward the stove; they follow
He starts a fire
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that
Where's Ma
Sleeping
You remember Margie Fogg
From Wickham's
Been a while
Like some coffee
How you and Ma doing
Haven't seen you in town for a while
We're alright
Your Ma's sleeping
You want me to get her
Yeah
Pop goes to the bedroom
(to Marg) Jesus
Nothing's changed around here
Pop returns
Where's Ma
She's coming
Have you been heating the house
Not just with the stove
There's a furnace
You're not using it today
It's broke  guess
There's an electric in the bedroom
Maybe Wade should take a look at it
Your pipes'll freeze
(Pop nods) Wade, would you do that
Wade, concerned, pushes open the  door: Ma
It's Wade
Can  come in
He steps inside
On the bed, Sally Whitehouse, wrapped in blankets, lies dead
He walks over, beside the small electric heater, touches her forehead
Her skin is chalk white
Oh, Lord
Margie steps into the doorway
Pop joins: Coffee's perked
When did she die
Is
She's dead then
Yeah
checked on her
She had the electric heater
Cold don't bother her as much as me
Which is why  give her the heater
(kneels over mother) Is there something wrong with the phone
In the living room
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed
Wade
thought she was alright
Till this morning she was
Pop goes to the dresser, pours himself Canadian Club
Wade opens his mother's mouth, attempts respiration
It makes me sad
Can --
(sits) Makes me sad it was her
Instead of me
shoulda froze
: '  - , 38, drives his four-door Toyota west: through Massachusetts, toward New Hampshire
His face bespeaks tolerance, objectivity -- in short, education
It's also Wade's face
(
) Wade called me, as usual, late at night
knew it was Wade -- no one else calls me at that hour -- and was ready to listen to another chapter in one of his ongoing sagas
There was the detective story concerning the shooting of Evan Twombley and the family melodrama about Wade's custody fight with Lillian
But not this time
: - Rolfe's Toyota sits with other cars
(
) Wade was telling a different story, or so it seemed then, one in which myself was a character
He had called to tell me that sometime the previous night our mother had died, and he had discovered the body when he'd gone over to visit her and our father with Margie Fogg
Pop was okay, but kind of out of it
Worse than usual, maybe, though no drunker than usual
: - Friends and relatives gather in the living room: Wade, Rolfe, Glen, LaRiviere, Margie, an aging couple,  , 30, thin, wearing glasses and an avocado-green suit
(finishing a beer) Shouldn't we get this show on the road, now that Rolfe's here
No one moves
LaRiviere checks his watch
Wade shrugs: Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do,  guess
What about Jill
Is Lillian bringing her
Margie's face tells Rolfe he's touched on a sensitive subject
They'll be at the church and the cemetery
Wade opens the frig, takes out another beer: Anyone else want one
Rolfe
No thanks
don't drink
Yeah
forgot
How you holding up, Wade
'm fine, fine
You Rolfe
(Rolfe nods) remember you from high school
You're a teacher now
Harvard
haven't seen you around
don't suppose there's much reason for you to come this way
Rev
Doughty calls for Glen Whitehouse, who has been sitting, silent, drinking, to join the others: Come, Glen, join us
Let's kneel for a moment of prayer before the service
Wade
Rolfe
Well
Wade, expressionless, looks at Rolfe
Rolfe, embarrassed, trying to do the right thing, helps his father kneel beside Rev
Doughty
The others join the circle
This is nuts
(reproving) Wade
Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts, we come to Thee to beseech Thy blessings and commend to You the soul of our beloved wife and mother, Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You and walk with You -- Pop mutters something
Wade, Rolfe and Marg exchange glances
He mutters louder: goddamned hair on her head
He rises over LaRiviere, turns, exclaims: Not a one of you is worth a goddamned hair on that good woman's head
Doughty freezes
Pop
Don't do this now, Pop
Pop knocks back a drink as the others stand
Maybe 'll head on over to the church
This is a difficult time
Gordon and the couple file out
Doughty, Glen, Rolfe, Wade and Margie remain
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop
(raising fists) Come on, smart guy
Tell how it's no big deal
Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head
Give up this demon
Go fuck yourself
Wade, eyes blazing, squares off
Son to father
Wade, just leave it
(mocking) Listen to your little brother
'Wade, just leave it
' Candy-asses
All of you
That's what 've got for children
Candyasses
'Wade, just leave it
' Praise the Lord
'Just leave it
' Wade stiffens
Pop cocks his fist
Marg, screaming, jumps between them as Pop swings
The old man bounces blows off Margie's arms and shoulders
Wade pushes Marg aside, grabs his father in a bear hug and walks him backwards, flat against the wall
Wade releases him
Pop, frail, collapses to the floor
Wade kneels over him: If you ever touch her again, 'll kill you
swear it
: - Townspeople and friends cluster around the gravesite: Pop, LaRiviere, Jack and Hettie, LaCoy, Chub Merritt, Nick, Jimmy, Lillian, Jill and Horner, Rolfe, Wade and Margie
(
) The day of the funeral was almost springlike
The snowline crossed New Hampshire west to east, retreating northward to Concord where it melted by midmorning
Rev
Doughty finishes
The mourners exchange farewells
Wade looks at Lillian
Margie and Rolfe, escorting Wade's father, let him be
He walks over, hugs Jill
Dad
(to Lillian) 'm glad you're here
Can you stay for a while
Lillian hesitates, shakes her head 'no
' You ever come to your father's grave anymore
No, not anymore
It's too
it's too far
We should talk
We've done all our talking, Wade
It's just
Let the past be
(beat) 'm sorry about your mother
liked her
You never know how much women like that suffer
It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone
(tugging at Lillian) Mom
She has an ice-skating lesson at four
'm taking ice-skating, Daddy
He kisses Jill, says goodbyes, walks back to Rolfe and Margie
Ahead, LaRiviere walks with Jack
: - Wade and Rolfe leave Margie and Pop in the kitchen as they step out back
Let's dig out Pop's truck before the skin of the snow freezes up
They grab snow shovels propped against the porch, walk to the barn
Firewood's stacked alongside
: - Shafts of light filter through the ramshackle structure snow drift nearly buries Glen's red truck
Wade and Rolfe break away the packed snow
What about Margie
What about her
Well, do you still plan to get married
Yeah
She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop
We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire
With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around
Things are going to change in that department, by the way got a custody lawyer in Concord
'm gonna see him tomorrow
All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it
They finish clearing the snow
Wade gets in the truck, starts the engine
Rolfe waits for Wade
want to let the gas run out don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now
After, we'll hide the keys
Anything new about the shooting
Twombley
(reluctant) guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks
Want to know what  think happened
Wade opens the glove compartment, finds a bottle of Canadian Club
He unscrews the cap
Find them everywhere
(swigs) think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one
Which is
That it wasn't an accident
Then who shot him
Well, your friend,  think
Jack Hewitt
Motive
You gotta have a motive
Money
Who'd pay him that kind of money
Not the mob
They got their own guys
Specialists
(agreeing) They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack
Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead
(swigs) don't know
You tell me
Okay
It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify
They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president
read that in the papers
What's his name, Mel Gordon
Yeah, the guy with the   told you about
did, didn't
Here's my theory
Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out
Finds out his son-in-law is involved
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit
That'd make the feds dig deeper
He wants an accident
hunting accident is perfect
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted
Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled
The truck sputters, stops
Wade pulls the keys
It's too neat
Things ain't that neat
It makes me mad
That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it
Don't that piss you off
Not particularly
Right's right, goddamnit
Don't you care what's right
care about what happened
The truth
'm a student of history, remember
The sun is down
Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board
was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
Yeah
hate to disappoint you, but  don't think it happened
Of course it happened
Why would lie about it
It may have happened, but not the way you said
You think  wouldn't remember a thing like that
It wasn't me
wasn't there, but heard about it
When  heard about it, it was about Elbourne
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
(laughs) Well,  never heard that one
remember clearly cause when  heard became real careful around Pop was a careful child and  became a careful adult, but at least  wasn't afflicted by that man's violence
(laughs again) That's what you think
Rolfe looks out: the cobalt sky has turned black
gotta head back
It's a long drive
They walk toward the house
: - Wade walks in as Jack and Jimmy prepare to head out, their drilling rig loaded with pipe
Gordon yells at Jack: Put out that fucking cigarette
Jack opens the truck ashtray
Not there, asshole
Flush it
Hewitt trudges to the john
Morning, Gordon
LaRiviere smiles, goes to his office as Wade hangs his coat in his locker
Jack cruises over
'm fucking out of here
Lawford
Out of this fucking job
This job sucks
Working outside in the winter sucks
Jack gets in the cab of the drilling truck
Wade follows
Open the door, will ya
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad
Open the door
We're late
mean it -- you got enough money now
Head out for California
Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow
What do you mean  got money
'm as broke as you
Wade grins, goes to activate the door
Looney Tunes, Jack
Fucking Looney Tunes
The drilling truck pulls out the garage, onto the road
From the opposite direction a black  slows, enters
Mel Gordon
Wade, all eyes and ears, watches
Mel Gordon parks in front of the office, gets out
Elaine calls: (
) Mr
Gordon
The boss in
(
) Yes indeedy
Wade flips the door switch
Mel Gordon and LaRiviere talk
Yeah
: - The South Main Street office of
Battle Hand, lawyer
Concord is a real town, with traffic, stores, people with places to go
: '  - , 60, sits in a wheel chair behind his desk
Wade, uncomfortable in work clothes, tries not to show it
screwed up the divorce
agreed with everything she said
wanted her to like me
just want to be a good father
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work
plan to
Soon
How soon
This spring
Good
It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife
Sexual problems upsetting to the child
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it
No, not exactly
'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn
Interview your daughter
Jill, right
Yes
Fine
'll need a $500 retainer
You can mail it
Jesus
How much
how much will the whole thing cost
Hard to say
If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on
Ten or twelve thousand dollars
She could win on appeal
If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred
Oh
(sensing situation) You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- Yeah
know
The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her
'm not as dumb as  look
Whatever you say
love my daughter
(Hand nods) 'll send you the five hundred
Wade stands; Hand motors to the door
Wade puts his fingers in his mouth
His tooth throbs
: - Fairlane squad car in its customary spot
: '  - Wade and Gordon speak
LaRiviere is relaxed, open: a "new Gordon
" Sorry about the long lunch
My clutch is going out again
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade
On what you pay me
Elaine
Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch
(
) What
(to Wade) Use the pickup
'll bill it to the town
You're the town police officer and the town police officer should have a decent car
You want a new car or not
What do  have to do for it
Nothing, Wade, 've been thinking
You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little
saw Mel Gordon in here this morning
So
He say anything about the summons tried to give him
Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it
Wade, that wasn't smart
Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself
Let it go
Call it a favor to me
You
Why
Mel's doing some business with me
It's nice to do favors for people you do business with
He was in a hurry
No big deal
That was before Twombley was shot
Before he knew
What's the difference
Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon
Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there
(takes out cigarette) Want to buy
Don't light that in here
'm allergic
won't
You interested
Maybe
You and Mel Gordon
Could be
(voice rising) Always count on old Wade for a good screwing
Why should  always pay more, sell cheap
Why should you guys make all the money
You and Mel and Jack
Right's right
Wade pulls out Bic, lights cigarette
(waving arms) Out
Out
Wade smiles, exits
: 29 - Wade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar, takes 29 toward Pop's farm
pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford
Wade stops
Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident scene
Something's up
Wade turns and follows
Jack's fresh tracks lead the way
Hewitt is driving fast
Wade keeps up
Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene
Stops
Night has fallen
Wade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup
He kills the lights, parks to block Jack's exit
Silence
Footsteps in the snow
Wade watches, listens
What's he doing
Looking for evidence
The burgundy pickup engine suddenly  -- Jack's back and at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past Wade
Wade starts his engine, gives pursuit
The pickups gun their engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads, rocky trails
Wild headlamps their only guide
: - trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too sharply for Jack
He crashes through a stand of skinny birches straight out onto the pond
The pickup's momentum carries it across the pond
Wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting ice
He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight to headlight
Jack sticks his head out: You crazy sonofabitch
You'll sink us both
Get off the fucking ice
Get off
Wade doesn't budge
Jack backs away; Wade inches forward
Hewitt's trapped
Trees behind him
Neither truck has traction on ice
Jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly
Wade gets out
Jacks grabs his rifle, points it: 'll shoot you, Wade,  swear it
'll fucking shoot you dead if you don't move away from that truck
Wade backs off
Don't move
'll shoot you dead if you move
Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone
Wade stands in darkness
The only sound his idling truck, the wind
Then a third sound -- the snap of ice
Ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond
Ice planes tip around the truck
LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears
Headlights glow under water, then go out
"Our Business Is Going In The Hole
" Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore
Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow
He bangs his jaw
: ' - car drops Wade off
"Home Made Cooking
" : ' - Wade enters the empty diner
His clothes frozen
Your father's in back, Wade
Marg had to babysit him
She moved in with you, huh
(looking closer) What happened
Wade goes to the kitchen
Glen Whitehouse, washing dishes with Margie, looks up: Ah, the prodigal son
About fucking time
Look, got me a new job, second cook and bottle washer
What happened
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home got waylaid
Sorry
The fuck you got waylaid
You follow your prick around like it was your nose
(enters) Can it, Whitehouse
(to Wade) Get him out of here
It was funny at first, but 'm tired
There's clothes in the back
Wade's old man talks as he dresses: Let's go home
What home is that
Your home
My home
Let's have a talk about that
You're fucking sly, Wade
Your mother's dead so she can't make any excuses for you anymore
You gotta deal with me
No more sugar tit, asshole
Wade, redressed, enters: Pop, for Christ's sake
You think you can take me now
Come on, try
Margie and Nick guide pere et fils to '
Nick speaks to her: Marg, get out of this
Fast
can't
Marg drives off
: '  - Wade leans close to his father, his breath on his: wish you would die
Pop spits directly into Wade's face, raises his arm
Wade catches it, twists it
Margie shrieks: Stop it
Stop it
Just stop it
They do, glaring as they approach the farmhouse
: - Wade looks in the bedroom, sees Margie sleeping, goes to the bathroom
He peers, stands before the sink, washes his hands slowly
Drying his hands, he looks into the mirror, startled by the image of his own face
phone conversation plays over: (
) No shit, Rolfe,  glanced up and there he was, only it was me
But it was like  had never seen myself before
It was a stranger's face
Hard to explain
You fly on automatic pilot, like  was doing all night, and you disappear
: - Wade sits alone in the darkened room, speaking on the phone
His cigarette glows
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to
Strange
It's the business with the old man,  know, and how incredibly pissed  was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another
(
) Wade, are you alright
But you gotta hear this
You won't believe it
Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now 'm in his office
: '  - Wade's theory expanded: Jack and Gordon argue in the office
An extension of Scene 55
Like Wade's other theories, in black-and-white: He's on to us
Shit
What are we gonna do
Maybe  can buy him off
gotta talk to Mel
You can't buy Wade off
We bought you
That was me
: '  - Wade drives Margie's car toward LaRiviere's
In his rear view window he spots Chick Ward driving Chub Merritt's tow truck, lights blinking, pulling LaRiviere's pickup like a dead fish
He pulls over, lets it pass
He's parked in front of Alma Pittman's house
sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman, Town Clerk
" He looks at the house, decides to go in
Wade walks up the shoveled steps, knocks on the door
, 60, wearing plaid shirt and slacks, greets him with a smile: Wade
Come in
Have a cup of coffee
: '  - They step into Alma's living room/office
She's been keeping the town secrets for as long as anyone can remember
You got yourself a computer, Alma
Been putting my files into it
You take sugar and milk
No
Black
They sit by her desk at the bay window
She studies him
Are you alright, Wade
Yeah, sure
Why
got this damned tooth,  got a few things bugging me, like everybody else
But 'm okay
Well, you look
sad
Upset
don't mean to pry
'm sorry about your mother
It was a nice funeral
Alma,  think there's some dirty business going on in this town
Always has been
This is maybe worse than you and are used to
(beat) What 'm talking about, 'm talking about murder
Among other things
Who
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot
Somebody murdered him
Who
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid  work with
: '  - Gordon LaRiviere examines his damaged pickup outside the Shell station
: '  - Wade finishes: if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age
Sometimes things are simpler than you think
Let me ask you a question
You don't believe me
(crosses to her desk) About Jack
No
Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately
know he's due for the last two years
was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in
Has anybody offered to buy it
As a mater of fact, yes
LaRiviere
Alma punches her computer
Dozens of items flash up
This is all the real estate transactions in this town the last year
Most of it unused land
Most of it for little more than the back taxes owed
She punches again: only three items
This is from three years ago
Some difference, huh
(looking) What is the Northcountry Development Association
went down to Concord to check it out
The president is Mel Gordon
The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere
Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade
$364,000 this year
believe that's out of LaRiviere's league
Twombley involved
No
He musta found out
They had to get rid of him
And Jack'll get blamed
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman
In a year or two, you won't recognize this town
: '  - Wade storms in, shouting
Jack and Jimmy choose donuts by the file cabinet
LaRiviere's behind his desk
Wade's tooth makes it hard for him to talk without pain: You sneaky sonofabitch
've got your number now, Gordon
All these years  actually thought you were a decent man
(pounds fists on desk) Can you believe that
Jack, combative, looks at Wade
Gordon stands before Jack can speak: Wade, you're done
(extends hand) Let me have the shop keys
(to Jack and Jimmy) You two, don't you get it
He's using you
You're his slaves
(soft) Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that
The key, Wade
Yeah, you can have the key
It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years
give it to you with pleasure
(passes key) Now 'm free
See how easy it is, Jack
All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him
(turns to leave) 've got to call my brother
Wade's phone conversation plays  as he goes to Margie's car
(
) know what it means
'm just running out of ways to use it
(
) For what
: 29/' - Phone conversation continues as Wade drives to Merritt's Shell station
(
) To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons
That's what Alma calls them
Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on
(
) Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things
Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police
Let them work on this
, 30, Chub Merritt's mechanic, greets Wade outside the station
We join their conversation: The good news is we haven't got to your car yet
The bad news -- Just tell me when you'll have it fixed
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night
Figured you'd know something about that, Wade
(beat) Yeah
know about that
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car
couple hundred for the clutch
got some more bad news
Wanna hear it
Tell me
Chub says you're fired
He can't fire me
LaRiviere already did that this morning
He's a Selectman
The town
He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office
'm supposed to pull the  and police light out of your car
They're town property
: - Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking into the receiver
Margie looks up from the  table, an old newspaper in front of her
What do you mean, you can't take me today
told you -- The other party has hung up
Margie stands, upset
Wade slams the phone down
What on earth is happening to you
Why are you acting this way
It's my tooth
My fucking tooth can't even think anymore because of it
heard you talking
You got fired this morning, didn't you
Look, that's temporary, believe me
There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit
Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes
'll get another job
People are going to need me
After this is over, they'll make me into a Goddamned hero
You wait: you'll see, 'll deliver
'll be the best father who ever lived
You need me, even Pop, for Christ's sake, he needs me
This town needs me
Maybe now they think they can send me howling into a corner like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll be different soon
Margie's face falls
She retreats from the room as he speaks, taking her coat and pocketbook
Wade and his old man, she thinks: just the same
Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives off
Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight
Pop turns on the  in the living room, boosts the volume
Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours himself a drink
Leave the bottle out
Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the
Wade walks to the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer, goes toward the bathroom
In the , Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank
He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his mouth with the pliers
Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes and pulls
He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from his mouth
The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink
He takes another bite of whisky
Rolfe's voice plays over: (
) You will say  should have known terrible things were about to happen, and perhaps  should have
But even so, what could  have done by then
Wade never went inside
He lived almost wholly out there on his skin, with no interior space to retreat to, even in a crisis
Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the beside the  set
Wade and Pop exchange looks
Wade exits through the , snatching his coat
: - Wade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of gasoline from under the porch
He crosses to the barn, prepares to pour the gas into the beat-up red truck
: - Wade's Ford pickup passes
Battle Hand's office, keeps going
Grass peeks through the snow at this lower altitude
: '  - Wade parks the truck, walks past leafless bushes to a charcoal- gray split-level with pink shutters
He pushes the door bell; the first notes of "Frere Jacques" play
Lillian opens the door; Jill's footsteps approach
Wait there
She'll be right out
(looks back) Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford
Yeah, lots
(to Jill) See
Get your boots
Hi honey
(going back inside) Hi
Have her back tomorrow night by six
No problem
Look,
You make me sick
can't believe you've sunk so low
Low as what
What have  done
It's bad to want to see your own daughter
You know what 'm talking about
For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much
Love
You won't get away with it
Jill returns, wearing parka and boots, heads out with her father
Bye, honey
Call me tonight if you want
Wade and Jill approach the truck
Are we going in this
Yeah
My car's in the shop
This'll be fine
It's pretty old
It belongs to Pop
Pop
Grandpa
My father
It's his
Oh
Wade opens the truck door
Jill climbs in with her overnight bag, looks back to the door where Lillian watches
: /
'  - The Ford heads north
(winking) How about a Big Mac
Mommy won't let me eat fast food
You know that
It's bad for you
'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac
And a cherry turnover
Your favorite
What do you say
No
What do you want, then
Nothing
You can't have nothing, Jill
We need lunch
Mr
Pizza
Same thing, Daddy
Mommy says -- know what Mommy says
'm in charge today, though
Okay
So we'll get what you want
What do you want
They stop for a light
Silence
Nothing,  guess
guess  can wait till we get home
Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford
That suit you
You always like Wickham's
(looking ahead) Okay
Fine
Pause
Wade looks over at Jill and realizes she is crying
Oh, Jesus, Jill, 'm sorry
What's the matter, honey
She shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs
Please don't cry
Please, honey
(regains composure) What are you sorry for
don't know
For the food business
guess
just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to
want to go home
(quick) You can't
Jill looks away
Wade pulls a six-pack from under the seat, pulls off a beer, takes a swig
(quiet) That's illegal, you know
know
You're a policeman
Nope
Not anymore
'm nothing anymore
Oh
: ' - Wade and Jill enter Wickham's, crowded with out-of-state hunters at the end of the deer season
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub
Wade, flaring, reaches across the counter and grabs Nick by the shirtfront
Nick's arm knocks over a cup of coffee
The diner goes silent
Hunters look up
Jill's face is white; she starts to cry
Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends down, comforting her
He wipes her nose with a napkin
Jill, please, it's alright
Nothing happened
want to go home
(rigid) Okay, let's go home, then
They head for the door
Nick eases over: (delicate) Wade,  got a message for you
(Wade turns) Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you
Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall
His office
You mean my old office
Well,  guess -- that's what he said
He got his deer yet
No, he's out now
Somewhere on the mountain
'd stay away from him if were you
He's real pissed
Wade takes Jill's hand, exits
: - Jill waits in the old red truck parked outside
Wade emerges with cardboard boxes of office miscellany, rifles laid across top
He shoves the boxes and guns into the back of the pickup, gets in and drives off
: - Wade and Jill pull up the drive, past Margie's car, into the barn
Her trunk and two side doors are open
Margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her car
She's leaving
plastic bag of clothes sits in the trunk
Wade and Jill get out, approach: Going somewhere, Margie
'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up
For the rummage sale
And some things for the cleaners
And the laundromat
Don't lie to me
You're leaving me, can see that
Don't be silly
Hi, Jill
Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile sadness passes over Wade's face
(hurt) Marg
Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry
She drops her suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby
Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back
His face is racked
He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could
In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's circumstances and terrible sadness
She pushes: (crying) Leave me alone
Leave me alone
She struggles in Wade's grasp
Jill, frightened, wildly hits him from behind: Leave her alone
Leave her alone
Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms
Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying
Wade stumbles backwards into the snow
Jill still swings
Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide
Jill flies into Marg
Her nose is bleeding
Wade's caught her across the mouth and nose
She takes cover behind Margie, crying
Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing
Wade looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock
Marg slowly backs away, her arms behind her holding Jill
(to Jill) Get in
Marg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's seat
Wade stands
want to go home
Will you take me home
Yes
She closes the front door, starts the car
She backs out the drive
In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, standing frozen, staring down at the snow
Pop emerges from the house, looks at his son, grinning
Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered on his father's face
Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol
Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance
(Satanic delight) You
By Christ, you --  know you
(points bottle) Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, know you
You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart
(dead) You don't know me
You don't know me
(beat) So fuck you
Fuck you
Nah-nah-naw
You done done finally done it
Like a man done it
Done it right
love you, you mean sonofabitch
Pop holds up the bottle, pretends to fire it at Wade
Love
What the fuck do you know about love
Love
'm made of love
Call it what you want
Everything you know is from me
Yeah
Bang
You and me
Wade waves his old man off, trudges toward the barn
Where the Christ you going
You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is
need
Give me the Goddamn keys
need to get me to town
Crawl
Nothing in the fucking house to drink
Not a fucking thing
My house, my money, my truck -- stolen
don't know you
My goddamn father and  don't know you
Wade walks from the glistening snow into the dark barn
: - Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the ground
He gathers up his rifles
Suddenly
whiskey bottle  against the back of his head
He drops to his knees, the guns scatter
He looks up with child's fear and guilt at his father
Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone
Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle
He grabs it by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's head
cold hard  of bone
Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies back like a stuffed dummy
He collapses beside the empty bottle
Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face
know you now
love you too
Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud The gun's empty
(smiles) Joke
You scared me
He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray hair
Pop's eyes are clouded
Blood suddenly drips from his ear to the ground
Wade rests the rifle against the truck
He bends over, slips his hands under his father's body, lifts him up
He carries Pop over to the workbench, lays him out
Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp
He unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body
Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse
Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud of yellow flame
The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot up the old weathered wall
Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards
: - Wade stands in snow and sunlight
The entire barn is engulfed in flames
Black smoke billows through the clear winter sky
Inside Glen Whitehouse, a pyre, burns
(
) The historical facts are known by everyone -- all of Lawford, all of New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts
Facts do not make history
Our stories, Wade's and mine, describe the lives of boys and men for thousands of years, boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth and whose best hope, if any, for connection with other human beings lay in an elegiac detachment, as if life were over
: - Pop's red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitt's 4x4 on a snow- banked road
Wade, hunting rifle pointed up, traces Jack's footsteps down the slope of the mountain
(
) It's how we keep from destroying in turn our own children and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love us; how we absent ourselves from the tradition of male violence; how we decline the seduction of revenge
Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer
Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and
Jack, hit in the chest, falls bleeding between trees
Blood stains the snow
(
) Jack's truck turned up three days later in a shopping mall in Toronto
Even without the footprints, the bullet, Wade's utter disappearance seemed evidence enough of his guilt
: - Camera glides from room to room, glimpsing details, fragments of former times, as if this were an historical site or memorial
The walls resonate: lives were molded here
(
) LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed in business
The Parker Mountain Ski Resort is now advertised all across the country
Jimmy Dame tends bar at the lodge
Chub Merritt opened a snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham runs the new Burger King
Margie Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her mother; Lillian and Jill went with Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle
Out a window, workers gather charred timbers from the barn, throw them on a truck
(
) We want to believe Wade died, died that same November, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk
You cannot understand how a man, a normal man, a man like you and me, could do such a terrible thing
Unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will have turned himself into one of those faceless fellows working at the video store and lives in a town-house apartment at the edge of town until his mailman recognizes him from the picture at the post office -- unless that happens, there will be no more mention of him and his friend Jack Hewitt and our father
The story will be over
Except that  continue
