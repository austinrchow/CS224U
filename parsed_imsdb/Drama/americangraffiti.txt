" " Screenplay by George Lucas Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck On a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an electric humming begins
The eerie light glows brighter and illuminates a single huge number--11
We hear static and a large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the screen
Pulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing-- 70
90
110
130
And we begin to hear voices--strange songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static
Pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the indicator stops
There's a pause
and suddenly we are hit by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up- the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was better
And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds
Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay
got a oldie for ya--gonna knock ya right on de flowa--baay-haay-hee-baay
The Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as "Rock Around the Clock" blasts forth
' --- neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill
large neon sign buzzes in the foreground
' -, while in the background, "Rock Around The Clock" blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck- and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in
Main titles appear over action
Steve Bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out
He looks around, then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered hood
Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, button-down, short-sleeved shirt
Most likely to succeed, president of his graduating class
He looks around the empty drive-in, then hears a funny little horn
Vespa scooter bumps into the lot
young kid waves at him-- and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples
Terry Fields ("The Toad") maneuvers the scooter next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping
Terry grins sheepishly
He's seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white bucks
He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's projecting an air of supercool
Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead
He unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough
Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating Steve who pays him no mind
In the background, we hear the Wolfman howling with the music
The record ends and a barrage of humor begins from Wolfman Jack
The Wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids
Witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and guardian angel
Now, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot
Steve and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out
Curt stands by his little car
He's seventeen, a curly bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts
Curt thinks of himself as the town cynic
In reality, he's a hopeless romantic
He starts over to his buddies
Hey, whadaya say
Curt
Last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave
The Moose have been lookin' for you all day, man
Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope without saying anything
Curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check
(sarcastic) Oh great
Whadaya got, whadaya got
Wow--two thousand dollars
Two thousand doll-- Steve looks at Curt suspiciously; Curt seems somehow guilty
Mr
Jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you
He said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out
Oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you
Curt hands the envelope back to Steve
Well
ah
why don't you hold onto it for a while
What's with you
It's yours
Take it
don't want it
'll take it
Steve
Ah,  think we'd better have a talk
've gotten- Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn
Laurie Henderson pulls into the drive-in and waves to them
She is driving the family's '58 Edsel
Your sister calls
'll talk to you later
Now, Steve
Let her wait
Okay, make it short and sweet
Yeah, well
Listen
(clearing his throat) don't think 'm going tomorrow
What
Come on, what are you talking about
don't know
was thinking  might wait for a year
go to city-- Laurie honks the horn a couple of times
Steve ignores her
There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable
You chicken fink
Wait, let me explain-- You can't back out now
After all we went through to get accepted
We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look,  gotta talk to Laurie
(he hands the check back to Curt) Now take it
We're leaving in the morning
Okay
Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot
The low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in
Big John Milner, twenty-two, sits in his Ford, tough and indifferent, puffing on a Camel
He wears a white -shirt and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself
You wanna end up like John
You can't stay seventeen forever
just want some time to think
What's the rush
'll go next year
We'll talk later
Steve walks off toward Laurie's Edsel
Laurie gets out
She's wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "Class of '62" emblazoned on the shoulder
Steve goes to her and they hug
On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune comes on
(singing) "Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman Jack
" (
) Oh, We're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby
You got the Wolfman Jack Show
' --- As the radio blares "Sixteen Candles," we see that with the darkness Burger City has come alive
continual line of hot rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, then returns to the maindrag
Carhops glide by on roller skates
Curt and John are fooling around in front of the deuce coupe
horn honks and they turn as a '60 Ford with three girls in it slows by them
girl leans out the window and smiles
Hi John
The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off
Not too good, huh
Why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly
Or has a boyfriend
Where is the dazzling beauty 've been searching for all my life
John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night
know what you mean
The pickin's are really gettin' slim
The whole strip is shrinking
Ah, you know, remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit
It was really somethin
' Suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood-curdling scream from an incredible high-performance engine
The entire drive- in stops and listens
Hey, John
Someone new in town
Ahhh
You gonna go after him
Hey, listen, Professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right
The big shot
Across the swarming parking lot, Steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with Laurie
Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her tight blouse
cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain
Anything else you want, Steve
(Steve shakes his head
) If there is you let me know now
Just honk and 'm yours
She tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray
Budda takes the other tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where Laurie is sitting
One fries--grab it before  drop it
She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off
Steve laughs
Laurie smiles
She's seventeen, very pretty, with big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo
She pushes up the sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too large for her
His class ring glints on a chain around her neck
Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with a practical and self-preserving mind beneath
Where was
Um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought  was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious
and ah
oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big
You make it sound like 'm giving dictation
Well, seriously, what meant was, that ah
since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults
Now, , ah
could  have a couple of those fries
Through the windshield of the Chevy, they see Terry run by in front of them, chasing Budda Macrae who's outdistancing him on her roller skates
: Come on, Budda
Come on
Steve watches them go by, then looks back at Laurie
Ah, where was
"consider ourselves adults"
Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is obviously expecting something big
Right
right
anyway,  thought maybe, before  leave, we could ah
agree that
that seeing other people while 'm away can't possibly hurt, you know
Laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask
You mean dating other people
think it would strengthen our relationship
Then we'd know for sure that we're really in love
Not that there's any doubt
Steve smiles and then looks to her
He stops smiling
They listen to the radio for an awkward moment
Laurie struggles to hold back her tears
With obvious difficulty, she turns to him and smiles
He's expected something different and doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back
think you're right
mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out
Laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and puts it in her purse
Laurie, now, listen,  didn't ask for that back
think that
know
just sort of think it's juvenile now
'll keep it at home
It's less conspicuous there
You don't want to wear it
didn't say that
understand and 'm not upset
mean,  can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away
Steve just looks at her and nods
The Wolfman howls an intro to "Gee" by the Crows
Outside, skooting around the drive-in after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she delivers a tray to a car
and  have a really sharp record collection
even have "Pledging My Love" by Johnny Ace
Anyway, how can you love Nelson when he's going out with Marilyn Gator
Since he dumped on you maybe we could-- He didn't dump on me, you little dip
Hi, Steve
Her tone changes immediately
Terry looks sour and turns around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy
Budda leaves, wiggling her butt for Steve
She's a little conceited--just playing hard to get
Listen,  came over here to talk to you about-- Any time, buddy
'm your man
Nothing like better than chewing the rug with a pal
You talk, 'll listen
'm all ears
Shoot
Shut up
Sure
Terry, 'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until Christmas
'm afraid if leave it with my-- Steve notices Terry isn't with him any more and turns
Terry is standing frozen to a spot
What's wrong
Terry tries to talk, much like a shell-shocked war veteran
His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out
Curt is standing by the Chevy, talking with his sister Laurie
She's still upset by what Steve said to her
Hey, sis--what's wrong
Nothing
Meanwhile, they watch Terry as Steve explains to him about the car
Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol- 've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment
Are you listening
The others are watching now as Terry shakes his head mechanically
What's wrong, he's crying
There is indeed a tear rolling down Terry's cheek
can't
believe
it
(He starts toward the car and gently caresses its paint
) don't know what to say
'll
love and protect this car until death do us part
(He circles the car
) This is a superfine machine
This may even be better than Daryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird
It is better than Daryl Starbird's
Laurie watches Terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be left behind as a fond memory
She turns and looks at Steve, who's been watching her
There's a moment between them
Budda comes by with an empty tray
Terry sees her and wipes his eyes
He walks up to her, a strange look on his face
Budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me
The idea is so preposterous that even Budda is speechless
She looks around at others
You've got to be kidding
Would  kid you about a thing like that
want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything
've got a new
John walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the back pockets of Terry's low riding levis
There is general hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants
Car
All right, who's the wise-- (He turns and sees John and changes his tune
) Oh, John--verrry funny
(He tries to laugh with the others
) Hey, did she do that to you
Let's get going
It seems like we've spent most of our lives in this parking lot
Hey, Curt, let's bomb around,  wanna try out my new wheels
'd like to, Toad, but 'm going with Steve and Laurie to the hop
'd just slow you down anyway
Yeah, tonight things are going to be different
Hey, wait a minute, you're goin' to the Hop
The Freshman Hop
Yeah
Oh, come on, man
That place is for kids
You two just got your ass out of there
Don't go back now
You ain't got no emotions
We're gonna remember all of the good times, is what we're gonna do
Yeah, well, go
Why don't you come with us
Bullshit, man
Come on
For old time's sake
Yeah, yeah
Well, listen
You go
Go ahead, Curtsy, baby
You go on over there and you remember all the good times you won't be having ain't goin' off to some goddamned fancy college
'm stayin' right here
Havin' fun, as usual
John walks angrily to his coupe, gets in and slams the door
Curt looks at the others and shrugs
Jesus, Milner, you're in a great mood tonight
Curt goes over and stands by the window of the yellow coupe
What's the matter John
Did  say somethin' wrong
'm sorry
Ah, man, it's nothin'
Well, we'll see you later, okay
Right
We'll all do somethin' together
You know, before Steve leaves
John looks at him suspiciously
Okay, wait a minute
Now, you're not going
don't know
John shakes his head
On the radio, Wolfman is taking a call from a listener-- (
) Wolfman
(
) Who is this
This is Joe
in Little Rock, way down in the Valley
You callin' from Little Rock, California
Long distance
My, my, my
listen, man, what kind of entertainment you got in that town
All we got is you
John roars his engine and pulls the yellow deuce coupe into a screeching take-off out of the drive-in
Terry and Curt watch him go off
, - During the day,  street is a line of used car lots, small shops, tacky department stores and greasy spoons
At night, it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in flamed, lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one way street, through the seemingly adultless, heat-drugged little town
Police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic
In parked cars, couples neck between flashing headlights
Guys looking cool in a '56 Chevy sit in the slouched position of the true Low Rider--and over it all the music and the Wolfman can be heard
Just now, it's "Runaway" by Del Shannon
John travels with the flow of traffic, watching some dopey guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car
John drives the deuce coupe effortlessly
He looks over at a car pacing alongside of his own
Hey, Zudo
sweaty looking guy turns and nods from the window
Hey, Milner
Hey, man, what happened to your flathead
Huh
What happened to your flathead
Ah, your mother
What
Your mother
Hey, we been talkin' about you
Yeah
Yeah
There's a very wicked '55 Chevy lookin' for you
Yeah,  know
Watch out for the cop that's in Jerry's Cherry
Yeah
All right, thanks
John nods and the two cars pull apart down the street
-'  '58 The Rock and Roll blares as Terry the Toad cruises along the main drag, singing along with the music
Sitting low in his seat, he looks around, his face aglow, experiencing a new world from the inside of a really fine car
This is the greatest thing that has happened to Terry in seventeen long years of being a short loser
Terry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside
guy looks out the window
Hey, Toad
Terry looks over and smiles coolly, proud of his new wheels
(leaning out the window) Is that you in that beautiful car
(Terry nods modestly) Geez, what a waste of machinery
Terry's smile changes to a scowl as the car pulls away from him
Terry accounts the slight to jealousy
Then he forgets it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again
Another car pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly
Hey, kid
Terry looks over at the car cruising next to him
In the back seat, a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his bare buttocks against the side window--a classic  complete with pressed ham
Terry looks away, wondering why this is still happening to him, even in his new car
-' '58 Curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark main street of the small farm community
Steve and Laurie are talking quietly in the front seat
Laurie is sitting near the window and it sounds like Steve is convincing her to move over
Laurie finally does
His arm goes around her and her head rests on his shoulder
Curt is laughing as the Wolfman harasses someone on the radio
The Wolfman is placing a call
(
) Here we go with another call out of the station
Can you dig it
Answer the phone, dummy
(
) Pinkie's Pizza Ah, yeah, listen, you got any more of those secret agent spy-scopes
Hit parade on the stethoscope
No
No, the secret agent spy-scope, man
That pulls in the moon, the sky and the planets
and the satellites and the little bitty space men
You must have the wrong number, partner
'Bye
Wolfman cuts into "Why Do Fools Fall in Love
" Curt is laughing in the back of the car, as he listens to the ever- present
Steve slows the Edsel to a stop at the next light
Curt glances over at a classic white '56 Thunderbird and sits up
In the -bird, a girl watches him
Blonde, beautiful, her hair, backlit by a used car lot, seems to glow, making her look almost ethereal
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away
She smiles faintly---then says something, so softly it's lost
What
Curt struggles to lower his window
She repeats it, but he can't hear
The light changes
She smiles once more and is gone
(shouting) What
What
We didn't say anything
Quick
Hang a right
What
Why
Cut over to  Street, 've just seen a vision
She was a goddess
You've got to catch her
didn't see anything
We're not going to spend the night chasing girls for you
'm telling you, this was the most perfect, dazzling creature 've ever seen
She's gone
Forget it
She spoke to me
She spoke to me, right through the window
think she said, " love you
" Curt looks at his sister and Steve in the front seat
They are bored by his romantic visions
That means nothing to you people
You have no romance, no soul
She-- someone wants me
Someone roaming the streets wants me
Will you turn the corner
Laurie looks around at him and seems to pity his flights of poetic fantasy
Curt sits back and shakes his head
Big John sits in his deuce coupe, backed into the parking lot of the Acme Fall-out Shelter Co
, the prime spot in town for girl watching
guy in wrap-around dark glasses leans by the car next to John
They watch a group of laughing girls cruise by in a Studebaker
Oh, oh
Later
Alligator
John turns on his lights and swings the deuce coupe out into the flow of traffic, after the Studebaker
John accelerates and pulls alongside the Studebaker
The girl in the front seat rolls down her window
John grins and yells over at the carload of cuties
Hey, you're new around here
Where're you from
Turlock
Turlock
You know a guy named Frank Bartlett
No
Does he go to Turlock High
Well, he used to
He goes to
now
Do you go to
Yeah, sure
Oh, wow
Do you know Guy Phillips
Yeah, sure
got him in a class
He's so boss
How would you like to ride around with me for awhile
'm sorry,  can't
'm going steady
Ah, come on
just can't
You're just ridin' around with a bunch of girls
Hey, how about somebody else in there
Anybody else want to go for a ride
The girls chatter and giggle among themselves
One of the girls dangles a bra out the back window, and they all break into hysterical laughter
The girls try to accelerate ahead, but John stays alongside their car
Aw, come on
got plenty of room
It's dangerous to have that many people in a car
Cops see ya, you're had
You got nothing to fear, 'm as harmless as a baby kitten
small voice rises above the chatter
'll go
'll go
Judy's sister wants to ride with you
Is that all right
(grinning) Yeah, sure, Judy--her sister--her mother--anybody
'll take 'em all
Listen, we'll go up and stop at that light
It'll turn red by the time we get there
All right
The first girl grins and nods
John winks at her
You ever get tired of going steady with somebody that ain't around--'m up for grabs
The cars stop at the light
girl rushes out from the Studey and runs around the back of John's coupe
She opens the door and climbs in fast as the light changes
The Studebaker pulls off fast
John pushes through the gears and turns and smiles at his pick-up, as "That'll Be the Day" plays on the Wolfman Jack Show
So, you're Judy's little sister
Carol Morrison shakes her head
She is thirteen years old, very cute--wearing blue jeans, sneakers and a "Dewey Webber Surf Board" -shirt which hangs to her knees
John seems slightly panicked
Ah, shit,--how old are you
Old enough
How old are you
'm too old for you
You can't be that old
Listen, listen
think you better go back and sit with your sister
Hey, ah
where are they, anyway
They comin' back or somethin'
This is a joke, right
This better be a joke, 'cause 'm not drivin' you around
But you asked me
What's the matter
Am  too ugly
(on the verge of tears) Judy doesn't want me with her and now you don't want me with you
Nobody wants me
even my mother and father hate me
Everybody hates me
No they don't
mean,  don't know, maybe they do
But  don't
It's just that you're a little young for me
am not
If you throw me out 'll scream
, , just stay cool
There's no need to scream
We'll think of something
(He looks at her as she wipes her eyes
) It shouldn't take too long to find your sister again
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them
John looks over at the car
(
) Hey John--you gonna be there tonight
Oh, shit
Hey, get down
John grabs Carol by the neck and pushes her head down onto his lap so she can't be seen
John casually waves to the friend in the car cruising alongside
Hey, cool
Carol's head is being held down on his lap
She looks up at him
Hey, is this what they call copping a feel
John jumps, and immediately lets go of her as if burned
Uh uh
-
Don't even say that
Jesus
John is beginning to sweat now
What's your name
Mud, if anybody sees you
-' '58 Terry continues to cruise the main drag, slouched low and looking cool in his newly acquired machine
He adjusts his waterfall curl as the Wolfman dedicates a list of songs
He passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised hood of a souped-up parked car
Terry cruises alongside two girls in a Ford
He revs the engine to get their attention and once he has it he motions to roll down their window
They flip him the bird instead and he lets them pass
Terry pulls up to a stop light
The car next to him is a '56 Ford--a good opponent and besides, the kid driving looks younger than Terry
What you got in there, kid
More than you can handle
Terry revs his engine
So does the Ford
The tension mounts
The green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on, the car on Terry's other side moves off, and before he can control his reflexes, Terry, too, has shot into the intersection while the light remains red
Terry quickly shifts and returns to the starting position
The other driver is grinning
Terry is flustered and embarrassed
Terry revs the Chevy a couple more times, concentration intently this time on the right light
Green
The Ford bolts into the intersection
Terry likewise floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large Buick
Terry is stunned for a moment, then realizes he forgot to shift into first
He fumbles to get the car into first gear
distinguished looking man comes up to his window after inspecting the damage
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies
He struggles to start it
Excuse me, but  think we've had an accident
Well, goddamnit,  won't report you this time, but next time just watch it, will ya
Terry roars off in a cloud of indignant smoke, leaving the gentleman standing in the street looking dismayed
The cars behind him begin to honk their horns and shout crudities
Terry pulls up in front of a used car lot and jumps out to inspect the damage to Steve's Chevy
He rubs a small scratch on the back fender, but it won't disappear
As he spits on it, a slick, baggy-suited car salesman ambles up
'll give you $525 for her on a practically new Corvette
and on top of this, 'm going to know 10% off the low price of this beautiful Vette
'm talking about only $98 down and $98 a month
Now, how am able to make you this incredible offer
'll tell you
'm forced to move all the sporty cars off the lot as quickly as  can
Boss's orders
He doesn't want 'em
think it's a mistake, but what can  do
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes
Finally Terry breaks away and jumps back into his car and the salesman continues to rave on as Terry drives away
--"  " Herbie and the Heartbeats, wearing their matching red blazers, rock into a raunchy rendition of their masterpiece-- One, two, three, four-- one, two three, four--
At the hop
Pulling back from the bandstand, we see the Dewey High School gym--the basketball nets swung back and draped with crepe, the lights half-low, the noise high, and the waxed floor being polished and pounded by stockinged feet as a seething mob of adolescents join in that ancient rite--The Hop
hundred of them are dancing and swaying while the band gyrates on a raised platform
Kids on wooden bleachers watch the whirling and spinning mass of ponytails and ducktails, button-down shirts and mid calf skirts, cardigan sweaters with little belts in the back
' Laurie stands in front of a mirror in a line of other girls
She brushes her hair, staring rather despondently at herself in the mirror
The girl next to her is Peg Fuller, a cute cheerleader
Hey, why are you so depressed
You'll forget him in a week
Listen, after you're elected senior queen you'll have so many boys after your bod-- don't want to go out with anybody else
Laurie,  know it's a drag but you can't--remember what happened to Evelyn Chelnick
When Mike went to the Marines
She had a nervous breakdown and was acting so wacky she got run over by a bus
just wish  could go with him or something
Laurie, jeez
Come on
' We move down a row of sinks at which guys are working as intently on their coiffures as the girls
Ducktails being smoothed; glassy waterfalls being primped; the fronts of crew cuts being waxed to stand stiff
Steve stands looking at himself, then glances at Eddie Quentin standing next to him, dabbing something on his face
What's that
Eddie jerks his hand down and hides something
What's what
Steve turns and pulls Eddie's hand up
Hey, zit make-up
(laughing) Wait till  tell--hey, everybody, Eddie-- Come on, Steve--don't
Just cool it
He takes his pimple cream back and Steve continues to laugh
He stops slowly and looks at himself again in the mirror
He finds something on his neck, looks around at Eddie
(quietly) Let me see some of that stuff
Eddie gives him the tube and Steve dabs it on his neck
You leave tomorrow
Steve nods
You and Laurie engaged yet
No, but we got it worked out
We're still going together but we can date other people
And screw around-- hear college girls really give out
Suddenly a voice shouts "One-two--" they turn to see a guy at every toilet hit the flusher on "Three," sending a torrent of water down the pipes
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor
Panic
Everybody crashes for the doors, laughing and shoving each other
The guys tumble out the lavatory door and abruptly cool it as a dumb-looking paunchy teacher stops and looks them over, rocking on his heels
They escape quietly
Steve and Eddie meet Laurie coming out of the girls' lavatory with Peg
They're watching the dancers as Hervie and his band moan through a slow number--"She's So Fine
" Come on
Come on what
Let's dance
No thanks
Laurie,  want to dance
Who's stopping you
Eddie and Peg are listening and watching
Steve smiles at them like everything's okay
He glares at Laurie
(under his breath) Laurie,  thought since this was our last night together for 3 months, you might want to dance with me
How sentimental
You'll be back at Christmas
want to dance now, not at Christmas
He takes her arm, which she pulls away
Get your cooties off me-- Eddie and Peg are watching with great interest
Steve smiles at them again
Then he leans down and whispers something to Laurie
Go ahead, slug me, scar my face wouldn't dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym
Uh, Peg,  think we should dance
No, this is getting good
'll dance with you, Eddie
You don't mind, do you, Peggy
She takes Eddie by the hand and leaves Steve fuming with Peg
Joe College strikes out
Steve gives her a snide look, then watches Laurie and Eddie laughing, as they join in The Stroll
The whole gym is Strolling in unison, like some strange musical military formation
The Stroll music floats from the gym down the empty hall
Curt walks along with his hands in his pockets
One last trip down the grey, locker-lined corridor
He slows and stops by locker 2127
He smiles a little, then flips the dial of the lock
Once to the right--back to the left--then to the right again
Curt hits the handle
It doesn't open
Changed already
He shrugs and goes off down the hallway
Curt walks in the background, behind the line of kids clapping as one couple Strolls down between them
Then Curt hears somebody call him
(
) Hey--Curtis
Curt wanders over toward a young teacher, Mr
Wolfe, who is surrounded by a group of admiring (and grade-seeking) girls
Mr
Wolfe wears ivy league clothes and is about twenty-five, not much older than his students
Curtis, come here
Help me, will you
'm surrounded
You won't dance
Come on
No, really, 'd like to, but  can't
mean, if old Mr
Simpson came in here and saw me dancing with one of you sexy little--excuse me
one of you young ladies, he'd have my rear end
Aahhh
The all giggle
Mr
Wolfe shrugs at Curt and heads for a door
Curt follows him and they escape from the girls into the night
Curt and Mr
Wolfe come out of the gym
Mr
Wolfe sees a couple of guys skulking around in the shadows smoking cigarettes and laughing
The music has changed to "See You in September
" Hey, Warren
Come on, gentlemen, back inside
Put 'em out
Let's go
(grinning as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes) Kids
Want one
(taking one from the pack) All right
Hey,  thought you'd left
No, not yet
(looking for matches) have no matches
Mr
Wolfe takes out a pack of matches and lights both their cigarettes
They walk down a chain-link fence, past dark, venetian-blinded classrooms
Brother, how do  get stuck with dance supervision
Will you tell me that
You going back East
Boy, remember the day  went off
Got drunk as hell the night before
Just-- Blotto
Blotto
Exactly
Barfed on the train all the next day
(grinning) Cute
Very cute
Where'd you go again
Middlebury
Vermont
Got a scholarship
And only stayed a semester
(smiling and nodding) One semester
And after all that, came back here
Why
(shrugging) Decided  wasn't the competitive type
don't know
maybe  was scared
Well, you know  might find 'm not the competitive type myself
What do you mean
Well, 'm not really sure that 'm going
Hey, now--don't be stupid
Go
Experience life
Have some fun, Curtis
Then a voice calls from the shadows
(
) Bill
They turn and see a girl coming out of a doorway
Mr
Wolfe looks at Jane, one of his students, but doesn't say anything
mean--Mr
Wolfe
Can  speak with you a minute
(She smiles at Curt
) Hi, Curt
Jane
He looks at Mr
Wolfe, who seems a little embarrassed
Then, Mr
Wolfe sticks out his hand
Anyway--good luck, Curtis
Curt shakes his hand
Yeah
'll see you
Thanks a lot
Curt walks back toward the gym
Looking around, he sees Mr
Wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl, talking intimately
Curt turns away and goes off
Before going back into the gym, Curt stops
He sees a white -bird parked among a row of cars in the parking lot
He walks--then starts running toward the car
There's a blonde sitting in the front seat making out with some guy
Curt leans down to the window and is about to say something to his dream girl
But she turns and he sees it's not her
Her boyfriend glares at him like he's some kind of peeping Tom
Curt backs away awkwardly, trying to smile
He leaves
--'32 The yellow Ford coupe is gliding down the street--skimming around corners gracefully as the night lights glide up its lacquered hood
Inside the car, Carol glances at John and smiles
The Wolfman is howling on the radio
(
) Wolfman exclusive for ya now
The Beach Boys, baby, a brand new group
predict they gonna go a long way
This is called "Surfin' Safari
" Carol is continuing to jabber on, relating past adventures with her little friends
John is unimpressed
So the next night we found out where they parked and went out with ammunition
Don't you have homework or something to do
No sweat--my mother does it
Anyway, he thought he was had
He started the car and couldn't see through the windshield--and zoomed straight into the canal--it was a riot
John smiles sarcastically
still got some, so don't try anything
She takes a pressurized can of shaving cream and squirts his nose
He swipes the shaving cream on his nose--swerving-- car honks
Hey, watch it will ya
Jesus Christ, thanks a lot
(looking at her angrily) Hey, drivin' is a serious business
ain't havin' no accidents because of you
Carol sinks into her corner of the car
She sticks her tongue out for a quick moment
(catching her look) Come on, don't give me any grief
'm warning ya
Spare me, killer
He stares at her and she shuts up
"Surfin' Safari" is blaring on the radio and she starts twisting with the music
John turns the radio off
Why'd you do that
don't like that surfing shit
Rock 'n Roll's been going downhill ever since Buddy Holly died
Don't you think the Beach Boys are boss
You would, you grungy little twerp
Grungy
You big weenie, if  had a boyfriend he'd pound you
(looking in the rear- view mirror) Sure--ah, shit, Holstein
She looks around, and sees a police car following them, bubble lights aglow
Good, a cop--'m going to tell him you tried to rape me
John pulls the car over and stops
Oh, no--No
Hey-- It's past my curfew
'm going to tell him how old  am, my parents don't know 'm out and you tried to rape me
Boy, are you up a creek
John looks at her
Hey--ah, really--don't say anything
She looks at him
If you say " was a dirty bird
Carol's not grungy, she's bitchin'
" The cop is tapping at John's window
John wipes his face
Say it--'ll tell him
(quietly) was a dirty bird, Carol's not grungy, she's bitchin
' Okay--'ll think about it
"The Great Imposter" can be heard on the passing car radios
John rolls down his window
He looks at the surly cop
Where you going, Milner
'm going home--sir
Where you been, Milner
Ah--at the movies--sir
Milner, you weren't around the 12th and  streets at about 8:30, were you
No,  wa at the movies--like  said-- sir
Holstein looks at him, then steps back, looks at the car
Holstein's only a couple years older than John, but the uniform separates them by light years
Uh-huh
Milner, the reason  stopped you was because the light on your license plate is out
(opening his ticket book) 'm gonna have to cite you for that
And Milner, the front end of this
this
this thing you're driving looks a little low
Oh, no sir
It's twelve and a half inches
Regulation size
Now, it's been checked several times
You can check it if you like, sir
Holstein just glares at him and then leans in close through the window
Look, Milner
Yes, sir
You can't fool with the law
Yes, sir
We know that was you tonight
We have an excellent description of this car
could run you in right now and  could make it stick
But 'm not gonna do that, Milner, you know why
John shakes his head no
Because  want to catch you in the act
And when  do, 'm gonna nail you, but good
Happy Birthday, Milner
Holstein drops the ticket through the window onto John's lap
He starts back to his patrol car
When he's out of earshot John answers
Thank you--asshole
(looking over at him) You're a regular
Here, file that under
over there
Carol takes the ticket and opens the glove compartment
What's that stand for
Chicken shit--that's what it is
Oh
She looks amazed as she adds the new ticket to a mess of similar tickets crammed in the glove compartment
The police car pulls by them
John scowls, then roars his engine and pulls back into the stream of traffic
--' '58 Terry is looking and feeling like he's got it made
He downshifts and slows for a red light
very mean-looking black '55 Chevy--blown, scooped and slicked--pulls up next to him
The driver, Bob Falfa, has a gum-chewing girlfriend sitting almost on top of him
Terry challenges the '55 Chevy by revving his engine
Bob Falfa doesn't even look over
He revs his engine--which sounds like a cross between a Boeing 707 and a SuperChief
Terry can't believe it
He quits revving his engine--feeling deflated
Terry looks over at the snotty grin on Falfa's girlfriends' face
Ain't he neat
Terry doesn't say anything and Bob Falfa glares over at him
Hey, you know a guy around here with a piss yellow deuce coupe--supposed to be hot stuff
You mean John Milner
Falfa nods slowly
Hey, nobody can beat him, man
He's got the fastest-- ain't nobody, dork
Right
Right
Hey, you see this Milner, you tell him 'm lookin' for him, huh
Tell him  aim to blow his ass right off the road
(giving another snotty smile) Ain't he neat
Terry doesn't say anything
There's another incredible scream as Falfa roars off, leaving Terry to stare through his smoke
Terry accelerates the '58 Chevy--at a prudent speed
As the radio blares "Almost Grown," Terry glides past the lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes from his beautiful new car
Terry passes a steaming rear-end collision at an intersection where two guys and two girls are all yelling
Then, suddenly, he spots a girl--walking--alone
His mouth drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl
Debbie, nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti- strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk
Terry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him
As he passes her, he speeds up
What a babe
what a bitchin' babe
And Wolfman Baby, she's all mine
Terry tears around the corner and starts his approach once more
He quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and settles down into a comfortable slouch
Okay, honey, here  come--James Dean lives
He hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and then--disaster
Debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes on motorcycles, parked along the curb
One especially vicious biker turns and looks at Terry as he passes
Terry roars off around the block
Stay cool, honey--don't let those creeps bug you
Wolfman, please don't let those creeps bug her
please
As Debbie passes the bikers, they hoot, holler, and make barnyard noises
From the cat calls, and Debbie's manner it seems obvious that Debbie is a girl a lot of boys have "known
" She has walked clear of the bikers as Terry screeches around the corner again
He pulls up alongside her and again slows to a crawl
The pass each other for awhile, but she doesn't look over
Hi
(lowering his voice) Hello
buenos noches
Need a lift
Nice night for a walk
Do you know John Milner
Curt Henderson
Sure you wouldn't like a ride somewhere
Did anyone ever tell you that you look just like Connie Stevens
This stops her and she turns--Terry hits the brakes and the car bounces
You do
mean it
Just like Connie Stevens
met her once
For real
Yeah
At a Dick Clark road show
Debbie starts slowly toward the car
You really think  look like her
No shit--excuse me,  mean 'm not just feeding you a line
You look like Connie Stevens
What's your name
Debbie
always though  looked like Sandra Dee
Oh yeah--well, you look a lot like her too
This your car
Yeah
'm Terry the--they call me Terry the Tiger
It's really tough looking
What school do you go to
Dewey--can it lay rubber
Oh yeah, it's got a 327 Chevy mill with six Strombergs
Wow--bitchin' tuck and roll
just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery
You do
Yeah
Well, come on in--'ll let you feel it
mean, you can touch it if you want-- (realizing it's coming out wrong he gets nervous) mean the upholstery, you know
Okay
Terry is elated
He climbs out of the car and she slides in the driver's side
Terry climbs back in next to her and slams the door
She's sitting right next to him--like a real date should
Terry gets a little nervous
Peel out
What
Peel out
love it when guys peel out
Terry nods, checks his clutch, revs the engine to a high- pitched whine and they're off-- The tires smoke, scream, the car shots off, fish-tailing, nearly hitting a parked car, straightening out
and disappears down Main Street
-- On stage, the band is "taking five
" They're looking tough for the girls while the Student Body Secretary is making announcements at the mike
--a great band and they came all the way from Stockton
Let's hear it
There's applause as the girl continues
And we want to thank Darby Langdon, who did all these neat decorations
There's more applause
Standing among the crowd, Steve and Laurie both look angry
don't care if you leave this second
(into the mike) Now the next dance is gonna be a snowball and leading it off is last year's class president Steven Bolander-- and this year's head cheerleader, Laurie Henderson
There's applause, whistles and cheers from the crowd
blue spotlight floats over the dance floor and then lands on Steve and Laurie, who are in the midst of their argument
What's wrong with you
You're acting like a snotty-- Laurie squints into the spotlight and realizes everybody's watching them
Oh God, come on
Come on what
(pulling him toward the floor) Oh, Steven--please, everybody's watching
Smile or something
Steve gives a sick smile as she drags him out onto the floor
record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor
The crowd quiets, getting a little misty about this soon-to-be separated teenage couple
For their part, Steve and Laurie are arguing, whispering in each other's ears
You think  care if you go off
You think 'm going to crack up or something
Are you conceited
Quit--quit pinching-- don't know why  ever started taking you out in the first place
He takes her hand from the tucked-under-the-chin position and puts it around him, in a bear-hug
You take me out
When we first met you didn't have enough sense to take the garbage out
asked you out, remember
What do you mean, you asked me out
Backwards Day--remember
If  had waited for you to ask me--even after that you didn't call me for two weeks
was busy
You were scared
Dave Oboler told me
Then when you did ask me out you didn't kiss me for three dates
Well-- was-- Scared--Jim Kaylor told me
even asked my father why you hadn't kissed me
Your father--great
He said he thought you were bright and you'd probably think of kissing me after a while
He moans
You didn't, of course
had to
Remember that picnic
Out at the canyon
Oh boy
You can't remember anything-- the first one, up at the lake
That was the first time you kissed me-- practically had to throw myself at you
(quietly) remember
They continue to dance slowly
Laurie starts to cry, hating herself for it
Steve loosens a minute and looks at her
What's wrong
Go to hell
He holds her tighter and they circle the floor, all alone, the crowd watching quietly, the gym echoing with "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
" Curt is leaning against a car in the parking lot
He's looking up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from the gym
What are you doin', stealing hub caps
pretty, dark-haired girl, Wendy, slides up next to him and leans against the car
There's an awkward pause like that which happens often when two people who used to be close meet after things have changed
Well--hey, Wendy
How've you been
Fine
Great
How've you been
horn honks and Wendy turns to a  that's idling nearby
'm coming--wait a sec
(turning back to Curt) She's got her car
Hey,  thought you were going away to school
Ah, maybe
maybe
Same old Curt
All the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing
well, anyway, gotta go
Hey, Wendy--where are you going
Nowhere
(smiling at her) Well, you mind if  come along
(affectionately) Okay
Okay
They go off toward the  and climb in
The hop is almost over and the lights have been lowered, conservatively
Steve and Laurie hold each other, hardly moving and he kisses her
Still kissing, they continue to circle slowly--until a short, totally bald teacher comes and pokes Steve in the side
All right, Bolander, break it up
You know the rules
You and your panting girlfriend want to do that you'll have to go someplace else
He gives them a disgusted look and starts off
Hey, Kroot
The teacher turns, surprised by the omission of "Mr
" Why don't you go kiss a duck
Kroot's beady eyes widen and he comes back
What
What did you say
said go kiss a duck, marblehead
Kroot is stunned and people have stopped dancing to watch Bolander--you're suspended
You're-- don't even come Monday
You are out
(smiling broadly) graduated last semester
Suddenly everything has changed
Mr
Kroot is furious, but unable to do anything
He finally storms off in a huff
Steve, Laurie and the people watching all laugh
(to Laurie) Get your shoes
Let's go before we get thrown out
Steve and Laurie walk toward her Edsel
In the background Wolfman Jack is taking a phone call from someone
(
) Hello, Wolfman
(
) Who's this
This is Weird Willard
Hold on a minute, let me get my pants off
you understand
Steve opens the door to the car and then turns Laurie and kisses her
Why don't we go to the canal
(teasing) What for
Listen,  can get tough with you too, you know
Yeah, hard tough
She kisses him and they get into the car
As they pull out, the Wolfman continues his conversation on the radio
(
) got 'em down around my knees, man
Wear these tight pants
can't get 'em
All right, 'm gonna do my little dance now, man
And the Wolfman goes into an insane rain-dance rhythm as we hear "Little Darlin'" --' '58 Terry not only looks cool now, but is cool, singing with the radio, a girl beside him
Hot stuff
Terry ever so slowly tries to put his arm around her, but by the time he manages it, he has to shift
They drive by some kids having a car-to-car water pistol war
go to Dewey too, ya know
never seen ya
bug out a lot
When  graduate, 'm going to join the Marines
They got the best uniforms
But what if there's a war
With the bomb, who's going to start it
We'd all blow up together
Anyway, 'd rather be at the front
'm like that--rather be where the action is, you know
Once  got in a fight with-- love Eddie Burns
Terry stops, trying to figure out where their conversation went
Eddie Burns--oh, yeah, Eddie Burns
met him once, too
You really think  look like Connie Stevens
like her--Tuesday Weld is too much of a beatnik, don't you think
Yeah, beatniks are losers
Who do you like
mean, singers and stuff
Terry slowly maneuvers his arm around her
Ah hell-- like most of the people you like
(putting her head on his shoulder) That's nice--we got a lot in common
Both of them start singing with the radio
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg
You know what 'd like more than anything in the world right now
Terry almost does a comic strip "Gulp
" 'd love a double Chubby Chuck
Isn't that what you'd like more than anything right now
(quietly) Sure
' - The endless chrome-flashing parade continues
Among the lines of fine cars, Terry is parked in the '58 Chevy next to an order speaker on a metal pole
Terry leans out the car window and orders into the intercom
double Chubby Chuck, a Mexicali Chili Barb, two orders of French fries-- And cherry cokes
The intercom clicks on and a garbled voice squawks back at him
Ark, wark, dork
(pushing the button) Now wait a minute
What
Huh
Ark, wark, dork
Yeah, right
Cool
As they wait for their order, several guys in various passing cars yell sleazy greetings to Debbie
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window
Hey, Deb
How's my soft baby
Beat it, Vic
'm not your baby
Terry nervously pretends not to hear
Oh, come on, honey
So  never called you back
've been, you know, busy
Three weeks
besides, it only took one night for me to realize that if brains were dynamite, you couldn't blow your nose
Look who's talking
Who's the wimp you're hanging out with now
Einstein
Tiger happens to be very intelligent
Unlike you
know every thing your dirty little mind is thinking
(She looks out the window, down at Vic's pants) it shows
Hey, now-- (his voice cracks) mean, hey now, buddy, the lady obviously doesn't-- Look, creep, you want a knuckle sandwich
Ah, no thanks, 'm waiting for a double Chubby--Chuck
Then shut your smart ass mouth
'll call ya, Deb, some night when 'm hard up
won't be home
Vic makes a kiss-off noise
She lights a match and flicks it at him
He finally leaves
You seem to, ah--know a lot of weird guys
That sex fiend is not a friend of mine; he's just horny
That's why like you, you're different
am
You really think 'm intelligent
She moves very close to him and whispers in his ear
Yeah
And 'll bet you're smart enough to get us some brew
Brew
Yeah
Brew
oh--yeah
oh, sure
(she kisses him) Yes
Liquor
This place is too crowded anyway
Terry backs out and drives off, leaving the approaching car hop standing in an empty parking space
What about your double Chubby Chuck, mexicali-chili-barb and (looking at the tray) --two cherry cokes, sir
-'57 We see the white -bird ahead for just a moment, before it accelerates, passes a car and disappears, as we hear "Peppermint Twist" from the radio
In the , Curt is in the back, shaking the driver's seat, yelling at Bobbie
Wendy is in front next to Bobbie
There--don't you see it
Speed up, you're losing her-- Quit shouting in my ear
Cut around him, cut around him
The little  swerves and cuts around an old dagoed Dodge, then speeds along the fast lane
Ahead, we catch a glimpse of the -bird as it turns a corner
There, hang a right--over there
Bobbie turns, somebody honks, she hits the curb, shifting madly she mis-clutches; the beetle lugs forward; Curt falls back in the seat and Wendy looks at him
You lost her
What's wrong with you
You know Bobbie gets nose bleeds when she's upset
do not
You shut up
Lost her again
Ah, Wendy, my old lover, come back here and console me
Eat your heart out
Who was she anyway
don't know, but 'm going to find out
know her
There are a few moments of silence as Bobbie lets Curt sweat it out
Finally, Curt breaks
Okay, come on, who is she
You know Mr
Beeman
He owns Hepcat Jewelers
Yeah
Well, she's his wife
But she was young and beautiful, and cruising 10th Street
You're thinking of someone else
Mr
Beeman's not so old
What cruel fate keeps me from my true love
How am  ever going to meet her
(to Bobbie) Did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide
It's supposed to be a secret, but his big ambition in life is to shake hands with President Kennedy
How are you going to accomplish that at
Maybe 've grown up
Maybe 've changed my mind
Maybe you don't think you can do it
Maybe you should shut up
Maybe  will
and maybe  won't
Why don't you move your bod into aft chamber, where we might discuss this in private
(seeing that Wendy is considering it) Thanks a lot
Come on, Wendy
She doesn't say anything
They pull up to a stoplight
Wendy looks at the red stoplight and then abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back
Well, slide over, 'm not sitting on your lap
She gets in and the car goes off
In the back seat, Curt and Wendy are talking softly
He puts his arm around her and she makes a face, but doesn't remove it
Bobbie watches in the rear-view mirror, Curt sees her
To the Opera, James
Drop dead
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have an orgy
You wish
Curt looks at her and turns her head
He kisses her and puts his arm around her
They neck
The radio plays "Barbara Ann
" The little  flashes by in the stream of traffic
Bobbie drives, glancing in here rear-view mirror occasionally and also watching the station wagon ahead, in which two pairs of feet are dancing against the back window
Wendy pulls away from Curt's lips and looks out the window
've been silly
'm glad you're going to stay
Maybe we'll have some classes together
Maybe
(from the front seat) Look, there's Kip Pullman
He's so neat
Wendy turns and leans forward, laughing
Curt watches her seriously, studying her
Do you know Kip
Huh
Yeah,  know him
Talk to him when we go by
What do you want me to say
Anything
just want to meet him
They pull up next to Kip's car and Curt leans forward and yells out Bobbie's window
Kip, baby, what's up
Henderson, long time no see
Whadaya been doing
Not much, just wanted to let you know that Bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps
Bobbie swerves the car away and turns a corner
She stops on a dime at the curb
You creep, fink, son-of-a-bitch-- She turns and starts flailing at Curt with her purse
Help, wait
Joke--Joke--Bobbie, remember your nose bleeds
Get out--get out of my car-- hate you
Excuse me--ouch--Wendy-- got to go now
Wendy is laughing and Curt climbs over her out of the small car
He gets out and closes the door
Wendy changes seats and looks at him seriously
Curt,  hope  see you at registration
Call me if you want
It was nice seeing you again
See ya
The car pulls off and Curt watches it
Suddenly, he sees something--the -bird going the other way down the street
Oh shit--there
Wait
The 's gone and Curt starts after the -bird on foot
He runs down the middle of the street, oblivious to the horns honking and the cars swerving to miss him
We move with Curt as he moves like a broken field runner through the traffic only to finally lose the girl and the Thunderbird and to slow and finally stop, standing on the white line
Cars slow down and kids rubberneck as they go by him
--'32 John is driving and the Wolfman is howling on the radio while Carol is having the time of her life
(
) Went to a dance lookin' for romance
Found Barbara Ann
baby
Hey, this one is for all you out there watchin' the Submarine Races
And the radio moans into "Who Wrote the Book of Love
" Carol sits with her feet up against the dash
John knocks them off and she scowls at him
'm so thirsty,  could die
Just a little 10 cent coke to wet my whistle
It won't take a minute,  can drink it in the-- John suddenly hits the brakes and Carol almost hits the floor
John reaches over and opens the door
Why don't you just get out and get one then
So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago
She stares at him, shaken, looking sweet and helpless
He turns and looks at her
tear rolls down her cheek slowly
John can't take it
All right, one coke and then home
Carol is delighted
She slams the door
John takes off
Isn't it great, the way  can cry whenever  want
lot of people can't do that, but Vicki showed me how
bet you can't cry
Don't count on it
may surprise you any minute now
' - John cruises around the lot until he finds a space among the rows of dazzling cars
He pulls in and leans out to hit the intercom button
(into intercom) One ten cent coke
Is ice extra
All right, ice
Thanks for nothing
She looks around, sitting up so maybe some of her friends will see her in John's neat car
Oh rats,  though some of my friends might be here
Probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime
Wait, there's Dee Dee
hope she sees me
Oh Shit, Dee Dee
long line of cars coast past
Occasionally, someone yells a greeting to John
The car hop brings the coke
Then a couple, Al and Linda, come over
They lean in the window smiling--John prays they don't see Carol
Hiya, John
Say, do you think if brought my Mopar by the shop Monday you could spot weld the bumper bracket
Have to be before noon
Sure
Hey, have you met Linda
No
Hi--ahh, this is my, ahh, cousin, Carol
'm kinda babysitting tonight
Babysitting
She slugs John on the arm
John grabs her arm as she starts to swing again
Jesus--watch it, will yuh
(smiling at Al) Been hittin' me all night
Kids will be kids, you know
She struggles to hit him and spills her coke all over the car
He pushes her rather roughly against the door
Watch out--damn it
Look what--why don't you grow up
(looking at Al again) We don't get along too well
It's been like this-- You spastic creep
She is about to really cry this time
She jumps out of the car and runs off down the street
John wipes his car out as Al and Linda watch in amazement
We don't get along too well
You know what cousins are like
Yeah
well, 'll see ya on Monday before noon
John mutters profanities to himself, but his anger subsides after a few moments
He looks back in the direction Carol went
All he can see are two Hell's Angels on choppers rolling in the same direction
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe
--'32 John roars along looking for her until he sees her walking angrily along the sidewalk--being followed by a Ford full of guys
John passes Carol and the Ford and pulls over and stops just ahead of them
Carol stops when she sees John
The Ford also stops and the guys call out to her
She considers the situation a moment, then runs and gets in with John
He pulls off and she grins at him happily
Hi cousin, how's your bod
--' '58 Terry pulls into the parking lot and stops
He looks up at the flashing liquor store sign and considers his battle plan
"Maybe Baby" by Buddy Holly is playing on the radio
Do you have an
No
hey, but no sweat
What'll it be
Beer, little wine
If you could get some Old Harper, 'd give you a French kiss
Old Harper, rrright
He gives her an sign with his fingers and goes over to the store
He starts to enter, then stops and thinks
He sees a man in a business suit approaching, and smiles
Excuse me, sir, while you're in there-- mean, since you're going in anyway, wonder if-- Yes, son
Could you--sir--could you give me the time
(looking at his watch) Why sure, it's a quarter to twelve
Great
Quarter to twelve
Thanks a lot
The man regards him, Terry pretends to start off until the man goes in
Terry pulls himself together as another man approaches, or rather stumbles up, being older, scruffy and, essentially, a bum
Pardon me, sir, but  lost my
in--in a flood and 'd like to get some Old Harper, hard stuff
Would you mind buying a bottle for me
The bum is still trying to focus on Terry and smiles
Why certainly,  lost my wife, too-- her name wasn't Idy, though, and it wasn't in a flood--but  know what ya-- Thanks, here's enough for a pint
The old man takes the money and falls into the store
Terry watches and then waves to Debbie in the car that everything is cool
As he waits for the bum to come back out, the first man in the suit exits
Terry smiles at him again
Hi
Still quarter to twelve
Right-o
Night
Night
The man gets into the car and backs out
Terry goes over to the window of the liquor store and looks to see how the wino's doing with his booze
Terry sees the liquor store owner setting four bottles of cheap wine on the counter
(gesturing through the window from outside) Hey, no
Not wine
Ssss--hey
The owner turns and sees Terry waving
Terry ducks out of sight
When he looks back again, Terry sees the old bum is gone
Terry can't believe it
He finally enters the store
Terry tries to look very casual as he sidles up to the counter
Country-Western music hums over the liquor in hi- fi
(smiling at the owner) Hi there--ah, say--was there an old man in here a minute ago
Yeah
He went out the back
Terry is destroyed
You want something
Terry looks at the man and the endless rows of liquor behind him
Yeah--ah--let me have a Three Musketeers, ah, and a ball point pen ther, a comp, a pint of Old Harper, couple of flashlight batteries and some of this beef jerky
The owner puts everything into a bag and starts to ring it up
Okay, got an
for the liquor
what
Oh, sure-- (feeling his pockets) Oh nuts,  left it-- left it in the car
Sorry, you'll have to get it before-- Well,  can't
also ah, forgot the car
The owner takes the liquor out of the bag and puts it back on the shelf
Terry stands there
The owner takes the money from him and gives him his change
Terry comes back to the Chevy with the bag full of junk
Debbie smiles at him excitedly and scoots over to the window
Hey, did ya get it
Ya get it, ya get it
He hands her the bag
You got it
You got it
She goes through the bag and finds a comb and the batteries
You didn't get it
Why didn't you get it
Ah, well,  needed some things and thought as long as  was in there-- look, Debbie, can you loan me a dollar
What
Are you for real
Come on
Girls don't pay
Guys pay
Yeah, well, see--'ve only got a fifty and he doesn't have change
Well,  can't believe this
really cannot believe this
Here
She takes the money from a squeeze-open plastic change purse and hands it to him
Terry smiles weakly and goes back to try his luck again at the liquor store
He stops in front of the door as a young guy with numerous tattoos on his bulging arms approaches the liquor store
Hi--excuse me
was wondering--could you, ah-- Buy you a bottle of booze
Yeah, know
You lost your
What kind do you want
(amazed) Gee, that's terrific
Ah, just some ah--Old Harper
He takes Terry's money and enters the store
The clerk hands the man a bottle of Old Harper
Terry waves excitedly to Debbie, lowering his pants a bit
Suddenly, there's a gunshot
Terry whirls to see the young man stuffing cash from the register into his pockets, backing away with a smoking gun
He rushes out of the store, tossing the bottle to Terry and running off into the night
Suddenly, the owner emerges from behind the counter, shooting wildly
Terry ducks and heads for the car with his pint of Old Harper
John's '32 deuce coupe crunches to a gravelly stop in front of a dark auto-wrecking yard
John and Carol get out and climb over the fence
They walk through a valley of twisted, rusting piles of squashed, mashed and crushed automobiles
John sticks his hand into his pockets moodily and stops and looks at one of the burnt-out cars
That's Freddy Benson's Vette
he got his head on with some drunk
Never had a chance
Damn good driver, too
What a waste when somebody gets it and it ain't even their fault
Needs a paint job, that's for sure
John doesn't hear her and walks on
That Vette over there
Walt Hawkins, a real ding-a-ling
Wrapped it around a fig tree out on Mesa Vista with five kids in it
Draggin' with five kids in the car, how dumb can you get
All the ding-a-lings get it sooner or later
Maybe that's why they invented cars
To get rid of the ding-a-lings
Tough when they take someone with them
You never had a wreck though--you told me
come pretty close a couple of times
Almost rolled once
So far 've been quick enough to stay out of here
The quick and the dead
bet you're the fastest
've never been beaten--lot of punks have tried
See that '41 Ford there
Used to be the fastest wheels in the valley
never got a chance to race old Earl
He got his in '55 in the hairiest crash ever happened around here
He was racing a '54 Chevy, bored and loaded, out on the old Oakdale Highway and every damn kid in town was out there
The Chevy lost its front wheel doing about 85
The idiot had torched the spindles to lower the front end and it snapped right off
He slammed bam into the Ford and then they both of them crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin
Jesus, eight kids killed including both drivers, looked like a battlefield
Board of Education was so impressed they filmed it
Show it now in Drivers Education, maybe you'll see it
Anyway, since then street racing's gone underground
No spectators,  mean
Too bad
'd love to see you race
Carol takes his hand and they walk a bit, until John realizes what he's doing, and drops her hand and pulls away
Come on
None of that
Whadaya mean
'm the one who's supposed to say that
Whadaya afraid of
'll keep it above the waist
Funny
(he looks at her for a moment) Who knows, in a few years--but not now, bunny rabbit
Bunny rabbit
Oh brother, you are such a drip
She stomps off and gets back into the coupe, quickly rolling up all the windows
John saunters up and finds the door locked
Come on, open the door
If you say "Carol's not a bunny, she's a foxy little tail
" John grins and starts to pull his keys out of his pocket
He stops grinning: Carol grins and dangles his keys inside the car
John leans against the window, closes his eyes, a defeated man
(quietly) Carol's not a rabbit, she's a foxy little tail
He hears the button click up and slowly opens the door
You say the cutest things
John gets into the car
(
) Sneakin' around with the Wolfman, Baby
The Wolfman's gravelly voice whispers over the airwaves as John and Carol drive out of the shadowy car grave-yard
' Curt is sitting on the hood of a parked De Soto watching a row of televisions in the window of an appliance store
Twelve silent images of Ricky Nelson on "Ozzie and Harriet" glow in the dark showroom
Music from passing cars rises and fades as they cruise behind Curt
The Wolfman can be heard
(
) Oh, this is gonna strike a raw nerve, mama
Here's the Platters
The Wolfman howls and the Platters wail into the "Great Pretender
" Curt sings along, mouthing the words
Then somebody walks in front of Curt
Curt pays no attention, then sense the presence of another guy
Soon he realizes that he is being surrounded by a group of three hoods
They slink up from all sides wearing car coats with the name "" embroidered across the back
Curt looks them over--they all watch the silent tv's
One of them, without turning, talks to Curt
Whadaya doin', creep
Me
No, 'm talking to the other fifty creeps here
You know Gil Gonzales
Gil Gonzales
no
Don't know Gil
you oughta
You really should
Yeah
why
No reason
he's a friend of ours
and that's his car you're sitting on
There's silence
Curt looks uneasy and slides quietly off the De Soto
Curt sticks his hands in his pockets and starts slowly down the sidewalk
Hey, where ya goin
(turning) No place
Not going any place
Ya must be going someplace-- mean ya left here
Bring him over here, Ants,  want to show him something
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek) brings Curt back gently
Joe is bent over looking across the hood of the De Soto
Here--bend down, look here
See that
Right across there--see
guess so--yeah
Joe unbends and lightly punches Curt on the shoulder
You scratched it, man
Where do you get off sitting on Gil's car, huh, man
Joe gives him another charming punch on the shoulder
The others have left the tv's and are watching Curt now, looking puzzled and pained at the scratch on the car
'm sorry
It's not much of a scratch
don't think he'll even-- It ain't the size that's in question here
It's the principle
Jeez, this is tough
what should we do with ya
Tie him to the car and drag him
Curt turns and laughs at Ants' suggestion
He laughs and laughs until he realizes nobody else is; they are pondering the suggestion
That's funny (clearing his throat) Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez
He's a Pharoah, isn't he
Toby Juarez
Yeah, sure we know Toby
He's a friend of mine
They all grin and laugh with Curt who feels better
Sure, good old Toby
He's a friend of yours
That's cool
we all hate his guts
Curt stops smiling again
Oh--well,  don't know him that much anyway
We killed him last night
Tied him to a car and dragged him
Curt looks at them both, praying they're kidding
Joe looks at him, shaking his head
This is going to take some thinking
You better come with us maybe
(putting his arm around Curt) Go riding with the Pharoahs
Well,  don't think  can-- gotta-- know just how ya feel
Joe leads Curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon '51 Merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine quality
Joe opens the door and Curt slides into the white fluffy interior
In the small back window, a metal plaque reads "
" The third member of the gang is Carlos, a short little kid about fifteen years old
He appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth
Joe heads for the driver's side and Ants and Carlos both go for the front passenger door
Shotgun
No,  called it
When
Before we picked you up
You can't call it for the whole night, man
got it now
Get in the back
Carlos gives Ants a hard look and Ants backs down and climbs in the back with Curt
The Pharoah's Mercury roars out from the curb
--' '51 The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame
" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous
He eyes the three hoods cautiously
They are sitting super low, their eyes just visible over the windows
Then, Curt happens to look around
He does a double take
Through the narrow window he sees the Thunderbird passing in the opposite direction
Curt swivels and watches through the back window as the -bird disappears around a corner
Then, he shakes his head
Of all the times to be trapped with the Pharoahs
On the radio the Wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad time and the Pharoahs are chuckling
As the Wolfman continues on the radio, the cars pass though the night like a metallic ballet
The Pharoahs' Mercury (with Curt aboard) passes Laurie's Edsel
Inside the Edsel, Steve is driving
He puts his arm around Laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder
As the Edsel cruises by in one direction, John Milner's '32 Ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street
Carol is laughing like mad as the Wolfman continues
Even John has to chuckle at the mad
's raspy patter
(
) Who is this on the Wolfman telephone
(
) Hello, Collect
Pardon me
Your name is Colette
Yes
Collect Call
Your name is Colette Call
Sir, this is the Operator
Are you French, Operator
This is a collect call for Wolfman Jack
love you, Operator
Is this Wolfman Jack
Is Floyd there
It's for a Wolfman
Jack
Carol looks over at John and shakes her head
just love listening to the Wolfman
My Mom won't let me at home
Because he's a Negro,  think
anyway, he's terrific
Do you know that he just broadcasts from a plane that flies around in circles all the time
Do you think that's true
' '58 Terry drives on through the wonderful night--a blonde sitting next to him, he's feeling very bitchin'
He and Debbie are also mesmerized by the Wolfman
(
) Floyd,  love you, Floyd
Is this you, Floyd
cannot look on thee, love took my hand
and smiling did reply, who made the eyes but
Floyd, reach out and touch my soul
' '51 Even Curt has to laugh at the Wolfman--despite his situation
Little Carlos sits in the front seat and looks over at Joe who's driving
(
) Your party's ready, sir
You mean Floyd
Hello, is this Floyd
(
) Hello, is this Matilda
No, it ain't honey--bye
You tell her, Wolfman
He's my man
When  graduate, 'm gonna be a Wolfman
Hey, you know he broadcasts out of Mexico someplace
No, he don't
seen the station right outside of town
That's just a clearing station, man
So he can fool the cops
He blasts that thing all the way around the world
It's against the law, man
In the back seat, Ants nods in agreement
Ah, man--they'll never catch the Wolfman
Then Ants' nose starts twitching and he looks over at Curt suspiciously
Hey, man, who cut the cheese
Curt tries to smile but looks pretty guilty
Then Joe looks around from the front seat
He who smelt it, dealt it
(looking at Curt in the back) Hey, creep, scoot down
Sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know what  mean
Curt scoots down to a level even with Ants
Ants is staring at him and grinning evilly
Then they hear an incredible roar, and they all turn to see Bob Falfa's black '55 Chevy pass by
Falfa has a new girl with him this time, a lovely redhead
There's that badass Chevy again
Look at he snatch he's got with him
Hey, man, he looks like a whimp
Curt nods and tries to join in
Probably is
Whimps get all the snatch
Carlos and Ants look at him
Like nobody asked him to open his mouth
Milner ain't gonna beat that
His time has come
He's getting old
He ain't as fast as he used to be
Milner may not be as fast a he used to be--and having a little teeny-bopper with him isn't helping matters
He looks over at Carol
She's moved closer to him
You got two seconds to get your ass over in the corner
Don't worry,  won't rape you
Carol slides back to her side
But as they glide along, Carol watches John
She's moon-eyed and flipped over him
John deftly down-shifts as he approaches a light and then accelerates through the gears with a "race" expertise
There's a honk and John and Carol look over to see a '60 Cadillac full of girls laughing at them
You got a bitchin' car
John nods modestly
In fact, we're gonna give you our special prize for having the neatest car around
You want me to give it to you
If the prize is you, honey, 'm a ready Teddy
Yeah, well get bent turkey
The girl suddenly launches a water balloon, which John ducks deftly, the tumescent missile catching Carol full in the face
The girls roar off
John cracks up as Carol blinks away the water, not believing what's happened
She wipes her face
All right, very funny
What a chop
Ha ha
Quit laughing
John tries to control himself, but can't
Let's catch 'em at the light
Then you jump out and flatten their tires
Hey, wait a-- Just do what  say
Yezz, bozz
Carol jumps out of the car as John stops the car in the right hand lane next to the Cadillac
As Chuck Berry wails "Johnny Goode," they go into action
The girls in the Cadillac recognize John as one of their victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors
John starts pulling the stems from the front tires, sinking the car
Carol starts around the car with the shaving cream, spraying all their windows with the foamy lather
Carol is having a great time and John is laughing as they continue their guerrilla attack
They finish and jump back in the coupe
The light turns green and John takes off, leaving the Cadillac stranded at the intersection, covered with shaving cream
Traffic begins to back up
horns begin to honk
--' '58 The crickets chirp under the full moon
We hear " Only Have Eyes for You" playing as the Chevy slowly comes to a stop in an isolated spot along the irrigation canal
Terry gets out of the car, pops the top off two cokes and pours half of them into the canal
He hums, refilling them with bourbon
He goes back to the car
Tootie fruiti all ruti
It's Super Cola
He hands her one of the bottles and takes a long drink out of the other
He grabs the steering wheel for support and his eyes begin to water
It's a
a little
strong,  think
(drinking) It's the living end
Terry takes a smaller sip this time
Yeaah,  guess it wasn't mixed
Wow, it's pretty tonight
It's a perfect night to go horseback riding-- was going with a guy once who had a horse
Terry chokes
Oh yeah
used to have a couple of horses myself
Really
used them for hunting
do a lot of hunting
Deer mostly, although got a couple of bear last year
Yep, they were good ponies--hunting ponies
had to train 'em special, you know
Do you still have 'em
We could go for a ride
No,  had to sell 'em
To get these wheels
and a jeep
also have a jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive
It's got a gun rack
And  use that for hunting mostly
Why do you kill little animals think that's terrible
Oh, well, yeah,  figure with bears, though, it's either me or them
You know,  think you're really neat
He suddenly grabs at her, putting his arms around her
She's caught off-guard and tries to move away
Wait a second
Terry immediately lets go of her
Oh, jeez, 'm sorry
don't know what got into me-- didn't mean to-- maybe it's the booze or something
She puts her coke on the floor
She unfastens the chain holding her sweater together and takes it off
There--now
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself
She kisses him madly
At first he's surprised, but then gets the hang of it
They begin to neck passionately, encountering many obstacles in the cramped front seat
Ow--you pinched me
'm sorry
Let me get my head over here--okay, now you get up-- Ow--my leg, my leg
Ow, watch it
Ummm,  just love tuck 'n roll upholstery
As they roll around, a couple of guys walk by the car laughing
Terry manages to sit up and watches them go off into the night
Geez, it's like Grand Central Station around here
Why don't we go someplace else
Debbie pulls him back down on top of her
Nah, come on
They won't come back
Wait a minute
got a blanket in the back
Why don't we go over into the field
All right
Okay
They both get out of the car
Terry gets the blanket out of the trunk
They walk along a path next to the moonlit canal
Debbie carries their drinks for them
They left the radio on and Wolfman's voice can be heard as he takes another call
(
) Hello
(
) Yeah
How old are you
'm thirteen, how old are you
'm only fourteen
Oh, boy,  love you, Wolfman
(singing over) "Wolfman Jack
" Oh, now we gonna do the weather for all the valleys and the mountain tops
Gonna be hot
about 200 degrees in Merced, 400 degrees out in Fresno, and  know we're gonna have about 500 degrees up around the valley somewhere
You got the Wolfman Jack Show
As the Silhouettes yip-yip-yip-yip into "Get a Job," we see the mysterious white Thunderbirds cruise by and disappear
The Pharoahs' Mercury turns into the parking lot of a a miniature golf course
The doors open and the Pharoahs exit
There's a pause, then Ants reaches into the car and pulls Curt out also
The Pharoahs saunter into the miniature golf compound
Hey, terrific,  love miniature golf
hate it
Well,  don't play that often really
Ah--what're we doing here then
We're outta gas
They don't sell gas here
No
but we're outta money, too
Come on, Carl
Curt
Joe gives Curt a gentle push and they go inside
The golf course is empty, except for a couple of ugly girls putting around in the far corner
Under a trellis, Curt and Joe enter as the Pharoahs fool around with the candy machine, pinball games, "Check Your Weight," and "Air Corps Gunner" games, pretending to play with them
Joe looks around, whistling again
All right, men
Quickly the Pharoahs go into action, jimmying locks, pounding coin returns, pulling out plugs, prying open change boxes and stuffing looses coins into their pockets
Joe smiles at Curt, who looks sick again, involved now in a robbery
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts
Ants starts bouncing up and down looking dumber than usual
He swears at Rocket to the Moon under his breath--suddenly a screen door slams
The Pharoahs turn
man in an undershirt stands by the "Get Your Balls Here" booth, regarding them warily
What're you punks doing
The Pharoahs can't think of anything right away
Ants bounces noisily in the "Rocket to the Moon
" The Pharoahs are all looking to Joe for guidance
Joe for his part is mumbling
Hey, hi
Mr
Gordon, what's up
The man looks at Curt, surprised
Henderson--Curt Henderson
You with these punks
The Pharoahs don't know what's happening yet
Curt walks over to Mr
Gordon
These are my friends
We were just
Mr
Gordon looks skeptical, then Curt smiles at him
Then Mr
Gordon smiles
Jeez, you guys had me scared
He laughs nervously
The Pharoahs laugh
Everybody's happy
Hey, you haven't left yet
Oh ah--no--no, 'm not-- Mr
Gordon looks puzzled
mean, 'm not leaving until tomorrow
Tomorrow
Well, listen, Hank Anderson's inside
Come in and say goodbye
You know, Hank's the one that brought your name up on the floor of the Moose Hall
You got the check, didn't you
He leads Curt toward the screen door
Curt looks around at the Pharoahs, who are slowly starting to work again pilfering the machines
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder
We are all proud of you, Curt
The Moose Scholarship couldn't have gone to a better boy
And if there's anything we can do, let us know
Yeah, you'll stay in touch by letter, won't you
There's a knock at the screen and they turn to see Joe at the screen door
Hey, we're all done out here
All done
What--what's he mean
Ah, he means, we're all done having loads of fun out here
Oh, well
Wonderful
You can have all the fun you want
This place is for fun
Yes
Yes, it is
Thank you
Thank you both
Good luck now
Before  say goodbye, Curt,  want to tell you  hope you'll be taking along with you a little piece of this place
think  have
Good
Don't forget us
No,  won't forget you and you won't forget me
Okay
'Bye
Good-bye and good luck
'Bye
It was nice to meet yuh
Right
What he said goes for me, too
Curt and Joe go out through the arcade toward the Mercury
They start walking faster, anxious to get away
Joe grins at Curt as they climb into the car
Yeah, you just might make it as a Pharoah yet, boy
Back in the office, Hank and Mr
Gordon watch the car pull out
Some day he'll make a fine Moose
Steve's Chevy sits near the canal
The door is open and the radio blares, while Terry and Debbie are off somewhere in the weeds making out
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk
Feet approach the car as the light beam moves across the interior and stops on the vacated shoes on the front seat
The light beam continues past the empty bourbon bottle and starts int he direction of the field where Terry and Debbie are lost in the throes of passionate love
As we follow the light into the field we hear footsteps
As the darkened figure approaches the couple, we see the light go out and catch a gleam of silver in the moonlight as a switchblade springs open
Terry reacts to the sound
What's wrong
thought  heard something
She kisses him and he forgets about the noise
The figure retreats back to the Chevy, where another indistinct figure waits
(
) They're porking in the weeds
No sweat
Terry and Debbie are resting in the field, listening to the radio in the distance
car engine is heard starting up and disappearing down the canal bank
The countryside is very quiet
Only crickets and frogs are heard as Terry begins to drop off asleep
He suddenly jumps with a start
Wait a minute
What
The radio is gone
That means--the car is gone
He scrambles to the spot where the Chevy once stood
Oh no
Debbie comes up and watches Terry look heavenward
Oh God--'m sorry
But, why the car
You could have struck us with lightning or something--anything--- but not the car
--' '58 Cars are seen here and there in the moonlight along the irrigation canal outside of town
In the cars radios are playing "To the Aisle," laughter can be heard in some, whispering in others
Laurie's Edsel is parked by the slow-moving water
In the front seat of the car, Steve and Laurie are making out
Laurie leans back against Steve, his arms around her, and they look out the window at the stars
You know, it doesn't make sense to leave home to look for a home, to give up a life to find a new life, to say goodbye to friends you love just to find new friends
What
Say that again,  didn't-- That's what Curt said
Oh, figures
(smiling) You must've talked his ear off trying to get him to stay
That's not true
didn't say anything
Curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry
He thought he should take it easy for a while, go to
and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life
That sounds logical
Laurie's expression changes
You think so
Sure
think Curt's probably right for Curt
Not for me though
Laurie, look at me
Now you know what  want out of life
And it's just not in this town
'm not going to the airport tomorrow
She looks sullen and he smiles a little
He turns her around and gently kisses here
They begin to make out, Laurie seeming a little desperate
Steve pushes her slowly down on the seat
He moves on top of here and his hand begins to wander
Steve
Don't
(quietly) It's our last night together for three months
come on
We've been through this before
'm going to miss you so much need something to remember you by
You don't want me to forget you
She closes her eyes, trying not to cry
(softly) No
He starts to move on top of her, kissing her neck
She struggles for a few moments, then goes limp, not responding
He pulls away angrily
What's wrong
You're just lying there
Well go ahead, you want to
Not like that
If you're not going to remember me for anything else, why don't you go ahead
You want it and you know it
Don't be so damn self-righteous with me
After those things you told me about watching your brother-- You're disgusting
Get out of my car
told you never-- 'm sorry
Get out
It's not worth it
don't care if you're leaving--now get out
She reaches past him and pulls the door handle
The door swings open and she shoves Steve out
Then she starts the engine and drives away, leaving Steve standing there in the darkness
In the distance, he hears the laughter of other couples and the drifting music from their radios
Terry and Debbie walk slowly along the dark canal
Terry takes a large slug of his bourbon and coke
Anyway, the Goat Killer-- Let's talk about something else
--Whenever he strikes, he leaves a bloody goat's head near the victim
Isn't that creepy
Terry thinks about it and indeed it is
He looks around into the darkness and then takes Debbie's hand
They thought he went up to Stockton, but two nights ago they found Carlie Johnson and Don White right here by the canal all hacked to pieces and-- Who do you think'll take the regionals this-- --not only were there bloody goats' heads, but he had switched all the parts of their bodies around
You know putting her arms on him and his legs on-- Terry is slowing and he stops her
He motions for her to shut up and they listen
The wind whines across the flat valley
Ahead there is only darkness, then footsteps
Wait a second
Did you hear
You think it's the Goat Killer
(whispering) No
mean, no
Listen, 'll go for help, you stay here
Terry has turned and is starting off when she grabs him by his shirt-tail
Come on, we'll hide in the field
She takes Terry's hand and they go off behind some bushes, away from the black water
Debbie looks through the bushes, squinting
Maybe if it's the Goat Killer he'll get somebody and we'll see the whole thing
Terry stands with his eyes closed
don't want to see the whole thing
Especially if it's us he--oh, why me
'm going to look lousy with your legs and a goat's head and-- Shhh--he's stopped
can't see him very-- think he's coming this way
She edges off to get a better view
Well, as long as he's not--Debbie
Debbie
She's gone
Terry starts off, taking one step, turns, takes another, turns, takes another
Suddenly Terry hears something behind him
He turns very slowly and looks
figure is standing right behind him, silhouetted by the moon, its face obscured
Terry jumps about three feet and yells
(
) Terry
Who, me
Why me
Terry stops yelling, seeing that it's Steve
Terry
Steve
Debbie comes back through the bushes and Terry looks at her nervously
Where'd you go, anyway
Over there
Well, don't go off again
Come on, let's get out of here
Terry and Debbie start to walk with Steve back toward town
Terry keeps taking pulls from the bottle of bourbon
What're you doing out here
Hey, where's my rod
(choking) Um, oh, did  introduce you
This is Debbie
Debbie, this is Steve
Hello
Hi
Hi
They continue to walk along the dark canal bank
Well, what about my car
Um
'ts in the garage
put it in the garage for safe keeping mean
don't want to take any chances with it
Oh, great
Yeah
Yeah
It's a good thing too
'Cause somebody stole our car
Really
That's terrible
What kind was it
Gee, ah, where's Laurie, anyway
guess we broke up
You broke up
Bull
Steve just shrugs
The three of them go off into the darkness
-'32 The coupe makes an eccentric swerve as it cruises along the main drag
Inside, Carol is looking at the gear-shift knob that she's taken off the shift arm as they listen to "Do You Want to Dance
" It doesn't look like a gear shift knob
Come on, will ya
Give it back to me
Well, go ahead, cream me
What's wrong, you're a tough guy
Break my arm, see if  care
Forget it
He ignores her, and finally his silence makes her take a small round knob out of her pocket and put it back on the shifter where it belongs
was just going to keep it for a little while
You're an ogre, just like my father
He won't let me play records, or stay out late, or anything
(worried) He ah--doesn't like you to stay out late
No--he's terrible
Once  was at a party that didn't end till late and he called the cops
Can you imagine
It was only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force-- Say, where do you live anyway
Over on Ramona, why
(She suddenly smiles) Oh no
Uh uh
You thought 'd tell you where--not me, not old Carol
The night is young and 'm not hitting the rack until  get a little action
John sighs, wondering if he'll ever get rid of her
He looks back at something in the rear view mirror
He speeds up and checks the mirror again
What do you keep lookin' at
(she looks around behind them) Who's that
You know him
He's following awful close
Grab onto something
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash
John suddenly hits the brakes
The deuce coupe noses down and Bob Falfa's Chevy has to swerve abruptly to avoid a crash
Falfa pulls the Chevy around and alongside the coupe
He has another new girl with him
(shouting over) Sorry if  scared ya, man
(looking ahead) Takes more than that to scare me
Where ya been hiding
Didn't anyone tell ya  been looking for ya
Hey,  can't keep tracka all the punks lookin' for me
They say you're the fastest thing in the Valley
But that can't be your car, man
That must be your mama's car
Hell,  feel embarrassed just getting near ya
Ya should, man--you're driving a field car
Field car
What's a Field Car
Field Cars drive through the fields, dropping cow shit all over the place to make the lettuce grow
(laughing) That's pretty good
Hey,  like that paint job you got
What they call that--sorta a cross between Piss Yellow and Puke Green, ain't it
Yeah, well, you're car's so ugly you must have to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas
Well, at least  don't have to move over to let a funeral go by, man
Through all the insults, Carol has been cracking up
(shouting) Your car's uglier than  am
John and Falfa both look at her and she sits back
That didn't come out right
They both stop at a light now
Falfa roars his engine
Come on, boy, prove it
Let's go
Look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me
Oh, race him, you can beat him
John gives Carol a very fierce look and she sinks back into her corner
Hey, that's a tough lookin' girl you got with you, man
What're you doin'
Trying to pick up a few extra bucks babysitting
(grinning at Carol) Hey, Doll
Why don't you come on and ride with me--in about ten years
Leave her out of this
This is just between you and me
Falfa revs his engine again
John thinks a moment, then shifts down into first
The light changes, and John and Falfa take off, tires screaming
The two cars perfectly in sync, rocket down the block toward the next red light
John starts to slow for the light
Falfa looks over, laughs, and runs the red light
John stops
Wow
He's really fast, isn't he
Yeah
But he's stupid
10TH -' '51 Curt is still out riding with the Pharoahs
He seems a little easier with them now, after their successful heist at the miniature golf course
The radio is playing "Party Doll
" Hey--any of you guys know a blonde in a white -Bird
Yeah,  seen her, what about it
was just wondering who she is
She's outta your price range, man
My brother's been with her and he clued me in
Price range
You mean she's a-- Yeah, Thirty Dollar Sheri
Can you believe that
Thirty dollars
We must be thinking of different blondes
Hey man, don't tell Joe what he thinks
Thirty dollars ain't much
saw ten thousand once
My old man had it in a suitcase
They caught him the next morning though
Fuzz ahead, watch it
Where
Fuzz ahead, watch it
Where
At Jerrie's Cherries
You can just barely see the fender
That's rotten, man
Hiding like that
That's shitty
It's dishonest
Ants gives him the evil eye
Joe watches the cop car in the used car lot as they pass it
We oughta do something
got an idea
got a good idea
Steve, Terry and Debbie have made it back into town from the canal
They walk past the closed stores and stop on a busy corner
think 'm gonna go over to Burger City
Yeah
Yeah
Laurie's probably over there
You really think she's got me worried about where she is, don't you
Well
Let me tell you something
couldn't care less
Want to come along
Yeah,  do
do
No
Make up your minds
No, thanks
'mm
You know we got to report the car missing
All right
See yuh
Yeah
See yuh
Steve goes off and Debbie looks at Terry
Why can't we go to Burger City
Burger City
Burger City
How can you think of hamburgers when somebody stole my car
She looks hurt and starts off
'  - Curt is getting out of the low-slung Merc and Joe saunters around from the driver's side
He smiles, friendly like-- Listen, ah--Carl, -- Curt
Curt
He nods at Curt, looking cautiously around the dark lot
Despite you scratching Gil's car, like you
And  know what you'd like more than anything right now
Like every guy in town, you got the same secret dream, right
Curt nods
Ya want to join the Pharoahs
Huh
You can admit it--you'd like to--but you never dreamed it could be possible, did you
Curt shakes his head slowly
Well, tonight, 'm goin' to give you your chance
Curt hasn't the slightest idea what Joe is talking about
Joe puts his arm around Curt's shoulders and leads him away, explaining what he has to do, while Ants and Carlos grin
In the middle of the used car lot, a patrol car hides among the autos for sale
Inside the car, Holstein sits with another officer who's dozing
Across Holstein's dark glasses, reflections of the kids' cars cruising by can be seen, as Holstein waits to nab somebody
Joe approaches the patrol car through the lot
He ducks, carrying a length of metal cable in his hand
Curt wanders behind him
Joe sees him and motions for him to get down
Get down
Curt ducks down near Joe
Okay
Now you got it
'm stayin' here
You're on your own
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Joe
What if he hears me
Shhh
Listen
Look at it this way: Now you got three choices
One, you chicken out
In that case,  let Ants tie you to the car and drag you around a little bit
And you don't want that, right
No
Two, you foul up and Holstein hears you and well, ah
you don't want that, right
No,  don't
Three, you are successful and you join the Pharoahs with a carcoat, and the blood initiation and all that, huh
(seeing Joe walk away) Wait--wait a minute
Wait a minute
What blood initiation
(
) Oh, here we go baby
Here's "Come Go With Me
" The policeman waits for a victim
In the background, we see Curt dodging from behind one car to another
Taking cover, Curt makes another break toward a car--and trips and falls
In the cop car, Holstein thinks he hears something
He opens the door and gets out
Adjusting his billy club, he paces around the used car lot officiously, while Curt hides behind a Falcon and peeks out from behind a fender
He sees Holstein walking back toward the squad car
The cop opens the door again and climbs in
The echoing sound of the calls coming over the police radio blend with the Wolfman's howling as cars pass with their radios blaring
Curt is inching forward with the cable, toward the squad car
In the background, a slow freight train can be heard starting to move across the valley
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable
Underneath the car, Curt inches on his back and then reaches up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car
Terry and Debbie are walking across the street, Terry looks miserable and disconsolate about the loss of the Chevy he possessed for three short hours
Debbie tries to be more positive about the situation
Hey, why don't we go get your jeep
What
What are you talking about
You know, your jeep
The one you sold the hunting ponies for
The one with the four-wheel drive
Terry just stares at her morosely
He stops by a parking meter and sinks down on top of it
Come on, Terry--Terry
' Curt and Joe are on the run toward the Merc
Ants and Carlos jump in as they start their getaway
Hey, you sure you got enough slack
Yeah, yeah
No sweat
Let's get out of here
Joe shifts into high gear and is flying down the main drag
Terry and Debbie look startled as they see the Pharoah's Mercury roaring by--and Curt leaning out the door, shouting insanely
Stand by for Justice
Terry and Debbie watch the Merc speed suicidally past Jerry's Cherries Used-Car Lot
Holstein spots them and the driver starts up the engine of the squad car
THe red lights start flashing and the siren wails
The patrol car shifts into gear and leaps forward
Suddenly, there's a horrendous metallic screech, the patrol car hurtles up and out, airborne for a moment--then noses down and bounces along the pavement, sending out sparks as it slides to a stop
The driver is stunned and frozen to the wheel
Holstein manages to remove his dark glasses and looks back
There, sitting quietly in the middle of the parking lot, is their trans-axle and two rear wheels
The patrol car sits on the ground at a twenty degree angle, while its engine whines impotently at top speed
On the radio, the all-seeing Wolfman gives an evil laugh-- (
) Oh,  can't believe it
Feels so good 'cause you're sweet sixteen
And Johnny Burnette takes his cue and croons into "You're Sixteen
" -- John has glided off the main drag and into a residential area
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night
John pulls the coupe to the curb and turns off the engine
He turns out the lights
Inside the car, there's silence
Only the clock ticking
Carol looks over at John a little nervously
Why are we stopping here
John looks at her and his arm slides along the back of the seat above her
She notices his arm and the fact that he's moving slowly toward her
(in a husky voice) Carol
What
-- don't think that  can control myself any longer
You can't
No
Carol, 've got to have you
Me
He touches her hair and she slouches back into her corner fearfully
All night you've been sitting there and you've been so sexy and it's been so hot--and  can't wait any more
Well--well, a lot of that's an act, you know
Like
like my crying
It was just an act
Well, it's been building up inside of me like a volcano, all night
Maybe if  knew where you lived could fight it-- could take you home--but since you won't tell me, and since here we are--'ve got to have you
It's too late-- It's not too late
It's never too late
231 Ramona--two three one-- (smiling) Two three one-- 'll show you
It's easy to find
John starts the car engine
Carol looks very relieved
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street
' - Steve sits in the almost empty cafe section of Burger City
He stirs a coffee and mulls over the night's events in his mind
door opens and Budda Macrae comes in
She watches him a moment, then takes off her little Bell Boy Cap and gets a cup of coffee for herself
Steve looks up as she comes over on her roller skates
Hi
You mind if  sit down
Hi Budda
No, have a seat
got five minutes outa the rat race, and  saw you all alone
For a change
She drinks her coffee and he looks out the window thinking about something else
Where's Laurie
don't know
thought the two of you'd be going strong, this being your last night and everything-- We broke up
Budda looks surprised
No big deal
Wow
what happened
Nothing
We were out at the canal and
we had a fight
Budda smiles and he looks at her strangely
What's so funny
Nothing
Just thinking
girl like Laurie-- mean, she goes to school and is cute and popular and all, but we're not so different
We know what we want
've seen her after you for two years now
She's not like that
Maybe not
She does have a different approach
Hers is "Never surrender," me  lay down my arms at the drop of a hat-- (
) Budda, you got an hour left, let's get on it
(yelling back) All right, relax
old fart
Listen, 'm off in an hour
If you wanta come over, my girlfriend's away for the weekend
don't know
Laurie walks up the drive-in and is about to enter when she stops and watches Steve and Budda
She thinks about going in, then hesitates, watching them
Why don't you
never got a chance to talk to you
You're leaving tomorrow
Listen,  gave up a long time ago, so it'd be just for fun
No problems
She smiles at him and he smiles back a little
At the door, Laurie turns and leaves before Steven sees her
'll see ya later then
She gets up and goes back to the counter on her skates
Steve thinks a moment and gets up also
Budda, Budda wait
She turns and he comes over to her as she puts back on her little cap
gotta get up early and-- just don't think it'd work out
She's got you so brainwashed--well, hell
Some day 'm gonna win
Don't ya think
Sure
She smiles briefly, then turns and leaves
Steve watches her go
' - The drive-in remains a raucous roar: Cars coming in from the hop, from the movies, other cars going out to the canal or back out to cruise
Only the car hops, who have developed a late-hour, harried look, suggest it's nearly closing time
The Pharoahs arrive
The Mercury swings imperiously into the lot
The radio can be heard as the rumbling engine dies
The Clovers are singing "Love Potion #9
" Curt jumps out of the Mercury elated
The Pharoahs all climb out and circle him, punching him playfully
Joe holds him while Carlos tickles him and they all laugh
Oh mother, it's been a glorious night
That was the bitchinest thing  ever seen in my whole life
seen a little kid attacked by pigs once, but this was even better
Oh boy, 'll tell you something, that car must've jumped five feet in the air
Curt nods, feeling pretty good
You sure you got to go
The night's young
Yeah, there's some things  got to do
still want to find that blonde
think she was an optical delusion, man
Psychology-wise it ain't good to dwell on it
You'll alter your ego or something
Anyway, catch ya tomorrow night
Yeah,  guess so
Guess so
Man, we don't admit a lot of guys to the Pharoahs
You understand we're going to have to swipe your jacket and all--you gotta make up your mind
Curt nods, thinking about it
Then he shrugs
He looks at the three Pharoahs as they climb back into their maroon chariot
Hey--'ll see you guys
Sure--listen, remember, Rome wasn't buried in a night
Joe laughs and Curt nods
He watches the Mercury pull out and then he wanders back across the drive-in toward his little Citroen
(
) My, my, my
You only got five minutes left, if you want to talk to the Wolfman
Gonna make all your dreams come true, baby
Curt gets into the little car and sits listening to the radio
The neon ' - is reflected across the windshield
(
) Wolfman
Yeah
Would you dedicate a record to keep me and my girlfriend together
Are you separated
Well, see, we're havin' a little problem
'll bring you right together
Hold on a minute, man
Hi ya, hi ya, hi, hi, hi
Everything's gonna be all right now, man, you understand
Now, let me play the record for you
As the Wolfman talks on, Curt glances toward the street
He sees the white Thunderbird gliding by
He sits up quickly and tries to start the Citroen--but the machine barely turns over
He keeps trying desperately, but the engine won't catch
--'58 Laurie drives slowly, alone in the Edsel
On the radio, the Skyliners are lamenting the sad state of things--"Since Don't Have You
" Laurie wipes her eyes, crying with the music
horn honks
She looks over to see Bob Falfa's car pacing her
He's alone now and grinning at her
Laurie ignores him
They drive along further
Falfa roars his engine, but she still doesn't give him any attention
He gives up and pulls off
Laurie thinks a while, pouting
She pulls alongside Falfa at the next light
He isn't looking at her
She toots her horn and he turns
Laurie motions him to pull over
Falfa looks surprised
The light changes, and he follows her to the curb
Laurie takes a deep breath, and with a determined look, gets out and walks back to his car
She gets in and closes the door
They start off
He looks over and smiles
Hey Hey Hey, baby, what do you say
Just don't say anything and we'll get along fine
Falfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air
He glances at her then back at the road, wondering about this strange chick
-- The coupe slows in front of a modest California ranch-style home
John stops the car and turns off the engine
He looks over at Carol, who seems lost in thought
This the first time you've been quiet all night
had fun
Goodbye
She sits for a moment, about to say something
Do you like me
Yeah
like you
You're all right
But  mean, do you like me
, ah
like you
Okay
Couldn't  have something to remember you by
John gives in to her sweet gaze
He takes off the gearshift knob, gives it to her, and leans over and gives her a kiss
'Bye, kid
Gee, thanks
It's just like a ring or something
Yeah
It's like we were going steady
Wait'll  tell Marcia
Wait a minute, now
Wait'll  tell everybody
Don't go overboard with this thing
Well, 'll see you around
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house
He watches her stop at the screen door and turn
She gives him a little wave, then goes inside
John looks over at the empty seat next to him and seems a little sad
He starts the engine and drives off slowly
(
) haven't cried so much
And the tears and everything, man
leaned down towards the microphone and almost shorted myself out
' - Curt has the font hood up on the beetle-like Citroen and is fooling with the recalcitrant engine
Steve is standing beside him
Hold that up
(taking the hood from him) 've been thinking--maybe you're right
Why should  leave home to find a new home
Why should  leave friends that  love to find new friends
Wait a minute, wait a minute
've heard this already
Aren't you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime
realize that
realize-- No--no realizing
You've been telling me all summer that it's time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there
Gimme this thing
(letting him close the hood) don't know---- (banging the Citroen hood shut) feel like a mid-wife
guess  was wrong
may have been wrong
Wrong nothing
You've been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks
And now--goddamnit
-- you're just--you're just mentally playing with yourself
If you can just relax, we'll talk about it at the airport
Curt walks around the side of the car and opens the door
Where are you going
It's awfully early in the morning
have a dental appointment
Come on, Curt
Just relax, wil ya
'll see you at the airport
Curt gets into the car and starts the engine
Steve watches him pull out of the drive-in, then walks off
"  " half dozen people are standing around in the parking lot behind the bar
Debbie is sitting on the hood of a car, swinging her legs and chewing gum
The people all seem to be watching something on the ground behind the car
Coughing is heard, then gagging, and the unmistakable sounds of someone being sick
At the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and pointing
We hear more coughing and vomiting
guy slides up on the hood next to Debbie
never seen a guy lose so much
He mustn't have been used to drinking
Oh no, he really likes to drink
He told me
An old man looks at his watch and then up at the stars
Gettin' late
knew a man once who got this sick
Billy Webber
That was ten years ago
What do you think that was there, that he had for dinner
More groaning and gaggin is heard
An old woman moves close to the old man and he puts an arm around her sentimentally
Staying on his hands and knees like that
(she grins) He looks like a dog, doesn't he
Looks like old Ginger
Sicker than a dog, that's for sure
The people drift off, leaving Debbie sitting alone on the car
Now, Terry slowly emerges, pulling himself up the hood of the car
His face is white
He lies across the hood trying to catch his breath
Ohh rats,  feel like-- (he notices a car nearby and pushes himself up) Wait a second
hey
He staggers across the lot toward Steve's Chevy
Debbie slides off the car and follows him
It's--oh my god--it looks like Steve's car
Look, right here under our-- it's my car
My car
We found it
Look
Terry staggers around and looks for the keys
He searches under the front seat and over the visor
Must've taken the keys with them
Maybe we oughta call the police
Never get here in time
got a better idea
We'll just steal it back
See if you can find some wire around
We only need a foot to hot-wire it
okay
-- John pulls the coupe out of the garage and wheels up to the pumps of the gas station
An attendant nods, looking at the roaring engine
Took the header plugs off
Expectin' some action
John looks at him from inside the coupe and nods slowly
Yeah
Think so
There's some punk lookin' for me
Why the hell do they bother
You've been number one as long as  can remember
Yeah
it's been a long time, ain't it
'll see ya
Thanks
John drives the car out of the station and screeches down the street
"  " --' '58 Terry is fiddling around under the dashboard, trying to hot- wire the Chevy
As the wires connect, the radio comes to life and the Wolfman growls
(
) Who is this on the Wolfman telephone
There's the sound of a phone ringing, then the unmistakable voice of the Big Bopper answering
(
) Hellooo, baaaby-- Just then, Terry looks up and sees one large badass looking at him
Terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing nearby
The first badass reaches in and grabs Terry by the shirt
He pulls him from the car
Terry is smiling weakly
Ah, hi--this is my car
What  mean is, somebody stole my car-- mean lost my car and  want to thank you two guys for-- The first badass shoves Terry toward the other badass
--for returning-- mean finding it
mean, listen now, listen guys-- 've been sick recently, and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy
Now, easy will you
Easy
They throw him back and forth and start to rough him up seriously
Debbie is running around helplessly while they pummel Terry
Then, she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing
John glances out his window and notices the fight behind the Come On Inn
He punches it and wheels into a fast -turn
The hoods have quit playing with Terry and are punching him
Terry's still on his feet, mostly because he's drunk and staggering away from a lot of the blows; also, Debbie is screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Help
Police
You creeps
John jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking lot
He grabs one of the punks and turns him--smashing him in the face
The punk lands on his ass
John starts circling the other
Go, John
Hit him
good fighter, John lands a couple of blows to the gut and lands him on his can
Both of them crawl off
Terry is lying nearby, drunk, sick and bloodied
Debbie holds his head in her lap
John goes over and kneels by them
Hey, man, you all right
Yeah
'll die soon and it'll all be over
(looking at John) Wow--you're just like the Lone Ranger
(eyeing Debbie) Yeah
Listen, are you with the Toad, or were you with them
Terry manages to raise his head
You're talking to the woman  love
His head falls back again
What happened, man
Terry opens his mouth to start to explain, but it's too hard
He can only moan
' - The drive-in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour approaches and passes
The die-hards and the hard-ups are still wheeling through Mel's looking for remains of any action
Steve sits inside in a booth
Two gossipy looking girls come in smiling and slide into the booth across from him
Hi, Karen, Judy
Hi, Steve
Have you seen Laurie lately
Steve shakes his head no
Well, we have
(already annoyed) Oh yeah
So what
So nothing
She was just with a really cute guy in a boss car
We wondered who he was
wouldn't know
We do
His name's Bob Falfa
The name registers with Steve
Terry and Debbie pull into the drive-in and park
Terry, his face swelling, groans as he leans toward the intercom
Help
mean,  want two cherry cokes with lots of ice
Never mind, forget the cokes, just bring the ice, pronto
The intercom repeats his order in a foreign language and suddenly Steve arrives and opens the door
Out
What
need the car--now
Terry gets out and Debbie gets out her side
Steve gets in
What's going on
'm about to find out
Steve roars out of the drive-in, leaving Terry and Debbie standing in an empty space
don't believe it
You practically get killed trying to get your car back, then you let him have it
Terry looks at her, his eye swollen, his lip ballooning, his glasses broken
Finally, he gives up--it's not worth the trouble any longer
It's not my car
What
What
Well, where is your car
Terry is upset now
'
You don't--no car at all
What about your jeep
Terry shakes his head
No car
well, how am  going to get home
Just then the car hop approaches with the two cokes on two trays
Where's your car
gotta hook 'em to your car
Terry shrugs, standing in the empty stall, the carhop with the trays and Debbie watching
There's a low rumbling sound and the girls turn as John's deuce coupe glides into the stall next to them
Terry shuffles toward John's car, a defeated man
Terry leans against John's car and John looks out the window at him
What's wrong, Toad
You lose the car again
(softly) No
Steve took it
(
) It's a shame, Baby
'll tell yuh
Got to take it easy when you're drivin' that car of yours
You got to cruise easy, baby
Don't be doin' any accidents or anything on me
And the radio plays "Cryin' in the Chapel
" John smiles and gets out of the car
He goes and opens his hood, making a last-minute check on something
Terry sits down gently on a curb by John
Debbie has been talking with some other boys
Eventually she wanders up slowly and looks at Terry
He looks up at her, then away, disgraced and embarrassed
She sits down by him and they're silent
You know,  had a pretty good time tonight
Oh come on, you're just-- No, no, really
really had a good time
mean, you picked me up and we got some hard stuff and saw a hold-up, and then we went to the Canal, you got your car stolen, and then  got to watch you gettin' sick, and then you got in this really bitchin' fight
really had a good time
Terry looks at her, starting to regain a little cool
You think so
Yeah--well  guess have pretty much fun every night
Anyway if you're not doing anything tomorrow night, why don't you come over
Yeah--well,  might be busy, you know
But we could--well,  got a little Vespa  just play around with
Really
Why that's almost a motorcycle
And  just love motorcycles
He feels his swollen lip and she touches it
Then she leans over and kisses him
got to go
Ow
Goodnight
See ya
She smiles, walks off, swinging her purse
She looks over her shoulder and smiles
He smiles back
-- The little Citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road, winding its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape vineyards
Curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, the radio increases in volume and he turns it down
Then it begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more powerful
Then Curt sees it
He stops the car and gets out
He stands looking at an isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight
Curt looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the stars, its black wires humming in the stillness
Curt starts up the gravel walk to the door
Under the glare of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays soft Rock and Roll
He hesitates, then pushes a buzzer
He pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom
(
) Yeah, who is it
It's-- want to talk to the Wolfman
The Wolfman ain't here
know, but  got to get in touch with him
got something to give him before-- We don't take no deliveries after eight
Come back tomorrow
No,  can't
want to ask him something that-- Dedications by phone is Diamond 75044
Wolfman Top 40 is Box 13, Chula Vista
Wolfman Sweatshirts is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfield
'Bye
Listen,  got a right to talk to him
listened to him every night for as long--for twelve years almost
know him and it's personal and it'll only take a minute and  bet Wolfman would be upset if he knew a friend couldn't get in touch with-- buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch
Curt pushes it open slowly--no one is there
little scared, he goes inside and closes the door
Curt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor, passing strangely lit rooms with electronic generators, humming dynamos and glassed-off booths filled with flashing electronic apparatus
Curt goes through this other-worldly maze until he comes to a small, dimly lit control booth
figure inside is barely visible through the reflections in the double glass windows
The figure turns and walks up to the window
Curt backs off a bit
face stares at him--long hair greased in a ducktail, a short chinbeard
Then he speaks, his voice filtering strangely through a hidden speaker
What do you want
Through the window, Curt can be seen but no sound is heard
Pull the red switch
'm looking for a girl
Aren't we all
She ain't here
Come on back to the booth
Curt walks around through a few more glass doors and ends up in the booth with the manager
The manager sits down and leans back, turning a fan to blow on his large chest
He's a large, friendly looking man; he wears a Hawaiian shirt
He sucks on a popsicle
Curt stands awkwardly
Hey, have a popsicle
The ice box just broke down and they're meltin' all over the place
You want one
No
Thanks
Listen, ah
Have a popsicle
Are you the Wolfman
No, man
'm not the Wolfman
The manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape
He holds it up as a magician would for audience inspection, then puts it on a machine
record is about to end
As it does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues into a Wolfman howl and then the distinctive Wolfman voice takes over
The manager adjusts the monitor volume down and sucks his popsicle
(
) Who is this on the Wolfman's telephone
(
) Diane
How're you doin', Diane
All right
The station manager smiles at Curt, who is watching the tape and blinking lights of the large console
That's the Wolfman
He's on tape
The man is on tape
(
) Do you love me
Say you love me, Diane
Well, ah--where does he work
mean, where is the Wolfman now
The Wolfman is everywhere
But  got to give him this note
(taking it from Curt) Here, let me see the note
(he reads it) Hell, that's just a dedication
All gotta do is relay it
And it'll be on the air tomorrow, or Tuesday at the latest
No, no
See, this is very important
may be leaving town tomorrow, and it's very important that --damn it, that  reach this girl right now
You don't know whether you're gonna leave town or not
Well, 'm supposed to go to college back East tomorrow
And  don't know if 'm gonna go
Wait a minute
Have a popsicle
No, thank you
Sit down a minute
Curt sits down, undecided about leaving and upset about not being able to get in touch with the lovely creature he saw earlier that night
Listen, it's early in the morning
Now,  can't really talk for the Wolfman
But  think if he was here he'd tell you to get your ass in gear
Now, no offense to your home town here, but this place ain't exactly the hub of the universe, if you know what  mean
And well--'ll tell you this much--the Wolfman does come in here now and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when  hear the stories he got about the places he goes
Hell, here  sit while there's a big beautiful world out there, don't ya know
Wolfman comes in last time talking about some exotic jungle country, handing me cigars he says was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties
The Wolfman been everywhere and he seen everything
He got so many stories, so many memories
And here  sit sucking on popsicles
Curt looks at him a moment
Why don't you leave
Well, 'm no kid anymore
been here a long time
And the Wolfman-- well, the Wolfman gave me my start and he's sorta become my life can't leave him now
Gotta be loyal to the Wolfman, you understand
Curt nods and stands
The manager swivels around and punches some buttons, putting on a commercial
He turns back
tell you what
If  can possibly do it tonight, 'll try to relay this dedication and get it on the air for you later on
That'd be great
Thanks
Really
He shakes the manager's hand, then wipes it on his pants
Sorry, sticky little mothers ain't they
Bye
'Bye
Curt goes out the door
He starts back out through the maze of windows and electronic machines
Echoing throughout the rooms, the Wolfman's raucous voice follows Curt
The Wolfman howls and Curt turns
Through the maze of glass, shifting like prisms, he sees the station manager sitting by the mike--howling
Then, he laughs and howls again, starting to sing a song called "Bluebirds on My Dingaling," pounding out the rhythm on the console
Wolfman
He backs away, leaving the Wolfman, who's on his feet now, screaming out the end of the song, dancing by himself in the little glass room, from which his voice radiates out through the night and around the world
' - John is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when Falfa's Chevy drives into the parking lot
The radio is now blasting "Heart and Soul
" Terry moves over toward John's car
John doesn't look up, although he is quite aware of Falfa's entrance
Falfa slows down in front of John's car and revs his engine again
John looks up--Laurie is in the car with Falfa
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is
Hey, John, let me go with you
Come on
Naw, man
can't take you when 'm racin' somebody
Ah, come on
Just let me go
So can watch
Or, 'll flag you, okay
All right
Go ahead
Terry starts to climb into the car
John looks over at Falfa in the rumbling Chevy
Paradise Road
Falfa grins and gooses the Chevy, peeling out of Mel's Drive- in
--' '55 Falfa looks over at Laurie, who is watching the road nervously
All right now, where's this Paradise Road
You just follow this street straight out of town
Listen, if you're gonna race John Milner, you can let me out right when we get there
Why don't you shut up, baby
You ain't said one word all night long
What a weird broad
But you're gonna appreciate me soon
You're gonna be hangin' on for mercy, when  get this sucker rollin'
He accelerates the Chevy, shifting up deftly
Laurie looks scared now
10TH --' '58 Steve is cruising along the almost deserted streets looking for Laurie
-Roadster pulls up alongside and a guy shouts at Steve
You heading out to Paradise Road
Paradise Road, 'm not-- Some guy named Falfa going up against Milner
John's racing Falfa
Yeah
Figured something was up, saw them going out of town real cautious and then-- But Steve is gone
Dale looks surprised as the Chevy roars off toward Paradise Road
' ---- Curt pulls into the parking lot just as the neon sign goes out
The last cars are leaving as the drive-in shutters up for the night
Curt stops next to the lighted phone booth and sits in his car, listening to the Wolfman
(
) got a dedication here that's for a friend of the Wolfman--a special friend of the Wolfman who's leaving town tomorrow and wants me to play the next song for a blonde young lady in a Thunderbird
white - Bird, you understand
Now my friend's named Curt and he wants to talk to you out there, baby
So you meet him at Burger City, or phone Diamond 3132
Now he's a friend of mine, you hear, and, little girl, you better call him, or the Wolfman gonna get you
The Wolfman howls and Curt smiles, leaning his chin on his hand, looking around the dark drive-in, wondering about tomorrow
-- John's '32 yellow deuce coupe and Falfa's black '55 Chevy are waiting side by side on a long, straight country road, their front wheels resting on a weather-beaten starting line
The sky is getting lighter as the radio plays "Green Onions
" There are about six to eight other cars parked off the road to watch the race
Everything is quiet now, only the crickets ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing
Terry jumps out of John's car, John hands him the flashlight and he takes up a position in front of the two cars
John looks over at Falfa, who's arguing with Laurie
Hey--Laurie, what in the hell are you doing in there
Is she gonna ride with you
Mind your own business, John
Yeah, she's with me
You worry about yourself, man
Everybody ready
John settles back in the driver's seat and positions his hand on the gear-shift, which we see is wrapped with rags because of the missing knob
Both drivers start revvin' their engines; the tension builds
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on
Both cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and screaming
Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass
John beats Falfa off the line
Out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost neck and neck
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death
Falfa looks insane as he tromps it
John hits fourth at about eighty-five
Falfa does likewise-- but starts to fish-tail
Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying-- Falfa regains control nervously
Falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on John
The cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke-- John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, swimming through an unbelievable -turn and high tailing it back to the crash site
He is out of the car like a bullet, running across the dirty cloddy field
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked
Meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who jumps from his car and is running across the field
Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same time
They stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up into the trees now
Steve looks around wildly--he sees John and goes at him
You stupid sonofabitch, she was in that car
Why did you have-- He takes a couple of swings at John, who finally manages to tackle him around the waist
They both get up looking at the flaming wreckage
Then John moves around the side, crouching, trying to see past the flames--suddenly, he stands and motions to Steve to come over
They both circle the wreck
Around behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a state of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while Laurie is circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse
said  didn't--you lousy greasy jerk
You coulda killed me--what's wrong with you
You clubfoot
She beats at him, crying hysterically
Steve runs over and grabs her, pulling her away
She fights at Steve, too, not knowing what's going on
No, no, no
Please, don't come near me
No, please
think 'm gonna be sick
Oh, Steven
Laurie, please
Standing in the early light, Steve holds her
She throws her arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation ditch to watch the flaming car
Oh, Steven
Oh, Steven, please, don't leave me
Don't leave me, Steven
won't
couldn't bear it
won't
Please
Believe me
John looks at Falfa who's shaking his head, watching the car dissolve
Come on, before she blows
He pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when they're a few yards off, Falfa's '55 Chevy does blow--exploding like a small -bomb, blowing it into Modesto history
Back on the road, John is heading toward his car, its engine still running, its door open
Terry runs up, trotting alongside John like a puppy
Jeez, did you show him
He'll probably never even get in a car again
He was faster
It was beautiful, John
Just beauti-- what
John stops by the open door of the deuce coupe
Terry stares at him and squints against the rising sun
was losin', man
What
He had me, man
He was pullin' away from me just before he crashed
You're crazy
You saw it
No, you creamed him, from right off the line
The guy never had a chance
Shit, Toad
The man had me
He was beating me
John,  don't know what you're talking about
It was the most beautiful thing 've ever seen
That guy, he might as well get a wheelchair and roll himself home
Man, you got
you got the bitchinist car in the Valley
You'll always be number one, John
You're the greatest
John nods, then looks up at Terry
His face is glowing, his glasses are smashed and his lip is swollen
John smiles
Look at your glasses, man
(shaking his head) Okay, Toad
We'll take 'em all
(grinning) Right
We'll take em
let's get out of here
John climbs in the car
Terry yawns and shakes his head
Jesus, what a night
He climbs in too, and the deuce coupe drives off slowly as the sun rises over the ploughed fields and on the radio we hear "Only You
" ' --- Curt sleeps in the little car as the sky grows lighter over the empty parking lot
The phone is ringing in the booth
It continues to ring
Finally Curt becomes aware of it and opens his eyes
It takes him a moment to remember
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth
Hello, hello, hello
soft sexy female voice is on the other end of the line
(
) Curt
Yeah
this is Curt, who is this
Who were you expecting
Do you drive a white -Bird
white '56
saw you on Third Street
You know me
Of course
Who are you
How do you know me
It's not important
(excitedly) It's important to me
You're the most perfect, beautiful creature 've ever seen and  don't know anything about you
Could we meet someplace
cruise Third Street every night
Maybe 'll see you again tonight
No
don't think so
Why
'm leaving
in a couple of hours
Where are you from
Curt
What's your name
At least tell me your name
Goodbye, Curt
Wait a second
Wait a second
But there's a click as she hangs up
Curt looks at the phone a moment, then also hangs up
From the car radio, he hears the Wolfman making kissing noises
(
) Little kiss on your ear
Good night, sweetheart
'll see you later
And then the Spaniels duh-duh-duh-duh-duh into "Goodnight Sweetheart
" -3 prop airliner is warming up its engines as it waits to take off from a small country airport
There aren't too many people around
Just Curt and his friends and family seeing him off
Curt stands with a kindly-looking couple in their fifties
He hugs his mother and shakes hands with his dad
Then, Curt moves to his friends
He shakes Steve's hand
Good luck
Yeah, same to you
And  better see you there next year
Oh yeah, 'll be there
Sure
Curt hugs his sister
Laurie holds on to him for a moment
See ya later
'Bye 'bye, Curt
Curt goes to Terry and John
So long, guys
Well, stay cool, man
Yeah
Ah--don't do anything  wouldn't do
Curt smiles at Terry, who has a bandage on his forehead
Curt looks at John and they don't seem to know what to say
Finally, John gives Curt a little slap on the cheek
'll see ya, buddy
know, you probably think you're a big shot, goin' off like this--but you're still a punk
Okay, John
So long
He walks toward the plane and they all wave
He looks around as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable radio
The stewardess smiles as he passes her
Above the door of the plane it reads
Curt looks back again, then goes inside
The plane takes off down the runway and then climbs up into the sky
Curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off
It's playing "Goodnight Sweetheart
" As the plane climbs and banks over the valley, the music fades and the station drifts between static and other stations
and then it's gone
Curt turns off the radio and looks out the window
As the plane banks, through the window Curt sees the white Thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of highway
Curt watches it
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone
As the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of Curt and his friends: John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964
Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965
Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California
Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada
