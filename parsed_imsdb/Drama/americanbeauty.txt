Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily For you, Brad

'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here
Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated
Oh, sure
Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash
Gotta spend money to make money
Right
Exactly
So
Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out
(blurts) Like the time when Mr
Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St
Regis for, what was it, like, three months
(startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip
That's fifty thousand dollars
That's somebody's salary
That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him
() 7
: Jesus
Calm down
Nobody's getting fired yet
That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute
That way, management can assess who's valuable and-- Who's expendable
It's just business
(angry) 've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad
You've been here how long, a whole month
(frank) 'm one of the good guys, Les

This is your one chance to save your job

You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist
Possibly
But you don't want to be unemployed
Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way
() 8
: Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh
As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the next door
(') So we've finally got new neighbors
You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- (heavy disdain) --"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months
She heads into the house, followed by Lester
Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore
Their sycamore
'mon
substantial portion of the root structure was on our property
You know that
How can you call it their sycamore
wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was

No, we don't
As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that 'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like

Just okay
No, Dad
It was spec-tac-ular

Well, you want to know how things went at my job today
Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind
(') They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that
And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they
No, no, that would be too
honest
And so they've asked us-- (off her look) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you
Carolyn is watching this closely
(uncomfortable) Well, what do you expect
You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day
She gets up and heads toward the kitchen

You've barely even spoken to me for months
She's gone

You treat her like an employee

Lester is quiet, staring at his plate

Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with him

Lester enters
Honey, 'm sorry
Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish

He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any

Oh, great
So now it's my fault

It's nobody's fault
Janie, what happened
You and  used to be pals

His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched
-  - Lester's : We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there
Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a framed  of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park
It's startling how happy they look

-   - The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless
Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly announces: will sell this house today
She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then strips down to her undergarments
: We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean
Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself: (') will sell this house today

She stares at her reflection critically

She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off

Welcome

They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today
This living room is very dramatic
Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace

You could even put in a skylight
The woman wrinkles her face, skeptical

It's a dream come true for any cook
Just filled with positive energy
Huh

The woman is pregnant
and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs

Except for maybe the bugs

Is this not a plant
If you have a problem with the plants,  can always call my landscape architect

She's furious
She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops
Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato  that seemingly escape against her will
Suddenly she herself, hard
Shut up
Stop it
You
Weak
But the tears continue
She  herself again

Baby
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up

They're such assholes
Why can't they just have their own lives

Lester is slumped in the passenger seat
What makes you so sure she wants us to be there
Did she ask us to come
Of course not
She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her
But she's been practicing her steps for weeks
Well,  bet money she's going to resent it
And 'm missing the James Bond marathon on
Lester, this is important

She hates me
She's just willful

Just like  knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off
Vomit

And  still like it
If people  don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means  really have a shot at being a model

It wasn't gross
It was kind of cool

Of course  did
He is a really well- known photographer

That's how things really are

Why
What did he do

My name's Ricky

Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it
Thanks, but  really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now

Hello
My husband, Lester-- (shakes Lester's hand) It's a pleasure
Oh, we've met before, actually
This thing last year
Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton
Oh, yes
It's okay

He
little too loudly
Carolyn quickly joins in
(forced gaiety) Honey
Don't be weird
She smiles her most winning smile at him
He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now
All right, honey
won't be weird
(his face close to hers) 'll be whatever you want me to be
And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins
(') We have a very healthy relationship

Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face

Whoa
Put a little more in there, cowboy
The bartender complies
Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room
His : Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy
She's on: smiling, animated,  too loud at their jokes
Lester shakes his head
Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses

Oh
Hi, Ricky Fitts

Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp
Ricky just stands there, watching him
Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want
(') Do you party
Excuse me
Do you get high
() 32
: Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued
- Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation
Christy has wandered off
Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused
You know,  probably wouldn't even tell you this if  weren't a little tipsy, but
am in complete awe of you mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating
You know, 'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing suppose, technically, 'm the "competition," but

Absolutely

Fine
So don't pay me
Excuse me

So you don't have to pay me
Now, leave me alone
Asshole
He goes back inside
Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs

(then) Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that
Well, guess when you're all of, what

He turns, and is instantly transfixed by: His : Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair
(') You're looking good, Mr
Burnham
She starts toward him
(') Last time  saw you, you looked kind of wound up
(spots something) Ooh, is that root beer
She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle
As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder
He sees it coming
Everything  , and all sound
on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in
We  only the amplified  of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow
: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him
on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her
She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with surprising strength
He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips
His eyes    widen as he pulls a   from his mouth right before we : -  - Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer
Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in fantasy
love root beer, don't you
() 36
: Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling incredibly awkward in her own home
Carolyn enters from the dining room
Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator
Mom, you remember Angela
(her sales smile) Yes, of course
forgot to tell you, she's spending the night
Is that okay
Sure
He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong way and he starts  violently

Don't be

Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones
But to me
he's just too embarrassing to live
Your mom's the one who's embarrassing
What a phony
Jane glances at Angela, irritated
(') Your dad's actually kind of cute
Shut up

He can't believe what he's hearing

) He is
If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot

Oh, come on
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear

You are so grossing me out right now

Jane covers her ears and starts  to drown her out

) (laughs) would

Angela crosses to the window and looks out

Jane joins her and is immediately unnerved by: Their : In the Burnham's , the word "" is spelled out in
- '  - It's that psycho next door
Jane, what if he worships you
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff
Shit

Jane tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room
We  toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela

Finally, we settle on the small make-up where we see a  of Jane, back at her computer
She's smiling
Then suddenly the   and she's gone

He lowers the camera and smiles
then something below catches his attention
He leans out the window to get a better look at: -  - Ricky's : Through a  on the side of the Burnham's , we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall
-  - Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it
Shit
Shit
He yanks aside  , a racquetball , boxes of old   , an unopened remote-controlled , stacks of old vinyl LPs
finally his face lights up when he finds: pair of  obviously unused for many years
Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt
He glances around, finding his  in the  as he pulls off his shirt, then the -shirt underneath
He eyes himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape
Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be hard to shed
He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants

His room is a haven of high-tech

There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room
Coming, Dad

It's been six months already

Good night, son
He disappears down the hall
Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door
He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a   in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized   from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight

Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling
After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom

She smiles and beckons us, and we float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body

(') You've been working out, haven't you can tell
She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs
Her eyes widen and she throws her head back

She flips over and faces him

That's disgusting

So do
Really

Lester

This is not a marriage
This hasn't been a marriage for years
But you were happy as long as  kept my mouth shut
Well, guess what
've changed
And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department
Oh

You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated

Well then, come on, baby

But
did support you while you got your license
And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours

It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable
He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change
He curls up under the covers contentedly

- We're  high above the neighborhood
Below us we see the two Jims, jogging
We  them steadily
It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself
Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about
- We're now at street level,  the two Jims
Hey
You guys
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as Lester runs  , wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants
The Jims slow down until he catches up, then the three men run together in the early morning light

The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the   in front of him
What is this, the fucking gay pride parade
Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath
He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting
Hey
Yo
Ricky

You want to borrow it

Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him
The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark

Are you kidding
You just smoked with me last night
It's not mine
One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office

Lester picks up a  case from a shelf and examines it
You like Pink Floyd

That sucks
No actually, it was great
All  did was party and get laid

Uh-oh, mom's mad
What the hell do you think you're doing
Bench presses

You have such hostility in you
Do you mind

You will not get away with this
You can be sure of that

Lester sits across from him, smiling

my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so  can jerk off, while fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell

(laughs) Brad, for fourteen years 've been a whore for the advertising industry
The only way  could save myself now is if start firebombing
Whatever

One year's salary, with benefits
That's not going to happen
Well, what do you say  throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot
Brad

Brad stops laughing

Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester
Man
You are one twisted fuck

He's happier than he's been in years

Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious

Buddy
Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name

What's she doing in New York
She's moving there
(off Carolyn's look) Yes
We are splitting up
Buddy
'm so sorry
(bitterly) Yes, according to her, 'm too focused on my career
As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw
Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her
Oh
Wow
(then, laughing) Ah, it's for the best

: When  saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy
Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times

Sorry 'm late
(overly cheerful) No, no, that's quite all right, dear
Your father and  were just discussing his day at work
(to Lester) Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey
Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive
Lester looks at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin
Janie, today  quit my job
And then told my boss to fuck himself, and then blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars
Pass the asparagus
Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of
And your mother seems to prefer  go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink
(ashen) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her
And  marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job
Lose it
didn't lose it
It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go
"  quit
Someone pass me the asparagus
Oh
Oh
And  want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now-- already have a job
() 62
: (2) (not stopping) No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage
We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn
You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn
Yes
don't mind
really don't
You mean, everything
You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job-- (overlapping) Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus
(rises) Okay, 'm not going to be a part of this-- (means it) Sit down
Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice
Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a   , then sits again as he serves himself
(') 'm sick and tired of being treated    like don't exist
You two do whatever    you want to do whenever you want to do    it and don't complain
All  want is the    same courtesy-- (overlapping) Oh, you don't complain
Oh, excuse me
Excuse me
must be psychotic then, if you don't complain
What is this
Am locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating
That's the only explanation  can think of-- Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it , frightening Carolyn and Jane
(casual) Don't interrupt me, honey
() 63
: (3) He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened
Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage
Jane just stares at the plate in front of her
(') Oh, and another thing
From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music
Because frankly, and  don't think 'm alone here, 'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit

There is a  at the door
Go
Away
(
) Honey, please let me in
Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in
(') wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight
But in a way, 'm glad
Why, so  could see what freaks you and Dad really are
Me
She stares at Jane, then starts to cry
Aw, Christ, Mom
(tearful) No, 'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself
(sighs) You cannot count on anyone except yourself
It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better
() 64
: Look, Mom,  really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay
Carolyn suddenly  Jane, hard
You ungrateful little brat
Just look at everything you have
When  was your age, lived in a duplex
We didn't even have our own house
Embarrassed, she quickly leaves
Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out
- Jane's : We're across from Ricky's room, looking in
He stands at the window with his , videotaping us
On the -  behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him
She waves

She has now removed her shirt
She stands there in her bra, then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra
On : We  toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily
She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this far and there's no turning back
She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable
Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters, incensed
Startled, Ricky turns around
As soon as his eyes meet his father's, he knows what's up
You little bastard-- Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the floor
(') How did you get in there
- From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of her

- Jane's : In the  across from us, the Colonel proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face
- '  - Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence
(unnerved) How
How
'mon, get up
Fight back, you little pussy
No, sir

How did you get in there

What were you looking for
Money
Are you on dope again
No, sir

: This is for your own good, boy
You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for
Sir, 'm sorry
You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can't--there are rules in life-- Yes, sir
You need structure, you need discipline-- (simultaneous) Discipline
Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me
Don't give up on me, Dad
The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily
Tenderness fills his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek
Oh, Ricky
But something keeps him from doing it
(') You stay out of there
He leaves
Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau
He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face
In darkness, we  repetitive

She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated
An approaches with a new round of ammunition

: (loading gun) gotta say, Mrs
Burnham, when you first came here  thought you would be hopeless
But you're a natural
Well, all  know is
love shooting this gun
And she starts  again
- ML320 - Bobby Darin sings "'       " on the
Carolyn  along as she drives
Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful    she is

Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to

Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a and controlling the car
His working out is beginning to produce results
The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in
Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry
She just stands there, staring at Lester
After a moment, he looks up at her
() 68
: What
Ah, whose car is that out front
Mine
1970 Pontiac Firebird
The car always wanted and now  have it
rule
Where's the Camry
traded it in
Shouldn't you have consulted me first
Hmm, let me think
No
You never drove it
(then) Have you done something different
You look great
(brusque) Where's Jane
Jane not home
We have the whole house to ourselves
He smiles at her playfully
She stares back, annoyed
It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone
Lester just
(') Christ, Carolyn
When did you become so
joyless
(taken aback) Joyless
am not joyless
There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man
There is plenty of joy in my life
() 69
: (2) (leaning toward her) Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored
And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters
Have you totally forgotten about her
Because haven't
His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged
She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him
He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced
Then, just before their lips meet
(barely audible) Lester
You're going to spill beer on the couch
She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late
His smile fades, and the moment is gone
So what
It's just a couch
This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk
This is not "just a couch
" It's just a couch
He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room
(') This isn't life
This is just stuff
And it's become more important to you than living
Well, honey, that's just nuts
Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry

She glances at us

We're watching the -  in Ricky's room

Ricky holds the camera, sitting naked in a chair
It's been almost a month since his father beat him up, and there are still slight on his face
He's aiming his camera at Jane
Why
(re: image on ) It's weird, watching myself
don't like how  look
can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are
'm not going to sit here for that shit
She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him
We see his image on the  as she videotapes
(') Ha
How does it feel now
Fine
You don't feel naked
am naked
You know what  mean
Jane  in on his face, which remains placid
(') Tell me about being in the hospital
Ricky smiles
() 71
: (2) When  was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope
He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right
(laughs) Well, of course,  got kicked out
Dad and  had this huge fight, and he hit me
and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and
just snapped
wanted to kill him
And  would have
Killed him
If they hadn't pulled me off
(then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital
Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years
Wow
You must really hate him
He's not a bad man
He grabs a half-smoked  from an ashtray and lights it
Well
you better believe 'd hate my father if he did something like that to me
(laughs) Wait
do hate my father
Why
He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her
We see her image on the  as he videotapes
He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting
You'd rather he had the crush on you
Gross, no
But it'd be nice if  was anywhere near as important to him as she is
(then) () () 72
: (3) (') know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong
He's doing massive psychological damage to me
How
Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face
Well, now,  too need structure
little fucking discipline
They
She lays back on the bed
(') 'm serious, though
How could he not be damaging me
need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever  bring a girlfriend home from school
(snorts) What a lame-o
Somebody really should put him out of his misery
Her mind wanders for a beat
Want me to kill him for you
Jane looks at him and sits up
Yeah, would you
(smiles) It'll cost you
Well, 've been baby-sitting since  was about ten
've got almost three thousand dollars
'Course,  was saving it up for a boob job
She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed,
(') But my tits can wait, huh
You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad
() 73
: (4) Well,  guess 'm just not a very nice girl, then, am
She smiles dreamily at him
He turns the Digicam off and the screen goes
He lowers the camera and looks at her intently
(') (suddenly nervous) You know 'm not serious, right
Of course
He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed
long moment where neither of them speaks
He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes
(') Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other
: - We're  above Robin Hood Trail
We see the ' below us as we  it steadily
Remember those posters that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life
" Well, that's true of every day except one
(a beat) The day you die
We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway
- We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us
He carries a  and wears , and we as he runs
The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body
74
-  - The blender  as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake
He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete
Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table
Carolyn enters
Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her
He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it
Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out
Jane, hurry up
've got a very important appointment-- Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight
Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts
He doesn't
Well, of course, she's always welcome
(on her way out) You know,  thought maybe you two had a fight
haven't seen her around here in a while
And she's gone
Jane continues staring at her father
Finally, he glances over at her
What
(nervous) 've been too embarrassed to bring her over
Because of you, and the way that you behave
What are you talking about
've barely even spoken to her
(angry) Dad
You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk
It's disgusting
() 75
: (angry himself) You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother
Jane is stunned
She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying
on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes
(') (under his breath) Fuck
-   - We're outside Ricky's room,  slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair
The scars on his face are almost gone now
reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness
Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious
(brusque) You ready to go
Oh,  don't need a ride
'm going to go in with Jane and her mom
-   - Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house
His : Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile
Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us
As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants
Yo, Ricky
How's it going
Pretty decent, Mr
Burnham
Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment

: on the Colonel's face: he looks confused
As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances over at him
Lester's : The Colonel watches the car driving off, then looks at us
His face tightens
studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house
on the Colonel, deeply troubled
- '  - The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters
He starts going through Ricky's bureau
He opens the  in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom
He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on: The  and a stack of  on a shelf
The camera is still connected to the

He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another
On the  screen we see
On : Through the Burnham's  , we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs
Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does
The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized
' - Lester, wearing a Mr
Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill
- Hey Lester,  need that Super Smiley with cheese,
You need more than that, my little hombre

) (over speakers) Nothing

He puts his spatula down

They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window
(overly cheerful) Smile
You're at Mr
Smiley's
Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin

: Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food
The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly
(') Would you like to    try our new beef and cheese pot pie on    a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a    limited time only
Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant
(re: Buddy) We were just at a seminar
(then, all business) Buddy, this is my-- Her husband
We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time
(to Carolyn) Whoa
You are so busted
(flustered) You know, this really doesn't concern you
Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf
(to Carolyn, quietly) So
This makes sense
(miserable) Oh, Lester-- Honey, it's okay
want you to be happy
(then) Would you like Smiley Sauce with that
Lester, just stop it
Uh-uh
You don't get to tell me what to do
Ever again

- The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds
Wind whips garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar
- ML320 - Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead
Buddy looks at her unhappily
'm sorry
guess we should cool it for a while
'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce
Oh, no
understand completely
(sarcastic) In order to be successful, one must project an image of success
At all times
She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to him
He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door
She starts to
As before, she herself, hard
(') Stop it
Stop it
She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then suddenly  as loud as she can

Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it
We suddenly  a  noise
Ricky pulls his  off his belt and checks it

Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework
He heads into the hall
The Colonel watches him go, uneasy

So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a regular basis now, right
(irritable) No
Oh, come on
You can tell me
Does he have a big dick
Look, 'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay
It's not like that
Not like what
Doesn't he have one

Maybe  don't really want to hear all that
Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it

Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at

We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked

Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder
(grins) You got any papers
Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there
(laughs) You know, put up a fight, dude
You are such a pushover
"No  can't
Really
Okay
" And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest
Ricky grins, then squats down and reaches under the weight bench
You should learn to roll a joint
Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint
82
-  - The Colonel's : Lester leans back in his chair
We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint
After a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job
The Colonel watches, incredulous
Then we  a , and the Colonel glances over at: His : Angela's  pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird
As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus  back to the

Wow
Look at you

Angela walks over to Lester
You can really tell
Look at those arms
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so
() 83
: But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all
He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly
You like muscles
His voice is low and intense
She moves away, suddenly insecure

And she heads out quickly
Lester watches her go, baffled

The Colonel moves closer towards him
Your wife is with another man and you don't care
Nope, our marriage is just for show commercial, for how normal we are
When we are anything but
He grins
and so does the Colonel
(') You're shaking
He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder
The Colonel closes his eyes
(') We really should get you out of these clothes
(a whisper) Yes
() 90
: He opens his eyes and looks at Lester, his face filled with an anguished vulnerability we wouldn't have thought possible from him
His eyes are brimming with tears
Lester leans in, concerned
It's okay
(hoarse) (softly) Just tell me what you need
The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's cheek
and then kisses him
Lester is momentarily stunned, and then he pushes the Colonel away
The Colonel's face crumples in shame
(') Whoa, whoa, whoa
'm sorry
You got the wrong idea
The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night
- ML320 - Carolyn is still listening to the same
She holds the  in her hand
" refuse to be a victim
" When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head-- Carolyn switches the   and puts the gun in her purse
refuse to be a victim
- The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder
-  - Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a
Suddenly we   coming from the other room
Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room
91
-   - His :  we   around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the , holding a  case
She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed
She regards us apprehensively
then puts on a slightly defiant smile
hope you don't mind if  play the stereo
Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer
Not at all
(then) Bad night
Not really bad, just
strange
(grins) Believe me
It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine
She smiles
They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged
Jane and  had a fight
(after a beat) It was about you
She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it
Lester raises his eyebrows
(') She's mad at me because  said  think you're sexy
Lester grins
He is sexy
(offering beer) Do you want a sip
She nods
Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily
He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand
() 92
: (') So
are you going to tell me
What you want
don't know
You don't know
His face is very close to hers
She's unnerved--this is happening too fast
What do you want
Are you kidding
want you
've wanted you since the first moment  saw you
You are the most beautiful thing  have ever seen
Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck
You don't think 'm ordinary
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried
Thank you
(far away) don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary
And Lester kisses her on the lips
- ML320 - Carolyn drives, her face resolute
refuse to be a victim
refuse to be a victim
refuse to be a victim
(angry) Lester,  have something  have to say to you
93
-   - Angela lays back on the couch as Lester moves in over her
He pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs, then moves up and caresses her face
- '  - Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed
Are you scared
don't get scared
My parents will try to find me
Mine won't
-   - Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse
She seems disconnected from what's happening
Lester pulls her blouse open, exposing her breasts
Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then
This is my first time
Lester
You're kidding
(a whisper) 'm sorry
beat
Lester looks down at her, his grin fading
His : Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable
This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child
() 94
: (') still want to do it
just thought should tell you
in case you wondered why  wasn't
better
Lester's face falls
There's no way he's going to go through with this now
(') (confused) What's wrong
thought you said  was beautiful
(tenderly) You are beautiful
He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders, covering her nakedness
(') You are so beautiful
and  would be a very lucky man
He smiles and shakes his head
Humiliated, Angela starts to cry
feel so stupid
Don't
He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently
'm sorry
Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious
You have nothing to be sorry about
But she keeps crying
Lester hugs her again
We  a loud of  outside
(') (smiles) It's okay
Everything's okay

- The Mercedes pulls onto Robin Hood Trail
- ML320 - on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the -
She turns her head to look out the window: Her : The   of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain
-  - Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter
She's eating a turkey sandwich
Wow
was starving
Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator
Do you want me to make you another one
No, no, no
'm fine
He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow
(concerned) You sure
mean, 'm still a little weirded out, but
(sincerely) feel better
Thanks
long beat, as Lester studies her, then: How's Jane
What do you mean
mean, how's her life
Is she happy
Is she miserable
'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it
() 96
: Angela shifts uncomfortably
She's
she's really happy
She thinks she's in love
Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is
(quietly) Good for her
An awkward beat
How are you
(smiles, taken aback) God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that
(thinks about it) 'm great
They just sit there, smiling at each other, then: (suddenly) 've gotta go to the bathroom
She crosses off
Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content
(laughs) 'm great
Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for
on a framed  as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park
It's startling how happy they look
Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo
He suddenly seems older, more mature
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago
() 97
: (2) (') Man oh man
(softly) Man oh man oh man
After a beat, the barrel of a  rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull
an arrangement of fresh-cut    in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the
Then a  suddenly rings out,    unnaturally
Instantly, the tile is sprayed with ,   the same deep crimson as the roses
-  - Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane
-  - Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops
Jane appears behind him
Oh God
Their :  pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table
Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid
Jane follows him, in shock
Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face
then he smiles, ever so slightly
His : Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile
(an awed whisper) Wow
(
) had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die
- We're  across a white blanket of clouds
(
) First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time

- In  & : Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at: His :     falls across an unbelievably starry sky
(
) For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars
- '  - Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed
We a  from downstairs
They look at each other, alarmed
- In  & : Maple trees in autumn
Ghostly slowly toward pavement
(

We the  again
Angela turns, frightened

- Carolyn walks slowly toward the  , drenched to the bone, clutching her  tightly
We  the  again

He's wearing covers the front of his -shirt
He paces in front of one of his  ; the   is open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside

She shuts the door and locks it, then takes the  19 out of her purse
She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into a
Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her, burying her face in them
She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to cry

The wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground
(
) guess  could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me
but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world
Sometimes  feel like 'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst

But don't worry
(
