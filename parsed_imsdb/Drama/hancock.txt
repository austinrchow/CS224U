Except for the, paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed
The end came abruptly you could tell 'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence
"Shh
," the curled lips attempted
Like it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley" or
"shit happens
" Your eyes don't forget things like that
Like you don't forget the sound animals make when they're humping
Primal
Raw
They endure in you forever because the senses have a brain all their own and they recall long after you've succumbed to the la-la of forgetfulness
(a pregnant beat) Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark it's black, 'll see
() And it starts all over again
From this blackness, a streak of  splits the night sky
- We are in the eye of a , an angry mass of clo uds raging o f a howling
across the black sky
It brings  and  an d the swirl An  emerges from this moist darkness
weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the , of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky
We the approaching entity as it hovers before us
It's a man
It's a man, plus
It's a , garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded   extends b ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain
This Superhero (30)
Unshaven
Disheveled
Worn
face chiselled with mileage

In the eyes, we can see his soul
Intense
Fierce
An exposed nerve, snagged in a fish hook
He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off
He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated visage of  , a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood
And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a thunderous
He pivots in the air and dives toward land
He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect, engulfed in the dimensions of his cape
The ground approaches, fast
He accelerates as if to embrace it
Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is
An  as he rips through the street surface, penetrating the asphalt - head first
Debris and concrete spew from the ruptured orifice as he disappears inside
There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches nearby manhole  from their spots - they bounce and down the street like loose change
The rain continues its onslaught
- Rain sloshes against a kitchen window
Where the sink is
Not far from the kitchen table
Where the  Family sits, dinner before them
(35) leans over his plate, eating his meal
Here idles a man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as low fat milk
He sits opposite  (30), frenetically appropriating food gentle beauty
entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an attitude
meek little  (8), slouches between the folks - a tattoos the left of his face
Aaron stares at the damn plate, finding no humor in eggplant
The principal did'nothing
Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy
What's the matter with education
Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and
mollusks and
not get stabbed on the way home

- subway  idles by a passenger ramp
hisses from its side and plumes into a wall of white mist
And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears
He surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his gait
It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the collar of a tattered
He traverses the loading deck, boarding and disembarking around him
He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway
He strolls over to a  , up against the grafetti- raped subway wall
On the wall, a line of profanity declares that
"
" He surveys the machine
His right arm appears from the coat pocket
Fingers merge into a tight fist
And casually, he rips into the metal vendor like it was Jello
His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins
He pockets the loot
He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of
Deposits it under his coat
And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets above
At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors
Trembles
Moves
Steams into the deep dark tunnel
White mushrooms from its tail
It lingers in the air as we
- see , rising from a faucet of running  water
It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits another set of pots
She's clearing the table
Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open door
Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes out of his clothes
- Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs
He stands before the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in- the-face body

Horns strikes a He-man pose, his biceps in the wind
He removes the Police apparel, plastic
Proceeds to put it on

His blood-shot eyes mean it
Fish turns to the back wall
Grabs a random  from a nail
Top floor, 7F
Fifteen a pop, up front
(re: the check-in sheet) And your John Hancock makes it sweet
The Superhero scrutinizes the - sheet
Scribbles on the dotted line
Fish hands over the key
Then, pulls it back from Hancock's grab

You want sheets, they're extra
Towel's extra
Plunger's extra

Is it quiet
Quiet
Hey pal, we look like a public library to you
The girls work
Some of them scream, some of them moan
() and some of them just kinda lay there cold
You want quiet,  got cotton balls you can stick in your ear
They're extra
Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare hands
He withdraws from his coat the  of loot
Pushes it under the window
And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a deep
Fish recoils
The bills fly
Hancock takes the key
Exchanges it with a metal  - the strangulated remains of the bell
It rolls out of his palm and off the counter
Hancock sidles off
Fish - the cat's got his tongue
- Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt
7
He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt - complete with holster
Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal
He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it
And we it to be a
shoulder patch reads
-
Their motto: "   " Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move
'  - jar of  rests upon a window ledge
Outside, the story is rain
On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face
Aaron brings his hand before his eyes
Looks at it
Studies it
Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight  - a boy's interpretation of a man's weapon
gentle  disperses the knuckles
Horus peers in
How's the eye
Black
Horus enters
Stands awkwardly before his son
It'll be gone in a week
Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there
Yeah  will
And  don't want any girly make-up on my face
Horus deposits himself on the bed
Hunches over-h13 knees
(almost apologetically) There'll always be people around who'll
exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace
Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts
(' ) (pain in every word) The thing to do is
to avoid them
They're no-wins
Can't-wins
You hold the anger
and move on
You hold the anger
(turns to Aaron) tell you because  can't take it, seeing you hurt
You're part of me
() 've felt what you're feeling now
And if you've got any of me in you, you're gonna feel what  felt-when you go up against one of 'em
Turn away
that's what you do
the other cheek
You do that for me
No, you're not the coward
Not you
No
'll be the coward, all right
'Cause don't want to see you hurt
love you
ask you to do that for me
your old man
And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark hallway - moved b y his affection
She oversees a father-son embrace
(') 'm late for work
Get some sleep
Tomorrow always feels better
after a good night sleep
The light  off and the man's silhouette form exits the room
- Horus backs his way out
Shuts the door
Mary's hand greets him from behind
It startles the man
He
tries to regroup
Mary

Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore
She nestles up against her husband
Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back
He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator
Mary caresses his neck
Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured the moment
And out of nowhere
(') () 'm late
Mary snaps from her trance
Unshackles her hold, like she almost expected it
() Right
() Coffee's by the door
She marches back into the kitchen
Horus stares at his feet
hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face
He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt : - Mary - against the kitchen sink
Her thin cotton dress clings to a body still'robust with enrgy, to breasts so ful l they could yread Uncl pop a boner inoud e And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish sweat
The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to saturate her chest and face - she drips
Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner longing

On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we  a trenehc -li12n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the picture
An open door faces the   set
It's the bathroom and it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock
He squats on the , pants around the ankles, cape shrouded around him
Those unforgiving eyes plant on the  screen, a cigarette dangling from the corner of his lip
We discern the  to be human and we  that he is watching a  flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy
(
) () Ooh yeah, big fella
That's it
Shoot your load, baby
Let it fly
(male; in ecstasy) fly
G0000D
Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his face
He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick deteriorates into ashes before our eyes
And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow
: - Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation
The streets glimmer from puddles left behind from the night
The overcast sky - its precarious rain formation indicates that the storm is far from over
- lunchbox perches on the kitchen table

Aaron adjusts his raincoat, looking disturbed

The  is on, commercialing some spring-fresh vaginal wash
The room sits empty
But the bathroom door is open
Inside, the supersuit peeled down to his waist, Hancock shaves
(mumbling; rehearsing) it's about responsibility
with what is empowered in you
to correct the ills of man
No foam
No gel
Just skin and the razor edge of his belt - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to sleep
13
(') () it's about responsibility
Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a of 409 all-purpose cleaner
On the tube, the commercial segues way into

As  file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and Roheim
They head streetward, to the sidewalk

He laps up the last drop
Reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket

Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the "   " of their vehicle
Roheim watches him - turning red with drama
Bastards
couldn't protect a pitcher of warm spit
couldn't find their asshole with common sense and a thumb
() Like  been saying, it's their

The jerk-offs, they don't got the heart

Horus tries to shrug off these words
No good - they stick like a thorn in the eye of his soul

) () Come on, let's go home
- On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel
trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only
We recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape, peering out from a hole in his coat
cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen cigarette
He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so still
Something brews within this superman
15
- The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with e  and  and   and   - they are the "esque" in Bro ly qu Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way Schoolyard activities abound
Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards of screaming little anti-christs
Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying to pull ahead and away

She continues her way, purpose in every step
No window shopping bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful
She crosses the street, her destination:

Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the situation at hand
They begin to panic
On cue, two new ,  and  (30's), emerge from the crowded bank, both revealing automatic
Jerry #1 drops the   with the butt of his gun
As planned, they take aim at the surveillance  on each end of the bank
They miss, much to Tom's chagrin
The crowd ducks, Mary among them
Terror grips,the queues
The Jerrys try again
No more cameras
And with ,Irao that, Tom takes center stage
He leaps on the teller counter

(') Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking
My name is Tom
These are my assistants, Jerry and Jerry
Why're we doing what we're doing, you ask
We got one word to say to you folks
(shrugging; smiles) Recession
: - Order in the bank - employees and patrons are now corralled at the center of the bank
Their faces all register pain
And we find out why
They all squat in the  position - legs crossed like pretzels

Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of
Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight
He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the back, a  boy (8) sits chewing gum
This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin
20
He taunts Aaron a smile, opens his mouth, and we realize that he's gnawing on a plastic
- Behind the teller window is Tom, assisted by a quite voluptuous employee - , (23), with an  to match

It's 2:30
Mary turns from the clock, concerned
She studies the situation, the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story
At the entrance - Tom
He looks desperate
Irrational
Ready to snap

The hostages huddle on the floor, tired
They wait

Children file out of classrooms

Only Aaron remains, alone to the elements - waiting

And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a comes  down before the bank entrance
It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps still reeling from the impact

There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight
He examines the ground below
And he dives
Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral
He circumvents the bank structure, flying around and around
Everybody ducks
Trash and paper batter about behind his draft
- Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots
Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion
The  outside subsides
Stops
loaded beat
Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular  of bricks sprays the air inside
caped figure bursts into the scene amidst  from clueless hostages
in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar
With a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route to the windshield of a police vehicle outside
Jerry #1 opens  on Hancock
Bullets careen off flesh of steel
- Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into another awaiting police windshield
- Smoke and debris smother the air
And as they subside, all eyes fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble
Mary can't believe her eyes
She surveys every inch of his frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect
Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out the  - Veronica's wet smile takes him

Bodies bang about, all moving for the door

Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped figure, until real estate ushers her into the street

The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights
They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers
- The bank floor in shambles
No one in sight
But movement jars us to the back, where the bank  is
We  Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a thick steel chamber of commerce
Hancock arrives at the safe
Confronts the object inside - Tom
- There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery
Tom bears his revolver, aimed at Hancock
Hancock enters the safe
Stay away
Hancock does not respond

Hancock turns, grabs the safe door
Slams it shut with a resounding
They're locked in

Hancock does not respond
(') What's going on, here
Hancock no response
Tom raises his gun, and meaning it

Say something

Tom fires a
shot off Hancock's forehead
The ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity
It rips Tom's right  from his head

Tries to put it back, clutching his head
He bleeds
Fuck

And as he utters this, he approaches Tom
() Fuck you
Close on his trigger finger
It tightens
- On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear - from the safe
- The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to where we are
Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and fire-escapes and ominous gray skies
move into this sight - they eclipse the heavens
And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of and  (both his age

Rage distorts his mouth out of symmetry
He stares at , before him - the blonde kid from class
We  water, a stream of liquid-something  about, Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg
- The aftermath
Hancock is swarmed under  , reporters squeezing through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this superman
29
We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious Veronica again, it spots , all who'd die for a chance to suck on his cape
: - Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of tears
He rages down the street while his mother pursues
Tell me
what happened

was held up
The asshole peed on me
'm dog shit
at the bank
Honey, were they the same ones
Don't cry
Get a grip, mom
They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs
- The door  to signify arrival
School books go flying
Mother and son march down the hallway
They are greeted by Horus, sleep still on his face
How was your day
Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel
: - Just your average professional building, several stories of brick and cement

But all is not well with this typically normal picture

His mother's  from the window
Below, the crowd makes its way across the street
They point and gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his lonesome
The baby teeters along the edge
It heads for a  pole, dazzled by the red-white-and-blue
It reaches out at fabric
Almost
Not quite
The baby  from the precipice
On the street, people  on their tongues as gravity pulls the infant down
But wait
Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and silent
He cradles the baby from utter concrete
He deposits the youngster with

paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man

Two individuals, man and woman, stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window
They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving pistons
For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's Veronica
(a her voice trembles) Oh god
The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with sweat and saliva
He brushes his cape away from his arm
Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her breasts beckoning at ceiling
Quite abruptly, he lets her go
Rights his pants
Unlatches the window
She paws after him

He reaches behind his e

Taps himself a stick

) How about spreading some of that joy
Hancock turns and faces a young , scraggly in his own slimy kind of way
In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building
Presses a gun to Hancock's temple
() Better yet, why don't  just take it
Hancock - enraged
In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by the throat via one arm, the gun with the other
(-) What are you thinking
The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground - one of his  remains in its spot from the swift jolt
The other sneaker teeters on his one foot
and falls to the pavement

Hancock wrests the gun from his hand
Places it into his own mouth
two slugs inside
The Hoodlum

Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth
Shoves it up the- Hoodlum's nose

Huh
Sticks the gun back into his mouth

Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth

Is this getting through

Have a heart, mister

- From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing into the trash cans below
Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage
Falls
He leans against the building, glazed over with drunkenness
He turns to the only source of light that of a building across the street:  , looming above the rest
Boarded- up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic
He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than we think it deserves
- Mary swallows
Starts in on the tune
"Once there was a way, to get back homeward
Once there was a way, to get back home
" Oh, mom
Shut up
- There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens, as if he can hear
- Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter
"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And will sing a lullaby
" 40
Mary as her voice carries
- Something overcomes this fevered superman
He begins to unravel
calm consumes him
Tames him
It could be Mary's voice - maybe he can hear it, and then maybe not

) "Golden slumber fills your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise

They chase him from behind, , taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood
Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping
- but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit
He swallows hard

Close on Aaron, as blood drains from his face
His eyes dash for a garbage  - but is there time
Spengler
Erlick
Perceval
They can smell their prey
He's not going anywhere
'Less he can walk through wall

They turn the corner, attack mode
Aaron, nowhere in sight
Just the brick wall and a trash can

Erlick inspects the solid wall
Spengler scratches his head
But'Perceval's no fool
He spots the trash can
He motions the fellas over
They circle the can

They an empty can
No one inside
Nothing
That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock's capable arm
In mid-air, they hang for a second
Then, Hancock takes them away
- Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her bladder's going to break
(checking watch) No
no
no
- secluded view of the city, high above
Hancock, Aaron under his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands
Aaron scampers away
Turns and faces the man
Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes
He shakes his head
Disappointed
He reaches for his belt
Pulls out a cigarette
Lights it
You smoke
What
42
Of course you don't
Nothing but a kid
(beat; takes a puff) Smoke no evil
Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner

what it's like
Aaron shakes his head
(') (hands it to
him) Go on
give it a try
One time
Won't kill you
Once

He takes the stick
Sucks on it
Doubles over, coughing
(') Good, huh
Tastes like compost
your first stick
Then, after a few more
it starts getting this
flavor
little nicotine buzz
while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy
Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there
, and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet
Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr
Wisdom waxing philosophical

And change
Can start by changing some principles
Blank best describes Aaron's face

Principles
Principles
Here's one; very simple
Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do
(beat; smokes) look at your face, the shiners
You took a shove and you let it go clean
Not good
That's a formula for future abuse
an invitation to the loser's dance
Letting it go
Walking away
,(shakes head) Bad policy
Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide
What am  suppose to do
You do what is necessary
wanted
there were three of them
What is necessary
() Let me tell you something, kid
There was this infantry unit, you see
badly outnumbered
(thinks about it) Wait, let me put it in kid terms
So you relate,
There's a fox, you relate fox and he's walking through what, the woods, the forests, right
Next thing the fox knows, he's staring down a pack of
hounds
Bloodhounds
And there's this chase, the fox's running his ass off, over boulders and through streams and, but the damn hounds are still on his tail
Finally the fox comes to this cliff, a precipice
and it's what, a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks
He's in trouble 'cause the hounds are closing in and they're going to tear him to pieces
So what does he think
" jump and  die for sure
stay, confront them and 'll get my ass butchered
" Decision time
He thinks, "stay and least 'd have something, a chance
() 44
(') To slip away, maybe
" The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand
Right
() The hounds come
What do you think happens
(thinking about it) He gets away
Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette
Blows smoke
No
The fox gets his ass kicked and some
mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric
What're you saying
But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise
It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath
words
The dog goes over
Gets up close
To hear what he's saying
You know what the fox's saying
just before he keels off
Aaron - negative
(') () Now he's gurgling, choking on his own blood, right
massacre
The fox's lying next to his entrails, you know
and you know what he says
(raises his fist in the air) "No regrets
" What
No regrets
You make a decision and you stick to it
Like a man's got to do
And "no regrets
" Aaron - submitting it to memory
Why're you telling me all this
45
(a beat to think) Look at it this way
got to do what got to do
: - Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher son
She looks at her watch
And up
up ahead, by steps apartment - Aaron, levitating in air
Hancock explains this defiance of gravity
He gently lowers Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother
She beckons him
Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms
She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear
Or possibly, they were awestruck
: - Horus, in his bed - smothered in slumber
He begins to stir, wrestling some unseen dream
He wakes, in defeat

Mother and son gesture behind him
He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm extended
All eyes on Horus - befuddled
You know Hancock

Breasts, please

It gives me gas
Thank you
beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART
It makes mom fart, too
Mary  on her food
Drops her fork
She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty
Hancock grabs the table, one arm
Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head
Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above
She picks up the fork

Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,
looking impotent

Security Guard

: - The Longfellow's apartment
- seem from above
Clyde exits the building in his morning robe
, Takes hold of the newspaper
Digs through it
Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde
Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger
She seizes the paper from him, sending him cowering inside
61
Mary and Aaron - by the perimeter fence
Have a good one
got to do what  got to do
She watches him go -curious
- The sky's  - the schoolyard
Aaron - sauntering to class
Mary - turning, walking away
We soar through air and mist
Circle a street below
Hover over an alley
Descend from the clouds - into the depths of buildings and fire escapes
- Mary, among other pedestrians, head homeward
Her pace say she's in no hurry to get there
Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated, inconspicuous, and in pursuit - Horus waits outside - hands in his pockets
He paces uncomfortably
Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown paper
Not a word from Horus
(-) This stuff's going to kill me
He gives Horus a glance
Takes another swig
(' ) () You disapprove,  know
No
62
Sure you do
You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink
to poison myself
Your friend
Without a word of caution
Not a word
Just take it
you take everything
No
You're afraid to offend
You don't want to be abrasive
Provocative
(beat; as'Horus squirms) So you suppress
Do nothing
Take it
Roheim takes another gulp
(pulling teeth) You shouldn't drink
My wife
She left a bad taste in my mouth
drink to kill-the taste
Horus has no response to this
(') () You're a good man, Horus
() And you're right
This stuff's no good
It's a coward's way out and  know it
He gives the bottle a guilty stare
Tosses the bottle into a nearby garbage can
(' ) (sick of himself) What the hell
can learn to love beverage
- Mary
Walking
Hancock
Following
From across the street
Mesmerized and in a world to himself
He crosses
the street, failing to look both ways truck  the clueless superhero, sending him across air - towards Mary
63
200 lbs
of superflesh  into a  display window - just ahead of Mary's path
Glass showers the scene
People Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters
He pulls a severed  from the rubble
Looks at Mary, reposed before him
(nothing happened) How are you
In unison, they turn to the  vehicle - a
mangled heap of steel,  billowing from its ruptured radiator
Hancock shrugs a smiles
- Mr
Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home
He is tired and his face shows it
There to make it worse - Clyde
He's back, getting at the sports page on the front steps
sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus
He approaches the steps with fire and
(burning
) Clyde
Can  talk to you for just a brief moment
() Not now, Longfella
'm all blocked up
Clyde heads inside - with the sports page
He  as he goes in
() Sure
- Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a cool stroll
Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage
What were you doing in the street
(the trenchcoat) You ripped it pretty good
64
Hancock - he's lost
(') () What're you:
how old's this thing
didn't see it coming
left myself open
It'll be all right
All right
It's just the seams
can sew it back
What
(the trenchcoat) This
It's just the seams
''ll take good care of it
You'll sew -it
Yes
Me
can
And 'll re-button it for you, all right
Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one
(' ) (} Are you okay
No reply
He stares at her - simply
: -
Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven
Her eyes search the gray sky for signs of life
- There, overhead - a
It grows in size, getting closer and arriving fast
and gradually, it shapes into Hancock
65
He swoops into view, straight downward
Pulls on the air brakes and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side
He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped together tightly
(like a little girl) Let's see
You have to be quick
Come on,  want to see
If you blink, you'll miss it
Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy  of white something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into moisture
It showers into his open hands
Mary reaches for it
Too late
saw it, right
little cloud
She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains
And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain
Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his
He stares down at her hand
at the wedding ring
Mary-pulls her hand away
(' ) The water is dirty
'm sorry
(into his eyes) It's not your fault
66
Hancock looks away
(') () You're tense
've been tired, lately
You should slow down
Rest
-So people tell me
(heat; upon some thought) It must be hard
Hard
To always do right
do good when all you want to do is rest
It's harder to not do anything
What am It's not for me
It's for
it is about people
Rest
When there is despair
cannot
bring relief
am relief
You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare
the totality of fear itself
that it's all been a bad dream
That it's safe
That is relief
The infant in my arms
to the hysterical mother
When you can see her face, what's rest
It is self-indulgence
Mary - in some advance stage of "wow
" Where
who are you
It's not important who  am, Mary
Or what
where 'm from
It doesn't matter
'm a man
am every man
67
(sizing up his words) You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do
Why
do you say that
It's like, everything you say sounds
so perfect
Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way
mean, not to say that it's insincere
() mean, maybe it's something about you but
it must be hard on you sometimes
Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer
(' ) () But probably not
probably
Yes
(pulling teeth) sometimes
Mary allows the moment to sink in
So, you never answered
Back there
what were you doing in the middle of the street
() was lost
() but  think 'm ok, now
: - Trash cans fly
Paper, swept up and sent aflutter
We've seen this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in pell-mell pursuit
He cuts into an alley
Looses them momentarily
Finds a to his liking
68
Erlick
Spengler
They zoom by and with great eagerness
Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat
From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them
looks relieved
until conscience kicks in
moment to reflect, he takes
() " before long, you're running, looking for a place to hide
" - Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end
Their trail leads them to a metal , the alley continuing beyond it
No time wasted they scale it
Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other side
Spengler pulls himself over
Joins Erlick on the ground
Shit, 'm not climbing this
Just combed my hair
Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars
Their eyes are of disbelief
(') What's up
(checks his hair) What
Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering with clenched fists
(') (rolls up sleeves) just combed my hair
Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray
(') Don't bother
He's mine
(to Aaron) No biting
hate biting
Kick his ass, Percy
() Do him, Percy
He's your woman
69
Let's go
Let's have it
While we're still kids
Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls
(') Dick wad, let's go
Come on, you impotent little gonad
() Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny, purple-headed shlongs the size of
All Aaron needs to hear
He charges - comatose
And the pummeling begins
Perceval dictates the assault, landing to the face and body
Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag
He wafts at air, left and right
He's yours
Save some for us
Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine
Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky
He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing
look of recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon
He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick into Perceval's peeing apparatus
faint  eructs from the fellow's mouth
He drops like a wet tea bag
Erlick
Spengler
Shock
Disbelief
Aaron gets to his feet, ready to book
but he doesn't
He stays
What's he doing
Kick his ass, Percy
Aaron stares at them, behind the fence
Then down at Perceval fetal position, mouth agape
Aaron reaches for his zipper , revenge presents itself
That's cold
0
Kill him, Percy
Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral orifice
Contemplates his target
Aaron - to pee or not to pee
He closes his fly
Steps away
(to the boys) Don't mess with me
He struts out of the alley
Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away
: - Horus sleeps
Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush
She moves to the closet
Changes out of her clothes
Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet
Mary stands before the closet mirror
Does a profile check
She reaches for her bra
and from the mirror, catches Horus staring,
You're still up
She moves behind the bathroom door
Self-conscious
Just get in
Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic attire
She nods affirmatively
Nick's market
Are you sick
can't sleep
She goes to the bed
Palms his forehead with her right
Palms her own with the left, as reference
Horus tilts his head away from her hand
71
(') Please, Mary
You want some milk
'll heat it up for you, how about that
No thank you
() Aaron, today
This Hancock 's picking up Yes, he is
He sits there in bed, struggling with the words
Mary continues dressing - oblivious
He'll take him home
Yes
What do we know about this man
The papers
they don't have all the facts about him
What facts
He's not a hero
Yes
hero
know that
Aaron likes him
() know that maybe, 've been neglectful
that  haven't been there
Mary does not hear him
She's at the mirror, fixing her hair
(' ) () 'm trying
you have to know
'd like to be more
involved
Like it used to be
Before we moved here
() 72
(' ) (notices Mary, applying ) Are you going somewhere
No
have to start on dinner
So how about that glass of milk
Horus - shakes his head, annoyed
(' ) All right
Try to get some sleep
With that, she's out the door
Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face
He spots a brown paper  on the chair
Goes to inspect
Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat
Oy, what does it mean
Horus returns to bed, distraught
He buries himself under the cover
- Aaron races down the
last leg of his street
On the steps of his apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home
Yes, a cigarette smolders from his lips
Hancock looks at the boy
They share a second of silence
And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves
Aaron, triumphant,  it for five
: - The dinner table
Post meal
Mid-digestion
Aaron is running off at the mouth
o his mouth was
open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad
And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child
Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned
(
) () said, "don't mess with me
" Just like that
() 73
(') "Don't mess with me
" Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie
he said that
All right, already
How's your mouth
It doesn't hurt,  told you
() He saw everything from the roof
Said did what  had to do
() Aaron, tomorrow
(to Mary; oblivious) He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again
thought maybe you'd like it -- if pick you
God, my friends will freak
Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard
- Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work
framed  of a distinguished  (50's) sits on the shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern and proud
Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph
He closes the closet door
- On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron, mother giving son a
Hold still
like it long
Shut up
74
Horus walks into the living room,
in the dark
He looks at his wife, then at his son - doing their own thing
They don't realize he's there
Horus leaves, the door' shut behind him
(') Horus
it's almost eight
Dad's late
Horus
She brushes hair off her apron
Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband
She goes to the front door
Opens it into the stairway outside
There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up
Mary sees him
and they look at each other
- In the kitchen and under the light, Mary
Hancock
Aaron
Mary is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last
like this
(holds up hand) How do you make a fist
(grabs his head) Aaron, hold it
Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes
So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones
It  at Aaron
Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them
Aaron swallows - in awe
Mary watches her guest, the change in him
(') Hancock
The sound of her voice takes him
He snaps out of it
15
(' ) ( ) turn
Hancock, it's yo ur What
Your hair
Come on, have a seat
Mom's going butcher your hair
Shut up, kid
Hit the showers
And the n homework
Oh, mom
want to talk to him
Tell her, Hancock
Hancock shrugs a "what can  do
" (' ) Yeah, right
know
got to do what got to do
- The Big Haircut
Mary and Hancock - up close
Mary runs her fingers through his hair, testing his length
She leans into him
, goes her scissor
Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble
He seems a bit lost in her presence
Baffled
From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her sweater
And that's it
Not a word during this process - just the of their breaths
- Hancock
Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut - he looks plain and un-super
He looks
goofy
There
my hero
He inspects himself via a hand
Smiles
Politely
76
(') () How do you like it
Nice
Thank you
Mary - peripatetic, putting away things
started out just trimming for Horus
Here and there
He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there
in Philly
When we moved here,  pretty much took over as the resident barber
You know, to save some money
He was in the-police academy
pause
His father's idea
Not his
He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove
the validation of his manhood
() It tpok everything out of him
He didn't talk for days after he was cut
He took it real hard
mean, still, he's not
mean,, he's still
(edits herself) it was a difficult time for hi
Me understand that 'm not intolerant of it, the working-through process
It's just that, sometimes
(at Hancock) sometimes,  need his strength miss
the strength
Is that what you want
Want
What you need
The hair
need to
77
She kneels to sweep up hair
Hancock follows her down
Mary
Yes
() You ever been down the boardwalk, at night
Why
what for
They're eye to eye
Close
(
) Mom
Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly
Aaron stands in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower
Yes
Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock
Nah
my mouth
It's starting to swell think he loosened a tooth
Mary - maternal duty calls
All right
Go to your room
'll get the ice pack
Aaron exits
Mary exits
Hancock - alone and on his knees
He finally rises
Heads for the front door
Mary returns with the ice pack
Catches him
(' ) You're leaving
It's getting late
78
'm sorry
'm going to take a walk
Really
On the boardwalk
Maybe
Pause
(
) Mom
' 'm sorry
She goes to him, without words to say
In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought
() Good night, Mary
Good night
'   - The clock - 9:45 pm
The store rests in afterhour stillness
Horus paces by the side door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer
He hangs up
Checks his watch
Goes to the front entrance and peers out at the street - no Roheim
- The bar
The smoke
The scums of humanity
Gina - over there, marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis
She mingles with a
Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat
From an adjacent stool,   places his hand on Hancock's lap
Whispers to him
79
wear dresses
How about you
(considers; nah) Get lost
The warning comes across quite well - the man exits
Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy
At the other end, the bar fly rises
Pays
Heads pass them, for the door
(to bar fly) Meet you outside
The El Camino, right
The bar fly nods
Exits
Gina turns to Hancock
Takes his face in her hands, studies him
(') Your eyes are calm
It's good
She withdraws her hands
What
But you're still here
She rises
And as she makes for the exit
(') Nice haircut
Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole
He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive
: '   - The clock, it reads 1:05 am
Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds
His routine takes him outside - via an  door
'   - dark alley
Dumpsters
Boxes
Horus peruses the premises
Heads around the building and to the street
:
80
as a ragged  collapses onto
him
It's Roheim and he's been drinking, right
Dear God
Horus catches him
' - They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the light
The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling
chunk of lip dangles, bleeds
Jesus
Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels
Comes back to nurse' the wounds
Figured  can get you by the front
but you weren't there
(dabbing the torn lip) Who
what happened
They-jumped me
That bastard Scarpo and his boys
They were waiting on me
Returns to get more clean towels
And comes back
Why didn't you come through the back
standing out there in the dark
-Couldn't find my keys
Must've dropped them'in the fight
(feels his lip) Shit
He works himself off the chair
Heads inside the bathroom
What're you doing
81
(into the mirror) the old man Look at what they did
gave a fat lip to match his big mouth
'm for shit
() Sit down Could you knock it off, please
so  can clean the cuts
He leads the old wretch back to the chair
'm a waste of time
Stop
'm too old for this
You're not old
What am
'm biologically challenged
Any way you look, 'm a waste of effort
() Use to be,  blame the job
The job
think, bullshit job
Not right for a man
"To observe and record
"  say, what a t's for the hell is DIo nly dogs
They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the carpet
Horus looks away
Doesn't want to hear it
(') () But you know what, Horus
That's all wrong
It ain't the job
The job don't make the man
It's me
Not the uniform
It starts right here
'cause  can't do anything right
Fuck up my 's
(a beat; at Horus) But you
Why do you put up with this crap
wife
kid
There
waiting for you at home
Horus - he just doesn't know anymore
82
- On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a Marlboro
Eyes red
Hair in wet dishevelment
He's a mess
got to do what you got to do
He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand
We sense a decision brewing
- desk clock points to 2:30 am
Mary - awake undercover
She twists, turns
shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in the room
Mary catches it
Rises above her blanket
What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non- gravity
He stares directly at her
know you're up, Mary
know you can hear me
Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning
Nine o'clock
It's important that  talk to y ou, then
() Please, Mary
And with that, he's off and away
Mary
- stunned
: '  - We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up the stairs
They're going to can me
No one's canning anyone
No one saw us
watch your step
leave
Should be an extra key over the door
83
- In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine
Something is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the machinery
Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts
She rushes back to the stove - her eggs beckoning
The toast's burnt
What
Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox
We're late
you forgot the corn chips
Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up
1
and down
and all over the place
Eat
and we'll go
(checks her watch) Where's your father
She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair
You forgot the corn
(the comb snags) ouch
'm'sorry, honey
was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave
'm sorry
You having your period, mom
She responds with a brisk slap to the head
'  - We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room
Horus ushers Roheim in
Shoes
The two pause
Remove their shoes
Proceed into bedroom
84
- Horus sets Roheim down on the bed
Tucks him under
You're going to be okay
don't know
You might have solo act tomorrow night
Get some sleep
You're a good man, Horus
(washing over it) have to get home, now
'll call
Roheim grabs on to his sleeve
You know what Olga said before she walked out on me
Her last words to me
She turned at the front door
Looked around the room and she says, "keep it clean
" That's it, can you believe it
Then out the door
() But like a
shmuck,
keep the place spotless
in case she walks through that door one day
(at Horus; with pain) don't think she's coming back
- Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger, despair, a combination thereof
He moves down his street
Looks ahead - where Clyde stands, pillaging his morning paper
Clyde Spots Horus on the approach
Smiles at him, with impunity
Goes back in
On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth
- Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus
steadies down the hallway
His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red
85
He gets there, the door
He swallows
Wipes sweat off his hand
And again,
i12ow He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed second
Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung
The door opens
And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly
He's holding up his pants with one and the   with the other
Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy
The box scores are waiting and  got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass
Make it snappy
(loosing his voice) 'd like my sports page, please
You what
want you to stop taking my sports page
All right
Clyde closes the door
Horus - thunderstruck
He stutter-steps
(' ) () What's the matter, you deaf
'll stop taking your sports page
Now get out of here and let me
() want today's sports page
You what
That there
my sports page
86
What's gotten in to you
All of a sudden
You don't even like football
Horus does
not budge
(') () You'll get it back
after  take my dump
Clyde proceeds to close the door
but Horus interjects, his foot in the door
No
What
No
would like my sports page now
Please
After  finish
'd prefer it now
What's eating you, Longfella
You crazy
Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm a kamikaze move, indeed
(') () Give that back
Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's midsection
Harmless - it tickles him, maybe
(') Why'd you go and do that for
Clyde belts up has pants
Roles up his sleeves
, and the massacre commences
He simply tears into Horus
to the stomach across the face
It ends quickly and without resistance - as if Horns accepted it as fate
87
Clyde 'kneels over
Picks up the sports page
And as if yawning, returns to his room
/ : - By the fence - Mary and Aaron
Mary, with a brown paper , seems
distant, preoccupied in a far away place
Are you all right, mom
() Yeah
why
You're acting weird
(didn't hear) What
'm late for class
Go home, mom
think it's time for your nap
Aaron leaves
Pensive, Mary begins her walk
to the boardwalk
- The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged, disoriented
He confronts an empty apartment
Mary
deaf ear
No one's there to console him
He storms out of the apartment
- The ocean  against the shore, in the distance and at some muffled volume
Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a cigarette
His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a while, one would suspect
88
(
) Come back here
Stop him
In the background, a  commences pursuit on a
The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock
The cop follows suit, passing by
(') Stop him
Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters
- Horus stumbles
Keeps his balance
Trudges down the street to a corner
- The bar is empty at this hour
The chairs are up, the floor swept
husky  unloads liquor in the back
Horus enters
Finds a stool
Drink
The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance
(' ) () Is this a bar
or what
Drink
(uncomfortable with his own ) Please
- Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms
It's cold this morning
little wind has picked up
And the clouds - they're alive, restless
She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for
her
Hi
() Thank you for being here
Is everything all right
89
Hancock has no response
(' ) () What's wrong
(constipated; following some ) It's cold
Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together
(') (at the clouds) They're moving
The turbulence has started
Tell me what's wrong
He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness
Look out there and what do you see, Mary
() Nothing
don't know
don't see anything
see it,can It's out there
But you can't nu
(beat; holding on to a thread) And that's good, not seeing
But for me, 've seen it
It's where 'm from
out there
Please, Hancock
What are you talking about
What's out there
Duty
(beat; at Mary) You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you
He'll say: "you do what you have to do
" Or what
You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't
if you can't
(losing it) And
but
If  can't, then who
() 90
(') The next guy
No
There is no " can't

the blood
and  deal with it

it's everywhere
And it stays
All that  can do, Mary
The things  am capable of doing,  can't blink away the hell 've seen
It's in me

It's in me
It's me

Get away to where

Hancock leans forward
Towards Mary
And kisses her
Their lips lock, twisted and entwined
until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away

To whom

The death blow
No
(turns from her) Unacceptable
love him
'm sorry
One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel
Mary wants to console
but what can she do
'm cold
Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat
'm sorry
92
She leaves
: - Aaron
The school hallway
He holds a wooden hall , indicating that class is in session
He swings into the
- large restroom - empty
Little Aaron passes up on the urinals
Selects a private
- urination begins
Splash segues into drip
Aaron shakes off the last drop
And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot
He can't see but, from behind, the stall door opens
Guess who
Perceval - possessed
He grabs the back of Aaron's head
Introduces it to the yellowed waters below
- the head goes in, submerged
What Aaron sees for the next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of
bubbles, the shine
-of white porcelain at
intimate range
What he hears: the  of his own breath, , and wicked laughter
The ambush ends
Perceval
Erlick
Spengler
One of them says
() "Don't mess with me
" They leave - laughing
(') (in the distant) Little shit
Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl
On the tile floor
wet rag of piss
93
- Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing wild
She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in Horns
The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home
Horus
: - The school front
swarm into the streets, freshly released from captivity
And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and soiled in disgrace
He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away
No Hancock, anywhere
Aaron waits, hopeful
- Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a   in his hand
He's been drinking
"i in his path and up ahead, a little girl  (8) beckons at the upper branches of a tree
(so innocent, her voice) Hymie
Come down, Hymie
She catches Hancock, Mr
Superhero who can fly, stumbling by
(' ) () Mister
My Hymie won't come down from the tree
Hancock's reaction - "what
" (') () My pussycat
She won't come down
She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent eyes
94
So cool, Hancock reaches down for a  - takes it in his palm
Finds the little pussy named Hymie
And with a simple flick of the wrist
shoots it down
sharp
punctuates the task
Hymie drops from the branch, limp and lifeless
we hear on impact
(') (so innocent, her voice) Holy fuck
Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky
- Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to
buildings
He strikes the corner of a brick tower, plummeting downward with the dislocated debris
He bounces off the concrete -
in an alley
- Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be
She checks h er watch
- The place is empty
Deserted
Aaron
On the curb
Some trash flutters by his feet
On his face - the abandonment of all hope
Nobody's coming, this is clear
- Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble
He braces the building to get up
Drops
Gets to his feet, only to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk
We'll call this one officer  - a beat cop with something stiff up his ass
What do we have here
piece of shit
slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that superguy
Hancock stares at him
95
() Fuck off
He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly
- Aaron
Walking home
Dejected
His eyes catch a glimpse of particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock
He gives chase
and confronts him, out of breath
(a slight smile) Hi
(turning; drunk) What're you doing here
(the smile fades) saw you walking
Where were you today
You said you'd
be there
Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame
don't know what you're talking about
Where are you going
Can  go
You don't want to go where 'm going
Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today
(trying to hold on) and you said you'd pick me up at school
Hancock turns
He's upset now
Listen
Aaron recoils
(' ) () Listen
'm not here to save you
() 96
(') No, not my job
Don't put that on me
(pounds his chest) Not my problem
Not on my shoulders
Deal with it, kid
You are what you are and
what  say, it won't do you any change
You'll grow up to be just like-your old man
coward
Not a damn thing you can do about it
'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle
Aaron backs away from his angry wrath
(' ) () That's right
Walk away
Me
'm not here to save you
He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed against the rocks
In Hancock's eyes - a
glint of regret
But only a glint
- This empty bar
With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's drying some mugs, let's call him  (30)
() One
more
Joey studies him
He takes a mug and begins to fill it
(') No
nevermind
(going to blow) Where's your bathroom
(not in my place) Bathroom's closed
Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit
How much
() Let's see
that's one beer
Tell you what
'll take care of this one
97
Thank you
The register ain't open yet, anyhow
Horus doesn't hear him
He's already on the move, making a dash for the door
But too late - he  at the front entrance
(') Shit
- In the armpit of town - Hancock
He lights a cigarette with the matchbook Gina had given him earlier
At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all her glory
've been waiting
They stare for one horny beat
Hancock moves into her
Buries his head into her bosoms, looking for solace
She takes him in, very maternal this Gina
\
/ - The front door opens, but slowly
Aaron steps inside
From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition
He sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs s obbing into her arms
: - phone booth - Gina's office
There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and Gina, their organs ensnared
They're pumping away
Up
Down
surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of her leather
Come on, baby
Relax
can't
98
You can
The phone begins to  - but they're busy
can't
Let it go, baby
Just let it

His arm rips through the glass

() Oh god
can't
He  a hole into the phone - killing it
' Don't give up, now
He lets her down
Tears out of the booth
Finds the sky
- There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and grooves in clouds once coy and demure
The wind  its presence, toys with fallen leaves
'
- It's dinner - but all is not well
Mary and Aaron and an empty chair
' They sit without talking
They eat without making a sound
Between them - a ketchup bottle
The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus
He locates his chair and plops on it
misses
kisses the carpet

Go to your room
Struggles to his knees
What happened toyou
Dad, are you wasted
Where
Aaron, he's not wasted
Go to your room

Horus rises, under great difficulty
Feels his way to the sofa
When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away
Aaron
Go to your room

Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace

Horus gauges her
Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary

Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength

Why do you say that
Because  let you down

She bounces over to the bathroom, as the door  shut

And in disgust, he swipes  off the sink

Thug #1 whirls around with a gun, catching Horus off guard
Horus responds with a  he had acquired from the camera section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug
And a quick  of the bat takes out Thug #1
Horus dispenses of the camera, his adrenaline raging
He commandeers the free gun, heads downstairs
But the  stops him

(grabs him) It'll never go away
Hancock responds to "it
" (' ) () If you've got anything left
inside
(hand over heart) and you do,  know you do
whatever it was that you felt for me
inside
then you won't go out there
He just looks at her
(') () Just let go
and it'll go away
Please, just let go

- Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man
He wants a fight
And he gets it
as Hancock, once again, emerges from the building - fire in his eyes
You ready to rock it up
Horus runs - he runs for an overturned
Hancock follows, toying with the man
Horus disappears inside
(' ) Come out, you little shit
pause in action - no reply from Horus
(') Are you a man
Horus answers
He storms out with a
He  it at the unsuspecting Hancock
It's a hit and it Hancock against Killybegs Textile
It lodges him inside the brick structure
Fuck you
Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable
He - looking to retaliate
But there's no Horus
Hancock explores the rubble - by the building
sudden rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose, sending it crashing down
, on Hancock
, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him
He shakes off the dirt
Finds Horus down the street
Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way
He gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar
With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying
as his body careens off the Killybegs wall
He drops to the asphalt below
Horus - in pain, something broken possibly
123
He gets up
Tries to walk
Can't
Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace towards his wounded game
Horns tries to crawl
Can't
Too much pain
He peddles back against the curb, nowhere left to go
Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed
He stands over Horus - not unlike Scarpo much The situation presents itself - he reacts
kick into Hancock's groin muscle - , sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs
bone off metal
Absolutely harmless
Horus else can he do
Hancock tears a  street  it backs Ready to strikei12 es this piece of jagged metal

Horns
Hancock
They turn to witness the de-physicalization of Killybegs Textile
they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks
beams
and tear of recent artillery
Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give
It slips
she
and collapses, taking the rest of the building with it
, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke
Mary is no more
Aaron
Roheim
In disbelief

() Mom
Horus, he struggles to his feet
Pushes past Hancock, limping over to the building that once was
Hancock - not a word
He stands in comatose silence, looking pale
Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to excavate his wife - one brick at a time
Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console
(
) (you're wasting your time) Come on, Horus
Horus - lost in the pain
He won't listen
Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation
He r olls up his sleeve and gets to work
Hancock drops the yield,sign
Turns to the battlefield in his midst
surveys the carnage
loaded beat
Hancock  - a cry of desperation
He grimaces with defeat
Staggers off
, because what else can he do
Falls to his knees
by a fallen police
He picks it up
points it at his head
the remaining rounds against his temple
Bullets carom off skull
Hancock discards the gun
Breaks into
Long  wet tears
He
He
Into his cupped hands
Indeed, a surreal sight
Horus
Roheim
Engaged to the task, brick by brick
Horus works his way down
to a lifeless , protruding from its tomb
He stops
