Written by Mark Bomback & Patrick Marber September 15th,  2005 resting face up on a black surface
beat of silence           -- is broken by its abrupt
Move in tighter on the phone's
number comes up:                  555-3827 hand enters frame
We follow it to a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone
The hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find a list of handwritten numbers
At least fifty
To this series is now added 555-3827
: - We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over which we hear the  of computer keys
( )                       - wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek conference room
Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table, empty save for &   at the far end - a lonely figure hunched over a laptop
Steadily tighten on   (late 20s), trim build not entirely at ease in a suit
Likeable features suggest a gentle, intelligent demeanor
Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his glasses
Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing
- Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty cubicles
In a few offices lights are still on; the figures of     at work are blurred like photos out of focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors
- Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk
Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet
The grizzled   behind the counter doesn't look up
It is tomorrow
() 2
: Right
forgot
The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers
As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display
Naked women smile back at him -- Anything else
Uh - no
No that's it, thanks
- Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop
Neighborhood streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound
Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first floor marked by unlit neon: "
" He ascends the steps, his keys out -- '                                                    (
) Jonathan
The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent, standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket
Solange, you're up so late
So early, Jonathan
We open in one hour
() So tell me, you have been out with a lady friend, oui
() Je suis desole, madame, mais no
But why else does a young man come home at such an hour
Just working late, that's all
Every night working late, working late
(teasing him) Ah, you can't fool me
You are Mister Mischief maker -  know this
You come by () 3
: (') later and pick out something for your lady friend, oui
'  - Very modest
Furnishings are nice, but sparse
Jonathan hangs his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers
' Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster and an old tennis trophy
Jonathan lies in bed, flipping channels on a small
Typical late night stuff: infommercials; ; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel " (public access) on which -rated clips advertise phone sex
Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks back to, the roaring soccer crowd
He closes his eyes and drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer
-   - are talking shop while pouring coffee
(0
) Excuse me
Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them
They barely give him a glance as they continue their conversation
1 So, the Knicks win last night
2 'm pretty sure, yeah
Actually, they lost by 4
Both pause, turn to Jonathan
Jonathan smiles awkwardly
It was supposed to be a good game though
1 Oh
(back to Lawyer 2) Hey, so
did you get a chance to look over that memo from Watkins
- Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his coffee past  and  talking shop
He smiles () 4
: politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return
-
Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table, rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop, beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post- its on which are scribbled various calculations
He strikes us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming array of numbers and data with methodical assurance
Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before him
Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank
'  -- In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the stall's marble door -- when a sudden - on the divider to his right startles him
He peers down and over, to expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St
Journal spread on the floor
Another -
Confused, Jonathan turns to address the divider: Yes
(
) Take a look at this
The voice sounds youthful, energetic
Its owner slides his Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division
(
) The Japanese are developing a toilet that can analyze your urine for glucose levels, kidney disease, even cancer
They're referring to it as the "super bowl
" That certainly is                                               - something
(
) Of course if you've ever been to Japan, you know they're nuts about their toilets
'm talking web sites, symposiums
Jonathan chuckles
(
) You think 'm kidding
They have bowls over there that cost more than a piano
What  want to know is how you're supposed to retrieve this analysis - you know, from your super bowl
() 5
: Maybe they're developing a fly with a nursing degree
superfly
(
) () Who's in there anyway
Uh, Jonathan Messer
(
) Messer
What department
None
'm from Worth and Berman
've been over here a few wee-- from the next stall cuts him off
The sound of zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening
(
) So you're an accountant
Jonathan follows the , now addresses his stall door
Audit manager, yeah
(
) So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires Worth and Berman to give their blessing to our books, and they send you
Have laptop, will travel
What about you
(
) What about me
Well,  didn't get your name for one
th-- The      drowns him out
(
) ose
Sorry -  didn't catch that
(gets no response) Hello
() 6
: (
) said it's Wyatt
Wyatt Bose
Jonathan , buckles his belt, opens his stall door - - only the men's room is now empty
( ) Message-four
Three-oh-eight-pee-em
- Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell phone
We
find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger
(
) Jonathan
Chet Peterson
Just wanted to- confirm you're wrapping up over there at Rutherford Stern because the controller at Clancey has been on me to get someone in there by Thursday
told him how brilliant you are, said you're the best auditor we've got
Anyway,  forwarded you some documentation
Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in worth&berman
com
He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week
Other than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank
- Jonathan still working
Only a few of the post-its now remain on the tabletop
Yawning, he glances at his watch - (
) 12:53                                                            a
m
Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the' doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice: Sorry if  scared you
was heading home and saw the lights
We met before, in the can
Sure
It's Wyatt, right
nods as he steps into the room
There's something very likeably "on" about him
() : So do you normally work this late
Pretty much
'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so 'm just trying to finish up
What about you
You kidding
This is an early night
Hard to believe that once upona time a man's success was measured by how little he had to work
You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation
(regards his stacked files) Do-you like accounting
It's all right, if you enjoy working with numbers
Do you like being a lawyer
It's all right
If you enjoy working with assholes
Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen
Well, 'm probably disturbing you - No - it's okay
Really
So Worth and Berman, huh
Don't you have to like be in Mensa to work there
Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly
Been with them long
Since my senior year of college
They subsidized my graduate degree
Really
So you were poor
Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question
() : Well -  guess you could say that
was raised by a single mother, and she died when  was nineteen, so
yeah
It wasn't so bad though
'm sure a lot of people have had it worse
Not around here
Practically every suit know is Harvard by way of Andover
Are you
Me
Hell no
'm Princeton
By way of Exeter
Jonathan laughs
Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces
So
Jonathan
() What do you say to a break
: Tilt up from Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint, staring out at the rain hammering the far windows
() It's just sometimes  feel so -  don't know - removed
mean,  work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world, and
there's not so much as a desk there to prove it
They've decided all we need are cell phones and laptops
Messages are voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's deposited online
Chet Peterson, my senior manager
swear he wouldn't recognize me if  was sitting in his chair
Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts: don't know
used to have friends
But it's like 've spent so much time trying to prove myself, working these hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before you look up and realize you've lost () 9
: (') everyone
Just - fell out of touch
With everyone
And  try to meet people at work
do
But it's always the same
To the accounting staff 'm a pain because for two weeks they have to hold their breath and hope  don't pick up on any of their screw ups
And to everyone else, 'm just a temporary fixture, so why bother
The truth is, this is the first meaningful conversation 've had in  don't know how long
It's like if  disappeared tomorrow, 'm not
sure anyone other than Solange would even notice - she's my neighbor live on what must be the only block in Brooklyn that still isn't hip
() guess  just never counted-on the isolation
It's like sometimes  look through that glass, and  see life literally passing me by
Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence
Jonathan
Yeah
By the clock on the wall there
You've just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight
Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up
Jonathan hesitates, then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by the
-  - Jonathan hurries in the cold
rain for the Times Square subway
He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue he spots a beautiful   in a camel hair coat, clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street
Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping
She's surrounded by pedestrians with umbrellas
, she's the only one without one and she's
But she seems content to entertain herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the umbrella in front of her
Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the subway below reminds him he'd better move
10
- Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his glasses steamed up
He takes them off to wipe the lenses
' : the entire station is a blur, all unfocused, muted colors, no object discernible from another - - until his glasses return his  to immediate focus, and he sees the same Young Woman in'the camel
hair coat, a pair of dollar bills in her hand, entering the station
Jonathan can't help but stare again
Despite her business attire, there's an almost childlike lightness
to her step
Jonathan notices her slim briefcase
Beneath her hand, he can make out the first letter of a monogram: "
" She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers waiting, then decides life's too short
She continues past, headed for the turnstiles
Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase, then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow gap in the turnstile
on the other side watches her with amusement
Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous smile
Once she's through, she drops her money into his collection - and slips out of view
, still stuck on line, staring at the space she vacated
-- Jonathan arrives as an  train pulls away, the platform now practically
empty
Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns - And then he sees "" is waiting on the same platform
Ten yards away
He gazes at her
She's unwrapping some
He watches as she puts a piece in her mouth
The sound of an
"" heads for it, Jonathan follows
The train halts
The door before him is the last of its car, the door before her the first of the next
The doors open
() 11 : a (turns to Jonathan) Excuse me, is this the train for canal Street
It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice
She's even more arresting up close
Uh,
either one is                                               --  mean the  and the both stop there so, you know, either way,  mean, this is the right train
Yes
Of Thanks
"" enters her car
Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her car but doesn't have the nerve
He enters a different car
- Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed
at himself for not getting in her car
He can see ''
She sits in the other car chewing her gum
He studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her
(
) Next stop Canal Street
Canal is next
He sees "" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a door
Jonathan stands up - his last chance
Determined, he braces himself and rises, grasping his briefcase
The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "
" sudden  of the braking train
causes Jonathan to stumble slightly and his briefcase  against a seat and - contents tumbling out
His cell phone hits the floor
Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell phone a few feet along the grimy floor
we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs for his phone a second before it's stepped on
He hurriedly stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet - - to find the doors closing, and "" gone
() 12
: Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as the train begins to depart
He can just glimpse the back of her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel
He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head
-   - Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2
Caught up in telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan
Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance up
His eyes meet Jonathan's
Jonathan smiles in greeting - but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers
Jonathan's smile falters
He exits wordlessly
- Jonathan hands over files and -Roms to a less than sociable guess that's it
then
Nice meeting you
Uh huh
Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back
Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose's office
The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance
Wyatt Bose
He's an attorney here
She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped
Jonathan's eyes follow her lazy finger down the list -- (
) Hey, quit looking down her shirt
Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor
Leaving, huh
So where to next
() 13
: Clancey Funds on Thursday
Clute Nichols after that
Wyatt's about to reply - when   passes him in the hall
Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder
Hey, wait up a sec
(smiles back) Well, good meeting you, Jonathan
,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer
Jonathan bends for his briefcase - (
) Wait, so you have off tomorrow
Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall
You don't happen to have
a
decent backhand, do you
- Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play mixed doubles with two attractive   (early 20's)
Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net Wyatt chatting up his partner
The rapport between Jonathan and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return
- good rally underway
Jonathan fires a backhand
Wyatt returns it with an audible grunt
Jonathan snaps the ball back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it back
Jonathan returns it with equal force
grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back each ball
The women step aside
Jonathan lunges, barely managing to lob a return
Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball
Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head
but it lands two inches outside the opposite baseline
Out
() 14
: Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air
Silence - then Wyatt's   echoes in the humid space
Commiserations, Messer
Good game
They shake hands at the net
Jonathan is exhausted
() Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat the crap out of me
Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's already gone to join her friend
Jonathan crashes out on the court
From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter
The girls finally wave goodbye
Wyatt hops over the net
They asked if we'd fancy a post-game cocktail
Don't worry,  got us out of it
Jonathan is barely able to speak
Oh
would've been happy to
Are you kidding
They're a couple of first years at Merrill
Screw that, we can do better
Hey, you
Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet
Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area
Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket
Man,  remember when these first came out
think  was a frosh at boarding school
(chuckles; fingers a string) Jeez, are these strings natural gut
Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut and Kevlar
They're pretty obscure now should replace them, they're all frayed
() 15
: Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar
From behind, it looks remarkably like ""
Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise
Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers
Jonathan still deep in the '' moment - Have you ever considered contacts
Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       - his eyeglasses in particular
Huh
Oh - yeah,  tried once, but  was allergic to something in the solution
Too bad
You have an attractive face
Your eyes especially
Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel
It's not a come on, just an observation
(considers him a beat) You don't get much, do you
What - you mean sex
No, flood insurance
How many women have you slept with
Oh,  don't know, not a whole- Of course you know
Everyone knows
Maybe - four
Maybe four
() 16 : Okay fine, just four
What about you
Me
have no idea
What
You just said everyone - meant everyone like you
Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a shower stall
- Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist as he walks toward the rows of lockers
(
) Tonight
Fine
'm on the list
Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a locker and talking on his cell phone
There better be
Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled
Something wrong
Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and pulls out his own cell phone
It's identical to Wyatt's
We have the same phone
Oh - and you thought  was using yours
can afford my own phone calls, you know
No,  wasn't                                                   -- of course you can- 'm pulling your dick, Jonathan
(grins, slams his locker) Actually,  was just firming up some plans for tonight
Are you free
() 17
: () Me
Sure,  guess                                               - but  don't want to - You're not
What do you say, are you in
guess  could go home and change
To Brooklyn
Forget it, you can borrow something of mine
'  - three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village neighborhood
As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they pass a papery-faced                                    (50s) in a fine suit
t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner
(glances back) This way, Jonathan
' Urban chic to a serious degree
Big terrace, funky furniture, framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image of a burning candle just slightly out of focus
Like it
It's a Gerhard Richter
Kleiner downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he hooked me up with the gallery in Munich
Wyatt disappears into the next room
Alone, Jonathan wanders, pauses by the framed snapshots
The young people in them are like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy
Jonathan pauses by one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair bleached blonde and loosely spiked
(
) Talk about a bad look
Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right behind him,
a slick, expensive  draped over his arm
() 18
: Here, try this one
(off Jonathan's hesitation) What
Nothing,  just hope  can pull it off
You hope you can pull it off
You know who you remind me of
James Getz
Who
guy  roomed with freshman year at Princeton
Real smart                                 - witty too, when you loosened him up
Only from day one, he just didn't fit in
For starters, he was dirt poor
But it wasn't that
See, there was always this boundary - this wall - between Getz and everyone else
You could argue we laid the foundation, but he built it
Built it by believing the lie
What lie
That he was any different
The clothes, the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all one big masquerade
Anyone can get in, you've just got to wear a costume
But Getz never got that
He assumed he could never scale the wall, when the truth is he was the only one guarding it
It never occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset
No one gets over like the guy who's just a face, an impression
We are - all of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be
So what happened to him
Who, James Getz
Oh - he killed himself
(hesitates a beat) You're pulling my dick, aren't you
Wyatt turns to him with a grave look
then smirks
() 19
: With both hands
Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit
: () in a vintage bowler hat
He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders: And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine, the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour
- An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s Parisian decor
Strictly  , male and female, sip from crystal barware, while on stage a performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease
Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted with
an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag films play silently
All part of the wink-wink ambience
It's a little self-conscious, but thought you'd get a kick out of it
How's that suit working out
Oh - great, actually
Keep it then
've got two just like it
Jonathan's about to protest, when a  arrives
Two Macallan 25 year
Enjoy, gentlemen
Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass
We'll try not to spill any
(regards the floor show) So what's the wildest thing you've ever done
Sexually,  mean
() 20
: The wildest thing
Oh  don't know, 've never been too adventuresome
All right, what's the lamest thing then
The lamest
Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it
Actually, that was probably a few months ago
was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back
It read something like "Are
you feeling all alone
Looking to meet women but have forgotten how
" And-there was this number
And you called it
So what happened
Nothing actually
The phone just kept ringing
And that's it
Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up
Lame enough for you
You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine
That is beyond lame
Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table lights'up
Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then picks up
He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan
Hello
Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan
All right
Goodbye
Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt
She wants to dance
21
- Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old Edith Piaf ballad
He looks over her shoulder to his table, where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone
Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud smile
Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself
The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear
' Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan returning alone, looking deflated
She's a hooker
Wyatt shrugs, grinning
Hold on - you knew
What - are all the women here prostitutes
That depends on what you mean by that word
Stretch the definition and you could incorporate most of the men as well
(sips his drink) You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only belong to a union, they have to pay taxes
You seem to possess quite a store of international trivia
Not really
just get around
Jonathan, relax
It's not like she just shot your dog
was only trying to help
Besides, what are you looking for - a relationship
As if you have time for one
This was your first day off in how long
Three weeks
Four for me
Face it, we've mortgaged our youth
Pimped out our twenties
But we still have needs
And there's nothing shameful about wanting them met
() 22 : So you sleep with hookers
() Me
Never
So how do you - meet your needs
Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl
What if  told you
(breaks off, laughs) Christ,  sound like an infommercial
What were you going to say
Listen
You don't think that women have these same urges
Young women, just like ourselves, successful and working their asses off to stay that way
You better believe they do
And
And - well - let's just say, there's a way
a way it can be taken care of
You make it sound like a mob hit
Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show
- Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat
quiet beat
What you were talking about, before
Peoples' needs
Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin: Some other time
(to Cabbie) () 23
: (') At the corner, please
The Rhiga Royal
(to Jonathan) Listen,  have to meet someone
() Oh
okay
The cab pulls up before the
Hey
You had a good time tonight
Yeah
Yeah  did
Thanks
'm glad
Listen, that thing with the hooker, 'm really sorry if                                    - Forget it
It was funny
Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder
'll give you a call tomorrow
Wyatt                                                           climbs out
Jonathan watches through the cab window as Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby
: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in the glass
He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit
Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur
(To driver) Hey
Could you let me out at the next corner over there, on 7th Avenue
- Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw ""
He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog
Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted to the spot,
hoping he'll see that face in the crowd
After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it and heads down into the-subway
-    - Clancey's stiff                                       (50s) hovers nervously over Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table
() 24
: Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger, pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its
Any problems, you'll want to see Julie Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       - or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior accountant
If Werner's unavailable, we have two staff accountants                                     - but like said,  don't anticipate any problems mean we've never had any before, so
Right
just need the access codes for the accounts and sub-accounts
The Controller suddenly looks uneasy
You've got account numbers, but no access codes
Without those  can't get the banks to authorize statement verification
(beat; smiles) Besides, how else can  steal the money
What
Nothing,  was just pulling your-- leg do need those codes though, when you get a chance
- Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed
Jonathan is hunched over his laptop
Like Rutherford Stern's conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall
Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference to him
Slightly different tank, slightly different fish
: a Rutherford Stern masthead, beneath it Wyatt's name and office number
Jonathan picks up his cell phone and dials it
- (
) Hey, Jonathan
How'd you know it was- () 25
: (
) You really ought to block your caller
So - same place as yesterday
- Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare
It's here we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite
wonder what the Founding Fathers would make of this scene
Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat
'm just glad to be outside
(awkwardly heartfelt) 've got to tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch
used to just- cell phone
They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take out their identical phones
It's Wyatt's that's ringing
Jonathan rests his down on the ledge
Yes
Shit
Okay, see if you can
gettme on the 6:15                                                     out of  tonight
Fine
Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's
Rutherford needs me to join him asap in London to paper some financing with Lloyds
tell you about this
No - no you didn't
Yeah,  should be gone a few weeks
Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in
Sounds exciting
Nah, it'll be boring as sin
() 26
: Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises from the ledge
Shit, 'd better get back
You ready
-   - Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone and punches in some numbers
(
) '------- ------- He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded message
He hangs up -- when it abruptly , surprising him
He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it
Jonathan Mess- Dead air
More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger
-  - As ignored as ever, Jonathan is squeezed among  on their way home
speak in hushed tones: 1 That's just it
You caught him in a lie, so now everything he says you have to- of a cell phone
It's Jonathan's
Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk

He descends into the subway
Jonathan is heading for the  / when:

) Beneath the Eloise portrait

Only when the train passes can he hear the other end
But now there's no one there
Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns
Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its list of stored numbers
His expression says none are familiar
And  he gets it
- heavy-set  glances in his mirror at Jonathan in back, cell phone to his ear
() 28
: (into phone) Hi, it's Jonathan, 've got your cell guess you must have mine
imagine you're in the air now, but call when you get this
if you do
Oh, and you got a call from someone who 'm
forget it, just call me
Jonathan hangs up
So where ya visiting from
Excuse me
You're from out of town, right
() Me
No
Huh
can usually tell
You seem like a tourist
've lived here all my life
No offence, pal
The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South
Jonathan leans forward, peers up at the gorgeous French Renaissance facade
Well, here ya are
The Plaza
-  - Sheer elegance
Wealthy  stroll, chat, lounge
Hotel in immaculate uniforms greet, assist, etc
Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he spies a       grinning at him
- Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait, glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure -- () 29
: '                                                     (
) Pardon me, but may  ask you something - personal
Jonathan quickly looks
up, to find standing before him an attractive
She's
around his age, slender to the point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit
Are you waiting for me
- think so, yes
You're here for Wyatt, right
Excuse me
(hesitates, appraising him) 'm sorry, did we speak earlier
Yes
Yes we did - Good
Let's go then
- Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an The couple smile at the handsome pair
Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably
The Woman is staring at the lit numbers
He notices a   in her hand

She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips
No fooling
The doors open
She steps out

He follows
Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous
The Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room
What  mean to say is, 'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake
() 30
: She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him
You're not who  spoke with on the phone
No -  mean, yes, but - You're not attracted to me
Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          - It's just what
exactly
She turns, steps toward him
Jonathan opens his mouth to explain -- when she covers it with hers
It takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss
but not too long
--   - smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies lower to them
The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's tentativeness is all but gone
Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language: Fuck
: Jonathan lies post-coital
smile
And then a look of mild anxiety, 'what's going on'
He turns to the Blonde but she's fast asleep
- ',  - On the sound of a  , Jonathan's eyes squint open
Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all alone
clock radio reveals itself as the source of the we hear
The time reads:                  6:18   am
He rises, glances around the room
No sign of her
-   - Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a
() 31
: Sir, 'm showing that room as having checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning
Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there
'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests
If you give me her name,  can confirm if she was registered here
Actually, the thing is
it's okay
Forget it
- Jonathan exits to good tidings from the
Lost in his thoughts, it takes him a moment to respond
He starts to walk
His cell
He answers
Hello
' Hey, you're up early
Hi
How's London
' Raining
So you've got mine-and 've
got yours
Yeah
Listen, last night
um
met this- ' Damn
Sorry, 'm gonna have to call you back, they want me in a meeting
Hey, no long distance calls, okay
Wyatt hangs up
Jonathan shakes his head, amused
He hails a cab, glances back at the hotel
His lips curl into a vaguely proud, if still dazed, smile
32
- Jonathan sits alone at the long conference table, working but distracted
He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there
-      ' The numbers stored have no names associated with them
It's just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list of phone numbers that seems to go on and on
Jonathan clicks on a number at random
It highlights itself
Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again
The number is dialled
- a woman with an elegant   answers: (
0
) Yes

Now if you'll excuse me                                             - wait - Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up
(
) Yes
What to say
And then: (braces himself, swallows) Are you free tonight
He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up
long silence

Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief

Right
The Plaza

Perhaps the Mercer
Say by the Shakespeare, half past eleven
The Shakespeare
(

) It should be fairly evident
-  - The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza
By a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade - (
) Excuse me, um - 'm sorry to disturb you - She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of Shakespeare's " Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand
'm - supposed to meet someone here and- You're rather new to this, aren't you
Jonathan falters
She smiles
That's okay
like that
She enters first, then Jonathan
He waits for her
to push a button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same
'm sorry, what floor
She rolls her eyes
Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more
() 34 : Frankly 'm surprised that whoever gave you access didn't explain more
() Right then, the rules: One,
no names, no jobs                                                           - no nothing
Two, latex is mandatory and non-negotiable
Three, no rough stuff   - the only rule that's even remotely malleable provided there's mutual consent, although  say if that's your thing, take it elsewhere
And finally
She halts a few feet from the registration desk
The initiator is responsible for the room
(takes him a second) Oh - so  should
Precisely
Jonathan is holding a key card
British Accent is leaning against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin moment
The elevator doors open
-  - They are headed for a room as he ventures another question: So are there a lot of - people - who do this
She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when the     causes them to glance up: a is crossing past the far end of the hall
Jonathan turns back to find her staring at him uneasily
How did you get into this
Well, a friend of mine - He uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics
() 35
: He's                                                          - well, he was going out of town
(off her frown) 'm doing something wrong, aren't
It's not that, it's just
well, you strike me as something of a stowaway
In fact if  were more suspicious, 'd say you didn't belong here at all
Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation --- But obviously somebody felt you did
The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt
And 'm a sucker for bashful boys
She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm
and removes the key card from his hand
-   - Jonathan and British Accent having sex
She has his arms pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride
- - Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent
Can  ask you something
Why do you do this
Why are any of us doing this
For the economics of the arrangement
(rolls over, away from him) It's intimacy without intricacy
Jonathan's about to reply -- Look, 've got a 7                                            a

breakfast, so
She says no more
Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat
Well - good night
() 36
: She doesn't reply
-   - Jonathan
alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a bare few
He dials a number on 'his' cell: (into phone) Hey,  never heard back from you
guess you're busy
with stuff over there
(smiles to himself) 've been kinda busy too
've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone
- Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night
(
0
) 've got a feeling you did
You dog
can see you grinning right now
Jonathan returns the  's chipper greetings and steps inside -- (

Jonathan shakes his head, looking confidently past him to a seated inconspicuously among the various out-of-towners

He reaches for the phone, presses "Room Service

and a 36-count box of condoms
- Carrying his coffee mug, Jonathan suddenly slows, his eyes locked on The Blonde with whom he'd first been at the Plaza
Her eyes fix on his as he
nears                                 - a flash of mutual recognition
then nothing as they pass without a word
Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin

The bed keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water, moving closer to the edge with every bang
There's something almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition
the glass ,  the ground and
: Jonathan  into water
-   - Jonathan doing laps
He emerges from the pool, strides with confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side: snoozing,  adjusting floaties on kids, with airport novels
He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's
/   : - '  - Jonathan arrives at his building's steps to find Solange hurrying out of her flower shop
She embraces him warmly
Jonathan, for so long  don't see you
'ai ete tres occupe

He's exhausted
And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly activities
Work
No, no

Mischief Maker

Jonathan is about to protest - Ah

will swoon
Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it
Maybe later, okay
There is no later when it comes to love
If you find it, you must not let it go
() 39
: Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps                  - when she tugs his sleeve
He turns to her; she searches his eyes
There really is no one
Jonathan evasively shakes his head
There should be, Jonathan
It is not good for a young man to be too much alone
He gives her an uncomfortable smile
She smiles back, but as she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him
Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and disappears inside
We remain on the vacant street, hear his climbing the steps - and then the muted  of his cell phone
beat, then another
and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out into the night
-  -- Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan faintly hears what sounds like '
He quickly turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby
Through slotted glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men
Reflected in the mirror, a  appears behind him
Jonathan freezes, his eyes grow wide - Excuse me
He doesn't breathe
Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm
It's her
-It's ""
- Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's oblivious, smiling casually back at him
"" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside
Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued
"" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair
Jonathan remains still and silent, just watching
She undoes the wrists of her blouse, then the collar button
() 40
: Jonathan is about to say something but can't
She undoes the next button
We can glimpse a bra
She undoes the next -- Before we
um, the thing is                                   -  know you
She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front clasp of her bra
Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met before

She glances back curiously

He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper
We can hear the sound of   ""
They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed
The radio is tuned to a pop music station
They're finishing a meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously
You have some ketchup on your chin

He's self-conscious at first, but she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it

You just need the right partner
She closes her eyes, swaying with the music
They dance together

As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn escapes her
She covers her mouth

to It is tomorrow
She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes her eyes and drifts off
Jonathan gazes over at her
The perfect line of her jaw
The petite divot above her lip
The tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe
And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse
He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away
He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer
He looks over () 47
: to the purse, then back at "," sleeping peacefully on his arm
and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any more
-   - '
His eyes slowly open
' : her purse is no longer on the chair
He raises his head, sees that she's gone
He stares at her pillow
The indentation where she slept
Smiles to himself
He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom
There's a on the desk on hotel note paper: Frank - you snore like a tractor
Will call u later

And then reads the note again - grinning

Among them we spot Jonathan, just slightly out of step, a sleepy smile lingering on his face

He looks at his cell phone, hoping it will ring, but it doesn't
He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up to the top number
It reads: "Number Unavailable

He immediately picks up

() think you have the wrong number
-- Jonathan arrives at the subway station
He's a little anxious now, still hasn't heard from her
He lingers at the top of the stairs, not wanting to descend
Below him he can hear the lonely roar of a train pulling in below
only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his cell phone is ringing
He picks up
Hello
Intermittent static on the other end
And then what sounds like a  ; it's unclear if it's a sound of pleasure or pain

suddenly a shrill, terrified
- and the line goes dead
Jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful

Jonathan and "" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple
Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a fascination with everything around him, especially her
They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle

What's his name
() Duck On Bike

Jonathan looks at her
Ever since that night on the subway - haven't stopped thinking about you

If Wouldn't it be great if you could just meet someone and not have to do the 'work/ family/previous relationships' thing
Isn't who we are right now so much more interesting than where we've come from
Sure
but that didn't really answer my question
She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly
az  of know it seems like 'm holding out on you, but 'm not
It's just                                  -  turned thirty this year, and  made this vow to live only in the present
And it's good, you know
And yes, maybe it's because there are things in my past  don't care to think about - but that's the same for everyone, isn't it
He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this

She offers him a piece
Oh - no thanks

It has ginseng in it, you know, for energy
It's not bad, though it sort of tastes like hairspray
She chews her gum
He watches her; the jaw line, her lips
She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it: a sadness
Almost an uneasiness
Hey, are you all right
" don't want to complicate your life
Too late
--  want all the complication you've got
She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions
it Sc, Your glasses
They're fogging up
She reaches out and gently removes his glasses
() 55
: She wipes the lenses, then peering into his eyes, slowly leans in to return them to his face
only she presses her lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss itself at once tender and passionate
She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected intensity of the kiss
Embraced, they accidentally step under the sheet of water falling off the awning
Jonathan guides her back beneath the awning's shelter
At  is (breathless whisper) Maybe you should go
Maybe you should stay
She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately
Again they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter them - - only "" leans into him instead, leading him out from under the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating
wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's just breathed for the very first time

Pause
Jonathan is wild with lust for her

Mmhmm

Would that be such a terrible thing

His face is inches from hers                                  - when she rolls over and reaches for a glass of water on the night stand
She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan
Still, Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift
is everything okay
She starts to say something, then stops herself and nods instead
She sets down her glass, starts to get out of bed
Where are you going
, $az (a mischievous smile) For ice
(a lusty grin) Ice, huh
,, saw a machine down the hall
'll be right back
She starts to tie her robe closed - () 58
: That's all right, 'll go
He hops off the bed, grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar and a key card from the table, he surreptitiously adjusts his penis                                                           (as one does): and goes to the door
He's about to turn the handle when - , Saz Wait - (glancing back) Yes
She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head, and smiles at him with immense tenderness
Jonathan beams back
its
P1 Hurry, okay
He blows her a kiss, she blows one back
Almost in She looks stunning
- As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517
Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine
He's giddy with excitement
Passionately alive
At the ice machine: an eccentric   in her night attire is slowly filling a bucket
Piece by piece
Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to break her long nails
Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration
She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self- conscious in his robe and bare feet
Would you like some help, ma'am
can manage, thank you
Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way
Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice
() 59
: Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers
We see Room 518                                                 has the    sign on
Jonathan arrives back at room 517
He pauses and slips his robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'
He puts the card key in the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light blips
He tries the card again
Again red
He knocks on the door, calls out: can't get the card to work
He tries the card again
Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door
He peers down at the key panel: red
He knocks harder, waits for a response
None
Dead silence
Hello
Hello
He jostles the door handle: it won't budge
He's getting anxious now, his breath quickening
He tries the key card again: red
He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into the door
Nothing
Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns green
-  millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into He peers up into the small entryway: empty
Ahead of him we glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets
Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket
Panicked, he rushes forward to find  soaking the bed, splattered all over the crumpled sheets
Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just as he senses something behind him and
- something hits him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of potatoes

The ice has melted, a pool of water seeps out

Rubs the back of his head

Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet, shaky
He looks around the room
It's
No sign of "

Also empty
Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty
The between this room and the next:
He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every trace of her is gone
He whips back to the bed - the sheets are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them
He runs to the window looks down at the street
It's four in the morning, no one around
Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the corridor
He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow corridor
we hear the muted  of an elevator
Jonathan tears off in its direction
He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are located
He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3"
His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing to the 2nd floor landing
He clutches his head, gets up and continues to dash down
of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild- eyed and shaking

Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word: help

My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone
They were right here
He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies
His is gone too
2 Maybe she took them
What

She didn't do this, okay
Something happened to her
You don't understand, we were
Wait
He sees something on the floor between the bed and night stand

This                                                        -- this was hers

Mr
Messer,  spoke to the desk clerk
She only recalled seeing you check in
That's
that's the way it works
All right
But now you're telling me that in addition to this mystery woman, there was another individual in the room
Not at first -- look,  know how it sounds, but 'm telling you, whoever hit me must have -  don't know -- taken her
Maybe even
He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications
Mr
Messer, have you had - experiences like this before
Taking any sort of medication
'm not crazy, okay

There was blood all over the goddamn bed
He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when : it's Russo's
She pauses, struck by the genuine desperation in Jonathan's face
She finally picks up
() 64
: Yeah
(glances at Jonathan) No,  don't think it's necessary
Right
She hangs up and turns to Jonathan
He looks away, barely able to contain his devastation
What am  supposed to do
An awkward silence, then: If you want to file a report regarding the items she - (corrects herself) - the items you claim were stolen
Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated
'd like to go now
Is that all right
Can just                                                          - can  go

He tips it, a   falls out
As he starts back down, he feels something in his coat pocket
He reaches in, finds "Duck On Bike" where he'd pocketed it
'  -  - Jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower, face buried in his elbow, completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing
' Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses, staring at his dresser
He approaches, peering down at something that's caught his eye
Nothing unusual - except for a small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved

Jonathan looks very worried

The body came in late last night, although time of death's still unclear
She was found in a taxi: driver was in a
coffee shop on his break, came back to his cab and there she was in the back seat
The elevator shudders to a metallic stop
Her purse was recovered from a dumpster about a block away, so we've got a name
Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors

Jonathan looks sick with fear
Russo leads Jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the morgue

It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd passed without a word in an office some days later
She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck marred by a thin, discolored line where she's been strangled
Mr Messer
He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer
Was this the woman you were with last night
She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation
His tense eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there
They're out of earshot, but their mere presence amps tension
Angle on the guns in their holsters
The handcuffs dangling -- Mr
Messer
No - she's not
Not last night
no
Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat
- Jonathan exits behind Russo as they step onto the sidewalk
figured it was a long shot
The only reason  called you down is she was last seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson hotel

You mentioned this group of yours meets up at various hotels

Across the aisle, a sit side by side, her headon his shoulder
On Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost overwhelming
Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a look of longing
when his eyes suddenly widen
He sees something inside, something he hadn't noticed
He unfolds it to reveal two words written in a feminine hand on the white underside: 'm sorry Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to share in this haunting discovery
of course, no one does
He stares back
down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled

Jonathan readies himself, then dives in
Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license
We see Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away
- Checking URLs site by site
He finally pauses on one
It's an article from the Boston Herald
The headline: " '

He steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder
He frowns at it - clearly out of place here
He picks the file up, opens it
to a series of                             8X10                                                        photographs
Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait
Confused, he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands there with him -- the Blonde found murdered
Simone Forester
Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more photos
They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens
Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator
Opening the room door
Undressing
Screwing
In one, Jonathan has his hands on her neck
He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings, startling him
He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up
Hello

) Mr
Messer, it's Detective Russo returning your call
Jonathan freezes, tries not to sound panicked, his eyes fixed on the damning photos of himself and Simone Forester
Oh - right,  was just - checking in, to see if you had any leads

He grabs it, yanks open the zipper
his face draining of all remaining color as he peers into his empty racket ba
His racket is gone

He holds Detective Russo's card
Knows he should call back
He abruptly reaches for the phone, and dials

Turns again to the pillar, steps closer - no sound
He hesitates
then turns and walks off
- People heading home from work
Jonathan among them, utterly desolate
Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched again
He spins, peers anxiously behind him
Only strange faces passing through turnstiles
- narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti
Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable
We lag back, following him from an  ; glance up at a sign for stairs to the  &  trains
Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing around, still feeling watched - When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the opposite platform, waiting for a train
She casually turns her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide

when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run
Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform

Wait, right there
Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her
He looks around, hears the distant:
nimble of afar
off train, and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him capable of: he jumps onto the tracks
He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails, eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he races for He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up
He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane of track separating him from the platform she was standing on - only she's no longer there
He scans the people waiting, no sign of "" among them - and then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits
She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing on the center divider, feet soaked in muck
Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other across the solitary track
Then: thought you were dead
She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't
And all at once he's hit with a crushing realization: You are in on this, aren't you
She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion - then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again

All  had to do was get involved with you, and not ask any questions

'd never met anyone so in command of his own charm
He said that he'd come from nothing, that everything he learned, he learned from his tricks
He claimed that Holloway was even grooming him for a position at his company
She lights another cigarette with her old one
In a way,  felt for him
But  also admired him
It sounds silly,
but he had a way of making me feel - close to him, you know
This clearly hits home with Jonathan
He barely nods
So  found myself telling him things
Personal things
And, next thing  knew - You told him
About this
beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette
He seemed fascinated by it
Wanted to know all the details
() suppose 'd had too much to drink
And was distracted
was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be
-
- Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal aggression
She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes
Exhausted, her body goes limp
to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of real pleasure
She struggles, tries to protest - when his hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress -- -  - Black Business Suit staring off, chilled by memory
() 91
: Only afterwards  discovered two of my credit cards were missing
As was my cell phone
Of course  couldn't say anything to Holloway
And Jamie must have known 'd never report it to the police
() So  just put the incident out of my mind
all but forgot about it, until one night, maybe two months ago - ()                                         -  - Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of Hearst and    lingering beneath it

It's Wyatt

) almost didn't recognize him
But when did,  suddenly felt very, very scared
She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look
left before he saw me
She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space
He must have used my cell phone to get into the group
(crushes out her cigarette) Anyway, that's it
That's all  know
She looks around
At the room, the bed
She shudders, rises
Wait - thank you
(off her look) Have you ever run into him again
Getz
No
And  don't ever want to
Getz
That was his name
Jamie Getz

- Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices Jonathan coming down the front steps
Jonathan, you're home early - Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the overcoat isn't Jonathan
It's Wyatt
Oh - je suis desole
My mistake
Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps
Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face
-    - Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall: (

) who's James Getz
(

) guy  roomed with freshman year at Princeton
on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton University alumni
He types in: Getz, James
beat - then: "No match
"  long list of  names follows
Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz
Shit
Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the 's jumps out at him: Holloway
Reed
Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name
"Sort no contact information available
" Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types: "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing
" An article appears
From the Chicago Tribune: " "  head-shot style photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize from Black Business Suit's story
Beneath his photo, his name: "Reed Holloway
" () 93 : Jonathan glances up at the Hotel employee manning the desk
Can  print this out
(' )   - Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a sinister energy
Jonathan is pacing toward the subway, reading over the printed article
-    - Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted neighborhood
the departure of the subway train is joined by the distant
wail of
Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses
He wrinkles his nose, smelling something
He looks up: two blocks away, a thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky -- ' Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of his building
Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a   parked across the street, engine running
It suddenly shifts into gear and peels out in a fast turn
Jonathan spins               - something about it troubling him - but the  is already gone
He continues racing toward his building
The neon "  " sign crackles and sparks in the flame
Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers emit what must be an awful stench
Two   are loading a gurney on which Solange lays, burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over
She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible: Jonathan
He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance

Yeah, she'll make it

'  - Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor
Suit jacket over his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker
His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its hinges
The place looks like it's been turned upside down, furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls
Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat
Better get your valuables together
' still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck on Bike" too
(calls out) How did it start
(
) We're not sure
Maybe a bad fuse
' Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left
Not very much
He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket
Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take
He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its contents --- Stuffed with paper
But not bank statements
Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan with Simone Forester
Some we've seen, some new
Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea telling us the contents of each and every file have been swapped out with photos
() 95
: He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of Jonathan and "" walking in Chinatown
He scans through others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel Lotus
, terrified by the horrific implication - (
) Mr
Messer
Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the doorway
He quickly shuts the file
Just                                                            - give me a minute
'  - paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed near to bursting
The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently
That everything
Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little evidence there is of a life
wrenching sense of isolation
guess it is
You got someone you can stay with

Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through steel mesh at

It's fifty for the night
Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what he discovers are his last three                                 $20s
-  - - Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows, stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of paid sex bleed in
Somewhere a bottle smashes
() 96
: Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents onto the bed
He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and "
" She's smiling up at him
The smile, frozen in time, at once haunting and heartbreaking
He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway ("     ")
His eyes drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him - :    "'
" of Wyatt with bleached hair styled in a loose spike -- ' , Holloway sports an almost identical look
-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17
" : Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand
Boston Police, how can  direct your call
Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him: This is Detective Russo, , badge number 274655
1   just need some information from you guys
Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response
Finally - Well
You've got a case, a missing person named William Bansky
'm wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen
Hold a sec
() Bansky, William, last seen
May                              17
Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 (" :), dated "May 17
" Anything else you- () 97 : That's it, thanks
Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by the connection he's made
to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: " = =
" To this he adds: "=  " - line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face all anxious tension
- '  - Jonathan slides his passport through the window's metal tray, to the                                                    (40s) working behind three inches of glass
The Teller examines the passport, then slides it back
'kay, if you'll just swipe your  card
She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right
Actually, my card was stolen
Mmm'kay
do you see those two taupe colored telephones over there
Just pick up either one and you'll be connected with our automated system
The thing is,  already used your automated system and
look, this passport's all  have left, it's the only thing proves who  am and now 'm down to like my last ten dollars here, so
Jonathan's cool is cracking
The Teller wrinkles her brow
Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone
customer service representative will - Give me a goddamn break
() 98
: Sir, there's no need for profanity
(loses it) Oh no
In the last few days 've seen a woman  thought might be dead turn up alive and a woman  assumed was alive turn up dead, both at the hands of a guy about whom everything  know is apparently a lie
've had my building set on fire, my neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment ransacked
So please forgive my language, but it's been one fuck of a week
The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed
Look,  know 'm just another face on this side of the glass,  get that
But 'm begging you, as one human being to another, please let me into your life just long enough to help me out here
Please
The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods
She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up
'm showing that card as having been sent out four days ago
It definitely went out
We even heeded the change of address request
Well, like                                                     -- wait, what request
Apparently you informed the bank of an address change
She swivels her monitor so he can see
Mr
Jonathan Messer,                                            140

91st

91ST                         - We recognize the  in the midst of fielding a complaint by an   with a yappy dog
Jonathan hurries to the elevators, unnoticed
140
91ST -- Jonathan emerges from an elevator
The last door on the left
Jonathan tries the doorknob
It's locked
Jonathan checks under the mat
Sure enough, there's a key
Utterly bare
Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood floors
Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer around the corners
He paces cautiously through the living room
The dining area
The glistening chrome and granite kitchen
room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner
Jonathan slowly nears
to find it's a stack of mail
He picks up an envelope --
the  of a door hinge
Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him
He steps out of the room to investigate
We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat
until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at ease
He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope
He reads: "Mr
Jonathan Messer 140
91    St
" Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail - all addressed to him at this address
Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he finds at the bottom of the stack: another
It's of "" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the track from Jonathan
And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder
Long time no see

It's pointing directly at Jonathan

Follow them and might let her live
Where is she
This should've been simpler

Where is she
terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts: Goddamn it tell me what you did to-- Press pause on the questions and listen
The brokerage firm you're auditing is Clute Nichols

And hands Jonathan an
It's all in there

This account overseas                                   - it's in my name, isn't it
moment of tense silence
Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then: Why'd you pick me
Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question
You answered the ad, Jonathan
(off Jonathan's confusion) "Feeling all alone out there
Have a great job, fine personality and good looks to match, but no time to
meet that special someone
Help is just a phone call away -" The ad - in Money magazine
() Told you to block that Caller
Of course  had to scope out a whole lot of losers before  hit the jackpot
After all, there only so many Jonathan Messers out there
() If you screw with me, well - you saw what did to that Blonde
That's kindness compared to what 'll do to your little girlfriend
You won't even recognize her when 'm through
Why should  believe you
Everything you told me was lies
Not lies, Jonathan
Foreplay
And now
now you're fucked
He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door
() 102
: Remember: be smart
'll be watching you
And
feel free to take a shower, looks like you could do with one
The front door slams
Jonathan just stands there, staring shell-shocked at the envelope
- Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his suit pocket
As he crosses the street a    -   to find a car barrelling at us
Jonathan dives out of the way an instant before the car would have hit him
Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers up to see Wyatt's   speeding away
: &  -   - stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an enters
Mr
Peterson, one of the audit managers is here to see you
Jonathan Messer
() Really
Well - okay, bring him back
We follow the assistant out the door, read the name stencilled on the glass " ,
" &  - Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's Assistant approach a , who gestures across the lobby
The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is seated
She addresses him
He rises
&  - ' Chet Peterson looks up as his door is opened - Jonathan, good to see you again
() 103
: - reverse angle to find a   we've never seen before
Actually,  was just looking for Fred Whipple's office
() Next door down
The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting his glasses
Peterson reloads his greeting: Jonathan, good to see you again
'  - Close on Chet Peterson, gravely peering across his desk
Well,  have to say, your resignation comes as something of a surprise
Most of our auditors seem to like the freedom the position affords
() You'll stay on to finish up at Clute Nichols, of course
Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him, lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing it's Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses
He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would
Absolutely
So do you have any plans
Yes
'm going to travel
want to see the world
Peterson nods benignly
: 104
/ - : Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute Nichols, lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers
Throughout this, Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes
: - Abeautiful shot of the cityscape - accompanied by the sound of fingers clacking on keys
- Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on his laptop
Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed
Jonathan peers at the laptop clock
It reads                            10:58
His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while
He finally reaches a prompt:
,  P2
We glimpse a small
logo with a
Jonathan presses F2
Reads some more, types some more
Finally we read:  -
Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions
Reads
: Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions
Waits
' 8
His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols file
We can glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil
Jonathan stares at the cursor
on the laptop screen, the icon blinking petulantly
He's about to type
And then he halts
His eyes drifting to   , resting in its charger
His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an idea forming in his mind -- of the cell phone suddenly jars us
Jonathan hesitates, then picks up
(
) What's taking you
() 105 : Jonathan says nothing
We can hear Wyatt getting tenser: (
) said what's taking you
wondered if you were monitoring this
(
) Don't worry about what 'm doing
Just finish the transaction
Now
Not until  see her
(off Wyatt's silence) The transfer's impossible without an access code
And there's no way 'm entering it until 'm sure that she's safe
So you tell me
How do we do that
Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent
We tighten on Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting clearly hinging on this
(0
) (low, frustrated) You have a wireless connection
Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation
- Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag, in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "" smiling up at him
He then turns to his cell phone once more
He picks it up, scrolls the menu, punches a number
- '                                                  ( ) Hello
() Are you free tonight
sudden, jarring     as we : 106
-  - An elaborate and intensely packed   is being held up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd noise unspeakably loud
We travel through the din, past hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy
- The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below, where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters
- Jonathan surveys the busy lobby
mulling bustling
And, of course, the ""
(
)' May  ask you a personal question
Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic smile
With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers
Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and tense
Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand
Where is she
In one of the rooms
Safe
(a thin smile) got us a table
- delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and Wyatt are seated
Two Macallan 25 year
Enjoy
The Waitress leaves
Wyatt raises his glass
To friendship
Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt
Bansky's dead, isn't he
() 107
: He was dead when  met him
Just like you
The rest was a mere formality
(re: the laptop) Of course he didn't have your bargaining chip
Speaking of which
Not until  see her
She's the only reason 'm here and not at the police
told you, she's in a room
Alive
Give me the key then
Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the table
Of course there's nothing on the key card to indicate a room number
As soon as you're done, 'll tell you the room number
Not good enough
Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit
You won't let her live
You killed all the others, you'll have to kill us too
Hey,  like you, okay
You'll be fine
(scoffs, repulsed) You like me
do, Jonathan
In my way
After all, you're my creation
'm the one who gave you life
Don't you get it
It was her, not you
She's the one
She gave me life
You can steal my identity, but not what's here
() 108
: He puts his hand on his heart
Wyatt is startled by Jonathan's passionate outburst
Yeah, well, 'm weeping big wet ones for you both
Now, let's get on with it
() don't have all night, Jonathan
Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent
Wyatt lets go of the key card
Jonathan opens his bag
- '   as it defuzzes from sleep
The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an access code
Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then pauses, looking confused
Jonathan quickly reaches around
to the back of his laptop, feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale
What is it
My wireless modem -  must have left it in the conference room
can't get back online
Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething
You stupid fuck
can go back there and- No
(thinks, then abruptly) Get up
-  - Wyatt and Jonathan crossing the lobby; they arrive at , partitioned by a wall of glass
Jonathan and Wyatt stand on the other side, peering in
() 109
: They don't let you use your own computer
Wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill, gives it to Jonathan
They will now
Jonathan takes the hundred, and heads into Empty at this hour, with the exception of a sleepy-looking As Jonathan steps toward the desk, he takes out the hotel key card, his eyes travelling up to a clock overhead:                                                       11:29
(   ) Wyatt eyes Jonathan on the other side of the glass
' : Jonathan explaining himself to the clerk
Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view of the business center's glass
Across the lobby, an attractive -  in business attire glances over at him
Jonathan is subtly slipping the                                 $100                            bill to the Employee
You forgot your
own room number
just checked in and it's been a hectic day
Look at me
The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed tension in Jonathan's eyes
You could just ask at the front desk
'm sure they can- really don't have time, okay
Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up at the clock again: the big hand clicks over to 11:30
() 110
: Still eyeing Jonathan
He sees the Employee hesitate, then accept the money
Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by the Auburn-Haired Woman
Pardon me, but may  ask you something - personal
Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused
Are you waiting for me
The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner
Room 907
907                                                             - thanks
His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair
What the hell are you -- And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes: Motherfucker
He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass, just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been standing
Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to close
He turns to find a   riding up with him
They've pressed floor 6
He presses floor                       9
Wyatt arrives at the elevators - none are ready to open
He furiously presses the call button, his hand hovering by his concealed gun
6TH   - Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out
Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to close - - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire alarm
He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just as it's about to close
6TH Wide shot of an empty hotel hallway -- as suddenly the fire alarm blares to life
Pan                                                                                                                                     180   to find Jonathan dipping into an emergency exit stairwell
- Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of wedding guests also start to pile in
Furious, he abandons the elevators for the nearest stairs
7TH spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm
8TH as Jonathan smashes the glass of yet another fire alarm
- Surveillance monitors show guests in the various hallways and stairwells rushing in confusion at all angles
(
) We've got alarms on two - wait, three floors                                                          - Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music still blasting, the upscale throngs still partying
112
Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor - - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell
Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up the stairwell
9TH  - Close on a door marked by a placard:   9th floor -- as it's banged open by Jonathan's shoulder
The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925

Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907
He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot -- when a hand grabs his forearm
He spins in panic to -- - a
She says something
in Vietnamese, indicating the ringing alarms
Fire,  know - 'll be out in a minute
The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan quickly slides the key in the slot
The light blinks green
He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find - 907 - nothing
The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other than     from the  set on Pay-Per-View
Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she
He searches every corner, the bathroom, the closets
Everywhere
The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the incessant moaning coming from the porn on the  set -- Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the  and shoves it off its ledge
It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence
Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the  was () 113
: resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan taps it, he realizes: it's hollow
He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall
And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: ""
Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over
She looks semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped
Jonathan hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by how lifeless she appears - - when her eyes widen, focus on his face
Before he can say anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her face to his chest
azS
, (whispers gratefully) You're alive
He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully
What do you say we stick together from now on
" 'd like that
rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces
Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests - as he's the only one heading up
He passes the 6th floor
9TH Jonathan and "" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn between a choice of two stairwells
His eyes dart from one to another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right
Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination; his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against -- - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge- shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles
to Jonathan and "" some three stories above
() 114 : As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him
That predatory gleam
, tucked carefully at his side
"" three stories above, starting to descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the flow of bodies below
Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a good look
He grips the railing, leans further over
and his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him -- He's down there
saw him - 11 Oh God - Up - we've got to go up
Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "" turn back up, against the flow of traffic
Stories above, less and less people are evacuating
as he presses upward, his steely gaze even more rapacious
The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "" race upward as well
' : a shaky, dizzying blur as they race higher and higher
' : from below but gaining on them, Jonathan and ""
appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn of the staircase
"", desperately racing upwards
bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of Jonathan and ""                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt now
Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim
"" still hurrying up - when a shot rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the () 115
: bullet missing them by inches
"" screams, Jonathan tugs her with him                                                         - - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent into the underside of the stairs just overhead
, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity
- The party is still at full throttle
Apparently no one has yet told them of the alarms
" " as it suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "" spill out
They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy, beautiful faces, laughing, dancing
Come on
She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into the mass of bodies
They keep moving
Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though not as smartly attired
as Wyatt enters the party, scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert
' : just a mass of successful, attractive, partying young men and women
There's no way to pick Jonathan and "" out
Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the periphery
"" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads ducked low as they press forward
, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him, sweat beading on his face                                        -- -- when suddenly the music stops
Wyatt frowns
, eyes darting
"" glancing around in confusion - (
) Ladies and Gentlemen, we need everyone to evacuate the hotel
This way please
() : The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start for the exits
"," doing their best to stay concealed within the exiting crowd
Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving people aside, trying to find them - - when he suddenly stops
He has an idea
He takes out his cell phone
"5" within the crowd - - when Jonathan's cell phone
as his eyes widen in panic
He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off        - - but it's too late
to Wyatt, grinning wider
He's spotted them
In an instant he is bee- lining through the packed suits
as the throngs are clearing out
Jonathan grabs "" as they duck, racing across the dark, rooftop, looking for a place to hide
They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge - gasping to catch their breath
Stepping back, "'s" foot clinks against something: a stray iron railing post
She reaches
down for it, starts to lift it - - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end
She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently, knocking her to the ground
Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt, gripping the iron rod tight
Nice try back there, Jonathan
Looks like you picked up a thing or two from me
Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the air, cracking Jonathan across the face
Killer instinct, pall () 117
: Jonathan crumples, his glasses knocked to the ground
as he grips the iron rod like a tennis racquet, steps into position                                   - - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis strokes: Backhand
Bam
Forehand
Bam
Slice
Bam
Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten
He hears Wyatt drop the iron rod
' : Wyatt's blurry figure hovering above suddenly swoops in on us - as Wyatt grabs Jonathan by the throat, hefts him up and yanks him back to the roof's concrete ledge
Jonathan fights to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin
Jonathan freezes
() They'll
catch
you
Me
No - no, 'm just a face in the crowd
'm a tourist, just passing through
' : Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in focus as he presses Jonathan's torso back over the ledge - As for you, you had your fun
Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge
Now we're going to go back down
'  reaching into Wyatt's pocket, his fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            (Jonathan's old phone)
We're going to get that laptop
'  blindly prodding - he has the phone now - his fingers feel for the antenna
And we're going to finish this, once and for - - when with all his strength Jonathan jams the cell phone up into Wyatt's eye, the antenna punching into the retina
() 118 : Wyatt's grasp slips from Jonathan's collar as he stumbles back, cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward Jonathan - - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan charges, Wyatt's shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge wall, seizing the momentum to turn himself - - as Wyatt falls right over the edge of the hotel rooftop
( ) Wyatt's body plummeting down the magnificent facade, vanishing into the vastness of the city below
as he crawls to the ledge, peers down into the darkness
He exhales, then turns back to ""                 - - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye
She leans into him, and he holds her tight, the two of them embraced on the precipice as we : -   - Strobed reds and blues of police and fire
trucks amassed, trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians blocking our view of the body they're all gawking at
We travel through the confusion until we find "" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped against the other
The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade
He reaches into his pocket and hands her 'Duck on Bike'
Yours,  believe
01S
11 Thanks, Frank
She winds the toy up
They watch it make it's funny way down the sidewalk
Can  ask you something personal
She nods
() 119
: What's your name
"" considers the request, then smiles gently, leans in close and whispers the answer in his ear
Jonathan gazes at her a moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect
So what now
She smiles up at him
Well
are you free tonight
On Jonathan: treasuring these moments
He is truly free -- perhaps for the first time in his life
Yes
'm free
They gaze at each other
We leave Jonathan and "" to their privacy, pulling back as they continue talking, continuing away until we're the window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene, people passing like fish in their tank
except for Jonathan and , seated center-frame, two small figures side by side, face to face, talking intimately as we
