Lockheed  sits
Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the- art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon
Waiting
to see
our  down onto the landing strip is from an open- sided, thatched roof  high above the airfield
And peering down through the mist and rain
a  in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane
Slender
Feminine
At first glance, fragile
Then the gray eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her
Something fierce lives there
:   ,   - 1937
(
) Sure  can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous
She turns
is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way
His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt- streaked as her own
He carries his bottle of tequila, and a Coke which he sets down for her
Adventurous
You've got the wrong girl, Mister
You should know that by now
Her eyes study him
Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers
Actually
knew that the moment met ol' George
He sips his drink
She says nothing
(') like how you don't talk about him
That why  get so many chances to not do it
Well
Natural curiosity
His charming smile
She's thinking more about the tequila
She reaches to take his bottle and glass
Moves them to her side of the table

mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show
Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail
No response
Just her clear direct gaze
(') 'll bet he knew that
First time he met you
She looks out to sea
He thought  hated him
He never knew  was fascinated
' ,   - 2                                                                  2 Alone by the window, he gazes at the city
powerfully built man in a perfectly-tailored suit
The face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion
Yet just now, there are none to be seen
Even as
a door
pretty  enters soundlessly, sits respectfully
Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad
Does he know she's there
:    ,  1937
(without turning) The first time  met her she sat in that chair
The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down
And still with his back to her
(') You may as well write it down, Mary
Write it all down
Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring
He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease
(') We'll see if  remember how to edit
She smiles back
She likes him, as much as her level of being awed by him permits
She begins to write, as

(') 'd kept her waiting two hours
She hated me on sight, but she hought  couldn't tell
His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes
And one object, oddly out of place
stuffed , with boots and a green frock coat
It wears a confident ironic smile
(') She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work
And there  was
His smile is kind
And honestly self-mocking
(') Self-obsessed
Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances
vain, fast- talking, manipulator
But then guess you know all that, don't you
She looks up reproachfully
Nothing of the kind, and you know it
(') Oh, yes
And the kind of man who fishes for compliments
He's made her laugh
3                                                                     3 - She is younger, dressed conservatively
The calm at the center of a storm
Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come and go
But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring through a small stack of volumes
As if preparing for an exam
:
'
1928
(
) The waiting made her furious
She undoubtedly felt  was stablishing my dominance and importance
She doesn't look furious at all
Thumbing through  by
Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St
Louis in Paris

(
) (') Actually,  hadn't given her a thought
Oblivious as usual
Which, perhaps, was even worse
Now,  by
Photos of the explorer preparing for his flight over the North Pole
One of Byrd with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas
(
) figured he'd be pompous
Her eye travels over the stack of books
Adventurers, explorers, celebrities
On an end table, a framed photo of George with the great Lindbergh
pretty  comes to summon her
Amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit
They head down the corridor
(
) (') knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me
had no discernible qualifications whatsoever
They reach the door, already ajar
It says on a small bronze plate
The secretary gingerly pushes it open
revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders
He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages
Off again, stalking the room
Dashing, electric, masterful
(
) But to be rejected by this
parasite
man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous
He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is there
Sit, please
But she doesn't
(
) (') didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk
He gestures again, more commandingly
Sit
She doesn't move, she doesn't smile
She doesn't take her steady gaze from him
He hangs up the phone
They stare at each other for a frozen beat
He breaks the moment with a charming smile

Miss Earhart
Mr
Putnam
(softly) asked you to sit
Was that the thing you did with your hand
Sadly,  don't speak dog
His smile now only a trace
But more genuine
Ah
Well, stand if you like
melia sits
(') 'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean
do
In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried
Three planes made it
Fourteen people have died
'll make it
Three women died trying
Two others escaped with their lives
If you do make it, you'd be the first
Which
is the real attraction for both of us, suspect
She nods
No smile
Always nice to know what the real attraction is
His smile
Beginning to enjoy this conversation
6
The plane was bought from Adm
Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself
Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger
She has asked for a replacement
He gestures
Perhaps you
(') who is American, educated, well- spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive
Why would that matter
Because she wants the world to pay attention
And pretty girls command more attention
Was that your advice
Sure
My role is selling this event to the public
There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times
Also a book to be published over her name
Understood (') But all the money from these will go to Mrs
Guest
Except for the part that goes to you
Which will be as great as  can manage,  assure you
You said she wants a flyer
Don't get your hopes up
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot
There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator
The woman will be purely a passenger
7
He waits for reaction
She keeps her mouth shut
(') That's good for your chances
Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this
If the woman were to do any flying at all
No punches pulled
Not his style
Why would anyone want a book from a passenger
Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander
The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control
It's her ship, her flight
Good for my chances, you said
What are my chan
The job's yours
She blinks
Stunned speechless
(') chose you the moment you walked through the door
He smiles his charming smile
Several phones are
(') Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise
May  give you a lift to the station
Amelia rises
Is she pissed at being toyed with
You're a busy man, Mr
Putnam can find my way
The look holds
He shrugs
You probably can

Her train is ready to leave
honestly feel an apology is in order
Fine
What have  done
She watches his smile
(') didn't mind waiting
Caught up on my reading
Knitted a sweater
mean an apology
For what's coming
His voice softens
(') 'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months
How you dress, move, cut your hair
Speak in public
It's all part of the package we're selling
We
That's right
If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work
The smile turns friendly
(') You're the star
'm no one at all
Spoken like a gentleman
She steps up onto the train
Extends her hand like a man
He shakes it firmly
The train begins to move
She watches his cheery wave as she rolls away
(
) (') Of course a gentleman
Would have paid for my ticket

She looks down now to a notebook in her lap
As she flips pages, we see it is a collection of hand-written  and thoughts
She writes
(
) Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace We  over her image the wall of a little girl's bedroom, filled with treasured   about women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had established themselves in positions previously thought to be available only to men

Amelia and a girlfriend
They stop, hearing
The  of an engine, a small red plane  above the treetops
The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field, down to  them
Amelia's friend runs for her life
But Amelia stands still, throws her arms , and the plane
lower, and , as it  straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms
and , as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills
The aircraft  past, just above her head
(
) As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me
Amelia beams
She fills her lungs, transported
(
) (') don't think 've ever stopped listening
on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze

See a group of
in their grease-stained jumpsuits
Three big guys and one little one working on an engine that's been pulled from Amelia's Kinner

he isn't a guy at all

He finds
Amelia sitting cross-legged on the grass
Reading to a group of  , who hang on her every animated word
On the periphery,  sit, taking in the story
They are of various ethnicities, homeless or handicapped or immigrant
Two are blind
Amelia sees Sam
Girls, this is Mr
Samuel Chapman
Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club
The Octopus Club waves to Sam
The adults wave, too
(') You're just in time
Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well
(on cue) They are, actually
She pats the grass beside her
Sam has no choice but to sit
- 10                                                              10 Amelia and Sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds
Through the chain link fence, they watch other social workers playing with groups of children
And it's a secret
Has to be
Competition, you know
Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots
If George knew  told you, he'd have me publicly flogged
She looks over
12
(') So long as he could sell tickets
He's not smiling
And no one else knows
Marion
She's giving me a leave of absence
would think so
Your name will be in all the papers, and not just Boston
Denison House stands to come in for funding, national attention
Specially if  don't make it
Don't joke about that
She wasn't joking at all
(') You'll make it
And then you'll have opportunities to work in aviation
Anywhere you want
She laughs
Well, 'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger
That's not exactly a career in aviation
She looks up at his eyes
(') 'm not going anywhere, social work is my life
After all the years of false starts,  found the thing 'm meant to do
Keep walking
She gives him time to say
And where does that leave us
13
You do love to look on the dark side
Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me
She gives him a sweet playful smile
It doesn't reassure him
It's not as if 'd been putting pressure on you
What love means to you
What it requires
Is the pressure
He stops walking
love you
Is that such a terrible problem
She gazes at him
Can he even hear this
The problem is what it's always been
The problem is me

Hotel conference room jammed with press sexy brunette in a sweater that seems to be made of strips of steps to a bank of microphones
Flashes start (
) The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, about to become the first female to fly the Atlantic in the wake of Lindbergh's historic journey, regales an eager world press
The sound switches to Mabel at the mikes
Okay, boys
'll take any questions you wanna throw my way
Except about what's behind this sweater
The boys
Mabel keeps her smile tight
(') The story
Behind it
Of course

As the laughter

George and Amelia enter the brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the , a sea-plane with golden wings
Its red-orange fuselage stands beside gigantic , each 29 feet long
The pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to the plane
They turn toward us now
is short and wiry with quick eyes
Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures and the streaks of gray through his hair
He is not necessarily happy to see us
(
) George had told me Stultz was Adm
Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted
He drank
But George said it never affected his work
George waves as we approach
Bill and Amelia seem locked on each other
(
) (') When he said it,  must have had a funny look
So  just said, `Yeh, grew up around a guy like that
' Boys, 'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart
We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress
' Bill doesn't smile
The other man does
Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator
She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way
(') And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working
She takes Bill's powerful hand
The look between them calm, yet somehow intense
As if each is establishing a tone for their relationship
15
(') We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane
ou mean the Admiral flies on those
The pontoons
She does not seem admiring
Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself
Bill nods on that
Sure were
(') This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue
Hmmn
What does that do to our fuel
Costs us at least 400 gallons
Don't bother bringing clothes for Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in Ireland
Real lucky
The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles
But Amelia looks to Bill
That's not really possible is it
The Admiral is the Admiral
He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants
All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol
She turns to George with challenging eyes
(') Don't go blaming the bookseller
He's been all through this with Mrs
Guest, but she worships the Admiral
And it's money that puts planes in the air
wonder if it can keep them up there
Not that 've ever had enough to try
16
Bill's small smile
Maybe the girl's all right
13                                                              13 - George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights of Boston glimmer across the harbor
His head is down
She's watching his profile
Sorry
'll try keeping my mouth shut
What  ought to try
Is listening to you once in awhile
e meant that
And she seems oddly touched
Careful
could get to like it
No reaction from him
He hops into the boat
Turns, holds out his hand
She hesitates
Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat
Their eyes lock
We are watching her decide
And then
She reaches to clasp his hand
Hops down beside him
(') Thank you, Simpkin
Thank you for everything
(a smile) Simpkin
It's in a book
Oh, that's right
You read the ones you publish
Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious
She goes to sit in the bow
He doesn't follow
But he is watching
14                                                              14 ,    - Amelia in a flying outfit
Hands on her hips as if posing
(
) There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin
to see the , George beside him
They are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston
17
(
) He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup
So he could never become bored
We see that Amelia's  looks exactly the  as a photo of   in the photographer's hand
It is labeled `
' (
) THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace
The photographer now shows George   of Lindbergh in a different pose
What are you boys doing over there
Trying to make you look like a girl
George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose
Tilting her head to Lindbergh's angle
(
) wondered
Was  Mr
Putnam's 43rd mouse
Or his 307th
Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face
he more we can make you look like a girl, the better
Oh god, is it worth the effort
He cocks his head, studies her
Nah, guess not
Wondering who should play you in the film of all this
'm thinking Chaplin
Valentino's not available
He shakes his head sadly
Adjusts her collar once more
This time, his hands linger
18
(') Two things
One, Chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you
And two, you have company
She glances to where a , beautiful and aristocratic, is being helped onto the roof
George's face lights to see her
He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her tenderly
Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them both
Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam
The women trade smiles
They shake hands, holding eye contact
Great to meet you
George talks so much about you
(a wink) In fact, lately, you're all he does talk about
George steps in close, and the photographer  a three- shot
And another
Hold those smiles for one more, please

George and Amelia alone at the railing
She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots
They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward
From her bag now, she pulls three
Puts them in George's hand
Straight, unblinking
Popping off letters
For my dad, my mom, my sis
You know
In case

He stares down
Rocked by the weight of this against the simplicity of her words
The top envelope says: 'm honored
That you'd leave these with me
Who else
If  do pop off, it's your fault
Said in her sunny way
But she's not kidding
It takes a beat before he can offer
'll call them once you're safely on your way
Sam will handle that
They trust him
That registers

Sure
There are so few books haven't published, it was easy to find

Locking the door
:      : (
) Our first hop was to Canada, to start from as close as we could get to Ireland
Just in case we couldn't get the thing in the air and had to row
She walks briskly down the corridor
(
) The fuel was going to be so close, every single mile counted
Turns a corner
Approaches the dining room door
(
) George told me to keep to my room, just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere
She enters the hotel dining room
Stops cold
Across the room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from their breakfast, surrounded by 15  and Holy shit
Half a dozen   as one
It is a defining moment
And Amelia
Cocks her head
Throws an effortless golden smile
21
Hi there, boys
How are the ham and eggs
The   as one
They keep  as Amelia makes her way to them
Don't blame us, lady
think somebody's starting to sell books
The reporters are handing her their morning editions
The New York Times front page headline: There beneath the headline, the glamorous  we watched being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy
Next to it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker
melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and shaking her head
Say, Amelia
What have you got for Mabel Boll to chew on
Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me
don't have a single sweater made out of gold
The boys , Slim louder than anyone
Even Bill cracks a smile
They're shouting, teasing,  '

The boys make room
Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair friendly murmur
The ham's a little tough, Commander
But the bacon's swell

Once more, the hotel conference room jammed with press
Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat, shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium
Flashes start

(
) The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, upstaged by upstart social worker, seems madder than a rich wet hen
Hey Mabel, tell us about your rival
The sound switches to Mabel leaning her sultry voice to the mikes
Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man
Reporters furiously writing, more flashes
(') Bill Stultz and  were going to make history together, until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy, oh excuse me, `publisher,' started throwing money and  don't know what else at him
Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot
don't know, Charlie,  never seen her
Has she got any
, they're all calling out
She shows them a smoky smile, but stays on message
(') Well, she had to use something on somebody to get from nowhere to here
You figure it out, or wait til George Putnam feeds it to you
Two dozen questions at once
She's not even listening
(') We're going to Canada, waiting for some good weather on the Atlantic, and then we'll kick Little Miss Whoozis in the keester
What makes you so cocky that she won't leave first
23
Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to China
That thing they're flying can't load enough gas to make Yonkers
Tell that to Putnam's girlie
And while you're at it
She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her

(
) Eleven days of failure for plucky Amelia Earhart and her crew
If it isn't storms over the Atlantic, it's the inability of the seaplane's pontoons to lift from the sea
One failed take-off after another
(
) (') Perhaps it's for the best
Remember, no woman has beat the jinx of the Atlantic and three have died trying
Including a princess and the niece of former President Woodrow Wilson
The plane's engine  and
It floats on the sea

Time to fly
Get up, get dressed, we're going now

Slim pulls his pants off a chair
Where's the weather report
She goes to his bed
Hands him a slip of paper
He blinks, still waking up

Great
Maybe Mabel will think so, too
Because if she doesn't, she's going to Paris and you're going home
Today
It's not good enough
It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland
We've had better than this and we haven't gone
But this   is the day Mabel's ready, so we're   going now
The weather is going   to get better and we'll be there   to enjoy it
You're serious
Just as serious as you're hung over

Bill and Amelia stand at the dock beside their plane
He's drinking coffee as they watch Slim come down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand
Amelia steps forward to take it
Reads with neutral eyes
Good
Slim, start the engines
She still hasn't given the paper to Bill
Slim steps onto a pontoon
Starts  up the propellers
As the engine to life

She hands the weather report to Bill
He reads
Looks to her eyes

You've got a direct instruction from me to go
That report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk 'm taking
Have a nice flight
Thanks
She motions to Slim, get on board
The navigator grins, starts to climb up, looking back at Bill
Hey, 'm scared shitless of this dame
She climbs up after him
One look back
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill
We'll both be in them
And disappears
Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines Jesus, God, she's going to do it

Amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive
She's looking at swarming the docks
You can't even see the sand
The crowd is silent and staring
No cheers
As if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo
Bill and Slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore
But when Amelia jumps out, the crowd
begins to soberly , and slowly   around her
At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand thrust toward her
She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have been shunted to the back
Suddenly
people get

Just a passenger
Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon
All the praise

Amelia stares at the man
Conflicting agendas
This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim
Women should know, however, that  have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record
So you could have done it yourself
This particular flight, under these conditions,  wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off
But certainly, one day a woman will do this
As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man

Such confidence in that

We  on a young woman we scarcely recognize
It is Elinor
Though less than a year has passed, she seems much older
Sophisticated, poised
secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to George's office
As they enter, George is pacing on the phone (into phone) Because Amelia invented the Powder Puff Derby for female pilots
Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains
Listens, impatient
46
(into phone) 'll tell you why it's a front page story
Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race
So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts
You want me to write your headline
He glances over
Elinor in the doorway
(into phone) Call you back
've got a very important guest
He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit
As she does
Wish  was important enough for you to manage
Well, 've just got one client
And most days she's more than can manage
Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety
Get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the Derby
He grins back
You bet
(') Some of the gal flyers had their doubts about her
well, her skill level
But she's everyone's champion now
And both of those things
Are the reasons  called you
trange words
He has her attention
(') think it would be huge for women flyers if Amelia won the Derby
The publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys
47
'm not sure she has much of a chance, Mr
Putnam
Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown
We're thinking the Lockheed Vega
The girl's shock
He really means this
Sir, 've test piloted the Vega
It's way more than she could ever handle
It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful
He smiles
That's why 'm thinking of you flying with her
You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and 'd pay you $75 a week
Elinor  low
Well,  think that's the most generous opportunity 've ever been offered
He stares at her
There's just one thing
Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying
So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side
Her eyes narrow
He's completely serious
In that case, 'll get my own plane and win the race myself
You haven't changed
o smile at all
48
(') Unfortunately for you, neither have
The look in his eye is not to be ignored
(') You can't win if you can't get a plane to enter
Let me predict that you won't
The voice calm and low and riveting
(') In fact
If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it
For a long, long time
That's a threat
'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor
And this is what my loyalty requires
She's glaring
Reeling
Trapped
She's the one who said  shouldn't let anybody turn me around
She probably meant me
So honest, the words confuse her
Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat
Oh, sure she does

Oh
he told you that  shut her out of the Derby
And that's true
And when were you going to tell me
(calm, straight) Never

And felt it needed to be done
She can scarcely believe this
What
You think  wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work

She is writing, and as she does

She brushes at them
Stares down at her work

From the doorway, Amelia beckons George
The letter is in her hand

She turns, fixes him with a look
Hands him the letter
And steps back
As if giving him space
At first, he smiles
What is this
She gestures for him to read
As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds

Nor shall consider myself bound to you similarly
Snow falling
Absolute silence

He never looks up

(
) (') Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements
And then

) (') must exact a cruel promise
And that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together
He stops on this
His thoughts unreadable

And give you that part of me you know and seem to want
He folds the letter carefully
Places it in his pocket
And smiles

His eggs and toast ignored for the moment, he's reading a magazine article
to Amelia, sipping her coffee
Watching him

This is different

It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot

The Vega waits
They stand beneath the wing
Her ground crew in far distance, giving them their moment

It's good luck
He puts it in her hand

That's what the elephant told me

And  try to respect them
My favorite is

Remember that

Hands it to her

What was all that

She doesn't want to leave him either

Have fun
Who let you off the hook on this
She takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar toward Gene
He smiles, unfolds a third chair

That's crucial
Gene nods, slowly
His eyes still locked on her

Amelia has made the boys laugh
George laughs with them

Too heavy, not important

And plenty of them
She reaches down to take George's hand and  down from the wing

He is  , in crisp naval uniform, relieving a  who has been on duty
As Cipriani sits at his station, he notices
The direction finder
How long has this been on
The seaman turns back at the door

At the transmitter, the chief radio man
Short and square, an unflappable air of quiet expertise
With him, his assistant , lean and young with dark serious eyes
At a typewriter sits  ', barely twenty, headphones across his shock of rust-colored hair, telegraph at the ready

Dalten adjusting the receiver which is suddenly spitting Threading through the noise, what could be a human voice
Bellarts calls to 'Hare
That's her on 3105
She said `cloudy and overcast

Are you serious
Bellarts mimes typing with his fingers
'Hare starts typing into the log

Dalten begins to transmit Morse Code

We are about 100 miles out
The transmission cuts out
Dalten answers in Morse Code
No response
She's got to stay on longer
Bellarts dictating as 'Hare types
Earhart signal strength 4, but on ir so briefly bearings impossible

Are you receiving this

) calling Itasca
We received your signal, but unable to get a minimum
Please take bearing on us and answer 3105 with voice

It is impractical to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice
Give us a longer signal, please
Go ahead
Silence
Feet are shifting
No one speaks

(softly to Dalten) Keep us at 7500, that's her only acknowledgment
You've got her signal, dammit
What about the direction finder
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir
It was left on all night
Full beat
(low) don't believe this is happening

Did you get transmission on 7500
Go ahead on 500 so that we can take a bearing on you, it's impossible on 3105

When did she say she was low on fuel
All eyes shift to Tommy
He scans the log
Stares

It is filled with people who stand motionless, staring somberly at one man
In turn, he stares at a telephone
Which
Mary reaches, but his hand goes  and she pulls back
He lets it ring three times, four, gathering himself
Lifting it
(into phone) Yes
There are no other words
His eyes tear up
He nods numbly at the phone (
) (') Looking back, the questions were obvious
Why would anyone try to ind such a tiny target in a vast ocean, with barely an hour's lee- way in fuel
He draws a breath
(into phone) Well, we're most grateful
With such an effort, of course they'll e found

As he listens, as he responds graciously, (
) (') So  tortured myself
Why hadn't killed this plan on day one

In a moonlit garden
(
) If  tried to count the insane and reckless chances she took from the first moment  met her
wouldn't know where to begin
Slowly to his knees
By the plants they had tended together

) (') It was the most tragic of endings
The most cruel and senseless and wasteful
And yet
And yet
