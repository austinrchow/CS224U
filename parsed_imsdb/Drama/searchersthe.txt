href <b>// --> </b> " " Revised Final Screenplay by Frank Nugent Behind the main title and the credits: -   - -     - The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth
An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them
The   the hoofprints : -   - We see the rider now
, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals
-
-  - The   and  with the lone horseman
He is , a man as hard as the country he is crossing
Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard
Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing
He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows
His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry
His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho
Rider and horse have come a long way
The   and the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it
Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house
-
-  - She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o
s
Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly
quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him
Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face
-   - Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger
-
-  - The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows
small gallery or porch extends across the front
comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive
Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older
As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, , comes out to stand behind him
Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl
She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger
In the next instant   follows the daughter onto the porch
Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands
Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene
And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter
-   - Along the side of the house comes  , 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest
He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention
So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing
He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger
Beyond Ben, emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward
Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes
He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear
He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again
He continues, followed by Ben, toward where Debbie crouches over her dog
-   -  - As he rides downslope toward the house
-
- , , - Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider
Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips
An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman
(incredulous) Ethan
He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the hard ground
Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows Aaron
-   - as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them
There is a noticeable constraint on all of them
Finally: Hello, Aaron
His eyes shift to Martha and hold
Ethan is, and always has been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him
Martha
(a bit shakily) Hello, Ethan
Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle
Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances
troubled, puzzled
Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side
How's California
How should  know
But Mose Harper said
That old goat still creakin' around
Whyn't someone bury him
He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it
Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious
Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels
Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children
Ben, ain't you
Ben nods
(frowning at Debbie) Lucy, you ain't much bigger than when  saw you last
'm Deborah
(pointing) She's Lucy
Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger
- as Lucy steps down from the porch and approaches
Lucy's going on seventeen now
An' she's got a beau
Kisses him, too
That's enough
Go on inside and help Lucy set the table
You, too, Deborah
-   - as Martin -- with slightly averted face -- crosses to take the bridle of Ethan's horse and lead him away
(wheeling on him) Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise
(contritely) Martin
Here we've been standing
Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin
Oh
Mistook you for a half-breed
(levelly) Not quite
Quarter Cherokee
The rest is Welsh
So they tell me
You've done a lot of growin'
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred
(bluntly) It just happened to be me
No need to make any more of it
'll take care of your horse for you, Uncle Ethan
Again, he starts to lead away
Hold on
Martin stops again
'll take this
He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it as though it contained something of value
Martin watches with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him
Ethan turns and sees the look
He doesn't care what Martin thinks, nor does he explain
Martin leads the horse off
Supper'll be ready by the time you wash up
Let me take your coat for you, Ethan
He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of its sorry condition
(smiling faintly) And
welcome home
He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of the house toward the wash-up
-   - She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her arms
She holds it against her breast for just a moment and her eyes are tender
: -   - The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still-life
Loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- in which logs are burning briskly
Ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre Ethan has brought home from the wars
He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard
Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the other
At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate
Lucy sits at her father's right and Martin at his left
Next to Martin is Debbie
In the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal
Lucy and Martin have finished eating
Aaron is sipping his coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is watching Ethan
Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt
He straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly
Good
The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm gong
Eight fast clangs
Ben
Deborah
Bed
But 've got to help with the dishes
Not tonight
Ben, put that sword back
It's not a sword, ma
it's a saber
(moving to Ethan) Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan
(matter-of-factly) Some
How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan
Ben
Martin, he'll sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight
Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night
Good night, Aunt Martha
Uncle Aaron
(he hesitates) Good night, Uncle Ethan
Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know from the quick look he shoots at Martin
But he acknowledges it
Night
Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan
Will you tell me tomorrow about the war
The war ended three years ago, boy
It did
Then whyn't you come home before now
Go 'long with Martin
As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to Ethan's side and studies him gravely
Lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl
Oh
She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green
(aghast) Deborah
(defensively) Well, it does
But  wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not
Ethan looks at her gravely
'Fraid
(then he remembers something, rises) Wait
He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- and burrows into it
Debbie is at his side
How about this
It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored satin ribbon
Oh
My gold locket
She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see
Martha takes it and reacts at its weight
It's solid gold
Ethan,  don't think she's old enough
Let her keep it
Just something picked up in Mexico
Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand
Aaron hasn't missed the word "Mexico" and looks sharply at Ethan
Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan
(to Debbie) Come along
The two girls leave the main room
Martha and Aaron both look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation
He turns from them and looks into the fire
Martha begins to clear the table
Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- lights it at the fire
Passed the Todd place comin' in
What happened to 'em
They gave up
went back to the cotton rows
So'd the Jamisons
Without Martha,  don't know
She wouldn't let a man quit
Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes
(change of tone) Ethan,  could see it in you before the war
(Ethan looks at him) You wanted to clear out
Martha freezes in what she's doing -- listening
And you stayed out beyond all need to
Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it
(hard) You askin' me to clear out now
(straightening -- with grave dignity) You're my brother
You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to
Ain't that so, Martha
(almost a whisper) Of course he is
expect to pay my own way
Martha resumes her activity
Ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table
It lands with a resonant clink
Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table
(   : This scene should be dramatically back- lighted
) There's sixty double eagles in there
twelve-hundred dollars
He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table
An' twice that in here
He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table
only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em
Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply then at Ethan
Aaron is examining another coin with a different interest
Mint fresh
not a mark on 'em
He glances questioningly at Ethan
So
Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair
He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it
Carefully he replaces everything
During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed
He takes the hand -- gently
Cut yourself
She nods and withdraws the hand
(softly) You were always hurting about your hands
She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance
Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look
Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair
Time for bed
He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their bedroom door
Martha looks at Ethan again
His expression is bitter
Night, Ethan
Come 'long, Martha
She turns obediently and follows Aaron
Ethan looks after them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door
Martha goes into it and Aaron follows and closes the door
Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out
Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly at the closed bedroom door
: '  - Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly ride toward the house and dismount
lamp goes on inside
: ,    , a big man with frosty blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority
He is a minister of the Gospel with a
44 on his hip
, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little man, Scandinavian
As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children
is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable, impulsive
He is in his early twenties
MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of Company  of the Rangers
(He is also Company
) Charlie is a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned by his association with Captain, the Rev
Sam
is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet capable of tireless feats of endurance
Some think him "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren
He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band
is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties; resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist
16- '  -   - She is at the window of her bedroom, wrapper clutched with one hand, lamp upraised in the other as she stares into the dawn to see who these callers are
We hear the heavy foot- falls of the approaching men, then a loud knock thrice repeated -- an ominous sound
17- ' - ' Aaron
Open up
Sam Clayton
The door is opened by Aaron -- holding a lamp and a gun
He is only partly dressed -- pants, boots, undershirt
The bar of light slashes across the faces of Sam and some of the men behind him
Reverend
Come in
'  - Sorry to get you out of bed so early
(as Martha enters, tightening her wrapper) Mornin', Sister Edwards
What is it, Reverend
Lars Jorgensen claims someone bust into his corral last night and run off his best cows
You mean those pure breds he just bought
Jorgensen enters -- an angry little man -- closely followed by Mose Harper, who is grinning foolishly
Next time  raise pigs, by golly
You never hear of anyone running off pigs,  bet you
Injuns has 'em
Caddoes or Kiowas
Kiowas or Caddoes
(irritably) Caddoes
Mose spots Martha and at once whips off his hat and makes her an exaggerated cavalier's bow
Respects to a charmin' lady, ma'am
Respects, respects
Ed Nesby enters
Mornin'
Coffee's made if you
Coffee'd be fine, sister
She heads for the stove
(an old man's whimper) My bones is cold
His eyes brighten as he looks toward the fire and spots a rocking chair
He shuffles toward it, plants himself and begins rocking and half-crooning to himself
Or bumble bees, by golly
show them dirty rustlers
(crooning) Lookit me, old Mose Harper, rockin' in a rockin' chair
'm a-goin' to set 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n rock
The front door opens to admit Martin, fully dressed and armed, with Charlie MacCorry
Over here, Martin
Aaron
Martin ranges himself next to Aaron and both face Clayton
Raise your right hands
Martha sets out cups on the table, begins pouring the coffee
During the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha
And as the scene plays, the audience must always be conscious of the by-play of glances between Martha and Ethan as they face the prospect of being left in this house together
You are hereby volunteer privates in Company  of the Texas Rangers and will faithfully discharge the duties of same without recompense or monetary compensation -- meaning no pay
Amen and get your shirt on, will you, Aaron
(stubbornly) Ain't goin' volunteerin' after rustlers without my morning coffee, Reverend
Drink your own
(sternly -- as he reaches for his cup) From now on, call me 'Captain'
But Ethan advances and calmly appropriates the cup Clayton is reaching for
(mockingly) Captain the Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton
Mighty impressive
Clayton marks his surprise
(dourly) Well
the prodigal brother
When'd you get back
Ethan sips his coffee and doesn't answer
Haven't seen you since the surrender
(a pause) Come to think of it,  didn't see you at the surrender
don't believe in surrenderin' still got my sabre, Reverend
never turned it into any ploughshare neither
Is no time for kaffee-klatch while a man's beef is been run off
Injuns, Ethan
(taps his nose) Caddoes or Kiowas
Mose Harper, drinkin' coffee in a rockin' chair
ay-eh
Martha has left the room briefly to fetch Aaron's shirt and vest and stands behind him
Aaron drains his cup
Ethan, countin' on you to look after things while 'm gone
Ethan -- cup to his lips -- looks over its rim at Martha as Aaron starts to put on his shirt
Their eyes meet briefly, then she looks away
Ethan sloshes the dregs of his cup into the fire -- some of it spattering Mose
You ain't goin'
He sure is goin'
He's sworn in
(angrily) Well, swear him out again
'll go with you
Martha stands submissively, with her head bent, eyes averted as Ethan crosses the room to get his coat, guns, etc
Aaron follows him
Now, Ethan,  ain't sure
Don't argue
And stay close
Maybe they're rustlers
and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong
Thankin' ye, Ethan
thankin' ye
Kind words
(grudgingly) All right
'll swear you in
You can forget that
(as Sam stares) Wouldn't be legal anyway
Why
(a pause -- then shrewdly) You wanted for a crime, Ethan
Martha waits -- intent
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam
'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas
Got a warrant
You fit a lot of descriptions
(levelly) figger a man's only good for one oath at a time
took mine to the Confederate States of America
(he pauses -- then) So did you, Reverend
He looks past him then -- at Martha and then at Aaron
Stick close, Aaron
He looks at Martha again
and then strides out
'  -- As Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other's arms, standing near the saddled horses of the posse
Clayton and Jorgensen following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are conscious of their audience
Brad
Is no time for lolly- gagging
In confusion, Lucy runs back around the side of the house as Brad -- unrepentant -- grins at his irascible old man and heads for his waiting horse
Clayton chuckles and turns toward Martha, who has followed them out
Looks like 'll be reading the lines over that pair before long, sister Edwards
Is no time for talking weddings
Better say prayers for those dirty thieves, by golly
running off a man's beef
Mose, last to emerge, bows elaborately to Martha
Grateful to the hospitality of yore rockin' chair, ma'am
The men are mounting
Mose nimbly vaults onto the back of his horse -- which he rides bareback, with only a blanket pad
'  -- as Ethan and Martin ride to join the group
Let's get on with it
She comes flying out of the house in her long flannel nightie and runs to Martin
Martin
Ride me as far as the well
Grab hold
He swings her up in front of his saddle
They start away
Ethan is last to ride out
He is watching Martha
He brings a gloved hand up in a salute
She starts to raise her hand but only brings it just above her waist, a fluttering gesture with tremulous fingers
It is the last he will ever see of her alive
'  - as the posse slowly rides out, with Ethan last
Martin reins in to let Debbie slip to the ground
Ethan passes her
Debbie stands watching the men ride away, waving at them
' (calling) She turns and comes running back --   -- to the little group on the porch; Ben in the door; Lucy crossing the porch; Aaron and Martha at the steps
: -   -  - Ethan and Mose are advancing at a steady walk, both men leaning slightly out of their saddles to study the terrain -- the trail they are following
Out to one side -- fifty yards distant -- is the main body of the posse: Sam, Jorgensen, Charlie, Ed, moving roughly parallel to Ethan but at a faster clip
Martin comes riding in toward Ethan from behind
(calling) Uncle Ethan
Ethan reins in -- compressing his lips at the "Uncle
" Mose waits
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan
Stop callin' me 'uncle'
ain't your uncle
Yes, sir
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither
Nor grampaw neither
Nor Methuselah neither
can whup you to a frazzle
Mose lets out a snickering laugh
What you want me to call you
Name's Ethan
Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail
Well, fust off
He breaks and all turn at a distant hail from Jorgensen
Look
Look
-   -    - He is holding his rifle with both hands straight over his head -- and he repeats the signal until he sees they have seen him
' (excitedly) Brad
He's found them
Come on
-   - as Jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way
The other riders follow
-  -   - He waits grimly until he sees them coming, then wheels his mount and takes off over the hill
- as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest
Jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay
The other men look down into the long valley on the far side with equally grim expressions
Call that young fool back
Jorgensen doesn't even seem to hear him
Angrily Ethan whips out revolver and fires into the air
Then he swings his arm in a come-back gesture
He rides out ahead then a short distance and dismounts
and slowly the others follow
We see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun
Ethan goes to the nearest one
feathered lance is driven into it
He pulls the lance out
Mose comes over beside him
(angrily) Caddo or Kiowa, huh
Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that
He hands the lance to Mose
(almost a whisper) Ay-he
Comanch
Brad rides in -- shrill with anger
Killed every one -- an' not for food either
Why'd they do a thing like that
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out
This here's a murder raid
(facing Jorgensen) It shapes up to scald out either your place
or my brother's
Jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the miles they have ridden
Mama
Oh please
please no
And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off
fast
Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry follow
Sam Clayton pauses
Jorgensen's place is closest
If they're not there, we'll come straight on
Then he too rides
Martin swings his horse back to where Ethan and Mose still are standing
Well, come on
Easy
(he starts toward his horse) It's forty miles, sonny
Horses can do with some grain and a little rest
Comanch generally hits at moonrise
Moonrise
It'll be midnight before
ain't waitin'
He wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the others
Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed his horse
Mose does the same
Wisht it was Caddoes
or Kiowas
(shakes his head) Comanche
Ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle
: -   - Nothing moves
Nothing could be more tranquil
The shadows are long
thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney
And then Debbie's little dog trots around the side of the house out into the yard
-   -   - He comes to a standstill and his nose is working
He begins to make excited little sounds deep in his belly
Then he lies down, muzzle between his paws, watching, listening
-   - Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll
The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting
Beyond her, on the porch steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame
We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes
Aaron comes from behind  and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe
Near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt
He puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at Deborah, intent on her play
He looks swiftly at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt
He hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it
He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door
Think 'll see if  can pick off a sage-hen or two, Martha
-
- busy at the wooden sink
Martha doesn't turn
You do that, Aaron
(still pleased with himself) Won't go far
He steps out
Only then does Martha turn -- and her : - and  the empty holster, as Aaron pauses on the porch
' My, the days are getting shorter
-   - as Lucy heads for the lamp
(sharply) Lucy
We don't need the lamp yet
Lucy frowns at her mother
(easily) Let's enjoy the dusk a while
-
-    - Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain
(to Ben) Mind you sweep up them shavin's
Yes, Pa
(undertone -- man to man) An' if you see any sage-hens, 'm ready
Aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever, by his side -- to disclose Ethan's cavalry sabre
Aaron smiles and rubs the youngster's head, then sets out across the yard
-   - Debbie's dog rises at Aaron's approach and joins his master as they set out across the plain
-
- He is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense alive and straining
He pauses every three or four strides -- casting each quadrant in turn
Once he whips, gun ready, as a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him
He smiles grimly as he watches it fly away
He keeps on
-
- Martha comes to stand in the doorway
Ben doesn't look at her
His eyes -- like hers -- are fixed on the figure of the man
(quietly) It's all right, ma
been watchin'
Only  wish
(quietly) What, Ben
wish Uncle Ethan was here
Don't you, ma
She doesn't answer
Lucy comes to the door
Mother,  can't see what 'm doing
,
-   - He stands on the near slope of a rise and then gradually moves toward its summit, so that only head will be silhouetted
He drops to one knee, half-leaning against the slope and slowly looks out
The   very slowly, following his careful sweep of the terrain
The scene is entirely peaceful
-   - with narrowed eyes slowly scanning the ground
Suddenly the head whips right
We hear a bird's sharp call
-   - It is taking flight, sweeping away in erratic arcs
- He squints closely at the ground from which the bird had flown
Then slowly his eyes range toward the left
-   - Across the meadow, a shadow seems to touch the grass and at once a covey of quail takes off, whirring loud
Aaron waits no longer, but slides down the slope and starts running at a crouch for the house, stopping every so often to look backward
-
-    - : What
has in mind for this and the following scenes is the same kind of dramatic use of red you achieved in "Yellow Ribbon" in the scene telling of Custer's defeat
They are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and Ben has Ethan's sabre in his hand
We hear Aaron coming at a run, breathing hard
Ben takes a step as though to go to him, but Martha's hand at once is on his shoulder
Aaron gains the porch
In the house, boy
and
He puts finger to his lips, sign for Ben to say nothing
Ben nods and goes inside
Aaron and Martha face each other, the question large on her face
Slowly he nods the confirmation of her fears, then gently propels her ahead of him through the door
-   - The room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness
Ben is waiting and Martha turns toward Aaron as he pulls the door shut, bars it and sets the shotgun down
He takes the revolver from his waist and Martha holds it as he reaches for his gun belt
Ben, close the shutters
Buckling on his gun belt, he moves toward the middle of the room, looking around him, taking inventory of his resources
Lucy slowly approaches, biting a knuckle, eyes wide with fright
Pa
One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing in goes out
Martha, Aaron and Lucy are dark silhouettes now against the red beam from another window
(sudden fear) Where's Deborah
(calling it) Debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light
She is clutching her rag doll, nibbling a cookie
She holds it for them to see
only took one, ma
Topsy was hungry
Ben closes the shutter
And now the room is almost completely blacked out, except for the dying light filtering through the rifle ports of the closed shutters
: -    -   - This should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the posse has split -- the main group heading for the Jorgensen place, Martin forking off to race alone for the Edwards ranch
Coming toward and passing  is Martin, riding all out
Several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction are the others -- Brad and Charlie, Sam, Jorgensen and Ed Nesby
The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out, each taking his own best course and his own speed
As the riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance, possibly a mile or two behind
-   -    - (
: What we are trying to get here is that moment of swift transition from twilight to night; of riders briefly touched with the last colors of day and then, as they pass, becoming one with blue shadows of night
) Ethan and Mose are holding their mounts to a jog, in marked contrast to the all-out pace of the others
The after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across the valley
The wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the hills a coyote pack yaps
: -        - Aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers into the night through a partly-opened shutter
Suddenly the room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters, holding a lighted lamp
Aaron closes the shutter, spins on her angrily
Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp
In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is crouched at another window -- rifle ready; and that Deborah is on her feet -- standing like a child who is being dressed
'm sorry
couldn't find the shawl
Hurry, Martha
Moon's fixin' to rise
He cautiously swings the shutters open
pale light filters into the room
We see Martha wrapping the shawl around Deborah
(softly to the child) We're going to play the sleep-out game
Remember
Where you hide out with grandma
Where's she buried
And you'll go along the ditch -- very quietly -- like a
(her voice breaks) Like a little mouse
Now
He reaches for the child, but he has to wait for Martha's last embrace
There
And you won't come back or make a sound
no matter what you hear
Promise
No matter what
promise
Wait
Child, child
Can't  have Topsy to keep me company
There's no time
Here she is, baby
Baby
Aaron takes the child, swings her out the window
Down low -- go
Martha would come to the window to look out, but Aaron bars her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to watch her go
Outside the little dog barks a welcome and presumably starts to follow the girl
Aaron reacts
(hoarse whisper) Here dog
here
The dog whines but obeys
Aaron continues watching the child's course -- unconsciously imitating her every run and twist
Then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners of his eyes
She reached the ditch
He closes the shutters and turns -- and his arms go around Martha, weeping soundlessly
She'll be all right, mother
she'll be all right
-
- Nothing stirs and we hear nothing
Then, with faintest little rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed against Topsy
She becomes one with the earth and the stillness
And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals something glittering -- like beads
And the  from that ground-level shot : -     - The Comanche we are later to know as  is painted for war -- tall, savage, mockingly looking down at what we know is the child's hiding place
And in that instant, from a dozen quarters and a dozen throats, sounds the wild yammer of the warwhoop
: -
-  - He stands beside his spent and fallen horse
Its breathing is a rasping whistle
Martin tries to haul its head up
Useless
Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch
Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- struggling with it because it is under the horse
He freezes then -- listening
And we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching
Martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope
He gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders
(shouting) Ethan
Ethan
The   with him and we see Ethan and Mose approaching at the same steady gait
(waving) Uncle Ethan
it's me
Martin
Ethan doesn't slacken, nearly rides him down
Out of my way
Martin goes sprawling to his hands and knees
Mose continues without slowing
-   -    - (desperately) Mose
Wait
He goes running, stumbling after the riders -- desperately calling to them
Ethan
Mose
And then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops -- We see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the barns and the hayricks and the house of Aaron Edwards
Martin runs down the slope
-   - (
: Here again that use of red is suggested
) The  is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan as they ride in
Little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights
few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are burning along their shafts
Beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral
There are no bodies in evidence
The red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount
Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door
He stops there -- and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump
Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in
Mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief
We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through the house: (
) Lucy
Deborah
Lucy
He strides back through the main room and out onto the porch just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard
Ethan takes a few steps out toward him
Martin would pass him, but Ethan grabs his arm
(harshly) You stay out
Martin tries to fight his arm free
Nothing for you to see
Leggo
Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw
Martin goes down -- out cold
And only now do we understand how merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the fallen figure
Don't let him go in there, Mose
And he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop
-   - as he nears the graves
(calling) Lucy -- Lucy
He runs in, looking around him
He sees the little dog, dead on the ground
And then he sees a shadowed something: The shawl Debbie had worn
It is spread out, almost as though concealing a body
Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away
There is nothing there, but the shawl
He drops to his knees, his head bowed, his face tortured
The moonlight is clear on the face of the nearer headboard
It is of weathered wood and the chiselled letters on it read: 12, 1852 a good  &  In her 41st year : -   -   - The funeral is begun
In the foreground are three newly- made crosses at the head of as many open graves -- which we need not see
With head bared, Sam Clayton is concluding his prayer
Near him stand the Jorgensen family: Mrs
Jorgensen, Lars and  -- blonde, just beginning to reach her maturity -- and a stepping-stone of tow-headed children
and to Your keeping we commend the souls of Aaron
Martha
and Benjamin Edwards
Mrs
Jorgensen and Laurie -- impelled by the same feminine sympathy and interest -- turn to look at Ethan and Martin
The   picks them up
Ethan standing dry-eyed, looking at the grave of Martha; Martin -- with bruised lip -- looking out across the plain
Clayton now opens his small, well-worn Bible to a marked page
Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble
Ethan looks at him, angrily, impatiently
He cometh forth like a
(harshly) Amen
Put an 'amen' to it
like a flower and is cut down
Amen
Amen
Ethan turns on his heel and walks --   -- to where Ed Nesby has been holding the horses
Brad is already mounting
Mose is there too and Charlie MacCorry
Silhouetted against the dawn light are the rifles in each man's saddle scabbard
Clayton is right behind Ethan
Charlie--you and Brad ride point
Don't get too far ahead
The young riders spur out
-
-
Ethan is about to mount when Mrs
Jorgensen comes up and catches his arm
Ethan
(he turns impatiently) Those girls mean as much to me as though they were my own
Maybe you don't know my Brad's been sittin' up with Lucy
and my Laurie's real fond of Martin
Ethan glances back at where Martin and Laurie are standing
- The girl is looking at Martin full of compassion, tries to console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares blindly at the graves and Jorgensen stolidly beginning the work of shovelling them full
- Ethan looks back at her -- stone-faced
(impatiently) 'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am
am
am
It's just that know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls
And if the girls are
dead
Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance
Ethan shrugs his arm free and mounts
Promise me, Ethan
He ignores her and turns angrily to where Martin is
(harshly) Come on, if you're comin'
He digs spurs and rides out with the others
Martin comes over, with Laurie a step behind
His face is set, his eyes almost unseeing
(a heartbroken murmur) Oh, Martin
Martin
We'll find them, Mrs
Jorgensen
We'll find them
He swings into his saddle
Laurie impulsively runs to his side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the mouth
He looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it
And she is back beside her mother
Martin rides away after the others
(slowly) almost hope they don't find them
Laurie looks at her mother and understands
: 61- -   - The   begins as we see the riders in turn
series of portraits of the men
-    - riding point, they come to a pause, surveying the terrain ahead
Charlie, with an arm signal, indicates he will take the left
Brad nods and he rides out to the right
, Clayton passing first, expression resolute, competent
Then Ed Nesby and old Mose, squinting at the ground as they ride, all but sniffing like an old hound dog
63A - Next to last in file
Finally: 63B - His face a study of relentless purpose
: -   -    - The two men are at a cairn of rocks -- their horses nearby
In the near distance, Clayton is leading the men of the search party at a fast clip toward the cairn
Charlie is standing, Brad tearing the rock cairn apart
In Charlie's hands is a Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers
Brad doesn't even look up as the men ride in and dismount, but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried Indian
Another one, eh
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan
don't like it
What don't you like
Injun's on a raid generly hides their dead so you won't know how many they've lost
If they don't care about us knowin', it only spells one thing
they ain't afraid of us followin' -- or of us catchin' up with 'em either
You can back out any time, Nesby
Didn't say that
(angrily indicating Brad) What's he doin' that for
He wants to be sure
Brad shifts another rock and Looks grimly upon the face (
) of the dead Comanche
Then he spits at it and stands
(grim) Let's get along
(to Brad) Why don't you finish the job
With that he strides to the cairn, whipping a knife out
he crouches over the body (
) concealing what he is doing, he bends to his bloody task
Sam Clayton crosses to stand behind him
(gravely) What good does that do
By what you preach
none
He stands now and he faces Sam
But by what the Comanche believe -- now he can't enter the spirit land, but has got to wander forever between the winds
because  took his mangy scalp
He flings the scalp down and grinds it into the dirt with his heel
He wipes clean the blade of his knife as he crosses back to his horse
The men mount (those who have dismounted) and they ride off
: -  -   - Brad is looking out into the night -- strain and tension in every line
Beyond them we may see some of the other men -- sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire
(a whisper) If only she's alive
'll make it up to her
No matter what's happened
'll make her forget
She's just got to be alive
Ethan crosses behind them carrying his blanket roll
He looks at them sourly
Get some rest
They move off, heading for their blankets
The on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side
He fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies it by the light of the flickering little fire
70- -   - It is a picture of Martha
The    to show Ethan studying it gravely, then putting it away and lying back to stare broodingly into the night
: -   - , , ,  - The four faces are just over the ridge, peering at something far distant, far below
Could be a buffler
It's horses,  tell ya
It's them all right
He starts to squirm down the ridge, the others following
-   -   - Ethan's group crosses to where the other men are waiting with the horses
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here
Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before daybreak
(slowly) You're right sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan
Martin and Brad stare at Sam -- not understanding the question
But Mose knows what he means and studiously looks into space
(touch of defiance) It's what we're here for, ain't it
thought we were trying to get the girls back -- alive
We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em
You know that
(bewildered, angry) But
but what are we doin' then
What are we supposed to do
What  had in mind was runnin' off their hoss herd
Comanche on foot is more apt to be willin' to listen
That makes sense to me
Yeah
(angrily) What do you know about it
What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him
You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as
as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em
say we do it my way, Ethan
and that's an order
Yes, sir
But if you're wrong, Captain Clayton, don't ever give me another
They look into each other's eyes a moment, then Sam turns to mount
and the others follow
Slowly then they start riding down the slope
: ,    -   - - (: It is now planned to shoot this on sound stage
) Fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp
Some cattails in the near ground
The effect is eerie, very still except for the trilling of frogs
Then, very quietly, the men emerge from the mist swirling around them
They are leading their horses
Sam looks baffled, angry
They stand still, listening -- then slowly continue
-   -   - ( ) The mist is thinning
In the f
g
is a small blackened area -- the ashes of a campfire
The men come through the mist -- wary, vigilant
It is Mose who first spots the fire
He runs to it and drops beside and feels the ashes
The others come up around him
Ay-he
They was here
(to Sam) They  here
Now they're out there
an' waitin' to jump us
He looks at Clayton
You got any more orders, Captain
(quietly) Just keep goin'
They move on, slowly
74- -   -  ( ) The mist is thinning as the men warily move along
Suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and to one side
the men turn slightly, hearing it
moment later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead
From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders are aware of its significance
Mose cups hand to his mouth and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls
Clayton glares at him
(in soft apology) Jus' bein' sociable, Cap'n
Ethan grins wryly
And now the first, faint, ruddy touch of the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn through the mist
74- -   - The    from a sun-touched butte or crag to the file of men slowly walking their horses
An occasional shred of mist drifts by
Everything about the little cavalcade bespeaks tension, watchfulness
Suddenly -- and every man sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel with, but slightly converging on, our group
(softly) Keep goin'
Brad, who has been looking up ahead, sounds a new warning
(tensely) Look
Easy
74- -   - Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very quietly
Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly away from the converging files, but still riding slowly
And then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap
(to Clayton) If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded
How far's the river from here, Mose
been baptized, Reverend
yes suh, been baptized, thank ye
Well, you better brace yourself for another one
Ya-
And with that yell, he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an angle to the converging Indian files -- and every man is with him
In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give chase
74- -   - with the Ranger group short-cutting in such a way as to outstrip the Comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river
74- '  -   - Clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers reach the bank
They rein in, wheel their horses and are reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting their horses, rifles at their shoulders
The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison -- and the Indians wheel to shelter
-
And once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the river, followed by the others
74- - As the men pound across
74- -   - They dismount and Charlie and Nesby take the horses and run them to some place of protection as the men group around Clayton and Ethan
During this: (shouting his orders) This is as good as any
Charlie, you and Ed take the horses
Mose runs over and crouches beside Ethan
Beyond Ethan is Martin, then Brad
Nesby and Charlie will rejoin the group after an appropriate interval
with all the men shielded behind river boulders, etc
'  - Ethan and Mose are hunkered down behind some rocks, very casual and business-like as they check rifles, set out and carefully wipe cartridges
(chattily) Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an' me fit us some Kiowas
Martin is in the throes of buck-fever, wiping mouth with back of his hand, peering anxiously across the river
You think they mean to charge us, Uncle Ethan
We found us an ole buffler wallow
(staring across river) Criminy
'  -   - On the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then wheeling off -- jeering, taunting
Brad starts to bring up his rifle
Steady, Daniel Boone
You don't want to miss
It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours
Ay-he
That's jest what  tole Joe Powers
That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan
One Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing his rifle, taunting the white men
moment later he is joined by a second brave
(grimly) Real sassy
He and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then the two shots crack out almost simultaneously
And within split seconds both Comanches fall
The others race away
Sam comes charging over to Ethan and Mose
(angrily) didn't give any order to fire
That's all right, Captain
don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch
(grimly) You got one now
And he drops behind a rock as, with a wild whooping, the Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit the river
The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen, staring wild-eyed at the oncoming Comanches
'  -   - Brad, Charlie, Clayton, Nesby are snapping shot after shot
Only Martin seems out of it
Ethan shoots him a glance
Slack your shoulders
Slack 'em
Your hands'll take care of themselves
Some of the tension leaves Martin
Somehow his gun is in position and he is firing as fast and well as the others
77- -   - The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies' necks, whooping and firing
Men and horses go down, counted off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans
But they keep coming
77- '  -   -  , , They drop their rifles now and pull out revolvers for close- range work
One Comanche breaks through from the side, his buffalo lance ready for the thrust
Ethan whirls and fires
The Comanche horse charges through the defense line and out and there is a muffled scream of pain from Ed Nesby
77- -   - The charge breaks and Comanches wheel left and right, racing back across the river
With magnificent horsemanship, one brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows and swings him up behind
Two others, riding together, head for one of the two dead Comanches Ethan and Mose had downed on their first shots
Swinging simultaneously from their saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off
77- '  - (cackling) There goes yer scalp, Ethan
Ethan snuggles his rifle to his shoulder as two other racing Comanches prepare to pick up the other dead Indian
Most of the Comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing away
The firing from the Texans has stopped
still got one out there
'  -   - The angle is along his rifle barrel as it beads on one of the racing Comanches trying to pick up the dead Indian
Clayton's big hand grasps the rifle barrel
' (quietly) No, Ethan
'  -   - Ethan looks up into Clayton's face
Let them bury their dead
Ethan pulls the gun free and looks out across the river
-   - The Comanches have done their work, are riding away -- and over the saddle of one lies the limp form of the dead Indian
Ethan looks back at Sam
That tears it, Reverend
From now on, you keep out
(mad now -- facing the others) All of you
don't want you with me
don't need you
for what got to do
(quietly) No need to shout, mister
The   to pick up the figure of Nesby outstretched on the ground, writhing in pain; with Charlie kneeling beside him
The men cross to stand around the fallen man
Reckon we got to go back -- Ed's shoulder is smashed -- bad
can make it
just get me on a horse
No good, Ed
And Ethan's right
This is a job for a company of Rangers
or it's a job for one or two men
Right now we're too many
an' not enough
(facing Ethan) Only one way you can stop me lookin' for Lucy, mister
An' that's kill me
That's how  feel, Uncle Ethan
(correcting the slip) Ethan, sir
Ethan glares at them, but has to accept it
All right
but 'm givin' the orders
You take 'em or we split up here and now
(quickly) Why, sure, Ethan
There's just the one thing we're after
finding Deborah and Lucy
(grimly -- turning away) If they're still alive
He heads away, for his horse
Brad and Martin look at each other as the full import of Ethan's footnote strikes home
Then they head for their own horses
86- - Ethan, Martin, and Brad mount
Clayton crosses to them
You boys got enough shells
They nod
Yeah
Vaya con dios
The three re-enter the river and slowly start across, with Clayton gravely looking after them
The three riders continue across the river
and the Search Theme resumes
: -   - region of buttes and giant rock formations; treeless, arid and seemingly reaching out to infinity
Far off we see a cloud of dust -- miles and miles off
Only the dust, nothing else
From behind  ride the three men -- Ethan, Brad, and Martin -- dust-powdered, eyes bloodshot
The three are watching that distant cloud of dust
They force their weary horses onward
: -   - The  is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock into another long reach of valley -- different from the first view of it, yet alike in its suggestion of endlessness
But now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to suggest the passage of anything but time itself
Ethan, Martin, and Brad ride into the fringe of the butte's shadow and scan the terrain ahead
(shrill) They got to stop sometime
if they're human at all, they got to stop
Naw
a human man rides a horse till it dies
then he goes on afoot
Comanche comes along
gets that horse up
and rides it twenty more miles
Then he eats it
Ethan turns to catch Martin thirstily drinking from his canteen
(angrily) Easy on that
Sorry
We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch
Maybe they split up
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive
Brad wheels on him
You've said that enough
Maybe Lucy's dead
maybe they're both dead
but if  hear it from you again, 'll fight ya, Mr
Edwards
(an aside) That'll be the day
Let's ride
: 89- -   -   - (: This is the gap in the rocks near the "Medicine Country" at Monument
) The three riders come to where the trail they have been following forks
the main horseprint track leading ahead, a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes
Four of 'em cut out here
Why
Ethan thinks he knows why
His face is bleak
But he tries to be casual
'll take a look
You keep after the others
He turns his mount toward the gap
(eagerly) You want us to fire a shot if
(disgustedly) No
nor build bonfires
nor beat drums neither
'll meet you on the far side
He's still grumbling as he rides off
An abashed Martin rides ahead along the broad trail with Brad
(: Ethan's serape, tied behind his saddle, should be clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible
) : - Martin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route -- haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his horse, his back to them, some distance along
They turn slightly off their course and ride out toward him
-   - Ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in
His serape is no longer behind his saddle
Ethan looks at them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing them
Oh
it's you
They both stare at him
(a vague gesture) uh
here's where they met up again
They both can see that
(pointing) Trail leads off there
They look at him and each other -- for these are clearly unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan
Why'd they break off
(no answer) Was there water in that canyon
Huh
No
no water
You all right, Ethan
Huh
(more like his usual gruff self) Sure 'm all right
He goes to his horse, mounts
Martin is right beside him and he notes the missing serape
Say
What happened to your blanket
Lose it
Must've
Anyway,  ain't goin' back to look for it
He leads out
Brad rides up beside Martin
Again the two exchange puzzled looks
Martin shrugs and the three continue along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting sun
: -      - Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so that barely the glow of the flames can be seen
Beyond him Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away
The men have come to the end of another long day
Both men look up as Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the incline to their camp
His horse is lathered
(shouting it) saw her
saw Lucy
Martin runs to his side as Brad slides off his mount
Ethan moves more slowly
(continuing) They're camped 'bout two miles over
was just swingin' back when  saw their smoke
bellied up a ridge an' they was right below me
Did you see Debbie
No, but  saw Lucy all right
She was wearin' that blue dress
an' she was walkin' along
(voice flat) What you saw wasn't Lucy
It was,  tell you
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress
(they stare at him) found Lucy back there in that canyon
wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands thought it best to keep it from you -- long as  could
He can't look at Brad or at Martin
Brad can't speak -- and then finally: Did they
Was she
Ethan wheels on him in shouting fury
(blazing) What've  got to do -- draw you a picture
Spell it out
Don't ever ask me
Long as you live don't ever ask me more
Brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand
He turns -- walking stiff-legged as though on stilts back to his horse
He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his grief
Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan
And in that moment, Brad mounts and takes off in the same direction from which he had ridden in
(frantically) They run for their horses
: 92- -  -  -   - He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and skims it away
He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve the rush of raging blood
92- -
-  - He reaches the crest and reins in
distant firelight is on his face
He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche camp o
s
Then he has his gun out
His eyes are wild, his face wet with sweat
Then he throws back his head and he yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp
92- -   -    - They rein in -- staring -- as from afar they hear Brad's yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls
There is nothing they can do
They hear his shouts, then the quick bark of his
44, and the angry shouts of the Comanche
92- -   -  -  - His face is red with the reflected light of the fires he is passing o
s
and his eyes are alight with a crazy, savage joy
His gun cracks once, then again -- and the hammer clicks on a spent shell
92- -   -  - He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched
He releases it at his running target
We hear its impact and a high gasp of pain
and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other Comanches
92- -        - The distant yammering of the Comanches doesn't quite drown out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping knife was busy in the last instance of Brad's life
Martin slumps in his saddle
Ethan listens a moment, then turns to Martin
Let's just hope he took some with him
He turns his horse back the way they had come
Martin stares at him
What you goin' to do
Get some sleep
Tomorrow's another day
Slowly, he rides away
Slowly, reluctantly but helpless to do otherwise, Martin follows
: -    - study of horseprints etched in the soil -- the mark of the passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather fallen from a warbonnet
And then we hear and see the approach of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen -- Ethan and Martin -- following the trail
The Search Theme resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us suggest the passage of time, the change of scene
-   -    - The two figures are little more than specks in a vastness of savage country
: -    - Again we study the hooves of two horses, fighting their way up a rocky slope and past a thorn bush on which -- fluttering in the mountain wind -- is a torn scrap of scarlet cloth with a bit of beadwork or Indian decoration
: -    -    - It is a portrait study of two faces -- etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks
Martin has aged years in a matter of months
Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly beards
(bitterly) Say it
We're beat
(slowly) No
our turnin' back don't change anything
not in the long run
If she's alive, she's safe
for a while
They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to
He turns his mount
And you think we got a chance to find her
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough
Then he quits
Same when he runs
Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on
So we'll find them in the end,  promise you that
We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth
-   - The time is spring
It is a year and a half later
The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood
meadowlark breaks into his sudden song
dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind  toward the house
In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door
-   -   - Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions
Bearing a lamp, Mrs
Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes
Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her
Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as Ethan and Martin dismount
-
- The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image of Ethan
Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech)
Neither man is sure of his reception
They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; and Martin is thinking of Laurie
And then Mrs
Jorgensen is running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him
He stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace
Ethan watches a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen
(to Jorgensen) You got my letter about your son, Brad
Yah
Just about this time a year ago
It came the day before his
birthday
The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh away
Mrs
Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside
Martin hangs back
ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen
These clothes is
Laurie rushes past her mother
Martie
She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes for anyone else
Mrs
Jorgensen looks on with amusement
Martin is just bowled over
(teasing) And him probably forgettin' all about you
Probably can't even call your name to mind
(smiling) Laurie
And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother
(continuing) But  fairly forgot just how pretty you was
Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there is no further resistance from Martin
Mrs
Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and her face is gravely questioning
The little one
Debbie
Ethan shakes his head
She squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors
: ' -
- - This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room -- and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly a fireplace
Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying his back with a long-handled brush
Beyond him is the door
It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered
Hey
What you doin'
She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags
During this: (a yelp) Don't go takin' that stuff
Ain't worth the mendin'
She turns and looks at him, matter of fact
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for
have brothers, haven't
Well  ain't one of 'em
'm a woman, Martie
(he tries to say something but she goes right on) We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives
When you're little we even wash you
How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman 'll never know
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid
Wouldn't bother me
(she heads for the door) wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was  you
And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her
- It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the good plain Swedish modern of today
There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor
All told, a cheerful, warm-smelling room
Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear
She will wait, listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get her mother's attention
Jorgensen is sitting in his usual chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less in tune with what Ethan is talking about
Mrs
Jorgensen is in her rocker, darning or knitting
Ethan is standing near the mantel
an' then it snowed and we lost the trail
No need to tell ya all the places we went
Fort Richardson, Fort Wingate an' Cobb
the Anadarko Agency
Trouble is we don't even know which band that war party belonged to
Mrs
Jorgensen looks up from her darning
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan
got your boy killed
(gently) Don't go blamin' yourself
(angrily) It's this country killed my boy
Yes, by golly
Mrs
Jorgensen stands
Now Lars
It so happens we be Texicans
We took a reachin' hold, way far out, past where any man has right or reason to hold on
Or if we didn't, our folks did
So we can't leave off without makin' them out to be fools, wastin' their lives 'n wasted in the way they died Texican's nothin' but a human man out on a limb
This year an' next and maybe for a hundred more
But don't think it'll be forever
Someday this country will be a fine good place to be
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come
The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't heard a word of it
Ma
Martie's drawers is a sight
Ain't fit for rags
Would it be all right if we gave him some of Brad's things
There is just the briefest hesitation
Why
'course it would
They're in the chest
And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a big chest at the far end of the room
(rising excitedly) By golly, the letter
In the chest, mama
It came for you, Ethan
last winter
Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs
Jorgensen is raising the top of a huge dower chest
She extracts a letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths
(continuing) Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought it
Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before venturing to open it
Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying not to seem nosy
The women remain at the chest -- pulling out various folded garments, etc
Finally Ethan carefully opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two- inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet
He reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and looks at the snip of cloth
(quietly) Mrs
Jorgensen
She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long- handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes, etc
Will you look at this
He holds out the snip of calico
Why it's just a snip of calico
You ever see it before
like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore
Yes
Yes,  remember
Have they found her, Ethan
No
not yet
He takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and carefully pockets it
He looks broodingly into the fire
(continuing) not yet
Laurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes
-   - Martin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket
He glares up as Laurie enters
His feet are in his boots
Might at least have left me my pants
Shush
Time for bed anyway
(putting clothes near him) Likely these'll need some takin' in
Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted
Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and
' (calling) Laurie
Come
come
Ethan opens the door, enters
Yes, Pa
Good night, Martie
good night, Mr
Edwards
She wants to kiss Martie but is shy in Ethan's presence and hurries out
Good night
Laurie
Good night
Martin stoops to remove his boots
Ethan studies him and looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin
He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively
He starts to undress
Martin lies back on his bunk
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own
(staring) cattle
' cattle
Ethan returns the stare without any change of expression
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while 'm gone
'll be pushin' on tomorrow
ain't stayin'
set out lookin' for Debbie
aim to keep on
Why
Because she's my
my
She's your nothin'
She's no kin to you at all
always felt like she was
Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own
That don't make 'em kin
All right
ain't got no kin
'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all
How
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em
You ain't even got money to buy cartridges
Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here
Martin throws himself back, turns his face to the wall
Ethan looks soberly at him -- and is sorry for the brutality of his words
Martin
want you to know somethin'
(turning -- mad as hell) Yeah
you want me to know  ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear
You tole me that already
Now shut your head
Good night
: -   - It is a still scene, with the first light of day in the sky, a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney
-
-  - She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly around her waist
She wears moccasins for slippers
Her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor
She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a coffee pot is on the boil
Beyond her the door to the grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in Brad's clothes
His eyes whip around the room
Laurie doesn't turn as he slowly approaches
(quietly) Ethan rode on
an hour ago
The starch goes out of him
He walks heavily to the table and sits, slumped
She looks at him compassionately
don't know what you can do about finding Debbie that he can't
He just shakes his head, not looking at her
She lifts the food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him
He'll find her now, Martie
Please believe me
know
He shakes his head
She crosses to the stove for the coffee pot
That's what scares me -- him findin' her
Now it is her turn to stare
Laurie, 've seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word 'Comanche' 've seen him take his knife an' never mind
But he's a man can go crazy wild
It might come on him when it was the worst thing could be
What  counted on,  hoped to be there to stop him, if such thing come
Laurie has poured his coffee
Now he sips it
She sits at the table with him
(slowly) hoped  could hold you here
But guess  knew
So  stole this for you
She takes Ethan's letter from her breast and hands it to him
He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud
' bought a small size dress off a Injun
If this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward
know where they gone
Jerem Futterman
' Martin is on his feet
(excited) Futterman
He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos
Laurie,  just got to get me a good horse
Think yer pa would
Finish your breakfast
gotta catch up with him, Laurie
(almost in tears -- but angry) Go on then
Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud
an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze
But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse
Laurie goes to the front door and throws it wide
(hysterically) Take it and welcome
but don't count on finding me here when you get back
've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you ain't cut out to be an old maid
(miserably) can't help it, Laurie
just gotta catch up with Ethan
He runs out and she slams the door, then rests her head against it
113- -   - Mrs
Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with head pressed against the door
She wants to offer some word of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say
She crosses to the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee
Then we hear the drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away
Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him back
113- - from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding one horse, leading another, goes galloping away
'   -   - Low, squat adobe structure, with a crudely lettered sign- board proclaiming it: '
, ' There are adjacent outbuildings and corral
Four horses are tied outside, two being pack animals
surly-looking white man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door, whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses covetously
He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back
Andale
Andale
Fearfully she quickens her step
The man gets up, shoves knife into belt and heads into the post
'   -   - It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables and benches
The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards
Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room, examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's
Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look; yes, it's hers
Both look up as  crosses from the bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his fingers thrust inside the glasses
Futterman is a squaw man and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face
Drink
He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey and thumb-printed it is almost opaque
Both Ethan and Martin regard it with disgust
Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it
Martin snatches it out of his hand
(harshly) How'd you come by this
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward
That's what  said
You got it with you
Ethan looks at him and beyond toward the two men
' -   -   - The solitaire player has a card in mid-air -- frozen, watching
The other man has the same buzzard-watchful look
' -   - Reward'll be paid when  find her -- an' if she's alive
Futterman uncorks the jug, prepares to drink
Man's got a right to expect some kind o' payment
laid out for the dress an' sendin' you the writin'
He tilts the jug to his mouth as Ethan reaches for his heavy leather pouch
Futterman watches greedily as Ethan lets a gold piece slide out
He tosses it onto the table
Twenty Yankee dollars
Futterman puts the jug down
His hand inches -- as though pulled by a magnet -- toward the gold piece
an' a man's time is worth somethin'
Ethan's big hand clamps over Futterman's and he starts squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon
Futterman's lips whiten
Talk
young buck fetched it in late last summer
(Ethan eases the grip) Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar
Scar
Never heard of any Chief Scar
Me neither
But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches
Keep talking
Scar's band was headin' north
to winter in at Fort Wingate
eatin' agency beef
That's what this buck said
Maybe he lied
And maybe you lie
In that case you won't find her -- and  won't get my thousand dollars
Ethan stands
Martin follows
Martin takes the dress and folds it carefully
(too casually) Stay the night if you want
(Ethan shakes his head) Cards
jug
If you'd like some company, we got a few squaws on the place
Ethan and Martin head for the door
No thanks
The two plug-uglies stand -- mean ready to do their master's bidding
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars
Ain't yours yet
They leave
The  holds on Futterman as he slowly rubs his bruised hand
His henchmen drift toward him
(slight smile) Bad manners
He shoulda said 'good- bye
' : -
-  - They have set up camp near a cluster of cottonwoods to which the horses have been tied
One of the horses is restless, possibly nickering
Ethan strokes its neck, looking out thoughtfully into the night -- listening
' Acts like somethin's out there
(heading toward campfire) Smells a change in the weather
him to where Martin is spreading his blanket some little distance from the small fire
Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't have a frost 'fore mornin'
Here
(he picks up a saddle and puts it close to fire) Whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy
Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a pillow
Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire, making it blaze up
Hey
What's the idea
Maybe 'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight
He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll, and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to suggest it is over the figure of a man
During this: Funny
When we passed through Fort Wingate last winter, we didn't hear mention of any Nawyecky Comanche there
Ethan steps back -- and studies the "dummy
" Not so funny
if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means
What's that
Ethan studies Martin's back -- the light on him -- and looks around figuring the range of fire
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse
(drowsily) Oh
You all settled an' comfortable now
Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket
Ethan nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change positions
Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy
He picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp
: -     -   - - Three shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen -- are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards
At a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot
-
- still snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him
-   - At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp
Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning
The two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position
shot cracks
and one man is knocked flat on his face
The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target
second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist
Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around
Futterman starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks
third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area
Martin is on his feet now
-   - He is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet
He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going to his gun
Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle
Thanks
you did just fine
Ethan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into his pockets -- first one, then another
(dazed) Futterman
He just couldn't wait
(watching him go through pockets) Whatchu doin'
Ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold piece in the air, catches it and pockets it
Even got my twenty dollars back
We did all right
And now Martin is getting the whole picture
and he's mad
You just used me for bait -- staked me out like a
buildin' up the fire
fixin' it so's
coulda had my brains blowed out
Ethan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying none of it
(explosively) Suppose you'd missed
Ethan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised
Never occurred to me
: -   - It is a day in early winter
Charlie MacCorry, short-coated, is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it -- carrying a load of firewood
(calling it) Howdy, Mister Jorgensen
Charlie
MacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door opens and Mrs
Jorgensen comes out -- shawled against the cold
Got a letter here
Jorgensen lets the cordwood drop
By golly
letter
For Miss Laurie
Come in, Charlie, come in
(calling inside) My land
Two letters in the one year
- as Charlie enters, following Mrs
Jorgensen
Jorgensen excitedly enters and closes the door
Laurie comes in from another room
Charlie smiles and bows clumsily
(to Laurie) letter for you, Laurie
Yes'm
Figgered it might be the news you been waitin' for
so
He hands the letter to Laurie who comes over eagerly, takes it and studies the wrapper before opening it
Real good o' you to ride all the way over, Charlie
Might at least say your thank you's, Laurie
Declare
No need to
But Laurie has no interest in anything but the letter which she is reading skimmingly
Well
(expectantly) Yah
Laurie
Don't keep a body just standin'
Laurie looks up then
(impatiently) was just readin' to see if
Anyway, it's  letter
(agreeably) 'Course it is
Now let's all get comfortable an' set so's we can listen while Laurie reads her letter
(turning as if to go) Maybe 'd better be goin'
You stay, Charlie
After all, Charlie brought the letter, Laurie
He got a right to listen too
Mrs
Jorgensen has been pulling and pushing chairs around and now they all take places
Jorgensen automatically reaches for his glasses on the mantel and puts them on -- even though he isn't going to read the letter
Laurie has been sneaking looks at some of the other pages
(surrendering) Oh, all right
Well
Martin says
From the beginning
'Dear Miss Laury'
He spells it with a  instead of an
Wouldn't you think he'd know
Who cares what he spells it
Read the letter
Dear Miss Laury
take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Comanches the late Mister Futterman told us about
She breaks off, looks up -- puzzled
The late Mister Futterman
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly
Wonder what happened to the poor man
Go on, Laurie
(resuming the letter) We cut north through Indian territory and
(her voice fades) : -     - () leading their pack animals
Martin's voice picks up the narration
' Soon we was meeting up with Kiowas an' Wichitas an' even some Comanches camped by one of the agencies
: -    -    - () The camp is on the outskirts of a trading post
Indians watch unsmilingly from tepees, or in little clusters afoot; a few mounted braves ride on parallel courses as Ethan and Martin ride through camp toward the post
' But none of them was Nawyecky's nor claimed to know a war chief named Scar
He's the one the late Mister Futterman said had Debbie
: '   -
() - This trading post is in marked contrast to Futterman's -- being well-stocked, clean and presided over by  , a resolute, clean-looking man of middle years
Ethan and Martin -- in winter garb -- are being shown a variety of trade goods, including a shoebox full of ornate ribbon rosettes, such as are awarded animals at stock fairs
Appleby is solemnly affirming the trade value of these, as well as sleeve garters, etc
' At one o' the agencies we outfitted with all kind an' manner of trade goods
figgerin' that'd make it easier for us to come an' go
You'd laugh if  told you what was our biggest seller
: -
- - Ethan is ceremoniously pinning something on the stern-faced buck
It is one of the rosettes seen in the shoebox
to an extreme  of the rosette
On it, in gold letters, is: -   - As the Indian proudly steps back, we see beyond him a half dozen other braves -- all rosetted
Ethan looks them over complacently while Martin -- to hide the smile that threatens to split his face -- bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs
: -   - reading the letter
She is at the bottom of a page
'There is one other thing  got to tell you before you hear it from Ethan
How  got myself a wife'
She stops and stares
She looks at them - dazed
(delightedly) He did
(smacking his knee -- very happy indeed) Good
young man should get married early in life
Right, mama
Mrs
Jorgensen, full of sympathy for Laurie, just glares at her husband
Every young man should at least once
Go on, Laurie
Read
(haltingly) little Comanche squaw -
And with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the fire
(aghast) Laurie
Jorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace to recover the letter
He fetches it out, beating the sparks out
The letter is basically undamaged
(sternly) Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie Mama maybe you better read it
(to Charlie, proudly) My wife was a school teacher, Charlie She reads good
Laurie snatches the letter back
'll read it
Charlie crosses the room, picks up a guitar
(smugly) So he married a Comanche squaw
Haw haw haw
Laurie glares at him
He begins chording the guitar
: -
-   "" - - "" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter- faced and wide-eyed
Over her arm is a very handsome blanket
She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a Comanche -- her father
Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- a few yards of bright calico, a couple of   rosettes and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket
Look glances shyly at her father
He shakes his head negatively
Look is disappointed
The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods
Martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high-crowned beaver hat
The Indian grunts his approval and puts it on
Look looks relieved
Martin reaches for the blanket
Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait
Then she runs back through the other Comanches now crowding forward
-   -   - who rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin's horse
(quietly) Let's go
think  stumbled onto somethin'
(eagerly) Scar
The name registers with some of the nearer braves
There is a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile
(angrily) When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut
Come on
Let's get out of here
But  just bought a good blanket
(curtly) Forget it
Martin mounts and the two ride out
The Comanches stare after them suspiciously, resentfully
-   -    - - They are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can assume) is the Comanche camp
What  heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago
(excitedly) Think it might be
He breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind her and her blanket over the saddle
She closes the gap between them
What's she followin' for
Look smiles shyly at Martin
Look,  changed my mind
You can keep your blanket
He gestures for her to go back
Go on back
She stares and then dutifully wheels her horse
Martin and Ethan face front again
Look wheels her horse again and is right with them
Martin stops - exasperated
Look
you don't understand
(he waves her away) don't want it
Look just sits
(explosively) don't understand, ya chunkhead
You didn't buy any blanket
Ya bought her
(aghast) What
You got yourself a wife, sonny
(a wail) Oh no
Tell her she's got to go back
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women
No sir
Come on, Mrs
Pauley
Look smiles and sets her horse in motion as Ethan moves ahead
Martin's face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up
He is mouthing the words -- Mrs
Pauley
And Ethan suddenly breaks into song; to the tune of "Skip To My Lou:" (singing) got another gal purtier'n you got another gal purtier'n you got another gal purtier'n you
Skip to my Lou, my darlin'
: -   -   -  - Ethan is wrapped in his blanket roll, head propped by an elbow, grinning sardonically as he watches a strange ritual in the camp
The score is softly reprising "Skip to my Lou
" -   -   - Look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm, her head shyly downcast, not far from where Martin (back to her) is spreading his own bed roll
He sits on it then and begins pulling off his boots
He is very conscious of Ethan's watchful scrutiny
Finally he is ready
He lies back on his blanket
At once Look is at his side to spread her own blanket
Martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free and wraps it protectively around him
She stares at him, puzzled
Water
(in Comanche) Pah
She nods her understanding, hurries off to fetch a canteen
Martin glares at Ethan
That's the way to train 'em
Looks like Mrs
Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife
Cut it out, will ya
Look returns with the canteen, hands it to Martin and kneels beside him
He looks at her sympathetically
Look
wish  could explain to you
And now Look speaks for the first time
She indicates herself
Look
Now she jabbers in Comanche and, at the appropriate time, will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying
Nay tzare 'sala-ta-komal-ta-name
unt kang-yah Look
(which means) (My father calls me Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky
but you call me 'Look')
Martin looks blank, but Ethan chuckles
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky
but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya
(blankly) Look
She nods and smiles and quickly settles alongside him and spreads her blanket over them both
Martin recoils, plants his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling
Ethan busts a gut laughing
Martin jumps to his feet, angrily
(hotly) don't think it's so funny
If you want to do some good, whyn't you ask her where Scar is
Ethan stares at the girl
Her face is suddenly impassive as she looks from Martin to the ground
(grimly) She heard ya-all right
An' she knows
He gets to his feet and he crosses to stand before her
So does Martin
Unt osupanet cah-nay Scar
(meaning) (You know where Scar is
) She stares sullenly, not answering
You ask her
Look
(she faces him) Scar
(sign talk) Do you know where he went
And if he has a girl with him
a white girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo
She stands
She indicates Martin
She indicates herself
Mah nee-koo-ur
(meaning) (Your woman
) (shaking head) No
not my wife
My
(to Ethan) How do you say sister
(in Comanche) Nami
She looks gravely from Ethan to Martin
Then, with impassive face, she bends swiftly, picks up her blanket and walks away from them to choose her own sleeping place
The two men don't know what to make of it
: -   -   -    - It is the same scene the following morning
The men are standing above where Look had bedded for the night, looking at the ground
Clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely drawn arrow
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain
not if she took off where the arrow points
Think she means for us to follow
How should  know
She's  wife
He walks toward their horses, starts to saddle up
Martin follows
think maybe we oughta
(hiding a grin) Yeah,  kinda figgered you'd say that
Bein' a new husband and all
And Ethan starts singing "Skip to My Lou" half under his breath
Martin gives him a sour side-glance and continues saddling
: -    -   - Mrs
Jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table where Laurie is reading against the fading light of day
Jorgensen's pipe has gone out and he lights it
Maybe she left other signs for us to follow but we'll never know -- 'cause it snowed all day and all the next week
We were heading north, through the buffalo country when something happened that  ain't got straight in my own mind yet
(her voice fades) 137- -    -   ( ) The two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled grove
Martin's voice resumes the narration
' Ethan's always been throwing it up to me that 'm a quarter-breed never figgered it made much difference
137- -    -  (
) ' But this day we came on a small herd
We needed some meat so we circled 'round
137- -   (
) ' and came up on 'em afoot
They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close
137- -    -  (
) The two men walk from behind
Ethan aims, fires and brings down a bull
' Ethan got a nice one on his first shot, but then he began killing one after another -- cows as well as bulls -- fast as he could fire and load
It was just a slaughter
no sense to it
137- (
) Shots cracking out -- the terrified bawling of the bulls -- the beginning of the stampede
137- -    () Martin strides across to where Ethan is firing
Ethan, quit it
(firing again) Nine
(another shot) Ten
What's the sense in it
Ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin by surprise and fells him
(in a fury) Hunger
-- Empty bellies
That's the sense in it, you Cherokee
He swings up his gun and fires again -- and again
as Martin stares at him from the ground
137- -   -   (
) Fear-maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing the deadly marksman
Rifle shots keep cracking out
137- -      () The thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers his rifle
Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan as though at a madman
Ethan turns and looks at him
Least,  won't feed any Comanches this winter
Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too
Ain't that too bad
If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, 'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours
He whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead buffalo o
s
Martin looks after him with troubled expression
Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind
Ethan turns
Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle
Listen
Hear it
There
Ain't that a bugle
and firing
Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots, from long miles off
(grimly) Just hope we ain't too late
And the two break and run for their horses
: -   -     - ' (as narrator) It was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high- tailin' it back to the agency with their prisoners -- squaws mostly -- by the time Ethan and me reached the camp
-   - Horses and riders plunge downslope through breast-high snow
' It was the Nawyecky Comanches all right -- the ones we'd been looking for all this time
-   -    - as they ride in, passing dead horses, a few bodies of men
' Trouble of it was that the soldiers had hit when most of the fightin' men was away -- huntin' maybe
So most of the dead was old men and women an' kids
And it was in one of the tepees Ethan found her -- the little squaw who wanted me to call her Look
Ethan has dismounted in front of one of the tepees, heads inside
-   - as Ethan enters
body -- Look's -- is sprawled on the ground
He crosses, turns her over
Martin enters behind him
Well, you're a widower now
(angrily) What'd the soldiers have to kill her for
He sees something clutched in her hand
He stoops quickly
Ethan
Ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses
Martin shows him what Look had been clutching -- Debbie's rag doll
Look
It's hers, Debbie's
Ethan snatches it, stares at it
Then he turns and runs from the tepee
Martin stares at Look's body, then covers it with a robe
' So we knew Debbie had been in the village
What Look was doing there -- whether she'd come to warn them, or maybe to find Debbie for me
there's no way of knowing
He turns and then slowly heads out
- Ethan stands there, his expression bleak, looking at the scene
Martin joins him
We gotta catch up with them yellow legs
Maybe they got her with them
Ethan isn't thinking of that at all
(harshly) And maybe they got Scar
They start away -- fast
: -   -     - long line stretching across the landscape -- women falling and being prodded along by their captors
From behind ride Ethan and Martin and move to intercept the column
-   - as Ethan and Martin come closer and look at the shawled prisoners stumbling along
-   -    - as a young  spurs out of the column and rides toward them
(inquiringly) Yes
We're looking for a girl -- a white girl
She'd be about thirteen now
We got two around that age
(eagerly) Where
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency
Fall in behind the column
(protestingly) But couldn't you
Sorry
(shouting it) Keep the column moving
Close ranks there
The officer spurs out to rejoin the column
Martin looks at Ethan, his face alive with hope
But Ethan is just looking stonily along the line of passing prisoners
: -   - The column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency ( )
We see the dead and wounded on travois; the agency Indians watching stoically; the prisoners -- some of them -- being herded into a chapel
-   - The office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters
The  is being interviewed by two Eastern newspaper At a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending out a report of the victory
pot-bellied stove supplies heat and the General is warming his hands at it, intermittently
An adjutant is rather wearily filling out a long official form
The General, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well-known glory hunter of the Indian wars
He wears a colonel's straps, but insists upon his brevet rank
And it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one
with all the advantage of terrain
Four to one
What did you do, general
Ethan and Martin enter, stand in the doorway
(impressively) Sir -- we charged
Gentlemen -- and  hope you will quote me -- cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp
(blurting it) Cheyenne
What Cheyenne
(turning and staring) beg your pardon
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche
Chief Scar's bunch
(fascinated) Scar
What a wonderful name
(to his aide) Are you getting this, Keefer
(to Ethan) How do you spell that word -- Nawyecka
Ethan ignores him, still facing the General
My name's Edwards
'm looking for my niece
she was in that camp when you attacked
(uncertain) Well
know there were some captives recovered
(bitterly) Four of 'em dead
so we were told
(uncomfortably) Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche
Keefer
Put this man under arrest
That'll be the day
(scornfully) 'As we developed the village'
Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are
You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws
Keefer coughs
Shall  show him the captives, sir
Just get him out of here
Yes sir
(he crosses to Ethan) This way
-
-    - The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into the room -- then stops in manifest shock
Martin is at his heels, eager and expectant
Beyond them stands Keefer, grave and compassionate
There is a keening sound in the room -- almost an animal sound
-   - It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without backs
Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar
Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- at least two being the bodies of children
Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian robes
Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be no more than in her mid-thirties
She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed golden hair, torn garments
It is she who has been making the keening sound, the animal moans
Now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape
Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door
One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair
The afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair
Debbie
He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room
Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to side like a trapped animal
Ethan follows Martin into the room, Keefer behind him
Martin comes to a stop, realizing the woman is afraid of him
The two sleeping girls stir, but do not turn
Don't be scared, ma'am
The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at them with frightened eyes
Just don't pay any attention to her
Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired girl
He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder
(softly) Debbie
At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, like a claw, drawn back to rake his face
She is unmistakably a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face
Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate
Pabo-taibo
(White man
) The other girl has risen almost in the same instant -- but more out of fear
She is younger, but painted like the other
She moves to stand behind the savage one
(slowly) No
She's not
ain't sure
Where's that doll
Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind
He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl
She looks at it
and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it
The other girl laughs
Martin turns away and he's sick
Was your niece about their age
Not far from it
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it
(grimly) They're not white any more -- they're Comanche
Let's see the bodies
Martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow
don't need you
Ethan and Keefer move away
As they do, the madwoman -- eyes fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up behind him
Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never see the dead
During this: (the dispassionate pro) 'd like you to see them all
It might help us identify them
Shot in the head -- flash-burn range
The boy got his skull cracked
Here's the girl
Martin stiffens, waiting
No
Martin relaxes
and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands
She cradles it and she croons
Martin reaches to take it away
But she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby
He can't take it
Ethan returns
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar
And where we begin to look, don't know
There's one thing
We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp
cheap stuff
trade goods
Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican
Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border
What do they call themselves
Comancheros
That's the breed
Course it might take time
Time's running out
But 'm obliged to you
They leave
: -   -   - Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it by the lamp on the table
Jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe
Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking a note or chord
Mrs
Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron
so we're setting out for New Mexico Territory in the morning
am sorry  won't be back for Christmas again this year
She swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading
(quick sympathy) And you knittin' that muffler
(impatiently) What's the difference
Well,  just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let get some good of it
She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys Laurie
Laurie resumes her letter reading: (peering closely) There's a word crossed out
It looks like ' wish' or ' will'
(she gives up) Anyway
' set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same
remain, respectfully
(forlornly) yours truly, Martin Paulie
' That's all there is
Not a cross on it
Laurie just looks at it
Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick in his back
He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel
They never find that girl
(half to herself) Yours truly
(hotly) And he even has to write his full name
Martin Pauley
not even just Martie
(she stands) don't care if he never comes back
She heads for the front door
(rising -- saying it without conviction) Now, Laurie
Charlie hits the guitar a little stronger
Mrs
Jorgensen looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work
Charlie, you'll stay for supper
Now  won't take no for an answer
Thought of saying 'no' never crossed my mind, Miz Jorgensen
No place 'd rather be than right here, right now
Mrs
Jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties
Laurie has opened the door and is staring out wistfully
and Charlie begins playing and singing a verse from "Skip to My Lou
" (singing) One old boot and a button shoe One old boot and a button shoe
-   -     - The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico
It is hot country
-    -    - Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry
Gone are the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days
They do not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic, hard look about them both
The music theme segues into something livelier and Mexican as we - : -   -    - It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the street
Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without a saddle -- only a blanket pad
There is something familiar about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in
-   - The two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes
Ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside
Martin pauses beside Ethan
Recognize it
Martin shakes his head
They start toward the cantina
There couldn't be two like that in all the world
-   - as Ethan and Martin enter
It is a dirt-floored room with a small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls
pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, slapping the dominoes down hard
, back to the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping a drink
Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic- looking man in modified charro costume
Watching the domino game is , lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper cigarette; she is barefoot
Behind the bar is the proprietor, dozing on his stool
Ethan takes a step into the room
(loudly) The proprietor awakens
The domino game is suspended in mid- play
Estrella turns
and from beside Emilio, previously obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the head of old Mose
Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers
Ay-eh
He is on his feet and advancing to meet them
As he recognizes them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that won't come out
He grabs and shakes Ethan's arm, then Martin's
Leggo my arm
You look mangier 'n ever
Ain't been too good
No sir, not too good
Gettin' old, Ethan
You were born old
(all smiles - as they head for the bar) Bienvenidos, senores
Pulque
tequila
mescal
huiskey
Tequila
Lo mismo
(beaming) ' par' el Viejo -- el vino del pais
tequila tambien
Martin puts his back to the bar, leans elbows on it and looks around
158A - She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the musicians to play
She rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move
Emilio is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored amusement
158B - Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself -- leaving Martin's glass empty
been helpin' ye, Ethan
been lookin' all the time
Martin turns back to the bar to take his glass
He finds it empty
(to Ethan's back) Thanks for nothin'
He angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to Estrella
Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going
Well, the reward still stands
Don't want no money, Ethan
jus' a place -- a roof over m' head
a little grub
a bunk to sleep in
an' a rockin' chair by the fire
my own rockin' chair by a fire
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair
Swear it, Ethan
Given word
(impatiently) Told ya, didn't
(impressively) Ethan
found a man's seen her
knows where little Debbie is
Ethan stares at him
Mose nods his reaffirmation of it
Then Ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder
Who
Where is he
this man
Mose winces under the grip
He can't speak, but he looks past Ethan and he points
Ethan turns
Emilio swings his boots off the table and slowly crosses to them
He lets cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth
Then he smiles
am this man, senor
Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y Figueroa
at your service
(afterthought) for a price
(he smiles) Always for a price
As the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance -- and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a metronome
Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to bring something better
Un otra
- He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl hungrily
She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him and with unmistakable effect
He sloshes another drink into his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it
-   -   - Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar -- gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation
Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand
Meanwhile, dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin
And the tequila is working
He gets to his feet, a little groggily
Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes
Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, and he sees what is going on
He starts for Martin's table just as Martin moves out to take the girl
(tolerantly) Come on, Don Juan
We're on our way
Martin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl
(thickly) Lemme alone
(taking his arm) You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'
Martin breaks free and squares off
Take yer hands off'n me
This lady an' me got some things to talk over
Estrella ranges herself alongside of Martin and slips an arm possessively through his
(a shrug) Suit yourself
While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, 'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here
The Comanch' medicine country ain't far
there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz
Never heard of him
Cicatriz is Mex for Scar
an' he has a white girl in his tepee
Be seein' you
He turns and heads out
Emilio, who has come up behind him, gives Estrella a slight smile and bow
Buena suerte, Estrella
Hasta la vista
He follows Ethan
Estrella swings her body close to Martin and lets her arms slide around his neck
(softly) Tu quieres
Martin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire
(a bitter laugh) Sure
sure
Only not this year
He pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others
Mose catches his arm
'Mind Ethan 'bout my rockin' chair
Martin continues out and Mose stands there -- his head rockin' as though he already were in his chair
: (    ) -    - - small pack train (nine or ten horses, six or seven men) winds through a canyon behind which we can see huge needles of rock: majestic, savage country
At the head of the column ride Ethan, Emilio, and Martin
Behind them come Emilio's cargadores -- lean, hard-bitten wiry little Mexicans
One leads a handsome palomino
The  of the in the musical theme
-
-    -  - Ethan is looking around with grim interest
Medicine country, huh
(slight smile) Medicine so strong they believe the feather of an eagle found here can guard a man against bullets
(looking ahead) If you got one handy, now's the time
Ethan and Emilio both look in the direction of his glance
-   -   -    - They are turning a bend and now, ahead, we see a cordon of Comanches -- all armed, all quiet, all very menacing as they watch the approaching column
Emilio calls a greeting in Comanche
It gets no answer
-   -    - The    the faces in turn, as from the white men's viewpoint, as they ride slowly by
-   - One tepee stands apart from the other's -- Scar's
Beyond it are other tepees, the gathering of braves and some squaws, the drying racks for meat, etc
Emilio leads the way toward the central tepee
They dismount nearby and Emilio inclines his head toward the one tepee
Ethan and Martin brace themselves and wait
The flap of the tepee is closed
(gruffly) What are we waiting for
Emilio cautions him with a hand gesture
-
- The flap is thrust aside and  steps out -- the same Comanche we had seen at the grave when Debbie was captured
He stands tall, arrogant, eyeing the white men with hard, implacable eyes
He has a robe gathered about him
Across his face is a scar
' Senores
This is Cicatriz
-   -    - The white men's eyes are as hard as the Comanche's: this is the man they have long sought, the killer, the raper
They cannot mask the hatred they feel
(slowly
at last) Scar
It's plain to see where you got your name
Scar's hand moves to the scar on his face, and a finger runs along it
Your name - Big Shoulders
His name - He Who Follows
You speak pretty good American for a Comanche
Someone teach you
It is a leading question and Scar knows it
He looks long at Ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips
But he makes no direct answer
He looks instead to Emilio
(in Comanche) Ah-we pabbo-tie-bo ee-kee-tay
(Why did you bring the gringos here
) (a shrug -- in Comanche) Pabbo-tie-bo kim te-moo-er
(The gringos want to trade
) That's right
We come to trade
Only not out here
(with sign language accompaniment) don't stand talkin' in the wind
Emilio quickly turns and calls to one of his men
Emilio is worried
(sharply) Miguel
caballo -- aca
One of the Mexicans comes on the trot, leading in the palomino
Emilio makes a gesture -- giving it to Scar
Co-bay tabitz-chat
(meaning) (Very fine horse
) Scar looks at it greedily, then nods
He'll accept it
He looks at Ethan
Again that faintly contemptuous smile
He signals them to enter his tepee
(to Martin) Stay out here
Not likely
He follows Ethan into the tepee
and a worried Emilio goes along
- small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak
Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grinding corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee
Two others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather work or stitching
Both are shawled
As Scar enters, he barks a word to the squaws near the fire
Pie-kay
(Clear out
) (then he turns to the white men) -
(Sit
) He sits on some robes, signs for them to sit opposite
Slowly they look around them
-   -     - They are sitting with heads averted, slightly profiled -- but clearly Indian women, broad-faced, dark of hair and skin
' His sons are dead
So his wives sit on the honor side of his lodge
- (glancing at them) Are those his wives too
One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it is another Indian face
The other does not turn
Scar leans in, blocking the view
Two sons -- killed by white men
For each son,  take many scalps
(in Comanche) Mayah-kay zee-eh
(Bring the lance
) The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't move
Scar glares
(louder) - -
The girl gets to her feet
Ethan and Martin watch as, still with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from the tepee wall
It has several scalps on it, including one with light red hair
Slowly she carries it back
Scar never takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring every moment of it
The girl extends the lance between them, so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists
Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole
Then slowly their eyes lift
and the and  : -    - As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white and very beautiful face
(  : The should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first clear view of , it ends dramatically
) Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard: (in Comanche) Pie-kay
(Go
) Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes back to her former place
-
- Scar is watching the white men like a hawk
Martin's eyes are wide and his breathing seems suspended
But Ethan is playing it like a poker player
(his voice controlled) 've seen scalps before
Scar's eyes are mocking
He lets his robe slip back from his shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan had given Debbie
It is suspended by a chain or rawhide string
Scar touches it
This before
Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker
He stands
and the others follow
Scar is puzzled
(to Emilio) came to trade, not to admire his collection
Tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick
Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow
Scar hasn't understood all of it
He scowls and looks at Emilio
(in Comanche) Ee-sap
Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap
(He lies
The gringo lies
) (placatingly) Tomorrow -- manana -- 'puetze
' Scar looks at Ethan and at Martin
He smiles slightly, and he nods his agreement
Puetze
Martin and Ethan turn to go
Only then does Debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away
Martin can't help but pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap
-
-  - They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not fast, not slow, and without a side glance
Scar emerges and looks after them -- glowering
few other Comanches begin to gather near his tepee
(urgently) Walk with dignity
(after a moment; lips hardly moving) If you gringo heretics have any prayers, say them
(transfigured) She's alive
Can you believe it, she's alive
alive
An' we found her
(fervently) Please
, too, am alive wish to stay that way
They reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train, surrounded by suspicious Comanches
(to his men) Vamanos
They mount and ride out
: () -   - Emilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and Martin
You understand, senores
It is not that  am cobarde
cowardly
Don't apologize
You did your job
Emilio nods and mounts
He knows you -- who you are -- and why you are here
This  did not understand
or  would not
even for gold, senores
have led you here
He fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan
Take it
do not want blood money
Vaya con Dios
He digs spurs and rides out
Ethan turns and looks soberly at Martin
We hear the rest of the riders moving away
Ethan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the creek where their horses are waiting
174- () -   -   - You figger Scar means to kill us
He's got to
All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him
Now we caught up
It's him or us
Why didn't he make his move back there
don't know
Somethin' tied his hands
maybe hospitality
He breaks and both wheel as sand slides from the top of the dunes
They look up
174- - Debbie is silhouetted atop the dune, looking down at them
(barely breathing the name) Debbie
She slides down the dune to stand across the creek from them
174- -   -   - Her hand cautions them to silence and against coming any closer
(in Comanche) Unnt-meah
(Go away
) Both men move closer
She takes a frightened step back, as if to run
Debbie
Don't you remember me
'm Martin
She hesitates
She looks long at him
(in Comanche) Unnt-meah
(softly) We ain't goin'
We ain't goin' without you, Debbie
Ethan, get the horses
'll try to keep her talkin'
(harshly) How
She's even forgot her own language
Debbie, you're comin' with us
Hear me
No
not now
not ever
These have been her first words in English
and they bring new hope to Martin
don't care what they've done to you
what happened
(angrily) They have done
nothing
They are my people
Your people
They murdered your family
(reverting to Comanche) Ee-sap
(furiously) White men killed them - to steal cows
was
little
ran away
They find me
take care of me
No Debbie
That ain't what happened
They been lyin' to you
You lie
All white men lie
and kill
Debbie, think back
'm Martin
remember
Remember how  used to let you ride my horse
Tell you stories
Don't you remember me, Debbie
remember
from always
At first prayed to you
come and get me
take me home
You didn't come
've come now
These are my people
(in Comanche) Unnt-meah
Go
Go
Please
(grimly) Stand aside, boy
Martin turns as Ethan slowly reaches for his gun
It takes Martin a moment to realize what he is about to do
Ethan --
He moves quickly then to put himself between Ethan and the girl and in that instant there is the crack of a rifle
Ethan is hit in the leg
It goes out from under him
Martin swings and his gun is out and firing
174- -   -    - mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them -- rifle raised
Martin's first shot brings him down the dune in a spectacular horse-and-man fall
Debbie goes running like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same instant we hear the angry yells of distant Comanches charging from the far left
Martin turns to see Debbie running away
Debbie
Ethan is on his feet now and limping frantically toward their horses
He shoves Martin ahead of him
(angrily) Never mind her
They mount and take off, just as the vanguard of the attacking Comanches swings around a point of rock and comes charging toward the creek
-   - as Ethan and Martin race their horses from the creek area and down a long incline, as -- from the heights above -- a dozen or more Comanches, led by Scar, come tearing after them
175- -
-  -  - Ethan is swaying in his saddle, just barely hanging on, as Martin races up behind him -- driving Ethan's horse along
They swing past a huge outcrop of rock and go tearing along a vaulting wall of stone
Their hoofbeats and those of the pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls, and bullets whine and ricochet
175- -    -    - They swing around giant boulders, up-ended like pancakes
Ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle, barely conscious
Martin spots the cave -- ahead -- and drives his mount and Ethan's toward it
175- () -   -   - Martin pulls his horse in and swings off just as Ethan slides from his saddle
He runs toward one of the huge boulders, crouches and starts firing
175- -      - The Comanches are spread out but coming on fast
One goes down under Martin's fire
another is hit in the arm
He pulls up and the other Comanches wheel away from the hidden marksman
175- -   - Martin runs back from his firing post toward where Ethan has fallen
(angrily) Go on
Get out of here while you can
(pointing to the cave) Over there
Ethan turns and sees what he means
He starts dragging himself to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their horses away
Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave
175- - Both men are crouching, rifles ready
In the distance we see their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches
Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave -- moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry
Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over their horses' necks and clear out of there
Ethan looks grimly at Martin
They'll be back
We won't be here
Come on
He gets an arm under Ethan and hauls him to his feet
: 175- -   - from the top of the rock chimney to where Martin is snaking his way through, carrying newly-filled water canteens
He stands there, listening and looking back the way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no pursuit, he continues away
-
-  - - Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with some boughs
He is half delirious
small fire is burning
Martin enters carrying the canteens
He looks unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, takes a knife and starts to sterilize it
Ethan gasps, mumbles and then a word comes clear
Martha
Martha
Martin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time, he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle
He shifts closer to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet
Ethan opens his eyes and looks at him
gotta open that leg and let the poison out
He poises the knife
Wait
He fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded piece of paper
Just in case
Read it
Martin sets the knife down, takes the paper, opens it and slowly reads: ', Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley
' (he stares, then) don't want your property
'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin
' Debbie's your blood kin
Not no more
(angrily) You can keep your will
(he thrusts it back into Ethan's shirt) ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself
What kind o' man are you, anyway
(sitting up -- eyes blazing) She's been with the bucks
She's nothin' now but a
Martin shoves him back onto the ground
(a shout) Shut your dirty mouth
He gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at Ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his eyes
Then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket
He picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man
(slowly) hope you die
And he kneels again to open the wound
: -   -    - Martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious figure of Ethan
-  -  - Eyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn -- he is an implacable figure as he drags the weary miles home
He hears a groan from Ethan o
s
He barely lets his eyes drift to the sound
He doesn't stop
-  -     - We see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles
The travois jolts over the ground
As he passes out of frame, the   on the marks of the travois poles scraping across the desert
-   - party is in progress
Fiddler and banjo-player are playing a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers -- ranchers, their wives and daughters
Laurie is not in evidence
At the far end of the room is a table with a punch bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about
Jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new arrivals
Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm
With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit and scrubbed until he looks raw
Behind them come three or four other competent-looking men -- Rangers all of them
(shouting) They're here, mama
Come in, come in
-   - Clayton waits for Charlie to come abreast, then hits him on the back and drives him inside
Here he is, Lars
Combed, curried 'n washed behind the ears
Mrs
Jorgensen hurries over, beaming, to admire Charlie
Why, Charlie, you look real handsome
(grinning) Yes'm
scarcely reck'nize myself
Where's Laurie
Mrs
Jorgensen smiles and playfully pushes him toward the guests
You'll see her soon enough
Clayton -- and the other Rangers -- have been hanging gunbelts on pegs along the wall
Now he shakes out his parcel -- disclosing a green-black frock coat
(nodding to the music) Say, that music sounds so good it must be sinful
Grab a partner, reverend
Well, now, a man of my age just can't haul off and dance in cold blood
but if there's any of that wild cherry brandy of yours, Lars
(suddenly sober) Nooo
(change of heart) Yah, by golly
One jug left get it
Mrs
Jorgensen glares as he heads out
Last winter that man swore up and down there wasn't a drop left -- and me with pneumoney
Reverend, you'd better start clergyin' again
-   - Horses, wagons fill the yard
We can hear the lively music of the square dance
As Jorgensen opens the door and sets out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and on it are Martin and Ethan
Jorgensen at first doesn't recognize them
(hailing them) Hi
You're late
hurry
And then he sees who they are, and his jaw drops
(staring) Ethan
Martie
No, don't get down
You can't come in
They stare at him
The Rangers are here
He says it as though that explains everything
What's that got to do with us
(eyeing the house) What's goin' on
(who's forgotten they wouldn't know) Why, my Laurie's getting married
Martin throws the reins aside and jumps out
Jorgensen grabs his arm
Wait
Don't you hear me
The Rangers
So what
You been posted for murder
both of you
That trader fella, the late Mister Futterman
Martin tries to break free
gotta see Laurie
(desperately) Go around the side
the grandmother's room
'll tell her
You better
He heads around the side
Ethan meanwhile has climbed stiffly down, slightly favoring his leg
Quick
hide in the barn, Ethan
Hide
Why would
He brushes past the little man and heads for the door
- as he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels
For a moment, as he stands there, the party breezes on
Then first one, then another sees him
They gape, and the music falters and stops
Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the room
Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes a very bad job of it
Look everybody
Look who's
He can't even finish it but stands there making flapping gestures
-   - -- others gaping
During the opening lines, Jorgensen will covertly back toward the door to the inner room -- Laurie's room
(to all) Evenin'
evenin' Reverend
or do call you 'Captain'
Came here for a wedding, Ethan
Until that's over,  reckon 'reverend' will do
(coming forward) And news of our little girl, Ethan
His face contorts and his smile is twisted
She's not a little girl any more
(eyes wide) You've seen her
She's alive
've seen her
and she's alive
Mrs
Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing
Ethan looks past her at Clayton
And the faces of both men are grim
: - The room is dark
Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning to the inside door
And then it opens and Laurie is inside, holding a lamp
She is in her bridal gown and very obviously trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under
(quietly) Hello, Martie
He just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote
He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn clothing
wrote you a letter
Reckon you didn't get it
(setting the lamp down) One letter in five years
read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out
It wasn't much of a letter
No, it wasn't
You mighta said you loved me
You mighta asked me to wait
At least that'd have been something
But  allus loved you
You know that, without my sayin' it couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait
the little  had
not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie
(breaking) It isn't fair
She sinks onto the bench
(sobbing) It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and you know it
She begins to cry, very softly
He is beside her and his arm goes around her shoulder comfortingly
Don't cry, Laurie
understand how it is
'll just go 'way
(spinning on him) You do and 'll die, Martie will
'll just die
And they are kissing through her tears when the outer door is flung open by Charlie MacCorry
They part as he glares
'll thank you to leave the room, Laurie
Martin stares at him, then at her
(incredulous) Charlie MacCorry
You weren't fixin' to marry
She sure is
An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it
As to that,  don't know, Charlie
We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman
(angrily) If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge
other things
Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took
bet she wasn't the first squaw you
Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter
He side- steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the wall
Laurie runs between them
Stop it
Both of you
won't have any fighting in this house
Martin gently brushes her aside
It's all right
Charlie, let's move outside
ain't wearing no gun
Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt
The men head outside as Laurie runs to get help
- Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside
Martin makes a wild run, swings
The blow is neatly guarded by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts Martin down
Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, not a white man
The men from the wedding party come out now at a run
(yelling) Sergeant MacCorry
Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though there were a knife in the hand
MacCorry stumbles back into Clayton's arms
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant
(regaining his balance) No sir
pleasure
In that case, give the boys room
Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his right and crosses his left
It is a hard blow but Martin recovers and waits
Charlie circles and starts to repeat
He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws Charlie over his head
What we are looking at, in effect, is a wrestler against a boxer
Fight fair, son
Use your fists
(drily) Comanches don't use their fists, reverend
Let 'em alone
Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now trying to imitate Martin's crouch
Suddenly Martin feints a right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the order of business
Charlie staggers and Martin follows up with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped
With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife
He looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd
Could scalp him
but 'll just count coup
With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off
He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet -- easing the tortured arms
Clayton goes to Charlie's side
Laurie moves to Martin's side
You all right, sergeant
Dunno
Seems so
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'
Charlie frowns and looks off at where Laurie and Martin are standing
Ain't goin' to be any weddin' -- not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here
He walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck assembly, murmurous with surprise
: - The last of the wedding guests is leaving: Ed Nesby carrying his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller children preceding him out the door
The Jorgensens stand by -- trying to put a good face on the wedding debacle
Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly, studying a spot on the floor
Ethan is at the mantel
Laurie is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding gown
Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip
Clayton, still in his clerical coat, is near the door
(a grin) Well
it was a nice weddin' party
considerin' no one got married
'Night
Good night, Ed
Mrs
Jorgensen puts her handkerchief to her eyes -- letting down now that the guests have gone
Jorgensen crosses to her, pats her sympathetically
Now, mamma
He leads her away
Clayton faces Ethan
got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend
Captain
Nope, wouldn't say that
Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman
Probably needed killin'
'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend
Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise
Ethan casually reaches into his pocket, takes out a gold coin and spins it
(casually) That so
Martin crosses to confront Clayton
ain't goin' to Austin, Reverend
Charlie gets to his feet and he has his gun in his hand
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'
Now, now
let's not grow disputatious
Fast hoofbeats sound o
s
-- signalling the approach of a four-man cavalry detail
(turning) What's that
More company
He and Jorgensen head for the door
Kinda late getting here, aren't they
voice hails from outside
' Hello there
Captain Clayton
-
-    - Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him, looking out
Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail, led by a young and very crisp
We may or may not see the sixth man, slouched over his horse
The Lieutenant swings off and crosses
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend
'm Clayton
The Lieutenant gapes at Clayton's ministerial coat
(doubtfully) You're Captain Clayton
Ethan chuckles, to Clayton's very obvious annoyance
(recovering, he salutes) Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir
The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and
Hold on, son
Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir
Commanding Officer, Fifth
Cavalry
'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir
Oh
Now what's this your pa wants to know
My pa wants to know
Colonel Greenhill wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches
action
Yes sir
We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar
What information
That maybe he's not far from here -- holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border
He raided north about a month ago
ran into more army than he bargained for
Now he's running for cover, for keeps this time
And what makes you think he's in this territory
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago
He talks crazy but  brought him along
Says he lives here
keeps mentioning a rocking chair
(half to himself) Mose
And then he is striding to the door, calling it: ' Ay-he
Ay-eh
And the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper -- hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious
Come f'r my rockin' chai'
ole Mose
(shouting it) Where's Scar, Mose
Ask him about Debbie
Is she all right, Mose
My rockin' chai'
(bustling over) Leave the poor man be
Can't you see he's out of his mind
She tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and grips the old man by his arms
Mose
try to remember
You were in Scar's camp
Ay-he
Made out  was crazy
(he giggles foolishly) Ate dirt
chewed grass
fooled 'em, Ethan
an'  got away
Scar
Where's he holed in
Seven Fingers
ay-he
Seven
He staggers and this time Mrs
Jorgensen won't be denied
Now that's enough
Here
by the fire
What you need's a good bowl of soup
She leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire
During this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose's answer
(blankly) Seven Fingers
That's what he told us
but there's no such place on the maps
Wait a minute
Isn't that the Caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the Malapai
(from his rocker) Caddo or Kiowa
ay-he
ay-eh
Sam Clayton wheels on the Lieutenant
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight
headin' for the south end of the Malapai
If he can catch up with us, well an' good
But
but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow
for your own protection
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive
You want to protect us, you just get out of our way
Now skedaddle
The lieutenant skedaddles
Sam whirls on Martin and Ethan
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay
Charlie, hightail it to headquarters an' spread the word
Yes sir
He leaves
Martin's hands go to his side -- recalling where he left his guns
My guns
He heads for the inner door to the grandmother room
- as Martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his gunbelt
Even before he reaches it, Laurie is in the room -- closing the door after her
Martie
don't go
Not this time
(staring) You crazy
It's too late
She's a woman grown now
got to fetch her home
Fetch what home
The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder
With savage brats of her own, most like
(shouting it) Laurie
Shut your mouth
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance
He'll put a bullet in her brain
And  tell you Martha would want him to
Only if 'm dead
He strides out past her
- as Martin re-enters
Ethan and Sam are waiting
Martin looks hard at Ethan
You ready
(eyes never leaving Ethan's face) 'm ready
As they stride out, : 204- -   -   - - as she stands at the window, in her bridal gown, and sadly watches Martin again going away
Softly the score reprises -- sadly now -- "Skip to My Lou
" : -   -   - file of eighteen men and horses -- Rangers -- is walking under the shoulder of a mesa, keeping well below the skyline
-     - They pass  one by one -- Sam Clayton in the lead, Martin behind him leading two horses, then the others -- grim- looking, capable men of varying ages; some with long drooping mustaches, some in need of shaves, some chawing tobacco
-  -      - He is lying prone, his hat off, squinting down into a long reach of desert canyon at the Comanche encampment -- with tepees set up, a thin wisp of smoke rising from a fire, the horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral of rawhide ropes
-    - The camp is sleeping
dog yaps shrilly
One of the tepee flaps opens and Scar steps out
He picks up a stone or a chunk of wood and throws it
The dog yelps and runs off
Scar's air is troubled, suspicious
He heads for the horse herd
The camp sleeps on
-  -      - His face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction
He looks back along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the Ranger company
Then he squirms back, retrieving his hat
-     - Sam, seeing Ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a signal for halt and waits
Ethan scrambles down the trail to join him
He takes the reins of his horse from Martin
We can get within 500 yards
there's a hogback to the south
How many, would you say
(drily) Enough to go around
'd say about a dozen apiece
Mount 'em up
He moves as though to mount, but Martin steps forward
Wait
We go chargin' in, they'll kill her
and you know it
(calmly) It's what 'm countin' on
Sam stares at him, but Martin isn't surprised
know you are
Only it ain't goin' to be that way
she's alive
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive
(same tone) She's alive
Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here
There sure is
'm going to tell you somethin'
wasn't going to speak of it
But 'll tell you now
Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance
( ) Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance
Long
wavy hair
saw it
And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's
You don't remember it, but  remember
That was your mother's scalp
Martin stares, quick disbelief in his eyes
But Ethan's eyes hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them
didn't want to tell you
but maybe it's your right to know
(quietly) Now mount up, son
Sam puts his hand on Martin's elbow -- as though to turn him to his duty
But Martin jerks the arm away
It don't change it
All 'm askin' is a chance to sneak in there
an' try to get her out before you come chargin' in
What if you're caught
It won't tell 'em anything, will it
Just a man alone
say
Go ahead, son
But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do
Ethan looks long and hard at Martin, then reaches into his shirt for the folded, dirty, dog-eared paper that was his will
Slowly he tears it into shreds
It's your funeral
Martin squats and starts pulling off his boots
He glances up as Charlie MacCorry comes over, an Indian blanket in his hands
He tosses it onto Martin's shoulder
Here
you fight like a Comanch
Maybe this'll help ya pass as one
Then he grins and extends his hand
Martin takes it -- and they shake as Charlie pulls him to his feet
Martin drops his hat, and then -- at a crouching run -- he heads for the distant Comanche camp
-     , as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward the unseen camp
Clayton waves an arm at his men and starts leading out -- in a somewhat different direction
-  , They are leading their horses down the slope, still under the lee of the butte, when two riders are seen approaching at a fast gallop -- Lt
Greenhill and his courier
(The latter is a bugler)
What in
(calling -- still distant) Captain Clayton
Captain
Sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to Greenhill to shut up
Greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides in
(exploding) Go on
Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it
(blankly) Sir
Never mind
Your pa know you're out here
Yes, sir
Troop's about ten miles back
The Colonel sent me looking for you
(dismissing him) Well you found me
Good work, son
Good work
He starts away
Greenhill follows
If there's anything  can do, sir
(under his breath) God forbid
No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at
and where he's at
But he knows , sir
Can't stay, sir
(reluctantly) All right
But keep your eye on me, boy
'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages
If you don't hear me first time  holler, you better read my mind
don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand
Yes, sir
He whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain Sam who quickly shifts out of the way
Watch that knife, boy
Then Sam continues away and the Rangers after him
-   - Martin runs from behind  and dodges behind a rock
The camp is still asleep, very quiet
Martin runs out from behind the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking
-
- He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines
In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, insistent
Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air suspiciously
The other Comanche laughs
Tahbo
( rabbit
) Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work
-   ' He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct decorations
The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for better air circulation
Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee
-   - The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their sidearms, tightening cinches, etc
Sam moves briskly along the line of men, then mounts his horse
The State of Texas is payin' you boys $12 a month
Here's your chance to earn it
Now  don't want any foolin' around after scalps
We ain't got the time
Yankee cavalry's on its way here to set those Comanches free
We gotta beat 'em to it -- our way
Now mount an' guide center on young Greenhill here
Son, you just follow me
And The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton
'  -
- Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around, then strides in
' as Martin enters
One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar has slept
Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two squaws
Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in robes
Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly and hold on: -
- She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair
Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, to awaken her
Her eyes open, then widen in fear
Martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth
Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away
(a hoarse whisper) Debbie
don't
And then her fingernails rake his hand
He winces and lets go
She screams and tries to leap up
He grabs her
The other squaws wake -- begin squawking
(grimly) 'm takin' you whether you want to or not
Debbie sees something beyond him
Her eyes widen
(a scream) -     , - He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her
He has a scalping knife in his hand
Scar whips his arm back
Behind him we see the other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd
- Martin spins and his gun is out
He fans the trigger hammer twice -- and both slugs hit Scar
As the other Comanche leaps in, Martin's gun speaks again
And then he is on his feet, catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling her after him through the camp
Shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp
-   - They are mounted and in line
The echo of a shot comes bouncing back
Clayton is facing the men
He solemnly doffs his hat and bows his head
For these Thy gifts which we are about to receive
(donning his hat, he turns to the bugler) Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us Go Amongst Them
-
And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge
The yell is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge as though he had a regiment at his back
Lt
Greenhill -- a West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre at the "charge
" - In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's saber ominously close to his back
The charge is sounding, the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their teeth, guns in their fists
-   - Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in
The bark of hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have never been up against such marksmen
One charging Ranger rides down a tepee
Another, with two guns drawn, scores a running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite sides of his fast-running horse
dodging Comanche screams as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him sprawling into the embers of the campfire
'  -   - He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche crouched near the tepee
The charge races past him
Ethan swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and glares
squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised, but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep
He turns and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes, seeing what he has been looking for: -   - '
Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, while she kicks and claws and tries to break free
(They are about thirty yards from the camp proper
) Riderless horses are milling, circling
s
we can hear the firing, the yells
'  - Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee
In the distance we see Martin and Debbie
The Rangers, regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the Comanche horse herd
-
- Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns, and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away
No, Ethan
He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse
-   - as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight the horse to a stop
Ethan swings on him -- once, twice -- and Martin is knocked sprawling
Ethan rides on, relentlessly
-   - She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman
Ethan has his gun drawn
She ducks to one side and the horse goes past
Both figures are almost obscured in the dust
Ethan spins his mount and charges after her
She runs and then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward her
- Ethan is at the left of  and slightly closer to the foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground and the dust swirling around her
Ethan draws and raises his gun
The hammer goes back
(quietly) 'm sorry, girl
Shut your eyes
The dust clears
The   slightly forward along the gun arm and  on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's
We  for a long moment and then the gun lowers
Ethan slowly holsters it and walks over to her
-   - He looks down at her
(softly) You sure favor your mother
-
- He extends his hand to her
She takes it and he helps her to her feet
And then she is against his chest and his arm goes protectingly about her
They are standing that way when Martin stumbles up -- and stares
: 233- -   - The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing in mid-ground
And then as the firing slackens, from afar we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop
: -   - It is perhaps half an hour later
Clayton is very grim of face and occasionally wincing
His trousers are down over his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled red underwear
Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump
Beyond them some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out
Sam looks up angrily as  , a guidon bearer, and bugler ride in
Greenhill is a choleric man
Clayton, if you were in my command 'd have you courtmartialed for this
(angrily, to MacCorry) Hurry it up
What's the matter, sir
You wounded
What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or an arrow
Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a meaningful glare on someone off
Greenhill looks that way
-   - He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace
It could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend
-   - Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding Debbie's hand
And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them
: -   -   - He is in a rocker on the porch
Suddenly he stares out and stops rocking
Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk
moment later Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing the distant horsemen
He is joined by Mrs
Jorgensen
And then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, then with dawning realization
Lars and Mrs
Jorgensen also begin to guess
to suspect
and then to know
And Laurie starts to run
- The   ahead of her as she runs blindly over the hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the still unseen but nearing horsemen
- Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm supporting her, and she is asleep
Martin is riding beside them
Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the girl
He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by
Laurie looks then at Martin
He doesn't know whether to smile or not; he just waits
And then she is beside him and she steps onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to take up the search
And still holding her beside him, he rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house
