-                                    1 disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and hats crosses a narrow street
Lights flare, hands are stamped, torsos are patted down
Money exchanges hands
We descend into a black, throbbing tunnel
Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers
Hips, legs feet dancing
-  struts and wiggles around a brass pole
Hoots and cheers
The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom
More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband
(
) Let's go
Where all my sexy Sagittarian ladies at
Arms go up
collection of whoops ripple the crowd
The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst
The   as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd
We realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling
(
) Oh my God
(pronounced --), 17, covers her mouth, laughing and wide-eyed
She tries to back away from the stage, but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills
Among them is , 18, worldly and smooth
Where your singles at
Where your singles at
Yeah, baby
Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancer's boot
Alike drops her beer in all the jostling
Goddamn  love my job
Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly waves Alike's wrist in the air
2
Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her
Stop
Chill
Whatchu' come here for
Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage
Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage
Alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend
Excuse me
Sorry
Excuse me
Oof, sorry ladies
Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone
(') Shit
She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer visible
Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd, she retreats for the bar
Let's go
2
-                                      2 Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar
Her gaze settles on a   a little ways down, staring out at the dance floor
Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl
Hi
The girl ignores her
Alike clears her throat and speaks a little too loudly
(') Umm
Hey
How are you
The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and down
What
3
Umm
sorry
was just sayin' Umm
hi
Oh
The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor
Oh
You wanna drink or something
Hey
Hey
Over here
Alike strains, snapping at the bartender swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand
The cute girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance floor
Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving
The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away
3
-                                   3 Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the cramped, 2 stall bathroom
in front of her makes out vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away
buff 30-  with locs smiles and winks at Alike
Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks away
The line inches forward
Alike glances around searching for the woman
The 30-something has already lost interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more strutting out of the restroom
Embarrassed, Alike faces front again
Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer
Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance
One of the 's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the line inches forward again
Alike pretends not to notice and slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch along the wall
4
-                                      4 Alike dozes on the couch
Give it up for Sin--Min ladies
Alike wakes with a start
She checks the time on her cell phone
Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch

5
-                                   5 Laura dances with a cute
Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction
'mon, we're late
Huh
gotta go
Hold on a minute
'mon, why you trippin'
What
Why are you trippin', you know gotta go
What
You know  gotta go
'ma get in trouble
Lemme dance with shortie first, then 'll be ready
What
Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair continue their wobbling, uneven groove
Alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine" and "butch" push past her without a second glance
Alike tugs at Laura's jersey
Laura, happily tangled in her dance partner's embrace rolls her eyes
Stop pulling on my clothes

-                                              6 Laura sulks, frowning out at the night
Alike extends the olive branch
How many numbers you get
One
could've gotten more, but your moms was holding me up
Oooh
That's jacked up
How many you get
Tonya, Denise, Shelley
No wait that's old,  can delete that one
Tonya
Laura snatches the phone from Alike
Alike swipes at it but misses
Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through the numbers with the other
Ain't Shelley that chick from your math class
Denise
What
These are your damn study group numbers
Why you frontin'
Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her sleeve
don't see you with no list of numbers
'm not the one looking for a girlfriend, man
You the one still a virgin
Shut up
Trying to help your ass
'm sayin', whatchu waitin' for
Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little
Laura elbows her and sneers
6
Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit since 6th grade
don't need to press,  gets plenty
Shit
Wah-wah
get more pussy than your daddy, nigga, what
Oh shit
Yeah, you got me with that one
7
-                                               7 Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on
middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window
Alike reaches over and presses the tape
Laura elbows Alike
Quit playing
Your stop
Huh
Your stop-- you're getting off here, right
Nah, 'll roll with you a few more stops
Why you gon' walk all the way back down for
That's stupid
Make sure you get home okay
The bus pulls to the curb
The light flicks on over the back door
7
You ain't big, nigga
Trying to protect somebody
Hurry up, man, get off
(to bus driver) That's alright man--next stop
Next stop
Alike elbows Laura sharply
The bus driver frowns in the rear view
You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'
'm not beastin'
Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door
You got a problem
Call me
'ma call you
Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away
Laura drums a little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off
Alike waves and faces forward again
An   sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look
Alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away
8
-                                          8 Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a breath
She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess
" She stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears
She slumps back against the seat and stares into the night
The bus stops at a lonely island of curb
Alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night
9
'  -                                 9 Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through
The house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock
8
Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway
Her younger sister, 's door cracks open as she passes
You late
(whispering) Be quiet
Where you been this late
(whispering) Movies
Movie ended at midnight
(whispering) Shhh
Shut up
Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door
Sharonda yanks the door open wider
(whispering) Don't push me
(whispering) Go to bed
know what stays open past midnight
Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance
Shut up
Alike eases Sharonda's door shut
Sharonda swings the door open wide
Good night Lee
Sharonda slams her door
The light clicks on underneath Alike's parent's door
9
(
) Lee
Lee
Alike rolls her eyes at her sister's closed door and shrugs into her room
10
'  -                                      10 Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed
She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, appears in the doorway
Nice to know you still live here
Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed
(') What're you doing home so late, anyway
Lost track of time
You know what time your curfew is
Where were you
Movies
The show ended at midnight
And your curfew is twelve thirty
lost track of time
Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb
Alike turns her back on her and slumps into pajamas
At least you were cute
Where'd you get that shirt
`Princess'
like that
Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches to the top of the closet
It's old
10
Compliments your figure
saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping-- Goodnight
Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter
Vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice
really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway
Yeah, okay
And tie your head up
Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps it around her head
(') It's your head
And you really should wash your face, too
don't have on make-up
Wash your face anyway
Mom
'm seventeen years old, please don't talk to me like-- Watch your tone
(Beat) Well, it's your skin
Audrey leaves
Alike is still
She listens for the door to her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and storming to the bathroom
11
-                                      11 Alike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack
She plops down on the toilet and looks up
crucifix frowns down at her from the wall
11
She averts her eyes and stands to leave
(
) Did you brush your teeth
Alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder
(
) Lee
Alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little around the sink
She stares at her reflection
(
) Lee
Alike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure
Yes, mom
12
-                                      12 Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes
The school bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building
Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last finally trickle in
She yanks her hoodie tighter and launches across the lawn and into the building
13
-                              13 second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into classrooms
Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the bathroom
One last straggler , a 17 year-old girl with mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike
The two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss each other as they hurry in opposite directions
14
-                             14 Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut behind her
She rips off her hoodie and the "girly" shirt beneath and flings them to the floor
She pulls out a pair of wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head
She unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head
12
She stares at her reflection in the window and tries unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt
Her eyes scour her reflection again and again for any imperfections
She spots the earrings and yanks them out of her ears
The late bell beckons and Alike stuffs her "feminine" clothes into her backpack and bolts
15
-                                     15 The   glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests
chorus of groans follows in her wake
As promised,  will be grading these on a curve
Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom
The desks in front her and beside her are empty
She is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes
(') But the highest grade on the test was a 98
The math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her a little smile
Alike doesn't smile back
The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks
Alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door
16
-                                   16 The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying
Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the walls
Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd and shrugs through the cafeteria line
17
-                                     17 Alike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of dubious nutritional value
She raps on the door of a classroom and slips in
(
) Hey there
13
18
-                              18 Hey
, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste
Her small desk radio plays alternative rock
Sun beams into the empty classroom and Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk
Whaddja bring me
Nothin' you can eat
You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, either
(over a mouthful of pizza) know
Sooo, where's the new stuff
Alike hands over her purple and white composition book
Mrs
Alvarado thumbs the pages, reading silently
Hmmm
Did you see the one in the back
Mrs
Alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth moves silently as she reads
(') 'll probably do it in class
Mrs
Alvarado hands the book back to Alike and digs in to another celery stick
So
So what
14
What do you think
They're okay
Okay
They're lovely
Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that
But
don't know
Is it your best
No
Alike frowns through the pages of the composition book
thought it was good
It's good
Not great
Alike slumps back into her seat and considers the book's cover
believe you can go deeper
19
-                            19 Audrey is a heat-seeking missile, whipping through the sparse hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in constant motion
and  scatter in her wake, suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to avoid her caustic gaze
She barks at a cluster of  chit- chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to escape
Audrey drills her
Oh, so your log is all up to date
No -- And you've checked the round for any calls
Well  -- 15
Do you even know which doctors are on the floor
No ma'am -- Then  suggest you get busy
The clerk skitters off red-faced, and Audrey looks daggers into her back before storming the break room
20
-                         20 Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads toward a table
few lounging  wad up their garbage and flee the break room
Audrey settles down at the table and pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not to be hurt
She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins reading
big red department store bag sits next to her work tote
The television suspended over the table mumbles corporate healthcare infomercials
, one of Audrey's co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag on the table across from her
Hey girl
Mind if  sit here
No, not at all
Help yourself
Whatchu got there
You been shopping
Oh, no
Just some yogurt
Some vanilla yogurt
No  meant in the bag
What do you have in the shopping bag--the big red thing
Oh 'm
don't know where my mind is
Yeah, this is just uh--well let me get your opinion
Audrey's steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all butterflies and giggles
She rifles through the bag and hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater
16
Oh that's nice
Yeah see isn't this cute
Umm-hmm
That's for your daughter
Yeah, this is for Alike
The youngest one
No she's the oldest one
Oh, the other one
Okay
What, you think it's too young
No, no
For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first
But  think it should be fine
It's really cute
Thank you
It'll compliment her figure
Now see that's what  thought
But Lee doesn't like anything pick out for her anymore
Mrs
Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the sweater from Audrey
Girl, please
My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes
We have two completely different tastes
just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it
Is it her birthday
17
Mrs
Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths it carefully back into the tissue paper
No, no
just wanted to get her something nice
You know
Three  - burst into the room chattering and finger popping
- #1 Hey, Brenda
- #2               - #3 Oooooh Audrey, you got me a     What'chall in here talking present
about
Well, no we-- None of yo' damn business
The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various parts of the breakroom
Audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet
Somebody cranks on a small radio and a frisky & beat invades the air
Mrs
Singletary pats Audrey on the arm
Let me know how it goes
Oh  will
'll call you when-- - #3 Hey Bren' this is what  was telling you about
Co-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs
Singletary's face, tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page
Is that her
- #3               - #2 Told you
Look how big she done got
The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone at the fringes
She collects her shopping bag and looks around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave
18
21
'  -                             21 Audrey, Sharonda, Alike, and their father, , 40- something with a used-to-be athletic build, are all gathered around the dinner table for a rare family dinner
Everyone takes half-hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact with each other
Sharonda picks at her food
don't see why we can't just watch like usual
Alike elbows Sharonda
Quit it
Shut up
You don't tell me what to do
Girls
The phone rings and Arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it
Audrey wilts
'm expecting a call
Audrey stares after him then glares back at Alike and Sharonda
This is your father's night off
Alike casts a glance in the direction of the bedroom, where Arthur can be heard talking in hushed tones
She rolls her eyes and slinks down into her seat
(') So straighten up
Arthur settles back into his chair, his mood a little brighter
Seeing an opportunity for brownie points, Sharonda pitches in
Homecoming got moved this year
It's gonna be in September instead of October
19
Oh really
Yeah
Which means 'll be able to go to Autumn Ball and the Homecoming Dance
Who are you going with
don't know
Maybe Derek
If he asks me
Maybe Parrish
haven't decided yet
But for homecoming, definitely want to go with Craig
Oooh,  see
Lee, who are you going with
Umm
'm not going
Arthur gives Alike an approving Daddy's girl wink
Alike beams back
Not going
This is your junior year
How can you not go
Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go
But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories
don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway
Nobody buzzes around Alike
That's right and it better stay that way
Matter of fact,  don't know if 'ma let you go
Daaa-aad
20
Alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink
Arthur jabs her on the arm as she walks by
Audrey tears into a dinner roll shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact
22
'  -                                  22 Laura brings a steaming cup of Ramen noodles to a worn kitchen table splayed with bills
Her older sister , a stout 30 something with pleasant but hard-working looks scribbles notes on the back of an envelope while soaking her feet
Laura takes a sip of her soup and starts sifting through a pile of envelopes
How much we paid him last time
Six twenty-five
So that makes--we owe another two seventy-five for the rest of the month
Candace pecks on a calculator and scribbles on the envelope
Laura flips through more bills
(') Electric
Half
Phone
Let it ride
Gas
How much
Eighty-five
Half
No let it ride
Laura locks her hands on top of her head and leans back in her chair, surveying the financial carnage
21
Candace reaches inside a   on the table and pulls out a wad of money
She counts out several hundred dollars into an envelope
can get some more hours-- No
You know what you need to do
Nah Candy,  can't just dip out on you like that-- was doing just fine before you moved in, remember
can handle it
Laura sucks her teeth
(') You working was only supposed to be temporary
Mom would've wanted-- Who
Man, don't even-- She would've-- Stop
Laura pushes up from the table and glares at Candace, a showdown
Candace stares back, unfazed
Laura caves first
(') 'll get the money orders in the morning
Laura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right away
(') 'll look into it alright
Candace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down the hallway to her room
The next test is coming up soon
22
(
) said 'll look into it
Candace smiles wanly and sips her soup
She takes a foot out of the water and kneads it
23
-                             23 Alike slams into her usual stall and launches into her `Superman' changing routine
She unrolls pulls a jersey from her backpack and yanks it over her head
24
-                               24 Alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into oblivion and scribbling into her composition book
group of strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling and yakking on cell phones
One of the girls,  cuts a flirty smile at Alike
Alike turns away and buries herself in her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod
' It was like seven of us--Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara
#2 Tamara Marks
' Heeeell no--Fat Tamara
Oh  was about to say, Tamara Marks is a ughh-- can't stand her
' Anyway, it was all of us and oh Laura, you know that girl from the restaurant
She was there with one of her friends
Alike's ears prick up
That gay chick
Ya'll be hanging like that
' Yeah, well it's a couple of them
She's mad cool though, so sometime she come out with us every now and then, anyway-- 23
Man, y'all be doin' it on it weekends, let me find out
#2 told your butt to come
' But anyway-- Some of them 's are kinda cute-- 'm not saying  would, but  would holla
#2 don't know about all that
Isn't that one of them over there
What's her name
Amika
--Alisha
The pack directs their attention at Alike
Alike profiles and attempts to look casual
' Alike
Yeah, Alike--she's cute too
#2 Uugh
don't be looking at them all like that
Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alike's physique
Alike, aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt unnecessarily
She licks her lips and readjusts the book in her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face
Look, 'm not gay--but if  was gay might talk to her
' She's in the middle anyway
Yeah, but if she was just a little more harder-- Alike looks over and starts to nod when a   with locs swaggers up to the girls, drawing their rapt attention
24
`Sup ladies
#2 Heeeey
What's up
The girls erupt into titters, and they melt into conversation
Alike deflates, watching them over the top of her book
She observes every little moment between the girls and the boy, every wink
Another  joins the group and they stroll off down the sidewalk
Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them leave
Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at Alike
Remnant's of Alike's grin return reflexively
Mika's friend jerks her elbow around
' Oooh--let me find out, Mika
You act like you bi- or something
like girls but  love boys
#2                        #1 Umm hmm
can't tell
Alike waits for them to disappear from view before snatching up her bag and bolting in the opposite direction

-   -                        25 Laura hoists a box of french fries onto her shoulder and moves inside the restaurant
Watch out, it's slippery
So what do you think
already told you what  think
But you know her, right
said  know of her,  don't know her know her
Alike hefts up a box and follows Laura back into the restaurant
25
'm saying, you know her friend, right
You gonna introduce us
Just put those on that stack right there
Yeah, thank you
You listening
'm listening--all 'm saying is-- pass me that milkshake mix right there
Alike tosses Laura a bladder of milkshake mix
Laura catches it
All 'm saying is that  don't think you should put yourself out there like that
Especially if you don't even know if she likes you like that
She does
How do you know she does
just know she does
Hmmph
We'll see
Laura holds out her hand as if checking for rain and scans the ceiling
What're you doing
thought  felt a drop of pig shit
Shut up
26
All  know is  been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest
don't want to holla at girls in the club
Obviously
Why you pressed about this chick
Alike shrugs
wanted to ask you about something else too
Oh God, what now
need you to get something for me
What
Alike cocks her head at Laura
Laura frowns back
What
Just for my image
Alike raises her eyebrow
Laura shakes her head
The light bulb goes off
She roars in disbelief
You trying to strap
Whaaatt
Oh my God, what are you going through
Please
What difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon' make
Pleeeeease
By next Friday
27
Next Friday
Okay-- Whatever
Oh my God  can't believe you
Alright
Yeah
She better be cute for all of this
26
'  -                             26 Alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in her underwear
think it looks natural
peach-colored dildo dangles stiffly from Alike's waist
The harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts
Alike appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots Laura a look
'm serious,  mean it doesn't look that bad
can't believe you
Alike frowns at the dildo in profile
What
Laura, this doesn't look right
'ma look stupid
Well, first of all--  don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that
'm not putting this thing next to my skin, it pinches already
Alike yanks at the harness and her boxers trying to pull it out of her bottom
It's supposed to fit like that
They didn't have any brown
28
didn't have time for all of that
The brown ones were too big, anyway
Alike struggling with the apparatus
Laura smiles
Ugh
You gotta take it back
can't take it back
Here's the receipt
Unh-unh
'm not going back in there
One time was embarrassing enough
You grown
Still what if somebody would see me in there
'm not going back, that's it
Then where's my change
Sharonda bursts into the room
Lee, where'd you put my make-up case
' '
, '
Laura leaps from the bed and blocks Sharonda's path to the doorway
Alike tackles Sharonda and wrestles her down to the floor
Laura slams the door, shuts and locks it
Eeew get that thing, off a me
Get it off me it's nasty
'm tellin'
Shhh
Shut up
Thought you locked the door
29
Eeew
Get it offa me
did
, look 'm offa you
Just be quiet and calm down
'm tellin' that you got that thing
You can't tell
'm telling
Shut up
It looks nasty
(to Laura) See,  told you so
Where's my make up case
know you got it
just borrowed it
Alike pulls off the dildo and harness
Give it back
Alike fishes the make-up case out of her backpack
She holds it out to Sharonda
Sharonda reaches for it
Alike jerks it back
Promise you won't tell
Give it back
Alike flips open the make up case and jabs the dildo at it, stopping short of the surface of the make up
30
,
just got that one
Shhh
Don't touch it with that
eeww that's so nasty
'mon Lee give it back
Then promise you won't tell
Promise
Ughh,  hate you
Alike jabs the dildo closer to the make-up
,   won't tell
Daag
Alike tosses the case at Sharonda who scrambles to catch it
Alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind her headboard
Sharonda saunters out into the hallway
'm still tellin' Tellin' what
Audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway, still dressed for work, shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag
Noth--                           She took my makeup again
Lee
(notices Laura) Oh
Hello Laura,  didn't see you standing there
Hi Mrs
Freeman
How's your mother
31
haven't spoken to her in awhile
She's fine
Well  hope so
And 'm so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet
Wasn't she-- She's good
Mom
Audrey fixes Laura with another hard glance and shoos Sharonda down the hallway
Laura starts to shut the door, but Audrey stops it with her arm
think we'll just leave this open
Let some air circulate in here
was just about to leave, anyway
So
Audrey lingers, looking back and forth between Laura and Alike
Alike frowns at her mother
Satisfied that the conversation is over, Audrey moves off toward her room
Laura checks to make sure she's gone and whispers to Alike
Just try it
27
-                                27 Alike squirms in her seat
Will you chill
You just gotta get used to it
Alike tugs at her crotch and attempts to cross her legs
Owwww
Alike uncrosses her legs and yanks at her jeans
Laura bats her hand away
32
Sit still, people gon' think you got something
This joint hurts, man
'ma go take it off
You not gon' take it off
'm gonna take it off
Where you gonna take it off at
In the bathroom
Then where you gon' put it
You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand
Chill
knew we shouldn't have done this
You blowin' me right now
Then 'm out
Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this
You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me
Then you come on, too
Hurry up-- group of girls approaches, one of them we recognize as Mika, the girl that likes Alike, from the bathroom
Laura stands to greet them
Nervous introductions all around
Laura shoots Alike a warning glance
28
-                               28 Laura is hugged up with two girls at the end of the couch
Alike fidgets in her seat and keeps pulling at the knees of her jeans
Mika hand in chin, stares into space
Alike does another pull-fidget combo
Mika rolls her eyes at her
You alright
33
Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a spring in the cushion or something
You wanna switch seats
No, 'm good
And you don't wanna dance
Hey ya'll we're about to go dance
No, no not really
'm not really feeling the music
Mika sighs and looks around at the other dancing couples
Alike gives her jeans another tortured tug
Agonized minutes of awkward booming silence
Well you don't mind right
mean you don't mind if  go dance with somebody else
No, do your thing
If you change your mind-- No, no it's cool
Mika escapes the couch and disappears into the crowd
29
'  -                                29 Alike slips off her shoes and eases through the kitchen
Audrey flicks on the light, blocking the hallway entrance
hope it was worth it
Mom  lost-- Save it
34
It won't happen-- Oh  know it won't
30
'  -                                  30 Alike peels off her jeans and lobs them into the top of her closet
She unharnesses the dildo and wads the tangled mess up in an old t-shirt
She stuffs the wad in back of the closet and slams the closet door shut, staring at her reflection in the mirror
Alike reconsiders and yanks the wad back from the closet
31
'  -                                31 Alike stuffs the wad into a trash bag and plunges it deep into a neighbor's garbage can
She scurries back into her building and doesn't look back
32
'   -                            32 Alike skulks on the couch in wrinkled khaki pants and a cotton button down shirt
An obnoxious & video plays on the Sounds of bustling and the drone of a hair dryer fill the room
(
) Turn that mess off
Alike turns the television volume to low and continues watching
(
) Sharonda
Sharonda are you ready
Stop lollygagging
(
) 'm coming
Lee are you ready
Lee
Audrey hobbles out with one high heel on
She snatches the remote from Alike and snaps the  off
(') said off
Thought you were ready
35
am ready
You're not going to church looking like that
Where's the blouse bought you
What's wrong with this
The front door bursts open, and Arthur tromps in, his police uniform hanging open over a white undershirt
He slings a heavy
tote bag on the floor and strips off his shirt as he crosses to the kitchen
Audrey rushes over and buzzes around him
33
'  -                          33 Hey there, you're home early--well actually late
thought you would have called-- Dad-- Do what your mom says
Audrey scuttles over to where Arthur is now digging through the open fridge
He pulls out a foil covered plate, tears open one corner, sniffs it
Are you hungry
Let me heat it up for you
Arthur heads toward the microwave with the plate
Audrey intercepts the plate from him and dumps the contents into a skillet
(') 'll heat it up on the stove for you
Tastes better
Dad-- Lee
36
Leave me out of it
Go get changed
Dad, what's wrong with this outfit
Nothing
See
'm not gonna argue with you
Do what she says
Dad-- (speaking bad Tarzan Swahili) Umgowa
And put on a skirt
Alike stalks off to her bedroom
Sharonda bounces into the kitchen
Hey Dad
Too much lipstick
It's lipgloss
Audrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare
(') Okay, okay
Gimmie kiss
Sharonda pecks dad on the cheek
Dad wipes his cheek and rubs his fingers together
37
Sharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom
Audrey slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur
Did you talk to her
Get me a beer, please
Sharonda's fine
'm talking about Lee
Alike
And  don't see that there's a problem
'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on
And Laura
You said you were going to handle it
Umm-hmm
She needs a male point of view
said okay, dammit
Now can please have a beer please
It's Sunday morning
It goes with the spaghetti
Audrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front of Arthur
She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal, her expression softening as she caresses his forearm
Do you have to work tonight
To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no
To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes
Are you forever gonna be mad
38
Are you forever going to be happy
(beat) You made that decision a long time ago
We both made sacrifices
Alike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v-neck that Audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat-front skirt
Arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can
You look beautiful, baby
Tuck your blouse in
This isn't me
Tuck your blouse in
Leave it out
Audrey frowns at Arthur
Arthur stands his ground
(') think it's fine out
What's the deal with you and Laura
What deal
Comin' in late
Dad,  hardly ever-- Why don't you give that a break for a little while
Dad, come on
(to Alike) You heard him
() 39
(to Sharonda) Sharonda
You done
Alike spins into the living room defeated
(
) Coming
You coming with us
Nope
Sleep
We could go to a later service
The one o'clock-- said
Arthur slams his fork on the plate
Audrey flinches
Alike looks up
Sharonda appears in the doorway, looking from Audrey to Arthur
'm ready
Arthur pushes up from the table
Alike, you look beautiful
Everybody looks beautiful, okay
Arthur disappears into the bedroom
Alike snatches up her bible and launches out the door, Sharonda follows
Audrey pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind her
34
-                                             34 Alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit chats with other churchgoers
Sharonda sits in the back seat, flipping through a  case and occasionally passing 's to Alike to play
Alike faces stonily forward except to cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction
Audrey raps on the window
Lee
Lee
Here's someone  want you to meet
Alike cracks the window an inch
40
Huh
Audrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms
Singletary
Alike cracks the window a little wider and acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave
(') Oh
Hey
Get down out the car and come speak
Laboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the car radio, and climbs down out of the car
(') What's wrong with you
Alright, Mom
You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately
Oh don't worry, Audrey, understand how it is
Hormones
It's just a phase
Alike, this is Mrs
Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina
Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her "Lee" for short
Alike shakes both of their hands in turn
Hi
Hello
Nice to meet you
Hi
41
And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda
Hi
Hi
Hi there, nice to meet you
Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you
Cool
Yeah,  think 've seen you around
Mrs
Alvarado's class right English
Yup
Audrey looks pleased with herself
Alike squirms
So
Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger
Oh no, we won't
Bina  think you and Lee may even go to school the same way
Don't you live off of St
James Place
There is something to be said for safety in numbers
Bina nods
Alike squirms
(') Well, we need to be pushing off -- 'll call you about those workbooks
42
Alike retreats into the car, Sharonda hops in behind her
Alike reaches over and turns the key in the ignition
Alrighty, 'll be around
Take care
Alike toots the horn
Audrey circles and gets in the driver's side
35
-                                 35 You're funny
don't know what your problem is
Can somebody put in this  please
Audrey cranks the ignition and starts to back out
don't know what you think is going to change
know God doesn't make mistakes know that much
An invisible scab is ripped open in Alike and the fire dies in her eyes
Satisfied, Audrey slips the car into gear
(') You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, guarantee you that much
Moooom, can you-- Be quiet
Nobody's putting in anything
'm gonna listen to what want to listen to for a change
Alike wilts against the window and tacky zydeco music leaks from the car as it jerks away from the curb and into traffic
43
36
-                                           36 Alike strides down the sidewalk
Bina speedwalks to keep up
Look,  don't like lying to my mother, that's all
Then don't, she doesn't have to know
She does
She asks me everyday
So tell her yeah
No, 'm sick of lying to cover for you
So don't
Bina stops short
Alike keeps walking
Look Alike, Lee
Whatever it is you wanna be called
'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but 'm not about to take an  for it
So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it
We don't have to see each other any other time than that
Alike doesn't miss a step
Bina yells after her
(') Whatever, my mother asks me again, 'm telling her
Then she can tell your mother, then it's whatever for you
Alike stops short
Bina crosses the street and continues in the direction away from school
Alike spins around scanning the street, then catches sight of her on the opposite sidewalk
Hey
Bina keeps on pushing, the school now in sight
44
(') Hey
Alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to catch up with her
(') Hey look, 'm sorry
Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out
No for real, 'm sorry
didn't mean to be that way
It's just
,  am concerned that my, my mom will find out, but
But
It's not like that
It's just-- she's just
If you knew her, you'd understand
She's like,  don't know
The girls walk in silence for a moment
(') So what's your favorite class
You don't have to make small talk
Let's just walk
said 'm sorry
It's not you, it's just that my mom is like, she's like
Overprotective
Alike relaxes her shoulders, both relieved and surprised
Yeah
can tell
've seen-- mean, a lot of people's parents are like that
45
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
But probably not like mine
But anyway
Anyway, like  said, we don't have to talk
Just walk
Alike's cell phone chirps--it's Laura
Alike sighs and stuffs the phone back into her pocket
37
'  -                                     37 (
) Hi
This is Lee, 'm not able to answer my phone right now-- Laura snaps her cell phone shut
study book still glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of her
She opens her cell phone again and pulls up Alike's number
Her thumb hovers over the `talk' button
She snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio down and dragging the book closer
The cell phone rings and she snatches it up
picture of a girl making a kissy face with the name "Tasha" underneath blinks onto the screen and Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside
She hoists the  book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall
There is a knock at her bedroom door and Candace peeks in
How's it comin'
It's good
Candace smiles at Laura and hesitates before closing the door
Candace turns the radio off before ducking back out
Laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book
38
-                        38 Alike and Arthur cavort in a sloppy half-court game in the fluorescent glare of the gym
Well-heeled clientele cross to and fro munching power bars and sipping Gatorade
Arthur has an awful shot, but Alike's is worse
Alike heaves a huge airball past the basket
46
Oh my God
Alike cracks up as Arthur chases down the ball
(') That's just embarrassing
You ain't got no range, either
Yeah but at least  hit the backboard
Damn
Alike rushes to guard Arthur who dribbles clumsily around the key
He tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward the basket
Brick
Laughing, they tussle over the rebound
Arthur recovers
What's the score
One up
One
Yup
One
Nah,  definitely have like three
At least three
Giggling, the pair rollick in another squeaky-shoed play
39
-                                     39 , the store proprietor leans against the counter flipping through a newspaper
Arthur, in uniform mulls through the sports section
ratty looking man,  sips from a red plastic cup
Mack cranks the volume on the tiny television above the counter
47
It's on again
Check it out Free
Channel 5 and Channel 2
Arthur appears on the  screen, dressed in suit, tie, sunglasses and looking impressive
He is talking to a news reporter and a bad news graphic reading "East Side Drug Bust-- Detective Arthur Freeman" blots out the bottom of the screen
Look who's big time
Brother was looking clean though
Looked just like, look like
uh-- Danny Glover
Arthur and Mack laugh and slap hands
Sock sneers at their revelry
The bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset strolls in
Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain clinks against her ample carpenter pants
All three men turn to stare
(') Been more of that since they opened up that new club `cross the way
Arthur grunts and returns to his paper
(to Butch Woman) Excuse me Miss
Miiiiissss
Certain Friday nights they got, you know special parties going on
Or should  say Sir
Siiiir
Hello
Chill out, Sock
Hey, my man
You hear me talkin' to you
Mack snatches Sock's cup
Sock pivots around to protest
Hey
48
Mind your business
Sock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts
He's caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up to the counter with a case of liquor
Arthur steps out of the way and observes
And a pack of Kools
Mack nods and fishes under the counter
Say,  been trying to get your attention
Do you go by Sir or Miss
That'll be all ma'am
Yeah
Look  just had a simple question wanted to ask
See,  just want to know how does pussy taste
The woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first time
Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale
Arthur stiffens
(') You know,  just wanna know if you go with women for the taste, or is it just you're too big, black, and ugly so don't no man want you
Sock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his cup
$65
07 ma'am
The woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock
can't lie, pussy do taste good
Oh yeah
The woman takes her time putting away her change
49
(') Maybe you should try it yourself sometime
Or better yet-- The woman picks up her case
(') --ask yo' wife how she likes me
The woman winks at Sock
Arthur chokes back a guffaw
As soon as the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in laughter
Sock is livid and screams after her
Fuckin' Bulldagger
He-She
Dyke
Ask your wife
She told you
She ain't tell me shit
don't know what the fuck y'all niggas are laughing for
Awww shut up
Your big mouth got you in trouble as usual
Thought you was my friend, Mack
But  guess  ain't expect you to defend me Free, the way your daughter is-- Arthur slams Sock against the counter before he can finish his sentence
Say what
He don't mean nothin'
He don't know what he's talking about
Arthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling fist
Sock glares back, clearly punked
(') He ain't moved outside a two-mile radius of where he crawled out his mammy's pussy
He don't know shit
50
(to ) been to Poughkeepsie
Arthur snorts and flings Sock loose
Carry your Poughkeepsie ass on out of my store
Mack sweeps Sock's plastic cup off the counter and into a garbage can
Sock tromps to the door
Fuck y'all
should arrest your ass
Man, fuck y'all
Free, don't pay him no mind
Just talkin' trash
Mack playfully jabs him in the shoulder and bustles underneath the counter
Arthur's eyes linger on the door and his jaw tightens
40
'  -                                   40 Laura swings through the front door of her apartment, Alike close behind
She slides two twenty dollar bills underneath the ceramic hen on the table and breezes into her bedroom
41
'  -                                 41 Alike is a paper doll in Laura's floor length mirror, dressed only in boxers and a wife beater
Laura holds a bright orange polo shirt up in front of Alike's torso
Alike cocks her head to the side and considers
Damn, this is your color
So what's the deal incog-negro
Mom has me hemmed up
51
Your phone ain't broke
You coulda called a nigga
Put this on
Laura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a turquoise one instead
Alike hoists the oversized shirt over her head
My bad
She's making me hang out with this chick from church
It's crazy
Makin' you
You a grown-ass woman, bruh
Laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head
Alike considers and takes it off
Laura puts another cap in its place
Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of denim shorts
(') Try these with it
So  guess the piers is out for Saturday, huh
don't even know if that's me anymore
Alike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so they don't fall down
Laura tosses her a belt and admires Alike's reflection
Yeah, that's hot, yo
You should rock that
(') was gonna see if you wanna do something different
Alike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the rack
Different like what
Alike peels out of the polo shirt
don't know--maybe like a open mic or something
52
Open mic
Nah, man
It's plenty chicks at the piers, you just gotta be more confident
Laura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory
The jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and some still have store tags
Most of the shirts are still enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners
Laura passes Alike a perfectly folded button down shirt
(') You can rock this
haven't even worn it yet
But  understand if you got better things to do
Alike holds the shirt against her torso and stares at her reflection
She catches Laura's eager look in the mirror and wilts
Nah, 'm down
You sure
don't want you getting hemmed up
Nah seriously, 'm down for whatever
Real
Promise
That's what's up
'ma take the whole day off
It's gonna be tight watch
we gon' do it up
Laura holds a new pair of jeans against her body and does a little dance
Alike laughs wanly
42
' '  -                    42 Audrey sits between Alike's knees as Alike oils her scalp
Alike takes her time, massaging each braid between her hands before moving to the next
Audrey reads an Essence magazine, the cover of which reads "101 Ways to Please Your Man
" 53
You should wear your hair down sometimes
Your father likes it up
It looks nice down
Alike catches her mother's eye in the mirror's reflection, they share a sad moment
Audrey closes the magazine and tosses it back onto the bed
Maybe
Anyway give this back to Bina's mom when you go over tomorrow night
Saturday night
We talked about this
No we didn't
Lee-- had plans for this weekend
Well, you don't have to go to Bina's on Saturday night, you can always stay home with me
Oh my God
43
'  -                                 43 Bina sits on the floor, flipping through 's
Alike sits in a chair, head in hand, completely disinterested
You like Destiny's Child
Uhh-uhh
54
Jay-
Nope
Fifty
No,  don't really like any of that commercial bullshit
Bina looks up, off balanced
Oh
Who do you like
Alike checks the time on her phone
Shit
Alike starts packing her backpack
(') Just more underground stuff
None of that crap they play on the radio
Like who
People you probably haven't heard of
Conscious stuff
Like who
Roots
Black Star
Asheru and Blue Black
Pharcyde
Pharcyde
heard of Pharcyde
Ah--for real
Yep
Tribe
-Rawls
Bahamadia
55
Alike perks up, looking genuinely interested for the first time
Uh-oh, whatchu know about Bahamadia
Let me find out
'm not as generic as you think
The phone rings
Mrs
Singletary answers from another room
Alike and Bina freeze, listening
(
) Hello
Hi Audrey
Yes
Yeah she's here
understand-- Alike sulks
Bina flips to the back of the  book
Alright, how about Rock
It's cool
Whatchu know about Santogold
Since you all underground and stuff
She's tight
Tamar-kali
haven't heard of her,  heard of Res
Alike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to leave
Oh no this is way better, you gotta check her out
Bina jams her iPod onto the stereo adapter
The thick, fierce guitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's "Boot" consume the room
Bina chants the lyrics along with the music
(') "Her hair is short
Her legs are brown
Her lips are full
Her head hangs down
" 56
Alike plops back down in her chair
Wow
44
'  -                       44 Audrey smooths a pink sticky note onto a foil covered plate and shoves it into the fridge
The doorbell rings and she rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing- song voice
He-llooo
Hello Mrs
Freeman
Is Lee home please
She's out with her friend right now, Laura
You take care
Audrey starts to close the door
Laura stops it with her hand
Oh
Umm do you know when she'll be back
No,  believe she's out for the evening
Oh, because we had umm
alright then
Thank you
Goodnight
Audrey shuts the door harder than necessary
Laura checks her phone and shakes her head
45
'  -                        45 "Twist a virgin `round your dirty little finger
() 57
Blood is gone but the memory lingers
twist a virgin `round your bloody little finger, love is gone, but the memory lingers
" Alike is bobbing her head, backpack forgotten on her shoulder
Bina cranks the volume down
Yo, this shit is hot
Told you
Don't you have to go
'll cover
It's cool
Nah,  wanna stay
Alike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the  book into her lap
Her cell phone rings and she ignores it
46
-                                     46 The pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans, and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and strut seeing and wanting to be seen
Equally bedecked observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both sides
Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone
Competing threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her
(

Laura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the screen
She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear
Where you at
Hit me up when you get here

'  -                                47 Alike and Bina are sprawled in the floor
Bina 's from her laptop
Mrs
Alvarado was trying to get me to check out this one place
58
Alike hands her the flyer
Bina laughs and tosses it back
Oh hell, no
That's for old people-- 'll write down some places you should check out
Maybe you could read some of my stuff, too
Definitely

-                             48 Laura scowls at her cell phone screen
She shoves the phone in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of the evening
Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of 's in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh meat
Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an alley across the street and looks away
One of the entourage passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply
few of the girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break off and scatter into the night one by one
#1 `Member when we used to stay out here all night
#2 Shit, used to
#1 You stay with your sister now, huh
Laura nods and spits
#2 Lucky as hell

The desks are pulled together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily pierced, dyed hair, and vintage clothes types
Mrs
Alvarado sits cross-legged atop her desk taking notes
Alike stands at the center of the circle reciting an original poem
butterfly, briefly Suffocated On the mucous of its own change Imprisoned () 59
By the membranous chaff of its own underdeveloped Wings And Cramped In the darkness of the too-tight cocoon of its own creation Pauses Thinking death inevitable Prepares to die in the absolute solitude Of Swollen Husk

Unguarded, Alike smiles back

Alike breaks the silence for once
liked your story, though
It was tight
Yeah
Which one
The one about the-- The one about karma, how things come back to you
That one, thought it was tight
For real
Thanks
wasn't gonna say anything, but  liked yours too
Why
60
Why did  like it or why wasn't gonna say anything
Why did you like it
don't know
guess because it felt honest
Oh
Didn't you have on a different shirt earlier
What
Nothin'
No, what'd you say
Nothin'
Yeah,  had on a different shirt
Oh
Well, that's cool
So why weren't you gonna say anything about it
About your shirt
About the poem
Cause you're moody
Moody
And quiet
61
Man, 'm not moody
Yeah, right
Bina stops
What
This is me
Alike looks up at the stoop, surprised
(') It's not so bad when there's some conversation, huh
Alike looks away
(') You wanna come up
51
'  -                              51 Alike sits on Bina's twin bed, looking around and really taking in the room for the first time
She reaches over and picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf
Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs
Who gave you this
What the bear
My dad
No, this
Alike holds the figurine out, Bina looks at it over her shoulder
Oh that
Girl, my stupid ex- boyfriend gave me that
Oh
Cute
Bina opens a  case and pulls the booklet out
62
Not really
mean  guess it was at the time
Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the room and hands Alike the booklet
(') Anyway, this is the other artist was telling you about
Her stuff is like, bouncier
buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom
Bina plops down on the bed next to Alike
This is straight
You'll burn me a copy
Yeah,  have a bunch of other stuff, too
(beat) So who do you hang out with don't really see you with anybody
Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack
She pulls out her composition book
Awkward silence
(') didn't mean it like that
was just asking because  was curious
don't really like anybody that goes there either
My friend Laura used to go there
Not now, but she's going back
Oh because,  was just gonna say-- 'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to
Bina waves her hand at the radio
(') They play this kind of music
Sure
How'm  supposed to dress
63
You don't dress
You just come however
Come as you are
Alike nods
(') Can  see
Bina snatches the book from Alike's hands and starts flipping through pages before Alike can answer
Yeah
But that's mainly old stuff, though
This is the one you did today
Yeah
Nice
Bina offers the journal back to Alike
Alike reaches for it
Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of keep away
(') Take it
Alike misses again
The girls crack up
(') Sorry, here
Bina yanks it away again
Alike gives up, still smiling
You play too much
Seriously, it's right here
Just take it
Alike summons the courage for one last swipe
She manages to grab it but Bina doesn't let go right away
The girls lock eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war
Thank you
64
You're welcome
Beaming with her victory, Alike busies herself with the journal
Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next foray
She dances the moose up Alike's arm and plants an exaggerated peck on her cheek with it
(') Mmmwaahhh
The girls erupt into renewed giggles
Bina tosses the stuffed animal aside and scoots closer to read over Alike's shoulder
(') What's so private
Nothin', just my writings
Bina studies Alike's profile
She leans in and pecks Alike on the cheek
Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina sidelong
Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss on Alike's lips
Alike pulls away
Bina tenses for the verdict
(') Why'd you do that for
Sorry--- No, 'm sorry
just umm
gotta go
thought-- Sorry
Alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door, Bina flounders in her wake

'   -                           52 Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a Music blasts from the  but doesn't drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage
There is a knock at the door
65
You'll get that for me
One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door without greeting and walks away
Alike is left alone to escort herself in
Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at the fringes of the pack
Wassup man
collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table although no one addresses Alike directly
Laura slams the table and raises her hands in triumph
Board, goddammit
told you
#1 Awww, we shoulda been done set you
Laura slaps hands with her partner
The unlucky pair of partners argue
The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the neck
Alike looks away
Good game, baby
What's good, Lee
Just came to say wassup
Whatchu got, Ty
#2 Three, maybe four
We goin' eight
Roars of disbelief from around the table
Alike is quickly forgotten in the ruckus
Alike circles to Laura's side
The personal cheerleader looks her up and down
Can  talk to you for a second
Now  got to cut you
Grab `em partner
We gonna run a Boston on that ass
() 66
(to Alike) Yo, 'm busy right now
More raucous laughter from the table
Alike endures another few moments of card slapping, table pounding dejection before leaning into Laura's ear
really need to talk to you-- said later
Wide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table
Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up
Alike picks up her face and slips away
#3 Thought that was your girl
Mind your business
Bam
That's what  thought
Laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig of water

' '  -                         53 Audrey lies awake in bed
The clock on the nightstand indicates a little past two in the morning
She looks at the sliver of light underneath the bedroom door, the sound of Arthur's key in the door breaks the silence
Arthur's voice in hushed tones
Audrey rolls over and faces the wall
54
'  -                                  54 Alike watches her father's footsteps break up the light beneath her door
She tosses off her blankets and springs into the hallway
(loud whisper) Hey Dad
She is talking to empty air
She eases down the hallway toward the kitchen and the sound of his muffled voice
(') Dad
67
(
) Come on now, you know that's not what  want
That's not what 'm saying
That's not--listen to me
Are you gonna listen to me
Mom
Alike stops short outside the kitchen door, confused
(
) Lee
Hold on
55
'  -                            55 Alike swings around the corner
Huh
No, not you
(into phone) Hey, 'll talk to you later, alright
My daughter's up
Arthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his pocket
He fishes a beer out of the fridge
Who was that
Arthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits
What you doing up
Just wanted to talk
Arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash without reading it
He peels up one side of the foil, peeks at the food underneath, and launches it into the trash, too
(') Dad, the plate--don't trash the plate
Arthur strips off his dress shirt and tie and flings them into the living room
68
Alike rescues the plate from the garbage and carefully lays it in the sink so it doesn't clatter
(') Aren't you hungry
Ate already
You ate at work
No, just grabbed some take out
Oh
Where
Arthur explodes
Why you asking me all these goddamn questions, girl
What's wrong with you
You don't question me
Sorry
Alike starts to head back to her room
Hold up
'm sorry, Alike come on back
Look--  got patties
Arthur tosses a greasy bag onto the table and pulls out a chair for her
Beef
And chicken
'mon
Alike sits happily and the two munch in silence for awhile
Listen uh
Your momma's worried that uh
How's school
Straight 's
Probably
69
That's right
Want a sip
Arthur offers her the beer
Alike takes it to the head
said a sip
sip
Arthur snatches the beer from her
They laugh
Alike picks at her patty, eating little pieces of crust
(') What's on you your mind
Nothin'
Arthur snorts
(') What if--what if
say somebody liked you right
They like you
Or they like you, like you
Say they like you, like you
Uh-huh
mean, they haven't said anything yet
But what if
so what if the person is kinda like a friend, but you know they like you more than that
Well,  think that's the best way to start--as friends
But then what if
What if the person is -- Arthur scents the heavy news packed in Alike's expressive pause and scrambles to intercept her at the pass
(') What's his name
What grade is he in
() 70
'ma look his ass up in the system
Ha-ha
Wait `till your mama finds out
She'll be so goddamn happy
Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment
Yeah
Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police uniform out the hall closet
He lays it across the back of the couch and unzips his pants
Alike turns her back to give him privacy
Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right
Alike shakes her head no
Arthur tucks his undershirt into his pants
(') Called the Kitty Litter, the Catbox, something like that
Nah,  never even heard of it
Good
`Cause you know that's a uh
it's a rough neighborhood
You know that right
had a case over there
You wanna be careful--stay away from that element
Just in case it ever comes up
'll be careful
Good
know you will
Alike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent
She scoots back around to face him
Arthur smooths his uniform shirt into his pants
Dad, when you were on the phone earlier
It sounded like mean
guess you're headed back to work, huh
71
Yep
Your mama still up
Probably
Tell her  had to work
Arthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the forehead
(') Love you

'  -                             56 Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch
The pier girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her knapsack on the floor
Laura tosses the pillow onto the couch
My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then
#2 Good looking
There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself
#2 `Preciate ya
Laura pulls up close to the kitchen table
The  test prep book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her
She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice answers into a spiral notebook
stack of old Math and English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil
57
-                            57 Alike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker
She draws her breath and approaches
Hey
72
Hey
long awkward silence
Alike leans against the bank of lockers, not daring to make eye contact
'm sorry about the other day
It's cool
Bina pretends to rearrange books in her locker
(') Things have been crazy
But look, 'm sorry  bugged out
It's just
didn't know that you wasn't expecting that
You still coming to the party
don't know-- need to try and catch up with Laura
Oh
But  do wanna hang out mean
maybe we could do both
Bina smiles and shuts the locker door
Cool

Avoid the whole curfew thing

You sure
Yeah

Easy, easy now
Watch your right hand side
am
Don't ride the brakes though
Good
See
'm getting better
Can drive back
Arthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack
don't about that
You're shaky girl, you're shaky
Get us some chips and 'll think about it
Arthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down out of the car
59
-                                59 Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door
Sock and    chit chat nearby
Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches
Alike bops into the store
Hey, baby
Hey Mr
Ferguson
see Alike's been running circles around you again
Little bit, little bit
still got it though
Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock whispering to one of the men
74
Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato chip rack
She twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t- shirt up over her nose
The smile evaporates from Arthur's face
Sock peers back at him, smirking
Arthur starts toward him, when Alike saunters out between them
We better get going
(') Gone already
'll holler at you later
Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car
(') Get in the car
But you said  could drive-- said get in the car
Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the store
She slumps into the car and slams the door
Arthur piles into the driver's seat
They sit in silence for a moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands
60
'  -                                60 Look
umm
you know you're daddy's girl, right
Alike avoids eye contact, staring out her window
Arthur searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and pulls away in silence
61
'    -                    61 Audrey reclines on the couch reading a book
The doorknob jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest, pretending to be asleep
75
Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form
Arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's foil covered plates
He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich ingredients instead
Audrey yawns and props herself up on one elbow
Oh you're home
Hey
must've dozed off
How long have you been in
Hour
Dad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients back into the fridge
Did you see the plate in there
This is fine
Arthur plops down on an armchair and flips the  channel to sports highlights
Mom scoots over on the couch
There's room over here
You can see the  better
This is fine
Arthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches Audrey's hurt expression
He winks at her
(') Thank you
Just alike
Say what
76
You and your daughter
Have you talked to Lee yet
told you she-- talked to Alike
You did
Everything's fine
Like  told you
Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend
Boyfriend
Just give her some space
Space
She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night
Both of you
Running around like you got something to hide, like 'm the big, bad witch and what about me
'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon-- don't have anything to hide
Look told you  talked to Alike and everything is fine
Did you ask her
Dad slams down his half-eaten sandwich and stands up
No, because  didn't have to
Besides, would know okay
If anybody would know, it would be me
know my daughter-- Your daughter
--better than anyone else and-- 77
So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter
--'m telling you she's just    Well  guess  better not fine
have nothing else to say then, huh
That's your damn problem, you're too much of a damn worry wart
Let's hope you're right, Detective
Will you shut the fuck up
Audrey jerks to her feet and flings the book aside
An hour
Really
'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street
And you will not talk to me that way
Audrey slaps the sandwich off Arthur's plate and storms to the bedroom
Arthur sees Sharonda peeking from her bedroom door but can't summon any words
Sharonda skitters into Alike's bedroom
62
'  -                                  62 Alike is awake, hands folded behind her head
Sharonda curls up on top of the covers next to her

'm not
The girls lay silently as they listen to Arthur bang around in the kitchen

Hmm

/  -                          63 yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table turned stage
Kids roam from room to room nursing plastic cups
Some in elaborate ensembles, some in thrift store duds, others in plain old jeans, but no two people the same
Alike clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable as she and Bina ease their way through the crowd
In between performers, guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and render their voices practically inaudible
: --Bina introduces Alike to different people, Alike is welcomed --Alike & Bina point out different performers, they laugh and talk in each other's ears --Alike and Bina dance wildly in the middle of the crowd, surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies --One performer beckons Alike up onto the table, Alike demurs at first, then leaps on top of the table
Bina cheers
--Alike drags a giggling Bina out of the party and they crash into the open night 64
-                                        64 Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak defiance against the night sky
sodium vapor glow veils everything in generous haloes, making the night more beautiful than it really is
Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying, always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house
Like Puck on a midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys
Among the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing
Laura, smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a sycophantic harem of four
79
Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now righting, always connected
Alike and Bina
Bina smiles and snakes her arms around Alike's neck
Alike too shy to react, giggles and folds
Laura watches the pair spin and passes to the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows
65
-                                 65 Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over her face
Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure whether this is play or for real
Laura chuckles, breaking the ice
The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with wild arcing blows
Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance away
Alike swipes Laura's hat
Laura claps Alike on the shoulder and Alike waves to Bina
Bina waves and smiles
So whatchu you think
She's cool right
Laura looks around and shrugs
Laura plucks a fresh joint out of her coat and lights it
(') She's hot right
told you
It was so tight
'm tellin' you, you shoulda been there tonight
Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike
This one's just for me and you
Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night
And she's smart, too
She does poetry, you should hear it
It's like, it's good, you know
Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead, still chattering
(') was thinking next weekend the three of us could-- Look, 'm right here
Alike snaps out of it
80
(') Oh my bad,  thought you were beside me
Anyway,  was thinking-- Look, 'm sorry for all the drama
No, it's cool
shoulda-- What 'm saying is,  probably overreacted
(beat) And then
don't know
Seeing you two together or whatever
'm glad to see you're finally happy
'mon man, you know you're my best friend
Nobody's gonna -- You don't need to say anything just wanted to get it off my chest
'm happy for you, that's all
Alike shakes her head
Her mouth moves but nothing comes out
(') Because  love you, alright
And 'm sayin'
'm right here
Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off
Laura takes a long drag on the joint
Bina and Mika stumble over giggling
Bina hooks Alike's arm
Mika kisses Laura on the neck
Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk creeping back
We goin' to get something to eat
That's what's up
Listen, umm-- Laura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it away
That's for later
Bina, nice to meet you
81
You too
We had fun
Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder and starts to lead Mika away
Byyeee
Hey hold up
Laura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement
Bina takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away
Alike keeps looking back, then    finally gives up

Any brownies left
Nope
Bina flicks off the  and stares at Alike

Her finger's dance at the top of Alike's pajama bottoms

What's wrong
This is uh
never
'm sorry, 'm trippin' out
It's okay
We don't have to

She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it
The return address reads " Educational & Testing Services"
She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope
The top of the slip reads "'Campbell, Laura' " 68

The paint is peeling and the flowers in the window-box are dead
rusted metal mailbox next to the door overflows with circulars
Laura lifts the circulars out of the box and trashes them
She picks up a discarded fast food bag and tosses it too
dog barks from a neighboring yard
Laura pulls open the screen door and tries to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil
More barking
Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door
She snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward

Alike yawns and rolls over, a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers her surroundings
Hey
Hey
Bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in
You up already
It's after one o'clock, actually
Bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes hamper, and then begins making the bed with Alike still in it
Alike pulls Bina down beside her
What's wrong
Nothin's wrong, 'm just cleaning up
Don't worry about it
Okay then, 'll help you
No,  got it
Bina snatches a pillow from behind Alike and fluffs it
Alike, still oblivious, grins and traces Bina's shoulder
85
Look um-- just wanted to say that last night
last night was amazing
thank you for-- Last night we were just playin' around, that's all
Bina flinches away from Alike's touch
Alike shoots a glance at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper
Look
We can slow things down
Nobody has to know that we're together
"Together"
Whoa, no
Huh
thought
Look if you don't want to call it that, that's fine, but don't act like nothing happened
Bina moves away and levels her gaze at Alike for the first time
Alike touches Bina's elbow, Bina flinches away
Look, 'm not gay okay
This isn't me-- wasn't--'m not ready for all this
Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it around on the bed
Bina recoils and snatches it away
Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face
Bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on Alike
Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on
She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a sweatshirt down over her nightie
She flings her backpack open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering her things
Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag
Bina watches her, arms folded
Alike takes one last look around the room and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face
(') Lee
Alike ignores her and launches into the hallway
Bina runs to her bedroom doorway
86
(') Wait--Lee
Alike beelines for the front door
Bina chases Alike across the room
(') Lee, stop please
Alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running nose and turns to face her
Bina takes several steps toward her
Alike lets go of the doorhandle, her voice cracks
What
You promise you won't tell anybody
70
' / -                             70 Alike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk
She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car
She continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening
She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into the air
She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and flings them into the street
Spinning and thrashing she wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another garbage can
She circles back and kicks the can over
She hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of a subway station
71
'   -                         71 Lee bursts into the living room and charges to her bedroom
Audrey, who has been waiting in the living room storms in after her
Where in the hell have you been
Alike kicks off her shoes and paces the room
(') You hear me talking to you
Where you been
You left Bina's hours ago
Lee-- '
87
Audrey gasps in stunned silence
(') 'm not your husband so stop comin' at me like  am
'm not your companion, 'm not your friend -- you made that abundantly clear--'m your daughter and  have my own shit to deal with
--don't you dare--Alike-- am your Mother-- Audrey melts back against the doorjamb
Alike slings off her shirt and slams the door in Audrey's face
livid Audrey bangs on the door and jiggles the handle
(') You must have lost your damn mind
Wait until your father gets home
72
'  -                          72 Alike attacks her closet, ripping all the "girly" shirts from the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan
She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the floor
She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed by a chunky pair of Timberlands
Silent sobs rack her body as she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror
She strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner
Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before collapsing onto the bed
She writhes against the pillows and covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist through her body
Blackout
73
'  -                               73 Alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her ears
The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her parents's bedroom
The shouting gets louder, and Alike sits upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her doorway and into the living room
Audrey's voice trails him down the hallway, and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and shorts
74
'   -                         74 Arthur's hand is on the doorknob, a small tote flung over his shoulder
Audrey blocks the door, her hands on her hips
They both look up as Alike edges into the living room
88
You see, that's exactly what 'm talking about
Get over here
Go back to bed
No, you come tell your father what you told me
Don't drag her into this, Audrey
(to Alike) Go to your room, Alike
Your mom and  are having a discussion
We are not discussing
wanna know right now-- Go to your room
Your father's leaving us
am not leaving you
Sharonda, wake up
Come see your father leaving us
'm not fucking leaving
Will you stop saying that
Come say goodbyeeee
Audrey shoves Arthur toward the door
Reflexively, Arthur raises his hand at Audrey
Audrey puffs up
(') Oh, what
wish you would
Go ahead
Look girls, your daddy's going to beat me
Sharonda bursts into tears behind Alike
Alike hurries Sharonda back down the hallway
89
Shhh
It's okay
Go in my room and lock the door
Don't come out, `kay
Sharonda bawls harder
Alike gently closes the door on her
(') It's gonna be okay
75
'   -                      75 Arthur and Audrey argue viciously
(
) No
Dammit, that's not true
Look, will you stop sayin' that
(
) It's the truth
Alike edges back into the living room, Audrey wheels on her
Arthur is beaten and cornered
(') Your daddy's got a new girlfriend
Or did you already know that
You know,  bet you did
Audrey, stop it
Alike go back to bed
Meanwhile, your daughter's turning into a damn man right before your very eyes, and you can't even see it
Arthur drops his tote and advances toward Audrey, leveling a stiff finger at her face
No you take that back
You shut the fuck up about that, Audrey
Arthur gets in Audrey's face
Audrey leers back at him
Alike jumps between them
Dad
Stop
90
Go back to bed, Alike
Tell him, Lee
Don't call her Lee
Mom, stoppit please
Tell your Dad where you hang out
Tell him about your butch-ass girlfriend-- Laura's  my girlfriend
What the hell are you talking about
You don't know what the hell are you talking about
Alike, please just go to your room, baby
Alike drops her gaze and backs away
Tell him
Arthur's expression cracks and he tears his focus from Audrey to Alike
Tell me what
'm not tellin' you nothin'
Tell him you're a dyke
You tell him you're a nasty ass dyke
No she's not gay
Alike we didn't raise you that way, baby
Eyes still downcast, Alike just shakes her head and backs away
There
You see
91
You shut the hell up Audrey
Arthur extends his arms toward Alike, his voice trembling
(') know that's not true
You tell your mother right now, Alike
You tell her it isn't true
Alike meets her father's eyes
Dad-- Don't you lie now, you tell the truth
You already know
No,  don't know
You tell your mother it's just a phase
It's not a phase
Arthur is stopped cold, his shoulders slump
See, if you would've (to Alike) What's wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with me
This is your fault
If you had-- Arthur tears into Audrey, spittle flying
92
'
You    This is  my fault
Just should've been at home more     shut up and lemme talk
'm often
Why don't you         trying to fuckin' talk-- '
Arthur spasms as though he's been stabbed
Out of nowhere, Audrey's backhand pistons Alike to the ground
She raises her hand high and slaps it down hard on Alike's shoulders and arms
Alike yells
Arthur turns to stone
Say it again
Say it again
Alike fends off Audrey's blows with her hands
She kicks angrily as Audrey towers over her
'm a lesbian
Yeah, 'm a dyke
No you're not
Audrey's blows become more manic and vicious
Arthur wakes from his trance and tries to wrestle Audrey off of Alike
That's enough
Stop it
Don't you say that
Let go
Don't you say that
Get offa me
What
You a man now
' Audrey swings and hits Alike with a nasty hook to the jaw, Alike's head snaps back and hits the floor
Arthur yanks Audrey off of Alike
Audrey directs her rage at him, pummeling his face and chest
93
Tears stream down Arthur's face as Audrey shakes free and aims one last blow at his face
(') '
76
'  -                               76 Click-clack
Click-clack
The rattle of circuit breakers echo through the bare darkness of Laura's small apartment
Anything
No
Click-clack
Click-clack
How about now
No
Nothing
Shit
Fucking building
Laura bangs into something in the darkness
(') Owww
Shit
small light flicks to life and grows larger
In its dim glow, Laura spots Alike leaning against a worn couch
The lights become two as Laura hands Alike a candle
Here
Good thing  keep some these around
Alike snorts thickly
Her words are slurred and nasal
Yeah, for your many women
Hey, you thanking `em now
94
Laura holds her candle up to Alike's grim face
You okay
Alike wipes at already dried tear streaks on her puffy face and looks down
Laura slides an arm around her waist and guides her into the small bedroom
You bring clothes
Huh-uh
stopped by the house-- stopped by--- That's alright, man
You can wear some of mine
It's okay, c'mon
Lets get some sleep
My sister'll be home in a little bit, too
77
'  -                                  77 Overturned Ramen noodle cups litter the floor
Laura sips a beer and strokes Alike's head who sleeps fitfully in her lap
78
'   -                            78 Arthur is frozen in the middle of the living room with a contractor trash bag
He stoops and piles the shards of a broken lamp into the bag one by one
Sharonda peeks out at him from her bedroom door
Arthur looks up at her and Sharonda pushes the door shut
79
' '  -                           79 Audrey sits at the edge of her bed in a housecoat
Her hair is ruffled and flyaway
Her ankles are crossed and her hands are dead birds in her lap
Her work clothes are laid out in a neat line beside her: shirt, pants, socks, and shoes on the floor right underneath
The telephone begins to ring, but Audrey does not hear it
80
'  -                               80 Bina and a    sit on the floor, their backs propped against the bed, books spread on the floor
The boy puts his arm around Bina, launching numerous passionate advances, but Bina pushes him away
95
The clueless boy continues his clumsy attempts
Bina stares out the window, completely detached
81
'  -                               81 Audrey, still in her housecoat, stares into the refrigerator, transfixed by the mountain of foil-covered plates
Her eyes are cried-out buttons
Suddenly she remembers to breathe, and her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears
She yanks a foil-covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can and tosses the plate into the sink
She dumps another and another, her composure returning with each plate tossed
By the time she gets to the last one, her breathing slows and returns to normal
She disappears into the bedroom and reappears with the red shopping bag
She calmly lifts out the pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage
She wads up the shopping bag and stuffs it in too
She takes a deep breath and wipes her sleeve across her nose
Okay
82
'  -                           82 Arthur, Audrey and Sharonda are pegged around the dinner table
Audrey's make-up fails to cover the dark circles beneath her eyes and Arthur has a week's worth of stubble
There is a jagged hole where Alike usually sits
Noticing the asymmetry, Audrey bundles up Alike's place setting and sweeps it onto the floor
Sharonda looks from Audrey to Arthur then into her plate
You want to say grace
Arthur clears his throat
Heavenly Father
Audrey thrusts her hands out to Arthur and Sharonda
They each take her hand and Arthur begins again
(') Dear Heavenly Father we pray
we pray thank you for this food and we pray
we pray for your continued blessing
Arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed
An awkward silence ensues
Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still holding hands
96
Amen
Amen
Audrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode, babbling to no one in particular
got this recipe from a magazine
Supposed to be very good
And you see  made those green beans you like
Sharonda pass the rice please
Sharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl
Dad
You know where she is
83
'  -                           83 Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream
Sunset paints the cityscape pink and orange
The faint cadence of children playing drifts in and out on a fickle breeze
Alike's wounds are healing and she seems happy
The friends exchange wordless smiles and soak in the peacefulness around them
Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate
Arthur is standing in the doorway
Laura calls out to Alike
Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face
Arthur tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down
Laura looks back at Alike
Alike considers, then carefully nods
Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass
Alike rises to face her father
She stands tall, her weight is centered
Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns away from him
Distant playground voices fill the pause
'  - Alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook
Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting, her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her
Laura motions to Alike
Alike considers, then carefully nods
Laura steps aside and watches Arthur pass
Alike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows
Distant playground voices fill the pause
97
Where's Mom
She
your mother couldn't make it
Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline
Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer
(') Remember our old place
Waaay out in Queens
It was our first apartment, we were so proud
Had all those trees around it
In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves
You remember
Alike makes no sign
(') You couldnt've been more than 2 years old
And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive
You'd get so scared
You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up
would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground
But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up
She always picked you up
Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory
He dares a glance over at Alike
(') `Member how we used to-- 've been accepted into a early college program
Starts in the Spring
Berkeley
California's a long way away-- Ten weeks writing boot camp, workshops
Then  can start summer semester
98
We can talk about that
Okay
need you to meet with my guidance counselor
Sign the paperwork so can graduate early
'm sorry, alright
'm sorry  let her hurt you-- need to know now if you'll sign the papers
Yes or no
Can you forgive me
Yes or no
You can always come back home
Things are gonna be different, promise you-- Alike holds Arthur's hand, stopping him
Dad, 'm not running
'm choosing
Arthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob
(') 'm not going back home
know
(beat) Okay
Alike nods, squeezes Arthur's hand
Arthur breathes deeply, composing himself
He starts to pull away
(') better-- Tell Mom that she was right
Right about what
99
God doesn't make mistakes
You should tell her yourself
Arthur squeezes Alike's hand and drifts away
Alike inhales the sunset
84
-                          84 Audrey is cleaned up, well-dressed and freshly put together
She sits alone at the lunch table, crunching an apple bible and a daily devotional guide are spread open in front of her
Alike knocks on the glass, and Audrey looks up stunned
Alike comes in and sits across from her
Audrey glances around, concerned about passing coworkers
Mom
Lee--Alike
How've you been
Fine
Did Dad tell you
He told me, yes
How are you
Audrey gathers her lunch garbage and pushes back from the table
just hope you're keeping yourself safe
love you, Mom
Audrey stacks her devotional guide on top of her bible and stands
She starts to speak, then crosses to the door instead
(') said  love you
'll be praying for you
100
Audrey disappears into the hallway
84A
-                                          84A Alike writes in her notebook, mouthing the words to a poem
She looks up and studies the horizon from time to time
84B
-                                        84B Alike relaxes at a desk, reading from her notebook
Mrs
Alvarado sits cross-legged on her desk listening
(
) Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise For even breaking is opening And  am broken am open Broken to the new light without pushing in Open to the possibilities within pushing out See the love shine in through my cracks See the light shine out through me
am broken am open am Broken Open See the love-light shining through me Shining through my cracks Through the gaps My Spirit takes journey My Spirit takes flight Could not have risen otherwise And  am not Running am Choosing Running is not a Choice From the Breaking Breaking is freeing Broken is freedom am not broken am free
Alike closes her book
The pair reflect in easy silence
Mrs
Alvarado nods
Yeah
(beat) Yeah

'  -                                       85 The downtown Brooklyn landscape hums against the windshield as Arthur and Alike ride in complete silence
Sharonda chews a thumbnail, peering over the backseat
Laura slumps against the window, a smirk hiding at the corner of her lips
86
-                                  86 Laura and Sharonda fumble a suitcase out of the trunk of the car
Alike shrugs into her backpack
Arthur nudges them aside and hefts out the rest of the luggage
got it
Arthur slams the trunk shut
Thank you
You want me to come in with you
Alike shakes her head
Arthur starts to back away
Well-- Alike pounces on Arthur in a surprise hug
Arthur squeezes her back
You can always come back home
love you
love you too
87
-                           87 General chaos as passengers, and well-wishes scramble for position
Let me get a hug or somethin', damn
Laura squeezes Alike first with one arm then pulls her hand out of her pocket to wrap both arms around her friend
102
Call us when you get there
You know  will
Laura backs away and wipes a sleeve at her eye
You just better fuckin' call
Alike disappears through the bus doors
Laura slouches on a hydrant and Sharonda paces, scanning the windows for Alike
88
-                                               88 Sharonda waves maniacally
Alike musters a smile and puts a hand on the window
Laura raises a fist
The bus sails away from the curb
Alike leans forward to keep Laura and Sharonda in sight as long as possible
As she faces front again, she glimpses Arthur, standing in the doorway of the terminal
passing van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat
An next to her offers her a piece of ginger candy
Alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep breath
Reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across Alike's face and she is able to hold back neither the smile nor the tears that come
