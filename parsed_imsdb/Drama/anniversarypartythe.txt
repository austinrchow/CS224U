Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife
, , - She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes
She watches her husband unguarded in sleep
Her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing
Traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth
Brushes fingertips against his eyelashes
- '
It retracts with a loud , sun, sky, trees
(
) And breath
and chataronga
- We're in the middle of a yoga lesson
Joe and Sally stand on their mats
Steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft-spoken instructions
large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace
The dining room on one side, living room on the other
Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool
The house is classic Neutra
All  and The calm is broken by the telephone
Joe and Sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up
They break their yoga poses and listen
The  hovers over the answering machine
(
) (over answering machine; sweet, British, slightly desperate) Joe, it's Lucy
Remember me
It's the black sheep here
Bah
not funny
Haven't heard from you, need you, call me
Love you madly
Hi, Sally
Joe, 'd love to talk to you before  go
Go where
(
) (over answering machine) It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother
Sorry  drone on
miss you
lo-- The machine cuts her off
Joe and Sally have resumed their positions
This wasn't the call they were waiting for
, forty-one, and , fifty, struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come through the sliding glass door
Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two unpack groceries, flowers, etc
, and start to dress the dining room table
They speak quietly to each other in Spanish
America, could you just
America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room, giving the couple their privacy
(') (calls out) Thank you, America
Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax
And reach up and into downward dog
Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard pillow, stirs, stretches and groans
Good boy, Otis
The phone  again
(
) (over answering machine) Hello,  have Dr
Harmon calling for Sally Therrian
Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone, all angles
Hello, hi, hi
and
Thank God
Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe
- Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign
Sally returns to the lesson
They do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the front door
No luck
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again
Sound like a plan
Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched relax, facing one another
Happy anniversary, baby
Happy anniversary
They smile
And change sides
America slides open the dining room doors
The dining table is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers
Rosa is singing in Spanish
(with the authority of long years of service) Mr
Joe, we have to have the house
If you please now
It's yours
The  glances off photos of the couple: portraits and candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like
Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf
It's clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful
There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood
There's an photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed somewhere
- Joe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror, his arms around her, stroking her belly
love you
Most beautiful woman in the world
Hardly
Accept a compliment
think you're the most beautiful woman in the world
They move toward the bed
What did you get me
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us
She pushes him on the bed
Kiss my eyes
She does
My wrists
He does
Kiss the back of my knees
Through the sweats or not
Not
She pulls down his sweats
She kisses the back of his knees
He turns, stares up at her
What
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you
Sally shakes her head
No
Did you
(after a beat) No
missed that
missed all of you
We're okay, aren't we
We're great
mean, you're really back
For good
They begin to make love
the phone
(') Don't get it
Well, it might be Clair
They're threatening not to come
What
They can't find a sitter
(into the receiver) Hello
Excuse me
Yes, uh, hold on
(she looks at Joe) Just a moment
(puts the call on hold) It's Skye Davidson
She needs directions to the house
You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party
Okay
'm sorry, look,  meant to tell you
It was the only chance  had to meet her
You invited her to our anniversary party
didn't even invite my mother
She goes on location tomorrow
Sally, 'm sorry
Look,  can't keep her on hold
(pissed) No, no of course not
It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake
(regards her) You want me to uninvite her
No, no of course not
How old is she
Twenty-fucking-two
She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom
The  is with her
(') (into the bathroom mirror) And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake
(into the receiver) Skye
(his face lights) 'm so glad you're able to make it
it's our sixth, actually
(flattered) You read the book again
Well, no, the ending to chapter six
it's just that it's not filmic
We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic
Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again
If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park
Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right
It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left
Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway
He meets her eyes mid-sentence
(') Oh
don't think tonight
'm sure they're well behaved
All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them
We'd be outnumbered, you see
So we sort of put a ban on it
Sorry
He rolls his eyes
Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it
(
) (') 'm looking forward to meeting you, too
And Skye, 'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me
Eternally grateful, really
(into the bathroom mirror) 'm going to throw up
(
) can't imagine anyone else playing Genna
(sanguine) Really
- The doorbell rings
There are two closed doors on either side of the room
The bed shows no sign of consummated sex
Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed
Who the fuck can be here at this time
It's not even seven
Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on
Oh Jesus, who else is always early for Christ's sake
Sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door
(') Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors
'll say as little as possible
Sally exits the bedroom
For a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply
love you
- The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere
and   are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door
Their argument is inaudible
They're in their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed
She's stunning, genetically nervous
Jerry carries a briefcase
She's got the gift
Sally opens the door
Hugs and buses them, hello
know we're early, we're so early
Sorry
You have to sign your taxes anyway
(a grin) Of course we do
(to Judy) We have to sign our taxes
(kisses Judy; all charm) You can never be too early or too thin
Happy anniversary, buddy
Six months ago, who would have thunk it
Jerry hugs Joe
(sotto) Well, not me, to be honest
(sotto) Don't fuck up again
It's got a ripple effect
Sally suffers, we all suffer
(offers) We have a gift
Thanks, 'll take that
Champagne
Lovely
Joe moves toward the kitchen
(a moment, to Sally) We closed
Fantastic
(takes his hand) Out here
They step out onto the porch
Judy's left alone, unsure whether to follow or not
(finally, to no one, and to no response) The house looks beautiful, are those hydrangeas
She stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer
- Joe officially owns No
4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England
No small doing
love you, you're a genius
Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly
suppose
Sally, that's quite a gift
'm not sure it's in your best interest
adore him
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning
The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat
know
know that
Don't spoil it
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city
We've only been over this how many times
You only made half your quote this year
Well, you're a tower of support
worry because you don't
It's my job
'm feeling guilty
would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground
(direct, simple) We couldn't be on more solid ground
Whatever you say
Listen,  love you
Otis is barking
(
) Otis
No barking
(touched) And Joe's huge in Europe
He's like a rock star in London
His novels sell millions
Not millions
He's directing now
They're paying him scale
The  catches sight of Joe behind them
He moves through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of glasses and Judy in tow
He gets huge advances on his novels
He's going back to that
You know how he hates it here
There's still time to undo this
(kisses his cheek) We'll be fine
(re: barking dog) Did you invite them
The Roses
And of course they said yes
That was the plan
And you're thrilled to have them
Whatever you say
Did you tell Joe to behave
Yes
Did he promise
Scout's honor
Before  forget
(pulls a novel from his briefcase) Put it on the bookshelf
She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of You're out of your mind
Just do what  say, alright
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do
Beats a lawsuit
- Joe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly uncomfortable with each other
(to fill the silence, conspiratorial grin) love gifts
What did you guys get us
(chokes on the champagne) Nothing that can't be exchanged
Oh
Well
Good
Congratulations on the deal
How exciting
Is Sally doing Sally
mean it's Sally
The character that's based on Sally
The character that's based on Sally in the book
The novel
No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead
Oh my God, 'm a huge Skye Davidson fan
She's very beautiful
Yes, she is
(trying harder) But  am right, yes
She's based on Sally
It's a novel
Still
Well
Let's drop it
Yes
'm not much of a reader, but  do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes
Mostly non-fiction
Did you read the new Styron
No
It's very good
(a moment) understand you won the Booker Prize
Yes  did
(another moment) Is your script much like the novel
Jerry says it's very good
But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this
" You know
sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all
Because, we come with expectations
and of course, we know where we're going
Don't you find
Don't  find what
don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long
Not long
(benign) Don't be silly
Joking
Yes  know
started to say started to say Joe that -- Do  put you off
You manage to throw me off balance adore you
And  you
But 'm always afraid 'll say something stupid
Ah
And so  always manage to, do you see
Like the book/script thing, do you see
Mmm hmmm
and   are there with their children -  and - eight and six respectively
Carrying gifts and totes with toys and changes
Jerry and Sally have gathered them up and ushered them in
You know Jerry
Yes, of course
'm the wife
We've met
(hugs her) You,  know
(to Evie) Hey, beautiful girl
She picks up the four-year-old, swings her around
Jack hides behind his father's legs
(a grin) Jack
Jack, you promised
The little boy comes out from behind his father's legs, covers his eyes with his hands
(sings) Happy anniversary to you
We're glad Joe came home
Don't split up again
Cause we like the food
Much laughter and clapping
(in the archway) Jack
Did you compose that yourself
Absolutely
Had a little help
Absolutely not
It has your ring
'm not that good
Cal, my wife Judy
Nice to meet you
think we've met, actually
No
At another one of these things
No,  don't think so
(to Cal) Congratulations on the Academy Award
Great performance
Really warranted
He thought so
Sally always manages to get robbed
(a mortified grin) Enough about me
Evie has a little something for you
Evie shakes her head
(') You do
(even) don't think so
Since when are you so shy
(her mother's daughter) Never
(bright smile) Honey, we have gifts for you and all sorts of surprises
Where is America know she's here somewhere
Joe reaches for the gifts
'll take them
No,  have a little talking to do with America
Privately
'll find her
(to Sophia) In the kitchen
Who'd like to go and find Otis
Me
guess
The infamous dog
He's the best dog in the world
(to Judy) They're both coming tonight
Not my idea
Ours
It's Jerry's worst idea
What's that
The neighbors from hell
The kind that lay in wait
'd rather move actually
Wouldn't
(to Sally) Wouldn't
(small smile) Yes
(to the kids) Okay
Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum
Joe goes off with the children to find Otis
Cal sits at the piano, plays
-   - Joe holds Evie in one arm
Jack stands beside him, holds his hand
and   face him across the threshold -- the
She's in her late twenties - and beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck
Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company, swallowing resentment and a little self righteous
Well, hello you two
(putting Evie down; to Jack) These are the people who live next door
Say hello
Jack does
(') And close the door, Jack
Because if we leave it open, Otis will run out and you know what will happen then
Uh, uh
He'll run next door into their backyard and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner
Is it a pitbull
(not amused) No, actually
(to Jack) Oh whatever
We don't want that to happen, do we
No
It's a rottweiler, actually
(to Jack) don't think our rottweiler is in any danger, Jack
Well, Jack and  are very relieved
thought this was a party
Are we going to talk about the dog thing
Please, Ryan
(kisses her cheek and shakes his hand) No, he's absolutely right
You're absolutely right, Ryan
Dog talk must be banned
Canine conversations are completely discouraged
it's really good of you to join us
Can  get you a drink
Not for me, thanks
An awkward moment
(checks with Ryan) Something soft
Right away
Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan
'm sure, yes
Sally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them super-friendly
Hi
Monica and Ryan
Sally
Yes
And you've met Joe
Yes
(a deep breath) Well, so glad you decided to come
We could hardly say no
Oh
Joe slips the coke into Monica's hand
(') (takes the gift) Thank you
This was so unnecessary hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much
We keep him in at night
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes
have it on tape
You're keeping a record, are you
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work
Ryan
(to Joe) 'm sure you understand
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis
Well today it was Otis
And you should keep him away from our yard
Because Sheila will defend herself
Ryan
(cuts off response from Joe; to Ryan) Are you working on a new book
(caught short; flattered) Well, yes, actually
He always has two or three going
Really
Joe can't manage more than one at a time
With huge gaps in between
and   wave from the door
Clair's arms are full of presents
Mac carries three video cameras under his arm
He's got Otis by the collar
You lose this
(re: Otis) Ah there's our snookums now
Yes, well, but  haven't won a Booker either
Or the Whitebread
The gate was open
Well, not yet
(she reacts to Mac) The gate was open
It's taken care of
think Ryan needs a new publisher think he's outgrown him
They're just not doing their job
silence
Awkward smiles go all around
Hors d'oeuvres or something
Yes, great
It's a beautiful house
Thank you
understand you're an interior decorator
Yes
so wish 'd known
Well, whoever did this is amazing
did it
(comes on them with the Forsythes in tow) She rarely cops to it
(kisses Sally's cheek) Otis is home
(re: the gifts) Where can  put these
Sally takes the gifts from her
(') What a fucking day
We only just got a sitter
don't know her from fucking Adam
She could be a serial killer
'm going to have to call every ten minutes
You have to let me give out the number
Of course
She already has
It's alright, isn't it
Of course it's alright
Clair is a hovering mother
'm not
This is Monica and Ryan
Mac and Clair
Clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make their way down the hall
(a wide professionally ingratiating smile) So nice
And for us
Truly
Well
You will never know
(pleased) Oh
(to Sally) have a four-thirty call
So we may have to leave early
Why didn't you bring him
What
Why didn't you bring him
(searches) He's allergic
Oh
To dander
Otis
Oh
Didn't  say
Well, probably
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know
He's got eyelashes yay long
They must be a foot long
The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up
(muted) Oh
The Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe
Next to someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers
Clair's not in the least put off by them
She manages to smile at them inclusively from time to time
So they tell me
Not soon enough, of course
(kisses her cheek) How are you, Sal
You look fantastic
It changes your life, you know
baby
It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it
Doesn't it, Mac
You can't be the center of your own world, anymore
(as grounded as Clair isn't) It's an object lesson in grace
(on seeing Cal Gold on the back porch) Wow
Look who's here before me
My leading man is on time for once
(at the piano) Those who can't direct
Fuck you
Mac and Cal sit on the porch sharing a joint
Cal is maybe the only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out his most arcane quotes on occasion
Are those our dailies
You're totally outrageous
It's their anniversary
Is nothing sacred
Well
so
how am
(laughing) Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the kitchen scene
liked the third take, the accidental disaster with the silverware
Nothing you do is accidental
The  spots   through moving bodies
Tall, beautiful, centered grace
She's got a Leica around her neck
drops her two large camera bags on the floor
Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them
Joe sweeps her up to his arms
It's an intimate, appreciative embrace
Theirs was a mid-30s relationship, certainly pre-Sally
Maybe his first important love
(re: the cameras) 'm the hired help
(affectionate) Fuck you
never put myself in harm's way
Anymore
No, not anymore
Happy anniversary, scout
Sophia bursts from the kitchen
Oh my God
America told me your neighbors are coming
And here they are
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over
Because you're both, so, what - introspective
And you should have done it ages ago
'm Sophia Gold
(rescuing Sally) Come meet my husband, Cal
Cal Gold
The very one
And you are
Monica and Ryan
Rose
Sorry
Ryan Rose
Yes
She shakes his hand
He's amazed at the solid grip
He's a novelist
Ah
Like Joe
Hmm
(to Sally) Where are my kids
In the guest room
've laid out a paint table for them
hope they're watercolors
Nevermind
(to Monica) Would you like to meet my husband
It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her chest
'd be thrilled
Then he'll be thrilled
She ushers them toward the living room
(re: Sophia, appreciative) She's such pure evil
Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest
Thanks for coming
Happy anniversary
You're a good match, you two
(to Joe) Can you help me with this stuff
(re: one of her bags) That for us
What a nose
You missed your calling
Can  open it
(defers) Sally
Please
He's impossible
Go on then
Joe rips open the gift
It's a framed black and white of Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch
It's clear which photos in the house are Gina's
It's a breathtaking print, an amazing caught moment
All light and shadow
touching study
(') (respectful of the talent) It's beautiful, thank you so much
Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him
Kisses her
love you,  Gina Taylor
Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous
feels intrusive
Aware that Gina got there first
Knew him when
And always captures something naked and vulnerable in his face
: - In the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons and glue and baubles
Two child size chairs either side
Empty, the table hasn't been touched
Evie stands against the far wall
She wears a helmet and is surrounded by toy suction arrows
The arrows make a perfect outline of her head and body
Jack stands three feet away, bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot
Cal is at the piano, charming the neighbors
Judy chats with Mac
Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter
Sally joins Cal on the piano stool
Sophia moves to Clair on the couch, kisses her cheek
You look so well, Clair
wraith
(pleased) You think so
've been working out a lot since the baby
And 've been working
And that takes it's toll, you know
'm glad that's all over for me
Don't you miss it
Never
Really
Not for a second
Cal can have all that
Really
So where is young Jonah
With a sitter
We have a sensational sitter
Jonah's really comfortable with her
You know, a second mom sort of
Like part of the family
Amazing with kids
She inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it beeps
She jumps
What is that thing
So this sitter can always reach me
'm still not used to leaving him
You should have brought him
(shrugs) Dander
He's allergic
Otis
Oh
Do you have any pictures
Pictures
They're always in my tote left my tote in the damn trailer
But
He's Mac all over again
Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet
The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth
Are you the funniest person  know, or what
can't think how you gave it all up, Soph
Sophia sends her a soft, content smile
Otis comes over and nuzzles Clair's knee
(') (freeks) Oh my God, the dog
/ - Clair leads Sally towards the bedroom
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and 'd kind of like to change into something of yours
You know it could be disaster
He's so allergic
It's terrifying
Borrow whatever you like
'll change back before we leave
(pointed) Whatever you like
'm afraid it'll all be too big for you
(a moment) Are you alright, Clair
'm fine
'm fine
Well, 'm a little stressed
And 've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby
'd say it was down
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy
've got a ghastly headache, actually
You want a Tylenol, or something
'd love a Xanex
(a moment) Sally, please don't tell Sophia that 'm not breast feeding
Why would she care
You know Sophia
She's so damned judgemental
And she's so damned
perfect
And so fucking
serene
Just fucking don't tell her
Because you know Mac thinks she's God
And  can feel him comparing
You need to knock off the pills, Clair
Just don't fucking tell her
It's not going to come up
-       - Peter Sellers look-a-like holding a violin case
(opens the door) Panes
How are you
Oh, you know,  am
Has she called
She'll never call again
She called last week to tell me she'll never call again
Where's Sally
(
) Here  am
Panes, my love
Sally starts down the hallway
(') (for Panes; a long supportive hug; a kiss) Good, you brought your violin
want you to play
It's a machine gun
thought 'd kill myself
Are you lovesick
Suicidal
It's much less codependent
Will champagne help
Not enough
Sally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats, drinks, smokes
They all like each other out of habit, if nothing else
Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at the edges of conversation
There's always someone at the piano, and they can all pretty much play
Panes is here
(gives everyone a shy, pained little wave) Oh great
Everyone stops, turns, toasts
Panes
/ (a little late; into silence) Panes
Panes gives them another little wave
Doorbell rings
- Hi
She's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in Joe's film
(his face lights up) Skye
She's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s
You're Joe, aren't you
(nods knowingly) recognized you from the book jacket
Joe grins from ear to ear
Uncharacteristically star struck in front of this beauty
How do you do, Skye
Oh,  love that
(throws arms around him) 'm just great
'm so happy to be here
And  apologize for invading you
And 'm so happy you asked me to
'm so touched
know how private you and Sally are
(uncomfortable) Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends
(genuine) When  read your work  felt that you knew me
Women must tell you that
And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know
am Genna
How many women must tell you that
And the script is wonderful
Wonderful and lean and visual
'm so happy you like it
'm so relieved you said yes, and 'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director
There's a long moment
(finally) think you're my first Goddess
Sally and Panes have been watching from the living room
She's even better looking in the flesh
Really
need a drink
Come hide with me
- America and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally come through
Oh, Jesus, Panes
can't,  can't believe that bitch is in my house
You don't know she's a bitch
She's all over him, are you blind
It could be worse
How
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours
Fuck you, Panes
You see, that's worse
just wanted tonight to be with the people we love
Like your business managers
They're not just our business managers, Panes
Oh, okay, forgive me
Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake
Exactly what  mean
It's all ruined
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake
It's one of your parties
don't want it to be just one of our parties
"How are you really doing, Panes
" "Lousy, thank you, 'm falling apart
" Like the last time
No
No, not like the last time
She was the rest of my life
Like the last time
wasn't finished
Okay
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes
hate you being alone
Why don't you stay with us for a while
" "'d love to, thanks
" It's our anniversary, Panes
didn't hear me say tonight
We're just feeling our way back
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here
" You know it's true
Skye bursts into the kitchen, Sally and Panes freeze
(stuck) Oh my God, sorry
'm interrupting
'll be right out
(over Sally) Come on in
'm in the same room with Sally Nash
Oh my God
You're my icon
've been watching your films since  was a little girl
Like, four years ago  followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself
Joe enters the kitchen, watches
don't think  ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center
Whatever, do you remember
've seen all your movies
When  was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie
They said you were too real
worship you
And couldn't be more flattered, because know the part 'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman
Joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine and leaves
(') And 'm overwhelmed
And  want to do it justice
And  hope we can spend time together
And 'm gushing
It's my worst quality
Not at all
Oh my god
've been so rude
'm Skye Davidson
Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers
No, never
(overlapping Panes) Everyday
'm Levi Panes
Will you excuse us, Skye
It's time for Sally's meds
Panes steers Sally out of the kitchen
It's nice to meet you
again
They go
Skye is left in the kitchen alone
(to America) Oh my God, she remembers me
- Sally and Panes start down the hall in search of privacy
(under her breath) Thank you, thank you, thank you
(on the way down; a dream in white) My God, your wardrobe is incredible
It took me forever to decide
Oh, and found Dr
, thank you
You saved my life
She moves past them
(a moment; sotto) Shit
(re: the dress) 'd cut off her red wine if  were you
Shit
It's my Galiano
What does that mean
About five thousand dollars
With my discount
The  follows them into the bedroom
They flop down onto the bed and into
- More guests have arrived
Sophia and her children play with Otis
America and Rosa pass round hot hors d'oeuvres
Joe places Gina's photo on the mantelpiece
(regards him) Directing suits you
'm not so sure
Look again in three months
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden
Ow
Gina, you obviously need to get fucked
Just did
Jealous
When does he graduate high school
(laughing) Oh, very jealous
Joe laughs
(') saw Lucy when  was in London, she seems okay
It's hard to tell with her
Shit,  forgot to call her back
She's off on a trip somewhere
Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold
In Cheyene Walk
Lucy's going to have a meltdown
Oh, 'm so sorry
should have damn well bought it
Well, we can't afford it
The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and 'm getting paid next to nothing
Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting
Four million
Yeah, but  hear she gives a mean blow job
You really need to be fucked
- So how are you really doing, Panes
Why don't you go fuck yourself
(laughs) No
Really
For real
Really
'm worried about your Galiano
(slaps him) You're a shit
No, really, five thousand with your discount
He rolls out from under her swat, she misses him
(') You hurt, you know
You're stronger than you think
They lie prone across the bed, about a foot apart
Contemplating the floor
(') (finally) How's the movie going
Your movie
You are making a movie, aren't you
Yes
Fine
That's it
Yes
Fine
don't want to talk about it
Why not
never like to talk about my work
Alright
Well, that's something new
No
Not something new
Well, something's wrong
Nothing's wrong
It's great, okay
Having the time of my life
Mac's a fantastic director
And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said
And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah
(a moment; little smile) Um
Happy for you
Thanks
So tell me, how's it going
Oh you know
No doubts
No second thoughts
Am  a monster
You're my best friend
That's not an answer, is it
Yes, you're a monster
She takes his hand
Sounds of the party come from below
(a moment) Thank you, Panes
You don't need to thank me
(another moment) We're going to have to go back out there

But neither of them moves

Let me

Monica
And you know our friends, how
We live next door
Oh
You're them
Excuse me
We've heard lots about you
(lost) You have
- Judy Adams lost herself a little, steps outside, sits alone
(smiles over at Ryan) Hi
Hi
little close in there
Yup
- small, narrow room
Not much more than an alcove
With space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with CDs
The topmost shelf is a line of record albums
Joe's picking through the CDs
Monica wanders in from the living room, toting a glass of champagne
watches him for a moment
Your Eames table is incredible
And the &
just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red
You're an interior decorator, right
(nods) Sally did all this herself
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me
So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic
And it keeps changing
(somehow at a loss) Mmm
It says something about the two of you maybe
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux
(re: champagne) see you've moved up from the soft stuff
Oh, yes
You know Ryan's been sober eight years
And it's difficult if
you know
It's better if  don't
Uh-huh
'm a little nervous, so
Oh
little out of my element
No you're not
Well, yes
Yes, in fact
little on the outside, yes
And there's been all this friction
Hm
don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating
Very well put
think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort
What
But you're very private people
You know, there's a kind of elitism
(pissed) Elitism
The wrong word, maybe
Delete that
And, you know, the dog barks incessantly
And you know, he really does not
And Ryan works at home
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive
And 've come this close to suing you for harassment
And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you
Her eyes well with tears
(') Oh shit
'm sorry
Well, that's what Ryan thought
was more generous, actually
Oh shit
'm sorry
'm a total fucking maniac
Delete all that, okay
spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife
Oh shit
get pissy sometimes
Much worse than Otis
Otis doesn't bite
It's just,  really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot
We live in a canyon
We hear dogs barking at night, too
And it's not Otis
Monica starts to laugh
Alright
It appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne
Easy tiger
Alright
Please don't tell Ryan 'm drinking
Scout's honor
(grins) 'll be your best friend
She feels they've bonded
She pulls a well-thumbed copy of Joe's novel from her purse
(') Would you sign it for me
(digs for a pen) 'm sure this is inappropriate
We're way past inappropriate
Monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest and moving toward her throat
Manages not to burp
(as he signs it) 'll treasure this
He moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals
need to leave you now
will treasure this

Ryan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted

You think you could sign it for us
Absolutely
You always wonder where your books end up
Why don't we use it
Good idea
There's not a chance in hell anyone will get it
Down by Law
Who's not going to get that in fifteen seconds

Teammates: Gina, Cal, Clair, Skye, Monica, Jerry and Mary-Lynn

- Evie and Jake run along the side of the house
Behind the glass walls the  catches adults moving through the living room and into the dining room
- Most everyone's moved through to the dining room
The table is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food
Candles, flowers
, newly arrived, carrying a miniature furball, of questionable breed, is first in line and halfway around the table
She feeds "Anouk" bits from the table enroute
(barely looks up as Sally comes into the room) So who won
(raises her hand) triumph
When did you get here
Ten, fifteen minutes ago
Why didn't you come in
hate the sight of blood
You guys don't take prisoners
(charmed by the bundle in Astrid's arm) Oh how sweet
The furball bares teeth and growls
She's insanely jealous
-    - She slips another morsel into Anouk's mouth, murmurs baby talk, allows the dog to take a bit of chicken from between her teeth
That's revolting, Astrid
People sit in small groups, eating dinner, catching up
Latecomers, bunch around Joe
Sam Feckman, an actor also in Mac's film, holds forth
Panes finds room next to Skye
Is there space here
Yes
Do you need anything else
No, no thanks
He sits on the floor along side her
They eat in silence for a moment
(finally) was impressed
Oh
The charades
Thank you
That was my clue
Oh
The Shostakovich
Really
(does Seller's Indian) Oh yes, indeed
That was my clue, you see
Skye giggles appreciative response
(') (still Indian) So you are well acquainted with this Shostackovich, as am
Other arrivals pick their way through bodies and plates
Walk over to Sally and kiss her cheek
Joe and Gina and Jeffrey sit off to the side
hate the idea of some one else living in it
Joe pulls Sally to him and wraps his arms around her
(') Sally's never even seen it
thought we'd raise our kids there
Sally held in Joe's arms, smiles
The cat who ate the canary
(') Have  ever told you how Lucy and nearly squashed each other getting into the dumb waiter
// Yes
/Often

The dumb waiter was our
Escape hatch

And Dad was having a go about the garden
Something was misplanted
Not properly watered
Whatever
(to Gina) You know how he gets
Well, he went absolutely bonkers
Lucy and  were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and  didn't fit any more
It was almost fatal
And that, my dear friends, is the day
/ realized  had become a man
Ta da
You're not a man, Joe
You're a boy
(childishly) So
(laughs) love you, Joe Therrian
(at a loss, small) Me too
Sophia watches from across the living room
- Astrid squeezes in next to Sally, on her second portion of everything
She allows Anouk to nibble from her plate
You're not upset that  brought the dog
Would it make a difference
Anouk isn't like a dog, really
More like a small person
So is there anyone here for me
No one looks new
(fixes on Ryan) Who's that
You don't want that
It's married and it's the neighbor
Oh  think he's cute
How's the marriage part working out
You're fucking desperate
Like you didn't know
(re: Skye) Who invited the bimbo
One guess
The  stays close on the cake as America wheels the cart into the living room
The top of it sports Sally and Joe's faces on either side of Otis, a detailed edible photograph
There are three sixes across the top
There's a freed up pathway
Cal taps the side of his champagne glass with a fork
(re: the cake as it comes in) Part of our gift
Honey
(clinks his glass) Here, here
Clair picks up discarded dinner plates
Otis takes care of those behind couches, under tables
The gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace
Sally is on the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against him
His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against hers
There's a    through speeches, gifts, entertainment
Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very funny, impromptu something with their kids
Panes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage
Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall
There are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty, funny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent separation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a baby
Panes plays a piece on the violin
Someone else sings
And finally
- She looks out at the guests
They look back at her
wasn't prepared to say anything
'm honored to be a part of tonight
To be in the same room, with my favorite living actress
The  barely catches the grimace on Mac's face; Clair elbows him
(sings out) Still living
And my favorite novelist
And all their amazing -- (sings out) And talented
Friends
And talented friends
This room is so filled with love
(sings out) And the winner is
Let the woman speak
And  brought a gift of love
gift that is love
She pulls an envelope from behind her back, which she's decorated in flower-child fashion; it harkens back to the sixties, puts it into Sally's hand, kisses her cheek
(') (tears up) Happy anniversary
Thank you for making me a part of it
(pours the pills into her hand) What are they
(pleased, surprised) Dolphins
Great
It's ecstasy, Sal
think there are sixteen there
(kisses Skye) This is an amazing present
What a sweetheart you are
Skye's pleased she's made him happy
(regards Joe; to Skye) What a sweetheart you are
pall descends on the party
There's a   of the group
Nobody quite knows what to do
There's torn wrapping paper all over the room
(Anouk still in her lap) It's late
(kisses Anouk) You sleepy baby
There are awkward excuses
Some of the guests leave
- The core group remains
think we should all take it tonight
Everyone's staying, stays
No driving
That's the rule
love you Sally-Mae
You're going to have a fabulous time
'm worried about my spine
'm very worried about my brain and my spine
(laughs) Oh honey, you're gonna love it
(to her Look) Sophia's going to do it, Panes is going to do it, trust me
- Cal carries the envelope into the room
(on seeing America, bursts into) America, America God shed his light on me
He dances her around the kitchen, he picks up the sterling dish, arranges the pills, carries them back to the living room
- Ecstasy is passed from guest to guest
Ryan expects Monica to abstain
(his glare; simply) want to try it, Ryan
- The drug has begun to take effect
The party is now in full swing
Music is playing, and Sophia and Clair are dancing
People are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits
Judy floats around the pool on an inflatable dog
Sally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round the pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation
Joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to everyone, emceeing the event
Everyone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside Monica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others
love it here
Don't you love it here, Ryan
love it here
And  love tonight
And  love these people
And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan
(touches her own cheek, ever so lightly; shivers against the sensation) Utterly fantastic
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain
She didn't pull that out of thin air
It causes brain damage
You'd better drink a lot of water
Do you want to go home, Ryan
Yes
think you should then
You should look in on Sheila
'm not going to leave you alone
They're really nice people, Ryan
They're like us
They're nothing like us
think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan
But  think you're really nice people
She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek
He stiffens
Are you making an ass of yourself
There's only you, Ryan
You know what, Ryan
You're beautiful
love you so much
You need
don't need a drug
You need a good review and you'll be fine
The whole color of the world will change, mark my words
She gets up
Ready to go
'm going to go get my swimsuit
do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry
(turns back) Ryan, you're a great man
The  follows Monica along the side of the pool
She passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair
The  stays at the pool
Clair tears off Sally's Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the pool
This water is great
(swimming past her) Wanna dive for a baton
- She stands at the side of the pool
Okay, 'm about to throw five colored batons in the water
Then 'm going to count to three, and then you may start diving
'm playing too
The red one is ten extra points
Ready
(she throws batons in) One, two, three, go
There is a melee of diving and screaming
: It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool
Voices drift up from below
Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing around one another
You got your
What
Oh yeah, the camera man
They gave me a list
And you got Skye Davidson
Pretty big leagues for a first timer
Do you even like movies
Not particularly
Weird, isn't it
God 'm rally up
Do you feel anything yet, Mac
Kind of
Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends
And great 's  could give them a call for you
Thanks, Mac
(regards him) And thanks for being so supportive about all this
(throws arm around him, hugs him close) really love you, you know
Hey, 'm happy for you, buddy
Anything can do
(lets go of Mac) God,  really need to jump about a bit
(begins jumping) How's your film going
It's going
It's going
And how's the diva doing
Well, you know
good days, bad days
meant Sally
meant Sally
(stops jumping, studies him) Oh
You're serious
(throws and arm around him) No
No
(a beat) Let me tell you something
Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood
The sleep depravation alone
Oh don't
Everyone says that
Sally's taken Gina's photograph of them from the mantelpiece in the living room, and looks for a spot for it on the shelves
Sophia is studying the CDs very intently
They are both bopping to the music
(re: the photograph) Isn't this a fabulous picture
Yes
She's such a great photographer
Hm
So where should  put it
thought it was okay where it was
It's much more personal in here
notch above the storage room
We're always in here
(regards the photo) She really gets him, doesn't she
The both of you
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she
She's a genius
So how much do you hate her
Big time
They both laugh, then
Well,  don't trust her
never have
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes
You don't trust anyone
(a moment simply) trust you
Oh Soph
You'll hate it in London
It's wet and miserable
medical hellhole Sally
It's socialized
Beds in the corridors
Terrible plumbing
And the food sucks,  know
You are not having your baby in London
You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr
Milton Cohen
Period
And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit
There's no excuse for pain like that
Sophia
'm not even pregnant
Well good
Thank God
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone
Oh honey, let's
They've started to walk through the house
(stops short; turns to her) What do you mean, thank God
Well, are you sure about this baby thing
It's not the ticking clock shit, is it
No, no, not at all
mean 've still got plenty of time
Don't
mean still have a good six years, whatever
We could have three kids yet, if we wanted
And  know 've always said never wanted kids, and  didn't
but this year,  really, truly, feel ready
Honey, 'm not worried about you
You are going to be a fantastic mom
Not an issue
pressed you, remember
Joe, on the other hand, is a different story
(laughs) Oh Soph, Joe loves kids
Joe wants kids
Joe thinks he needs kids
He wants playmates
Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know  love him
But he's not going to be a good father
He's just not parenting material
Hey, let's sit down
bet the rug feels really nice against your skin
Sally drops out of frame
Don't try and change the subject
(sitting, joining Sally) Oh God, it feels great
He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable
And Cal's this massive adult
Cal knows who he is
Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight
You weren't exactly horrified
(laughing) don't have a drug problem
Neither does Joe
His sister does
Big time
And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- 'll e-mail you the article
Sally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide
(') You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally
It's only five months since Joe came back
(getting up) We're fine
We're great
We're having a baby and we're moving to London
(following her) Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut
Not nice
Not kind
Ha
Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel
Why are you doing this
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic
(tearing up) But  am a possessive, fragile neurotic
(also tearing up) No you are not
You're Sally Nash
Listen to me, you're Sally Nash
You're my best friend and  love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child
"Oh now 'm a novelist, oh now 'm a director
" English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway
They hug a bit weepy
(') He's always one step removed, always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else, something more intoxicating, and  don't mean drugs love him, Sal, but he's a child
He's not ready
(a choked sob, tears well and fall) Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have kids
You can't stick your head in the oven
You can't take a handful of Percoden if you want to, or slit your wrists
You can't do yourself in
Kids rob you of that option
Trust me
(a beat) Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really good
- Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance by herself at the far end
Joe has his hand on Cal's chest
Cal is stroking Joe's hair
Isn't Skye amazing
She's got great tits
She's a constant surprise
And you've only just met
Yeah,  know
But she's only twenty seven and
(taps his head) The wisdom
She's an old soul
She knew that Shostakovich thing
Did you notice
Absolutely
And she's got great tits
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits
i can't wait to work with her
The camera loves her
great actress
With great tits
'm going to ask her if can touch them
He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by
- Clair is climbing up the pool steps
Has anyone seen Mac
(pointing further up the property) saw him wandering over there,  think
How're you feeling, Clair
'm so good
She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband
Poor Mac
It's been a bit of a struggle
'm sure Sally's told you
No, what
The movie
Oh, she's really enjoying it
think
Is Mac okay
don't know what's going on
don't care to guess
Mac's really unhappy
She isn't there, that's all
She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue
Who, Sally
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script
She can barely get the lines out
There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take
know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe
Something's gone
You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you
It's gone think she's scared
And that's death
still think she sails above the rest
mean not like her early films
But those were all such great directors
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe
He's a woman's director
And nothing's happening
Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship
But it was discussed
He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place
What
Hey, listen,  love her
She's Sophia's best friend
(to Joe's stare) never said any of this, alright
'll deny it on the stand
(into the silence) You guys are gonna have kids
That is so great
Maybe that's what this is all about
Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore
You know adults don't do this for a living
You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough
Sophia knew that intuitively
Look at Clair
Clair's a mess
(throws an arm around him) Make sure she gets the epidural
Forget that natural childbirth shit
Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be
"Life is but a walking shadow
poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more
" And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film
(stares at him) Leo
Any thoughts on casting yet
(regards him) Leo
It was out to Jude Law
Jude passed
Well,  can't make any promises, and of course  haven't read the script but loved the novel
when are you shooting
October-ish
have a small window of time
Leo
Leo's twenty-eight, Cal
Scratch the two, write in a four
Scratch the two, write in a four
You've got a lot of fucking gall
Thirty nine
Five years ago,  was at the party, remember
Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room
He blows her a kiss
She kisses her finger tips and puts her hand flat against the window pane
-   - She's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic
Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground
The floor is a heap of discarded ideas
She pulls on jeans and a t-shirt
Very similar to what Skye is wearing
She sits a moment on the floor
The sounds of the party below are muted
(
) Oh Warren, that was awful,  can't sing
The  stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice
- Mac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at the television screen - watching his dailies
At some point he drops his head
Stops watching
'
(
) You sing like a bird
'
(
) bird with dropsy
caged bird
That hasn't long to live
'
(
) You seem so alive up there
Sally stands at the open door
Stunned
Watches Mac watch her
Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye
More critical than Mac's could ever be
( ) was faking it
've been feeling caged for sometime
Funny, huh
(moans) No, it's not
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
-   - She backs up into the corridor mortified
Leans against the wall
'
(
) It's preposterous
You're free to do whatever you like
'
Yes, well, we'll see won't we
(
) Jesus Christ
(a deep breath) Well
wow
- Clair's started down the hallway, reaches the landing
Sally rushes into the guest bedroom to avoid her
Clair, just missing Sally, wanders into the dailies room
- Mac
Oh there you are
What are you doing, honey
No more work
Don't you feel breezy
'm in mourning
You can cut around it, whatever it is
You always do
Not this time
It's always not this time
If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone
She walks in front of the television set, blocks it with her body, switches it off
(an observation) You don't have any clothes on
How nice for everybody
Come swimming
The water's glorious
(re: the film) You'll fix it
You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas
Or  won't
can't help her
'm out of my depth
Things always look much worse in the morning
don't know how to make her funny
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about
You won't care who's in your damn movie
(really stoned) What what's about
wait, what are you talking about
Jack and Evie are asleep across the bed
Sally sits at the edge of the bed, regards the sleeping children
Reaches over and smoothens the tangled, tousled hair
Studies their faces
- ' Monica sits on the steps of the pool
She looks frightened, uncomfortable
Are you okay
don't think so
feel
feel a bit funny
Let's go for a walk
He puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool
- 've never done this before
Oh
It's easy
You just put one foot in front of the other
That's a good girl
'm a little in the puke zone
(giving her some water) Here, drink this
Drink lots of water
(puts the bottle in her hand) Hold on to this
Take deep breaths
Nice and slow
(sits her down; produces a lollipop) Would you like a lolly
What am , five
You're never too old for a lolly
'm having one
(a grin) Okay
He pulls out another one
Lemon or raspberry
Lemon
Lemon it is
The two suck on their lollipops for a moment
(finally) Ryan's really angry with me
think he's really angry with me too
(laughs) It's really not the same thing
(a moment) He was really nicer when he drank
'm sorry
Eight years, though
That's quite an accomplishment
That's a lot of those
Medallions
lot of cakes
Yes
And he doesn't smoke
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know
It's gotten much better
How long have you been married
Nine
nine, yes
Nine years, just about
You must have been a baby
Oh yes
Nineteen
just
(a moment) 'm cold
Come here
Joe holds Monica
(a moment) That's very nice
like you
'm so glad
You know,  recognize that passage in your book
The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre
Sorry
know you changed it to a bookstore
And the color of my hair
But the moment was exactly the same
The same, you know, dynamic
And almost verbatim, wasn't it
(humors her) Yeah, it was
For a writer nothing's sacred
(thinks a moment) No, nothing at all
think it's great that  made an impression at all, you know
Joe regards the open trusting face, is touched by it
Leans in, kisses her lips very lightly
and again
Her arms can't make up her mind, whether to come up around him or not
Finally do
(
) Otis
Otis, come
Oh fuck
She appears beside them
(') Someone left the goddamn gate open
Otis got out
Skye and , well the
came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open
Oh for fuck's sake
Nobody uses that gate
(horrified) 'm sorry
(raging) There's a goddamn sign on the gate
'm so sorry
You fucking cow, can't you read
(at a loss) How long ago was it
Stop being such a bitch, Sal
'm so sorry
It was a mistake
This isn't a plot to do in Otis
Don't be so sure
Listen to yourself
(to Monica) Don't worry, it's alright
We'll find him
(to Sally) What's wrong with you
(re: Monica) She left the fucking gate open
Well he can't have gone far
Can't have gone far
He's like a greyhound
He could be miles away
He'll find his way back
There are fucking coyotes out there
(calming) Sally, calm down
We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical
Monica retreats, backs off a step or two
Fuck you
Or shitty
Otis
: - America and Rosa are cleaning up
Ryan hangs around chatting
How long have you worked for the Therrians
(shrugs, polite but annoyed) long time
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence
Oh yes
Did you know the contractor
Very well
Was it a contractor
It's the way they do things
To code
Her back is to him
She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and the Spanish equivalent of "who is this wanker
" (') Did you see permits
Did he have a license
You should talk to Mr
Joe
Monica bursts into the room
Ryan, you've got to come
You've got to help me find the dog
let their dog out
We need to find the dog
You're not serious
left the gate open and Otis got out
He could get hit by a car
God willing
We have to find the dog, Ryan
Why
(regards him) Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around
(desperate) Because, God help you if something happens to that dog
Excuse me
All the ugly phone calls
We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan
(a beat) They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the
- Panes and Skye search the canyon for Otis
They both carry lanterns
Otis
Shostakovich identified with the Jew
He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov
Otis, come
Andre Zhdanov
How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky
'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know
Do Peter Sellers again
(a la Sellers) Otis you crazy dog
Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon
My people are very hungry
just did a movie about Bob Yar, played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko
Exactly
So  dug it, and  did a lot of research
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich
Yeah
Would you, like, marry him
If he were still alive, maybe
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich
(smiling) Are you asking me to marry you
No, 'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are
(laughing) Very
Oh good, 'm worse
Are you really twenty-two
Who told you that
No
'm twenty
(lops off two years) Five
- Sally and Joe have lanterns
Panes and Skye are up ahead
We hear them calling for Otis
Otis
(on her heels) Otis
Otis, good boy, come here
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
This is a nightmare
We should have kept him upstairs
It was done
When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door
It was done
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it
But  guess that's what interrupted
Jesus, Sally
You are a medical miracle
The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier
Yeah, let's talk about that
You seem to be rather an expert
don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties
Rave parties
That's so typical - you would think it was called rage
Perfect
What else don't  know about, Joe
Let's get really clear here
Sally, so  took a few pills
went out dancing
tried to forget how upset was about splitting up with you haven't lied to you
told you about the people 've slept with
just didn't mention the few occasions  took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental  knew 'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me
Sally, we're back,  love you
Trust that
Please let's not do this
Otis
Come
Good boy
Come
Otis
'm not sure we understand that word in the same way
Love
You walked out on a five year marriage
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love
It's whether we can live together
like this
All the time
It's not like this all the time
want anyone else
No
Do  want to be with you for the rest of my natural life
'm trying
And how hard it hit
Just stop right there, Sally
We've been through this
You've been through it
That's how you love people
When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit
And second
You want to talk about bullshit
Lucy called you three times this week
She's a fucking mess, Joe
Your sister is a fucking mess
She needs you
talk to her more than you do
That is not true
It is true
You know how you love, Joe
You dedicate a book to someone
Every novel 've had published in every language 've dedicated to Lucy
Right
And when was the last time you spoke to her
Joe is silent
(') And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part
Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me
'm an actress
It's about our marriage for fuck's sake
Everybody knows that
It's a novel
About me
Who the fuck do you think you are
The part of Genna is not just about you
It's about every woman 've ever loved in my entire life
Including my mother
The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally
What are you saying
Hello
Last birthday was
don't look my age, Joe
Sally,  have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it
And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently
It's a shit novel anyway
Well there you go
let you off the hook
You're one goddamn lucky actress
Not really
mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch
That's what all our friends think, anyway
Okay
If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made
Because  don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore
And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in
That you don't have
Oh Christ, Sally
Who
Who
Who thinks that
Your director and your co-star of your current movie
Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally
Mac
Mac says it
Cal
Joe doesn't respond
(') Cal, too
Sally, for Christ's sake
Anyone else
This is insanity
(moves toward her) Sally
Don't
Don't push me away
had an abortion two weeks ago
Don't do this
found out  was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me
(threatens) Don't do this
told you when we met  never wanted children
don't want kids in my life
We talked about it
You weren't listening
You changed your mind
wanted you back
Joe slaps her hard across the face
(') You think this was to hurt you
My God, Joe
It isn't about you
What
You aborted our child
'm a monster
Exactly
You're not ready
Don't make allowances
'll never be ready
Some people just shouldn't have children
'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe
did want it for us
But couldn't do it
don't really think can do it
wasn't part of that picture at all, was wasn't part of that decision
Did occur to you at all
It's a fucking farce
It's a fucking farce
How long did you think you could keep it going
You're amazing
Do you have any idea what you've done to us
Yes
'll never forgive you
know
have no idea who you are
They stand their in silence
Joe is devastated
We hear Skye and Panes up ahead calling for Otis
- Of Mac, Judy and Clair
Mac directs an underwater ballet, a la Esther Williams
There's a sequence of    of Mac, smiling, swimming underwater
His image of himself
- compounded by water-weight
The drug has clearly taken effect
Mac opens his mouth to direct his actors, forgets where he is, begins to choke, and cough, is clearly in trouble
Oblivious, Judy and Clair turn somersaults
Mac begins to panic
He is drowning
He begins to sink
Panic gives way to acceptance
Jerry's body flies past , splashes hard into the pool
The  is water-splattered
- Jerry's body sweeps past the lens, smooth and sleek as a Dolphin
He grabs Mac
- Jerry pulls Mac to the surface
Clair and Judy are out of the pool
Jerry drags the limp body from the pool, pumps Mac's chest - it's clear he knows what he's doing
Mac coughs up a load of water
Oh my God
Honey
There's a moment
Mac begins to sob
He's okay, Clair
You wanna give him a little room
(his face against concrete) Man,  must really be stoned
(wipes tears from his face with his hand) Thanks, buddy
Honey
Mac raises his hand, arrests her from coming nearer
'm fine, babe
Give him a minute, Clair
(humiliated) Hey
(looks over at Jerry) Thanks, buddy
Anytime, sport
(wants to say "don't call me sport") Yeah, thanks pal
(helpless) Honey
They all stand around watching him
Mac gets up
'm fine, babe
'm gonna take a little walk
need a minute
Let's forget it
My life didn't pass in front of my eyes
So, it probably wasn't that close
Probably not
(to Jerry) So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what
There's a test, you know
(embarrassed) Forget it, Judy
(still scared) Honey
'll be fine
Really babe
Give me a minute
The  stays on Mac as he walks around the side of the house, down the steps through the basement
- Mac begins to tremble, sob convulsively
He bites down on his lip, clinches his first, tries to pull himself together
(paces; at himself) You're okay
Buck up
Come on, be a man
It could happen to anybody
(tears start again) If you don't stop, 'm going to punch your face in
(another moment) He pulls a towel off a stack and they all fall on the floor
(') Oh shit
can't fucking do anything right
Come on, come on
Oh thank you God for giving me this chance
Thank you for having Jerry here to save me promise  will never cheat on my wife again
will never take drugs again, and  will be a great fucking husband and a loving father
am a great father have terrific friends
am a brilliant director
Well-respected
won a Golden Globe, how 'bout that
Yeah, man, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And God,  will be humble
- Gina regards the photographs she brought for Joe and Sally
She lifts it from the shelf, the phone rings, the machine picks up
' Joe, Joe
It's your Dad
Pick up, Joe
Gina sets the photo on the desk, leans it up against the wall
Joe and Sally's faces stare out of it
(picks up receiver) Harry, hi, it's Gina
Gina
Is everything alright
(a deep intake of breath) Oh my God
When
He's not here
They're out looking for Otis
The dog, Harry
(tears start down her face) love you so much
Lucy's a fighter, she'll make it
Whether she wants to or not
Harry
'm so sorry
will
(writes down the number) Yes  will
Take care, Harry
Bye
She puts down the phone
Stares into Joe's face, looks up at a photo on the wall that she took of Joe and Lucy
Jerry and Judy are making out
Are you my big brave boy
Are you my brave hero
You're crazy baby
love you
Are you my big hard hero
Do you want me to save you
Do you want me to save you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
'm gonna save you
Oh yeah
Let me heal you, baby
(mantra) Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus
Grunts, groans, a scream, a peel of giggles
Oh yeah
- Gina pulls Joe's clothes out of the closet, out of the drawers
There's an overnight bag on the bed
Cal and Sophia lie cuddled on a lounge chair, blissed out, counting the windows of the house
no, no, start again
One, two, three, four
Clair wanders up
She's changed into her own clothes
've lost my husband and my beeper
Have either of you seen either of them
- Clair, Mac, Sophia, Cal and Gina are waiting
The overnight bag rests near the coffee table
No one speaks
There are sounds of the search party approaching
Panes, Skye, Sally and Joe come into the room dogless
What is it
Let's go upstairs, okay
Joe looks from Gina to the others
(') Let's go upstairs
They move out of the room
(on the way upstairs) Is it Otis
Skye and Panes look at the other guests
What happened
Gina closes the door
The suspense is killing me
Harry called
(growing dread) And
(there's now way to say it) Lucy overdosed
(a long moment) But she's alright
She's in
Joe's legs give way
He sort of sits on the floor
(laughs; shakes his head) Stupid tart
She left a note
(realizes the import; to Gina) Fuck you
Tears start down Sally's face
You need to call your dad
Leave us alone right now
've booked you a flight and packed you a bag
You just need to get into a car and go
Would you leave us alone right now
love her too, Joe
Alright, good
Thanks for your trouble
So will you leave Sally and me alone right now
(a shrug; simply) Everybody hates the messenger
Gina exits
(') (to Joe) 'm coming with you
Joe starts to cry
Sally holds him, kisses him, strokes him, rocks him
(inconsolable) don't want you to go
He wipes tears away that start afresh; his nose is running, he wipes that too
(') can't got tonight
don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight
'll be with you
don't want to go tonight
You don't have to
They sit on the floor
Sally soothing, rocking Joe like a baby
(bereft) Stupid tart
- Gina's put up some coffee
Sophia, Cal, Mac and Clair stand around awkwardly
Sally comes into the room
How's he doing
Not good
He's gonna miss his flight
Yeah
Al the guests are a little stunned
Is he not going
booked a flight
He's not going tonight
told his father he'd be on that flight
Well you could tell him otherwise
It was good of you to be all this help
But he doesn't want to go tonight
Jesus, Sally
'm not the enemy
And you're not the wife
It's not a contest
Damn straight
Should  go up
don't think so
You want us to stay
Maybe not
So much for ecstacy, right
They all laugh a little
Let's get the kids
Oh my God, the sitter
(laughs) Oh Clair, you're so
You know
You just put things in perspective
- Joe listens to the answering machine message Lucy left that morning
He plays it again and again
fast forwards to his father's voice
Presses the button
Sits there, stunned
(dials phone, a moment) Hey, Dad
- Cal and Sophia bundle up their sleeping kids
The follows them to the landing as they head downstairs, pass Sally who is coming up
'm going to be home all weekend, call if you need anything
Sally kisses Cal's cheek
Hang in
- Panes and Skye are fucking on Joe and Sally's bed
Sally walks in on them searching for Panes' ear, her best buddy
(resigned) Oh perfect
- Jerry and Judy lie alongside each other, hands propping heads
They aren't privy to anything that's happened
call that a perfect day
perfect night
Damn near
(long moment) And a damn near perfect drug
Hm
We should do it again
Just every once in a blue moon, you know
Hm
(a long moment) You think we should ask them for their landscaper
Hm
Do you like fucking out of doors
Not as a rule
(a long moment) They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns
- Sally stands at the threshold, watches Cal and Sophia load their kids into the car
- Clair and Mac and Gina hug and say their goodbyes to Sally
(kisses Sally; whispers) Take good care of it
Count on it
- Monica and Ryan return from their unsuccessful search
They come through the gate with it's sight:
Monica and Ryan start for the kitchen entrance
-    ' Sally and Joe are alone in the room
They hold each other, weep
(appalled) Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog
(regards them) Don't go in, Ryan
What
Let's just go home, okay
- much embarrassed Panes and Skye enter
Coffee
Sure
'll do it
Panes starts to make some; Skye starts to clean up glasses and ashtrays
You don't need to do that
don't mind
Relax
You've done enough
- We see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house
Jerry has his briefcase in his hand
They are laughing
They enter the kitchen
The camera stays outside
We see them brought up short by the gloom, but hear nothing
- Sally and Joe are at the table, signing their tax returns
Jerry supervising
All is quiet
Judy's sunk into a chair
- Morning's finally come
Light fills the room, empty except for party debris
- It's empty but for glasses, wrapping paper, abandoned dishes of leftover cake
- - The bed is rumpled and indented from the sleeping children
Their drawings and paints strewn all over the floor
and Walls
- - The bed still shows the remains of Panes and Skye's love making
The  moves through the suite into the bathroom
Sally's in the tub
Joe comes into the room in the buff
Can  come in
Sally looks up at the nakedness
Sure
slips into the tub with her
They lie there facing each other
My plane leaves in a few hours
Okay
Do you want me to come with you
(simply) No
Okay
(a moment) Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it
guess
Life gets messy
Ugly messy
But don't understand you
And  don't think ever understood Lucy
don't understand throwing it away
How do you throw all that away
Any of it
want it all
You guys want guarantees want the possibilities
And all kinds of crap comes with that
lot of bad shit
And  think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff
All the good shit
All the surprises
It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it
(a moment) We'd have had amazing children, you and me
We'd have had a ride
You'd have surprised yourself
(regards her) 'll never love anybody else, you know
(a little choked laugh) Me too
That's under lock and key
Me too
Joe reaches out of the tub for gift-wrapped box
He hands it to sally
It's their ritual gift-giving site
Sally opens the gift
Takes out a Calder mobile
Happy anniversary
It's a Calder
know
He's my favorite
know
It's for the baby's crib
Ah
She hands him a small wooden box
He opens it, takes out a set of keys
(') They're the keys to your grandad's flat
Happy anniversary, baby
Oh, Sally Mae
He can't say anymore
know
Will you make love with me
Sure
She reaches out with both arms
- Joe and Sally tenderly make love
It's the dissolution of their marriage
-
America and Rosa begins to clean up the debris from the party
- taxi pulls up
Joe gets in with his bags
The cab backs out
- The two wedding rings rest on the nightstand, hers nestled in his
Sally's hand opens the drawer, sweeps the rings into it
- The " " sign is hammered into the ground
: - Otis wanders along the street, up the driveway and disappears through the flap in the kitchen door
