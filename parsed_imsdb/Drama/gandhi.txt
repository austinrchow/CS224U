Written by John Briley Final Draft -  - The camera is moving toward an Indian city
We are high and far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear: "No man's life can be encompassed in one telling
There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime
What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man
" And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large factories
And as we move nearer, coursing over the parched terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images from the life we are seeking: British: "Who the hell is he
", lower class British: " don't know, sir
"
"My name is Gandhi
Mohandas
Gandhi
"
woman's voice, tender, soft: "You are my best friend, my highest guru
and my sovereign lord
"
man (Gandhi): " am asking you to fight
"
An angry aristocratic English voice: "At home children are writing 'essays' about him
"
the sound of massed rifle fire, screams
-  - And now we are over the city, coming in toward a particular street in the affluent suburbs of New Delhi
there are a few cars (it is 1948), and we are closing on a milling crowd near the entrance to one of the larger homes
We see saris, Indian tunics, a sprinkling of "Gandhi" caps, several tongas (two-wheeled, horse-drawn taxis)
the shreds of sound continue -- American woman, flirtatious, intimate: "You're the only man  know who makes his own clothes
" Gandhi's laugh
The sound of rioting, women's cries and screams of terror
An American voice: "This man of peace"
And as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the street
an Australian and his wife, a  correspondent
all in passing, as the camera finally closes and holds on one young man: Godse
-  - Godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward an entrance-way at the back of a long wall
' He will be saying prayers in the garden -- just follow the others
In contrast to those about him, there is tension in Godse's face, an air of danger in his movements
He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his
Two young men (Apte and Karkare) meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger
They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd
Sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching
Apte and Karkare look back at him
There is just the slightest acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business
-  - Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance
He stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of Prakash
Prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head
Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate
-   -  - fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man
Godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark -- " see him
" "Here he comes
" "Which one is Manu
"
Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching
Featuring Gandhi
We see him distantly through the crowd
The brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, his "walking sticks," Manu and Abha
We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls
The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front
We hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger
Featuring Godse
He slides through to the very front rank
His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples
And now, for an instant we see Gandhi close from his point of view
He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him
Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands
(gently) Brother -- Bapu is already late for prayers
Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma
And now we see Gandhi in full shot
The cheap glasses, the nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes
He smiles and joins his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting
Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice
thrice
Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls
Oh, God
oh, God
Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to -   -  - Close shot
Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half- step, step of the requiem march
Full shot
The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route
People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more
and more
All are silent
We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief
We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain
We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi
And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence
'  -  -   -  - Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony
We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward
Murrow, who sits on the makeshift platform, a microphone marked "" before him, describing the procession as technicians and staff move quietly around him
(clipped, weighted) The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived -- a private man without wealth, without property, without official title or office
-   -  - As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo- Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans
' - Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander of great armies nor ruler of vast lands, he could boast no scientific achievements, no artistic gift
Yet men, governments and dignitaries from all over the world have joined hands today to pay homage to this little brown man in the loincloth who led his country to freedom
We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway
Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands
and behind them a broad mass of Indians
For a moment we see their sandalled feet moving along the roadway and realize their quiet, rhythmic shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced
' - Pope Pius, the Archbishop of Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of Russia, the President of France
are among the millions here and abroad who have lamented his passing
In the words of General George
Marshall, the American Secretary of State, "Mahatma Gandhi had become the spokesman for the conscience of mankind
" In the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall, English figure of Mirabehn, dressed in a sari, her face taut in a grief that seems ready to break like the Ganges in flood
Near her a tall, heavy-set man, Germanic, still powerful of build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest a man well into his sixties (Kallenbach)
He too marches with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for national mourning
On the edge of the street an American newspaperman (Walker) watches as the bier passes him
He has been making notes, but his hand stops now and we see the profile of Gandhi from his point of view as the weapon-carrier silently rolls by
It is personal, close
Walker clenches his teeth and there is moisture in his eyes as he looks down
He tries to bring his attention to his pad again, but his heart is not in it and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the horde of passing feet following the bier
' - a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than empires
" And Albert Einstein added, "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth
" The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body
the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves
and finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father
' - but perhaps to this man of peace, to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate, the tribute he would value most has come from General Douglas McArthur: "If civilization is to survive," the General said this morning, "all men cannot fail to adopt Gandhi's belief that the use of force to resolve conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our own self-destruction
"
news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd
As the cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their pictures
There is a newsreel crew center
The camera features a woman photographer (Margaret Bourke-White) who sits with her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous camera held loosely in her hand, un-regarded, as she watches the body of Gandhi approach
The intelligent features are betrayed by the emotion in her eyes
For an instant we see Gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact it has on her
' - Perhaps for the rest of us, the most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent New York which today wrote, "There is still hope for a world which reacts as reverently as ours has to the death of a man like Gandhi
"
The camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear, moving off down the vast esplanade, its narrowing path parting the sea of humanity like a long trail across a weaving plain
and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades in the distance we dissolve through to -   -  - With the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out across a darkly verdant plain, and suddenly the whistle of a train as its engine and light sweep under the camera, startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape
Tracking with the train
We begin at the guard's van, dwelling for a moment on the words "South African Railways," then pass on to the dimly lit Third Class coaches in the rear of the train, moving past the crowded Blacks and Indians in the spare wooden accommodation
There are two or three such coaches, then a Second Class coach
cushioned seats, better lighting, a smattering of Europeans: farmers, clerks, young families
Their clothes indicate the date: the early 1890s
The conductor is working his way through this coach, checking tickets
The track continues to the First Class coach -- linen over the seats, well-lit luxurious compartments
We pass a single European, and then come to rest on the back of a young Indian dressed in a rather dandified Victorian attire, and reading as a Black porter stows his luggage
-    -  - Featuring the young Indian
It is the young Gandhi -- a full head of hair, a somewhat sensuous face, only the eyes help us to identify him as the man we saw at Birla House, the figure on the bier in Delhi
He is lost in his book and there is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads intrigues and surprises him
He grins suddenly at some insight, then looks out of the window, weighing the idea
As he does the European passes the compartment and stops dead on seeing an Indian face in the First Class section
The porter glances at the European nervously
Gandhi pivots to the porter, holding his place in the book, missing the European, who has moved on down the corridor, altogether
We see the cover of the book: The Kingdom of God is Within You, by Leo Tolstoy
Tell me -- do you think about hell
(stares at him blankly) "Hell
" (the eternal, earnest sophomore) No -- neither do
But
(he points abruptly to the book) but this man is a Christian and he has written -- The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa
(puzzled) -- a week
Well,  don't know how you got a ticket for -- He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work
Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so
The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in
Here -- coolie, just what are you doing in this car
Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner
Why --  --  have a ticket
First Class ticket
How did you get hold of it
sent for it in the post
'm an attorney, and  didn't have time to -- He's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European
There are no colored attorneys in South Africa
Go and sit where you belong
He gestures to the back of the train
Gandhi is nonplussed and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself
The porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's suitcases
'll take your luggage back, baas
No, no -- just a moment, please
He reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card which he presents to the conductor
You see, Mohandas
Gandhi, Attorney at Law
am going to Pretoria to conduct a case for an Indian trading firm
Didn't you hear me
There are no colored attorneys in South Africa
Gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence, but is beginning to react to it, this time with a touch of irony
Sir,  was called to the bar in London and enrolled in the High Court of Chancery --  am therefore an attorney, and since  am -- in your eyes -- colored --  think we can deduce that there is at least one colored attorney in South Africa
The Porter stares -- amazed
Smart bloody kaffir -- throw him out
He turns and walks out of the compartment
You move your damn sammy carcass back to third class or 'll have you thrown off at the next station
(anger, a touch of panic) always go First Class
have traveled all over England and 've never
-  - Gandhi's luggage is thrown onto the station platform
blast of steam from the engine
policeman and the conductor are pulling Gandhi from the First Class car
Gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by the door, a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand
The European cracks on Gandhi's hands with his fist, breaking Gandhi's grip and the policeman and conductor push him across the platform
It is ugly and demeaning
Disgustedly, the conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start
Gandhi rights himself on the platform, picking up his briefcase, his face a mixture of rage, humiliation, impotence
The conductor hurls Gandhi's book at his feet as the train starts to move
Gandhi picks up the book, looking off at the departing train
lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into light and darkness
His point of view
The Black porter stares out of a window at him, then we see the European taking his seat again, righteously
The conductor standing in the door, watching Gandhi even as the train pulls out
Then the Second Class coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of fear
Gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train pulls away -- but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform with self-conscious embarrassment
Black railway worker looks as if he would like to express sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from Gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing wind
The policeman who pulled Gandhi from the train talks with the ticket-taker under the gas-lit entrance gate, both of them staring off at Gandhi
An Indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her face half-veiled
small child sleeps in her arms, and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet
She turns away from Gandhi's gaze as though it brought the plague itself
'   -  - Featuring Gandhi
As if a reverse angle from the previous shot, he is angry, baffled, defiant
But you're a rich man -- why do you put up with it
We are in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home
Facing Gandhi are Khan, a tall, impressive Indian
Singh, slighter and older than Khan, but wiry and looking capable of physical as well as intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed
(a shrug) 'm rich -- but 'm Indian therefore do not expect to travel First Class
It is said with a dignity and strength that makes the statement all the more bewildering
Gandhi looks around helplessly
We see Mr
Baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's naivete
In England,  was a poor student but -- That was England
Gandhi is holding a British legal document; he lifts it pointedly
This part of "England's" Empire
Mr
Gandhi, you look at Mr
Khan and see a successful Muslim trader
The South Africans see him simply as an Indian
And the vast majority of Indians -- mostly Hindu like yourself -- (there is a moment of blinking embarrassment from Gandhi at this mention of his own religion) were brought here to work the mines and harvest the crops -- and the Europeans don't want them doing anything else
Gandhi looks at Mr
Baker almost in disbelief
But that is very un-Christian
Mr
Baker smothers a smile
Mr
Gandhi, in this country Indians are not allowed to walk along a pavement with a "Christian"
Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously
You mean you employ Mr
Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him
can
But  risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr
Baker
He smiles, but his eyes show that it is no joke
Gandhi glances from one to the other them -- absorbing the inconceivable
And then almost before our eyes his innocence of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of it all
Well, then, it must be fought
We are children of God like everyone else
(dryly) Allah be praised
And what battalions will you call upon
--  will write to the press -- here -- and in England
(He turns to Baker firmly) And  will use the courts
He lifts the documents threateningly
You will make a lot of trouble
Its tone is chilling, and Gandhi's firmness is shaken a little
We are members of the Empire
And we come from an ancient civilization
Why should we not walk on the pavements like other men
The sturdy Khan is studying him with a look of wry interest
rather like the idea of an Indian barrister in South Africa
'm sure our community could keep you in work for some time, Mr
Gandhi -- even if you caused a good deal of trouble
(Gandhi reacts uncertainly
) Especially if you caused a good deal of trouble
Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly determined to take it
-  - We see a rather crudely stitched sign: "Indian Congress Party of South Africa
" Gandhi, now sporting a moustache, stands with Khan and Singh near a fire that has been started in the open area before the Mosque
wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire
Before them, a small crowd, mostly Indian (Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims), but with a few Whites drawn by curiosity
Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd
There's the English reporter
told you he'd come
We see the English reporter waiting skeptically
Near him, trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables) horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them
You also said your article would draw a thousand people
(If the crowd numbers 100 they're lucky
) At least some of the Hindus brought their wives
We see five or six women in saris standing together
No
asked my wife to organize that
We feature Gandhi's wife, Ba, standing at the front of the women
She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not
(alarmed) Some of them are leaving
Gandhi wets his lips nervously
He glances with a little apprehension at the police, then takes his notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire
He holds up his hand for attention
He forces a smile -- then starts reading -- Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal citizens of the Empire
It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way
Gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but just as colorlessly
We do not seek conflict
We know the strength of the forces arrayed against us, know that because of them we can only use peaceful means -- but we are determined that justice will be done
This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction
Three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them
He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both now
She wraps her sari more closely around her and her expression is a wife's " told you so" -- sufferance, mortification and loyalty, all in one
Gandhi wets his lips again -- and takes a square of cardboard from his pocket -- his "pass
" The symbol of our status is embodied in this pass -- which we must carry at all times, but no European even has to have
He holds it up
constable glances at the police sergeant
And the first step to changing our status is to eliminate this difference between us
And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire
The flames engulf it
The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief
The crowd murmurs in shock
At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture
Even so, a constable glances at the police sergeant again, "Do we take him
"
The sergeant just shakes his head, "Wait
" Khan moves up to Gandhi as the tremor of reaction ripples through the crowd
(quietly) You write brilliantly, but you have much to learn about handling men
He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd
(the reading not fluent, but firm and pointed) We do not want to ignite
the fear or hatred of anyone
But we ask you -- Hindu, Muslim and Sikh -- to help us light up the sky
and the minds of the British authorities -- with our defiance of this injustice
It is the end of the speech
He looks at the crowd
No one knows quite what to do
Gandhi harumphs -- gesturing to a shallow box Singh holds
Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely
We will now burn the passes of our committee and its supporters
We ask you to put your passes on the fire with -- Oh, no, you bloody well don't
He has stepped forward with his constables, who have faced the crowd, halting the tentative movements of the few committed supporters toward the fire
Those passes are government property
And  will arrest the first man who tries to burn one
He is facing the crowd
Behind him, Khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket
He holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket
The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame
Take him away
He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon
As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club menacingly against his hand
Now -- are there any more
Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire
Ba holds her hand to her mouth -- terrified
Again the crowd's reaction turns the sergeant
Gandhi is at the fire
For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another
You little sammy bastard --  -- He has leapt across the distance between them, knocking the box from Gandhi's hands, sending the cards flying and shoving Gandhi to the ground
He turns and faces the crowd angrily, pointing the billy club threateningly
You want that kind of trouble -- you can have it
Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him
Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket
The sergeant's fury bursts -- and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head
Gandhi sags to the ground
Ba screams
She starts to run to him, but the other women seize her
Let me go
She fights loose, but one of the constables takes her firmly
The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card
The crowd watches
The newspaper reporter watches
Ba stares in anguish
Gandhi lifts the card
The sergeant stares at him, angry but his emotions somewhat in control after the first blow
Stop
An instant of hesitation, then Gandhi drops the card into the basket
The sergeant almost stops, but he strikes again
quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as Gandhi sags
Ba's anguished face is wet with tears
The newspaper reporter stares without making notes
Khan, at the paddy wagon, watches in wonder
Gandhi, his head bleeding badly now, rises to his knees -- a breath and he gropes around the ground for another card
His fingers finally clutch one
The sergeant stares, his face wracked with uncertainty and confusion
Gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire, then drops it in the basket
The sergeant slams the billy club down again -- firmly, but with a manifest reluctance
The crowd watches breathlessly, the newspaper reporter stares
The sergeant draws a breath, grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees Gandhi lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his own blood, groping for another card
'  -   -  - Ba is gently removing Gandhi's suit coat, staring fearfully at a bandage on his head, another along the side of his face
The room is gaslit, overfurnished in the Victorian manner
Middle class
Gandhi sits carefully on the bed, where some newspapers are spread out, English-language ones among them
You saved the papers
Ba reaches forth, gently touching the bandages on his head
wish you were still struggling for work in Bombay
Gandhi doesn't take his eyes from the papers, but he shakes his head
hated that -- all the pettiness, the little corruptions
( reflective grin
) And  was more laughing stock than lawyer
He smiles whimsically, then turns back to the papers
But they needed me here
If 'd never been thrown off that train, perhaps no one would ever have needed me
Ba stares at the back of his head, wounded by that remark, bearing it as stoically as he bore the blows against him
(reading) " high court judge has confirmed that Mr
Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr
Khan resisted arrest
" --  told you about English law
As  told you about English policemen
Before Gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door
Yes
small, round ayah (an Indian nursemaid) pushes open the door and proudly admits her charges, Gandhi's sons: Harilal (ten), Manilal (six) and Ramdas (two)
They are all dressed in European suits, ties and stiff collars
They step forward, one by one, making the pranam (the Hindu gesture of greeting), then bending and touching the hands and lips to Gandhi's feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father
We are glad to have you back, Bapu
Gandhi smiles
And  am glad to be back
(He holds his hands out to Ramdas
) Come
And Ramdas runs to him and Gandhi bends to kiss him as Ramdas put his arms around his neck
Be careful
Gandhi pats him indulgently, then carefully stands erect, looking at them all with satisfaction
Tomorrow  will tell you what it feels like to be a jailbird
The two older boys show the expected apprehension -- and interest
Gandhi nods to the ayah
She claps her hands smartly
Come
Come
The boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline
The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at they go down the hall
Just like proper English gentlemen
'm proud of them
They are boys
-- And they're Indian
Gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper
Hm
Will you take this off
(he touches the bandage on his cheek) It pinches every time  speak
Ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him, maneuvering so that she can get at the bandage
Here, you see
Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack
" (of the tape, as she is about to pull it) Are you sure
(impatiently) Yes --  can't talk like this
Ba pauses and looks at him mischievously, as though that's not a bad idea
He scowls at her, then recognizes her "joke" and grins
Pull
Ba pulls one of the strands of tape and Gandhi flinches
Oww
(mockingly) Mr
Khan said they called you brave
Gandhi is nursing the moustache; he looks at her wryly
If you would let me teach you to read, you could see for yourself
She leans forward to pull at the remaining piece
could have told them you were merely foolish
Gandhi is watching her as she leans across him, her beauty and proximity obviously stirring him
It proves what  told you
If  had prosecuted him as everyone advised -- even you -- they would have hated me -- by showing forgiveness  -- ouch
She has pulled the other piece
There
And she slowly pries the gauze free from the strands of hair above his lip
As she does Gandhi watches her more and more intently, and slips his arms around her back
(as though continuing the argument) You see there is such a thing as moral force -- and it can be harnessed
Ba examines the bandage and gently touches the wound, but she is aware of his burning eyes and arms around her back
Not always
You have told me twice now that you were giving up the pleasures of the flesh
It slows Gandhi uneasily for a moment and Ba must grin at his discomfiture
He leans back -- still holding her, but looking at the ceiling
am
am convinced the holy men are right
When you give up, you gain
The simpler your life the better
Ba makes a moue of acceptance and starts to pull free of him -- but his arms still hold her
She smothers a smile and lies down, her face next to his, but neither of them looking at each other
long beat
and then Gandhi turns his head
She is aware of his eyes on her, but she doesn't move
Gandhi leans forward and touches his lips to her neck
will fast tomorrow -- as a penance
Ba smiles
Still not looking at him, she places her hand behind his head, gently
If you enjoy it a great deal you must fast for two days
Gandhi laughs
and buries her in love
-  - - General Smuts -- sitting erect and imposing on a beautiful chestnut horse -- rides down a tree-lined street
He wears civilian clothes with riding boots and breeches
Behind him, a junior British officer rides as escort
He turns into the entrance-way of an imposing building
The hooves of Smuts's horse clatter on the cobblestones as the General rides into the courtyard
Two sentries come smartly to attention
stable boy rushes to take the horse, and a tall civil servant approaches the General busily as he dismounts
The London papers have arrived from the Cape, sir
Yes --
The tall civil servant checks his notes
The worst was the Daily Mail, sir
They said, "The burning of passes by Mr
Gandhi was the most significant act in colonial affairs since the Declaration of Independence
" Smuts has given the reins to the stable boy
Did they
Well, they'll find we're a little better prepared this time
Mr
Gandhi will find he's on a long hiding to nothing
And he strides into the building, past the smartly saluting sentries
'  -  -  - Gandhi comes from the house door
He carries a briefcase and is still dressed in European clothes, though far less elegant than we have seen him in before
His mien, the cut of his hair, all suggest a passage of time
As he turns, he stops because he is face to face with Charlie Andrews, a very tall, thin Englishman, who wears a rumpled white suit and a clerical collar
He has descended from a horse-drawn taxi that carries his luggage
He too has stopped
For a moment they both appraise each other, neither speaking
Then You'd be Gandhi -- (Gandhi nods
) thought you'd be bigger
'm sorry
--  mean it's all right
It doesn't matter
(He suddenly steps forward and thrusts out his hand
) 'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews
've come from India -- 've read a great deal about you
Some of it good,  hope
He turns and waves to the parlor window
The three boys are there -- all bigger -- and Ba holds a new addition; they all wave
And Gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street
(to Charlie) Would you care to walk
He gestures Charlie on and starts walking
Charlie nods uncertainly
He looks back at the cab in confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace
(noting Charlie's collar) You're a clergyman
Yes
've -- 've met some very remarkable people in India
and -- and when  read what you've been doing here,  --  wanted to help
(He looks at Gandhi, then smiles awkwardly
) Does that surprise you
Not anymore
(And now he smiles
) At first  was amazed
but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement
Even when it is dangerous or -- -  - They have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down
Ahead of them three youths (twenty, twenty-one) in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path
They react to the sight of Gandhi -- fun
Then stride the pavement menacingly
One of them tosses aside his cigarette
Hey -- look what's comin'
white shepherd leading a brown sammy
Perhaps  should -- Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head
Doesn't the New Testament say, "If your enemy strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left"
He starts to move forward
Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself
think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically
don't think our Lord meant -- They are getting closer
The youths laughing, whispering
'm not so certain
have thought about it a great deal
suspect he meant you must show courage -- be willing to take a blow -- several blows -- to show you will not strike back -- nor will you be turned aside
And when -- One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard
It lands at Gandhi's feet
He pauses, looking at the youth
and when you do that it calls upon something in human nature -- something that makes his hate for you diminish and his respect increase
think Christ grasped that and  -- have seen it work
He starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly frightened, but
Good morning
Get off the pavement, you bloody -- And he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, but -- ' Colin
Colin
What are you doing
woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly
It is the first youth's mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably
Nuthing
nuthing
We were just cleaning up the neighborhood a little
snickering response from the other youths -- but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of Colin's mother's attitude
There's no note of apology in her cold stare at Gandhi, but she clearly believes her son should not be doing what he is doing
' You're already late for work thought you'd gone ten minutes ago
The moment of crisis has passed
Nothing will happen while she is there
Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth
You'll find there's room for us both
And he steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly
As they stride on, Charlie glancing back -- (relieved) That was lucky
thought you were a man of God
(wittily, but making his point) am
But 'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas
Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner
-  -  - busy street in the center of the town
Gandhi and Charlie come around the corner into it
you could call it a "communal farm,"  suppose
But we've all come to the same conclusion -- our Gita, the Muslim's Koran or your Bible -- it's always the simple things that catch your breath -- "Love thy neighbor as thyself" -- (He smiles, thinking back at the youths
) not always practiced -- but it's something we Hindus could learn a lot from
He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"
(a smile) Well, we shall try
And now he turns to Sonja
Behind her we see the small office "
Gandhi/Attorney
" Several clients waits, most of them conspicuously poor
Sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding
They're going to change the pass laws
Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly
'  -  - strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document
' - It's taken time, but it needed to be done fairly
We didn't want to create an injustice simply because Mr
Gandhi was abusing our existing legislation
Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts
Just one second, sir, please
Another angle
cameraman records the moment with a flash photo
General Smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document
But on a short trip,  wouldn't spend too much time on the Indian question, Mr
Walker
It's a tiny factor in South African life
The reporter who stands opposite him is Walker, much, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral
(a helpless shrug) It's news at the moment
will certainly report on your mines and the economy -- but  would like to meet this Mr
Gandhi
Smuts has risen
He knows how to concede with grace
Of course
We Westerners have a weakness for these -- these spiritually inclined men of India
But as an old lawyer, let me warn you, Mr
Gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet, however "otherworldly" he may seem
But 'm sure you're enough of a reporter to see that
The gaze is firm, strong, cynical
-   -  - The sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot
This is where the magazine Indian Opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around
short Westerner (Albert West) is running the simple printing press which is powered by a crude generator
small staff helping him
Sikh, a Muslim, a couple of Hindus, two young boys
Gandhi and Walker are approaching the tent from the river, Gandhi discoursing earnestly
so it's not "spiritualism" or "nationalism" -- we're not against anything but the idea that people can't live together
They've reached the entrance to the tent, and he gestures in
You see -- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jews -- even Christians
This last remark has been directed toward Charlie Andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter
He waves, and Gandhi shouts out to them all over the putt-putt of the generator: Mr
Walker
Of The New York Times
They nod
One of the Hindus bows with his hands clasped together
Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion and they start across the relatively barren field toward some other tents, Walker glancing at the paper
Gandhi watches him, grinning
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community
( teasing smile
) You belong to a very important profession
Hm
And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation
don't know
'm still searching for a "response
" (a leading question) You will respect the law
(a beat) There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men
This carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest of the conversation has
Walker measures Gandhi with a little surprise
You're a very small minority to take on the Government -- and the Empire
Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact
If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth
Reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and Walker senses it
But they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a European (Kallenbach) is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level
Some Indians are working below him
Gandhi turns to him, light-hearted again
This is Mr
Kallenbach
He is our chief carpenter -- and also our chief benefactor
He has made this experiment possible
Walker waves his notebook at him and Kallenbach lifts his level in greeting
On his bronzed chest there is a Star of David
Walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head
We see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling children in the background
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right
That's right
The word only means "community
" But it could stand for "village"
or the world
Walker looks at him appraisingly
You're an ambitious man
(uncertainly) hope not
moment of embarrassed doubt, then he starts toward a half- finished building -- wooden sides, door, but canvas still covering the roof
It has an awning spread before it
Walker's carriage is tethered nearby, a Black driver standing in the sun, waiting
In the background we see two women cleaning a latrine
Walker glances at the latrine
They tell me you also take your turn at peeling potatoes and cleaning the "outhouse" -- is that part of the experiment
As we have approached we see a table set for tea under the awning
There are two places
Having set the places, Ba is walking along the side of the building, away from them
She glances at Gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or acknowledging him
(a little surprised, a little annoyed) Ba -- we will need another place set for Mr
Walker's driver
Ba looks at him coldly
will tell Sora
She turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance
Gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude, but he tries to answer Walker
It's one way to learn that each man's labor is as important as another's
In fact when you're doing it, "cleaning the outhouse" seems far more important than the law
grin -- but forced
When a girl (Sora) comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls to the driver
Please come and join us -- you'll need something before your journey back
(He nods to Walker
) Excuse me a moment
And he goes into the building, determined to find the source of Ba's aloofness
'  -  - Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to the building
She does not look up at Gandhi, but she is aware of his presence
He crosses and stands in front of her with all the irritation of a husband
It is hushed, aware that Walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed anger
What is it
Now Ba looks at him hostilely
Sora was sent to tell me  --  must rake and cover the latrine
Everyone takes his turn
It is the work of untouchables
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us
(she looks up at him) am your wife
All the more reason
He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his
(finally, scornfully) As you command
As she starts to rise he grabs her arm, but she pulls free
The others may follow you -- but you forget,  knew you when you were a boy
She says it derisively and it stings, but Gandhi is aware of Walker and he fights to hold his temper
It's not me
It's the principle
And you will do it with joy or not do it at all
Ba settles back defiantly
Not at all then
For a moment Gandhi stares at her, and she back at him, resentfully
He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, pulling her roughly to her feet
All right, go
You don't belong here
Go
Leave the ashram
Get out altogether
We don't want you
It is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against him
Stop it
Stop it
What are you doing
She lurches free of his grip, glaring at him angrily
For a moment they both stare at each other, shattered by their violence
(bitterly) Have you no shame
'm your wife
(Like lead) Where do you expect me to go
Gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse
He sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding his head in his hands
Ba studies him for a moment -- and she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too
She moves and kneels before him
What is the matter with me
moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the mother-wife she is
(a beat) You are human -- only human
Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly
And it is even harder for those of us who do not even want to be as good as you do
And Gandhi grins weakly
Ba catches it and sends it back, warmer, less complicated by doubts
Gandhi sighs, putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching
apologize
Ba mutters "Hm" and holds him a little firmer
moment
must go back to that reporter
Ba nods
And  must rake and cover the latrine
Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her
She looks at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes
-  - The theater is packed
The front rows near the stage are held by rich Muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with small traders, peddlers, artisans -- Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, Sikh
The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -- largely Hindu
The mood is restless, belligerent
On the stage
Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence
Seated on the stage are Khan, Singh, three more leaders of the Indian community
Charlie Andrews and Herman Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs
Gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row
uniformed policeman stands near them
(to the house) want to welcome you all
buzz, then applause -- loud and defiant
When is subsides Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen, fixing his gaze on them
Every one of you
(Then, still at them) We -- have -- no -- secrets
And again the audience bursts into applause
The policemen just sit like stone -- confident, sure, immune to rhetoric
Let us begin by being clear about General Smuts's new law
All Indians must now be fingerprinted -- like criminals
Men and women
( rising, angry response; Gandhi just waits
) No marriage other than a Christian marriage is considered valid
Under this Act our wives and mothers are whores
And every man here a bastard
In the gallery a rhythmic pounding signals the anger and protest and is taken up around the hall
The police stare imperturbably
Khan leans towards Singh, nodding to Gandhi
He's become quite good at this
Singh smiles at the understatement
Gandhi holds up his hand, silencing the hall
And a policeman passing an Indian dwelling --  will not call them homes -- may enter and demand the card or any Indian woman whose dwelling it is
God damn them
Gandhi just waits
Understand
He does not have to stand at the door -- he may enter
Now a violent response -- a large, powerful merchant rises in the third row
swear to Allah  will kill the man who offers that insult to my home and my wife
( guttural cheer; he glares at the police
) And let them hang me
Another cheer
When it subsides, Tyeb Mohammed rises near the back, where he is seated with a number of other young men
say talk means nothing
Kill a few officials before they disgrace one Indian woman -- then they might think twice about such laws
The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back
' In that cause,  would be willing to die
And now there is general applause
Gandhi waits, then praise such courage
need such courage -- because in this cause, too am prepared to die
( response; he looks at Tyeb Mohammed) But, my friend, there is no cause for which  am prepared to kill
He looks at the audience
This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know
have asked you here tonight because despite all their troops and police, think there is a way to defeat this law
Whatever they do to us we will attack no one, kill no one
But we will not (the climatic point) give our fingerprints -- not one of us
He looks down at the police, making the point stick
There is a tentative reaction from the audience, but uncertain
They will imprison us, they will fine us
They will seize our possessions
But they cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them
Have you been to prison
They'll beat us and torture us
say -- am asking you to fight --
(It catches the audience a little, holds them
) To fight against their anger -- not to provoke it
He has their attention now
We will not strike a blow -- but we will receive them
And through our pain we will make them see their injustice (quickly) and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts
(Utter silence
) But we cannot lose
We cannot
(He looks down at the police
) Because they may torture my body, may break my bones, even kill me
(Up to the house) They will then have my dead body -- not my obedience
And now he gets the response he has wanted
Firm, mature, determined
Gandhi holds up his hand
We are Hindu and Muslim -- children of God, each of us
Let us take a solemn oath in His name that -- come what may -- we will not submit to this law
He looks at the audience
second, then a merchant stands, signifying his pledge
And then another
Then Tyeb Mohammed and the youths about him
Then all over the theater they begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is standing
It is all done is silence
Gandhi looks at the full theater -- all standing
He takes a step forward
(a coarse singing) God save our gracious King
Long live our (the audience takes it up) noble King
(And their voices fill the auditorium) God save the King
prison door slams: we are close on one face, another slam, another face, and again and again in the rhythm of marching feet
-  - Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are leading a large procession of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex -- sheds, elevator platforms, pulleys -- toward a distant city
We see crude, handworked banners: "We are Citizens of the Empire," "Justice for All," "One King -- One Law"
Tyeb Mohammed suddenly touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead
Their point of view
canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings and comes towards them
Resume Gandhi
There is a little hesitation in the ranks as the car approaches
In it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian
The car swings across the center of the road and stops right in front of Gandhi
These men are contracted laborers
They belong in the mines
You have put their comrades in jail
When you free them they will go back to work
The civilian smiles slowly
He looks from Gandhi to the miners
've warned you
We have warned each other
The civilian looks at him sharply, then smiles derisively, signaling the car off
As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh come up to Gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired
don't think that is very good
Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns and signals the miners on
They start forward
Their point of view
The car rides on past the factory building out of which it turned, and suddenly mounted police come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession
Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored
Tracking back before the mounted police
At the canter -- for-ward
They come on fast, batons at the ready
Gandhi screws up his courage, marching on
Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance
Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side
The mounted police riding on, batons at the ready
Featuring an Indian miner
He is in the front rank of the procession, watching the horses approach
He has a blunt farmer's face
(half to Gandhi) We should lie down -- the horses won't tramp on us
(Then shouting out) Down
Down
Everyone lie down
He starts to go down, and others around him, convinced by the authority of his voice
The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi, and as the sound of the galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too
Lie down
Lie down
And the miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands
Close fast traveling, the sergeant's point of view
We arrive at the prone miners
Close on Gandhi, his arms crossed in front of his face, staring up, frightened, but determined to bear it
Wide angle
The horses cannot bring themselves to gallop over the human carpet; they rear, plunge, swerve
Close shot -- miner who shouted "down
" He is peering through his crossed hands, a tight smile of satisfaction at knowledge confirmed
He turns to see: The sergeant thrown off his horse
He lands heavily, scrambles up, furious, darts after it
Mounting, he is enraged to hear laughter
Close shot
Singh and the miner who shouted "Down" kneeling, grinning at the chaos
The horses have more mercy than the men
Singh smiles, but suddenly looks up fearfully
The sergeant looms over them
You're right
And without taking his booted foot from the stirrup he swings it into the miner's face
The man goes down, bleeding
An angry roar from the miners
Several stand and shake their fists
"Bastard
," "God damn you, Englishman
," "Jackal
" The wounded miner himself starts to stagger up
The sergeant sweeps them, his eyes glittering -- this he can deal with
But -- Lie down
Lie down
It is a command, and angry in its own way, but it carries all the weight of his influence on them
They begin to go down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides at Gandhi
With deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof
Close shot, the horse's head, its eyes rolling as it swerves again
Close shot, the sergeant controlling it, cursing, but unable to make it plunge down on the man
Full shot, the sergeant wheeling his horse, angrily -- surveying the whole of the procession as they lie sprawled on the ground, his mounted police circling in front of them, not knowing what to do
Follow me
He turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories
Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are looking off at the retreating horses
The car with the civilian has returned in the distance
Gandhi looks at the miner who first shouted "Down" -- a smile, a nod of recognition and thanks
The miner grins, rubbing at the blood on his face, shrugging off Gandhi's implied praise
Featuring the police
The sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again
Their point of view
Gandhi and the miners coming on once more, chanting forcefully
"One King
One Law
One King
One Law
" What the hell are we supposed to do now
(watching the procession narrowly) Let them march
In our own sweet time, in our own sweet way -- we'll get them
-   -  - We are close on Charlie Andrews
Some of you may be rejoicing that Mr
Gandhi has at last been put into prison
The congregation is listening to him stiffly, unsympathetically, and there is more than one murmur of assent at his words
The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing
But  would ask you -- assembled here in this house of God -- to recognize that we are witnessing something new, something so unexpected, so unusual that it is not surprising the Government is at a loss
What Mr
Gandhi has forced us to do is ask questions about ourselves
few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort their families from the church
Charlie struggles on
As Christians, those are difficult questions to answer
How do we treat men who defy an unjust law -- men who will not fight, but will not comply
More of the congregation rise and march from the church
though a few pointedly do not
-  - Small, packed
Gandhi is threading his way in a line for soup
But it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in the line
As Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them
He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage on his head
When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi -- They're sparing no one,  see
No
You were the surprise
It's been all over the prison
We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press
So did
He takes his soup from Khan
(acidly) Don't worry about the meat -- it's Hindu (referring to the soup) -- there's not a trace
Gandhi smiles, but they turn as the gate opens and a paddy wagon is backed into the press of prisoners
Khan shakes his head
don't know who they've left out there to do the work
There can't be one mine left open
Have they touched the women
My wife publicly defied the law
They've arrested her and four others
(angrily) The fools
(He spills some soup
) Sorry
It's split the Government
Well, that's one victory
Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, the defiant, determined faces
If we hold firm, it won't be the last
Don't worry -- 've never seen men so determined
You've given them a way to fight
And  don't think -- He is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four men) pushing their way through the prisoners
Gandhi
want Gandhi
Which sammy is it
The prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who Gandhi is
The prison officer's eyes fall on him
-  -  - side street, but active
Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being marched down the pavement before two guards
The prison officer strides in front of them
People in the street stop and turn, staring
That part of Gandhi that is still the dandy is discomfited, but there is a growing part of him that defies appearances
Featuring a doorway
It is the side door of a large imposing building
The prison officer leads his little procession toward it
He knocks and the door opens
The tall civil servant has been waiting for them
The prison officer reaches forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles
-  - The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that is at right angles to them (i
e
facing the front of the building)
People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever
The grand staircase
The tall civil servant turns and starts up the staircase
Gandhi is even more exposed to everyone's surveillance on the wide, white expanse of the stairway
He hesitates, looking around in discomfort, then follows the tall civil servant on toward the large, white doors at the top of the staircase
'  -  - The tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates that Gandhi enter
Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock once on the inner doors
Then he pushes them open and gestures Gandhi in
'  -  - We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk
Ah, Mr
Gandhi
thought we might have a little talk
He nods to the tall civil servant, who bows and closes the door
Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet
Will you have a glass of sherry
Thank you
No
Smuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal
Perhaps some tea
(a shake of the head) dined at the prison
Ahh
He appraises Gandhi, measuring the irony of his words, his determination
Then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity he replaces the stopper on the sherry, turns and gestures Gandhi on into the room
Please -- please do come and sit down
It's prison  wanted to talk to you about
He has indicated a chair near his desk, but as Gandhi goes forward he pauses by a spread of papers from England on a long table near the middle of the room
We see one headline in close shot: "Thousands Imprisoned in South Africa/Mines Close
Crops Unharvested," a subhead, "Gandhi Leads Non- Violent Campaign
" He looks at Smuts
Smuts smiles, a passing nod at the papers
Mr
Gandhi, 've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to
(a beat) Well, if you ask, General Smuts, 'm sure it will be done
Smuts smiles
Hm
Of course it is not quite that simple
Somehow  expected not
wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has directed him to
Smuts measures him again, not absolutely certain how to deal with him
pause, and he affects to take Gandhi's irony at face value
'm glad to hear you say that
very glad
You see if we repeal the Act under pressure (a nod at the papers again) under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment
Can you understand that
Very well
And Gandhi does understand it -- as a guiding principle
Never humiliate your enemy
And his tone conveys it
(a bit surprised) Good
Good
(The bland politician: the compromise
) have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation
(He gestures, implying they'll do what they're told
) think  could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed
(waiting for the catch) congratulate them
Smuts does a slight double take, a smile, then the "tough" politician
But they might also recommend that future Indian immigration be severely restricted -- even stopped
He measures Gandhi challengingly, obviously expecting some contest
Gandhi mulls it, then Immigration was not an issue on which we fought
It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we -- we are in a position of advantage
Smuts stares at him
a moment, then You're an extraordinary man
(his grin; he brushes at his prison garb) assure you  feel a very ordinary man at this moment
And now Smuts smiles with him
He bends suddenly and signs a group of documents
'm ordering the release of all prisoners within the next twenty- four hours
You yourself are free from this moment
Gandhi stands, a little uncertain about the sudden change in his status
Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it
Assuming we are in agreement
Yes -- yes
It's just that
in these clothes 'd -- 'd prefer to go by taxi
(confused by his hesitation) All right
Fine
'm -- 'm afraid  have no money
Oh
(He quickly feels in his waistcoat pockets -- and realizes he has no money
) Neither have
(He reaches forth and touches a buzzer
) 'm awfully sorry
The tall civil servant (Daniels) enters
Daniels, would you lend Mr
Gandhi a shilling for a taxi
Daniel stares
beg your pardon, sir
(a second thought) How far will you be going, Mr
Gandhi
(a mischievous smile) Well -- now that this is settled -- had thought seriously of going back to India (he faces the startled Daniel) but a shilling will do splendidly for the moment
Still a little confused, Daniels reaches in his pocket and produces a shilling
He hands it to Gandhi
Thank you
(To Smuts) Thank you both for a very enlightening experience
He bows slightly and starts out the door
Daniels immediately starts to accompany him, but Gandhi stops
beat
(ice) 'm obliged, Mr
Daniels, but  will find my own way out
And his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in
Daniel bows, and he and Smuts just stare as the uniformed "prisoner" goes out through the grand doors, past the stunned men in the office to the outer doors and on to the grand staircase
The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance
Daniels simply shakes his head "Let him be
" Finally, when Gandhi has disappeared down the stairs, Daniels turns to Smuts
(a shake of the head) He's either a great man or a colossal fraud
Either way,  shall be glad to see the last of him
-  - Ship's siren, military band
a jubilant crowd on the pier, passengers waving to the receiving crowd
group of First Class passengers, ninety percent English, look down from the upper deck
From their point of view
We see the main section of the pier, a crowd of mostly European civilians on one side mass of military on the other: European officers, topees and swagger sticks, Indian cavalry, Gurkha infantry, Sikh lanoers -- turbans, rifles, bugles, an Indian military band -- a showy awe-inspiring display
Featuring two Englishmen
First Class passengers, white suits, Oxbridge accents; one quite young, the other a bit older, both civil servants coming to "administer" India
By God, he loves it
Their point of view
British general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his
The officer commanding and the Guard of Honor await him
'm sure he hates it
The young Englishman glances at him quizzically
The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band
Generals' reputations are being made in France today, fighting on the Western Front
Not as Military Governors in India
He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation
He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little
The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again
What the devil's going on back there
He is looking aft
His point of view
Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship
Third Class passengers are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier
large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person
The young Englishman glances back at the well-dressed Indian to make sure of his distance, then speaks quietly
It must be that Indian that made all that fuss back in Africa
My cabin boy told me he was on board
Why haven't we seen him
(Finding the name) Gandhi
Yes
That's it
He was traveling Third Class
There he is
Their point of view
There has been a little hiatus in those disembarking but now Gandhi has appeared, coming down the gangplank with Ba and the children (grown-up sons now), and three or four people behind them, including the tall figure of Charlie Andrews
But Gandhi is wearing an Indian tunic and sandals and he has shaved his hair except for a central section on the top
' - God -- he's dressed like a coolie thought he was a lawyer
The young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well- dressed Indian again, then After he came out of jail he refused to wear European clothes
-    -  - Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist
No, no,  haven't "refused"
-- simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed
He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception
An English journalist catches him as he turns
Will you support the war effort, Mr
Gandhi
An exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders
--  have demanded rights as a British citizen, it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the British Empire
He smiles uncertainly again
As he turns he is face to face with an American reporter
What are you going to do now that you're back in India
don't know
don't know
An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him
As an Indian woman how could you accept the indignity of prison
Gandhi half-twists to hear Ba's answer, but his arm is taken by a young Indian (Nehru) in elegant European clothes
Another garland is thrown over his shoulders
Please, Mr
Gandhi
Featuring Ba
Offhand, her eyes on Gandhi ahead
My dignity comes from following my husband
She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi
Charlie helps to guide her
Featuring Gandhi
The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little flower-covered platform
We see a banner: (he too speaks with an Oxbridge accent) Just a few words -- then we'll get you to civilization
He grins
He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the platform
Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform
There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off
Gandhi looks around at the crowd
Finally he speaks out
--  am glad to be home
( little round of applause
) --  thank you for your greeting
He makes the pranam and starts for the steps
The crowd is a little disappointed, but they manage a cheer and applause
Nehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man (Patel)
They exchange a wry glance, "Not exactly a world- beater
" car door slams
The camera pulls back
Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down
He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack
An Indian chauffeur rides in front
The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba
We'll follow with your wife -- don't worry, everything's arranged
He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion
'  -    -  - With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off
He finally turns to Patel
Who is that young man
That's young Nehru
He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave
Wave
-- he may amount to something
There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise that they are for him -- waves tentatively
Patel waves too but he eyes Gandhi rather critically
must say when  first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay never thought 'd be greeting you as a national hero
'm hardly that, Mr
Patel
Oh, yes, you are
It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it
And stop calling me Mr
Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore
(a beat; still hesitant) No
They have come to a main thoroughfare
crowd still lines the streets but it is thin and around and between we see groups of desperate poor, parked on the pavement, staring with blank curiosity at the passing car, but too listless and too out of touch to move from their little squatters' patches
Patel looks at Gandhi's clothes rather disapprovingly
The new Military Governor of the North West Province was on that ship
Too bad you came back Third Class -- he might have been impressed by a successful barrister who had outmaneuvered General Smuts
Gandhi is staring at the street
From his point of view we hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari
Another hollow-faced child leans against her
(leadenly) Yes
'm sure
'  -  - splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn
woman in a sumptuous silk sari is trying to feed it crumbs
Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate -- silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa
beautiful and beautifully dressed woman (Mrs
Nehru) stands next to her distinguished husband (Motilal Nehru)
(wittily) No,  leave practical matters to my husband and revolution to my son
She nods lightly toward Nehru
Featuring Nehru who is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, ascetic looking, but dressed impeccably (Jinnah)
The other with a haunting face -- beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical (Prakash -- whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination)
Mr
Jinnah, our joint host, member of Congress, and the leader of the Muslim League and Mr
Prakash, who fear is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder
Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash
Prakash grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi
have not actually pulled a trigger, Mr
Gandhi,  have simply written that if an Englishman kills an Indian for disobeying his law, then it is an Indian's duty to kill an Englishman for enforcing his law in a land that is not his
Gandhi nods
It is a clever argument;  am not sure it will produce the end you desire
He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa
(testingly) We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr
Gandhi
(a pause) -- Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others
May
Mohan --  would like you to meet someone
Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes
Behind him we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society
As Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru and Prakash watch him clinically
Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes
He told the press he would support the British in the war
(acidly) That's non-violence for you
Is he a fool
Nehru grins slowly, thoughtfully
'm not certain
But  wouldn't be surprised
We get a shot of Ba in a gathering of Indian women
She stands listening, seemingly tongue-tied in the sophisticated patter
And we cut to Charlie introducing Gandhi to a man in obvious ill health, but well dressed, looking like the professor, philosopher and elder statesman he is (Gokhale)
lied to you, Mohan, when  told you  decided to come to South Africa to meet you
Professor Gokhale sent me
Gokhale is pleased, Gandhi amused
He bows very respectfully
We're trying to make a nation, Gandhi -- and the British keep trying to break us up into religions and principalities and "provinces
" What you were writing in South Africa -- that's what we need here
He has offered his hand during this, and Gandhi has helped him from the garden chair he has been seated on, handing him the cane that is resting against it
(a smile) have much to learn about India
And  have to begin my practice again -- one needs money to run a journal
Another grin
Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly
Nonsense
(He turns to Charlie) Go on, Charlie
This is Indian talk -- we want none of you imperialists
It is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does
and Charlie does too
(a mock threat) All right -- 'll go and write my report to the Viceroy
Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and convert her to Christianity -- that's as much mischief as you're allowed
He still hasn't smiled, but Gandhi and Charlie have
This is private -- beautiful and still
Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale
Forget your practice
India has many men with too much wealth -- it is their privilege to nourish the efforts of the few who can raise India from servitude and apathy
will see to it -- you begin your journal
have little to say
India is an "alien" country to me
He grins self-deprecatingly but Gokhale persists
Well, change that
Go and find India
Not what you see here, but the real India
You'll see what needs to be said
What we need to hear
He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he smiles
When he speaks his voice is thick with feeling
When  saw you in that tunic  knew
knew  could die in peace
( dying man's command) Make India proud of herself
His eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly
: -  - Indian
Steam
breed of its own
-  - Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach
Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her
Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach
People are sleeping everywhere, some half-erect on the benches, many on the floor among the bundles and trunks and bedrolls and baskets
Some have children, some are very old
One old man, sleepless like Gandhi, stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother
Gandhi looks at the bench across from him
Charlie Andrews, his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window looks at Gandhi dozily, a little smile of sufferance, then he closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the rocking window frame
-    -  - Gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the shoulders of some trotting men
The chair is swathed in flowers, and flowers are being showered on Gandhi by the running children and the crowd lining the narrow street
Ba and Charlie and two others are following in a flower-bedecked ox-cart, lost in the mass of people that are swirling around Gandhi
On a building top a British officer watches emotionlessly as Gandhi and the crowd pass below him
On this building and others we see some on his Indian soldiers watching with their rifles beside them
-  - As from a train
but the shots are varied; some close of farmers and water buffalo, and ragged children and women in colorful saris carrying pots on their heads, and some distant of villages as units, one and another and another
: -  - Gandhi's face in the window, he and Ba standing, looking out together, neither speaking
Gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches
Gandhi sweeping part of the carriage, making disgruntled passengers move as he tries to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings
-  - broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun
The camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows
-  - The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river
People have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water, to stretch their legs
We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun
And, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the English First Class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume
British officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his trousers rolled up, his shoes off
Across the river down from the Third Class coaches a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes
Some carry infants on their backs
Some small children stand near them
Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train
Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers
Ba cools her face with water
Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy
Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river
And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the camera panning slowly along them
Their bodies are skin and bone
The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another
The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring listlessly at the train
One boy, with a stump for an arm, aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him
Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their poverty
His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank
Though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck
The cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin
Her eyes have met Gandhi's as he watches her
Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat
Then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing
It floats along on the water down toward the woman
She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense of incredulity
As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it
Her hands snatch at it quickly
Then she stands, looking at Gandhi
The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement
Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her
And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner calms again
And she looks back at him, and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks
Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes
-  - Threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a vast plain
-  - Climbing green hills -- a totally different terrain -- and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster
until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the screech of brakes it stops
-  - Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach
Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down
Gandhi and Charlie jump down too
As they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them
small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them
Featuring the cavalry
They are British and their troop leader is viciously angry
Clear the way
Get out of the way
He is swinging his sword, not lethally, but threateningly at the Indian passengers from the train
His British NCOs are equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers, forcing them back against the train
Gandhi and Charlie step back
And as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be dead
-  - The shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense of tension and foreboding
We hear the engine chugging slowly
The camera lifts
Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, staring out grimly
Other passengers are looking off too
Ba is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing
-  - Their point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible
In front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others
From this crude gallows two Indian men hang by the neck
One is in turban and dhoti, the other in a tunic
The sound of the train stopping
-  - Close shot
Incense rising in shot
The camera pulls back and back
The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the Indian men have been hanged
small crowd sits in a crescent before him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him
When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame
We know we are looking from someone's point of view near the prison wall
Finally, Gandhi lifts his head
(at first distant, as from the hill) ask you to pray for those who died
(Closer) For the English soldiers
(a murmur) who were doing what they thought was right
(Closer) And for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong
The murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this
Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent
It is not my law, it is the law of creation
We reap what we sow
Out there in the fields -- and in our hearts
Violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge
In them
And in us
He looks up
- The troop leader, on horseback, is on the hill beside the gallows
The first view of Gandhi on the platform was his
Some of his troops are lined up beside him
He stares down at Gandhi coldly
'   -  - Patel lounges in the water on his back, supported by a large air pillow
Nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming suit, his feet dangling in the water
Jinnah sits under an umbrella in an elegant white suit, being served tea by one of three or four servants around
Patel spews a fountain of water
agree with Jinnah
Now that the Americans are in, the war will end soon
The Germans are worn out as it is
(he rolls over, facing Nehru) and our first act should be to convene a Congress Party convention and demand independence
Nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant
And we must speak with one voice -- united
The others assent
Nehru shakes his head wistfully
(it reminds him) Ah -- we should invite Gandhi
What the devil has happened to him anyway
He's "discovering" India
(cynically) Which is a lot better than causing trouble where it matters
Invite him -- let him say his piece about South Africa -- and then let him slip into oblivion
: -  - fireman heaps coal into an engine's boiler
The train passes camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity
People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches
-  - Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely
Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny
She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms
(quietly, private) Please
You're being foolish
There's no room
And the air is lovely
She grimaces severely and tugs at him
No violence, please
Let me hang on with two hands or will fall
Featuring the roof
And Indian squats right on the edge of the roof above Charlie
He is looking down, offering a hand
(over the sound of the engine) Englishman Sahib
Charlie, who has been grinning, suddenly looks baffled, not to say appalled
Come
Come
There is room
His hand still dangles in offering to the tall Charlie
Another angle
Two other Indians on the roof move to where they can grip the first Indian's other arm, as counterforce to the weight of Charlie
(to Charlie) Place the foot on the window
Featuring Charlie
Hesitatingly, he grips the inside of the window higher, and starts to swing one foot onto the window ledge
(amused, but disconcerted) What are you doing
(grimly) Going nearer to God
Gandhi, baffled a second, sees the outstretched hand above them, and in puckish complicity, helps boost Charlie up
Long shot
As Charlie reaches up, his hand is grasped and he starts to scramble and be pulled up to the roof
Featuring Gandhi and Ba
As Charlie's leg, assisted by Gandhi, starts to leave its lodging on the window ledge Ba suddenly turns, sees it, and grabs for it in alarm
Charlie
Be careful
Close shot
Charlie
His face flat on the roof of the train as his arm is still gripped by the Indian, but his leg is being pulled from behind
(desperately) Mohan --
Resume Gandhi and Ba
Gandhi quickly moves to free Ba's hand from Charlie's leg and almost loses his own grip
He grabs the window again
Let go
You'll kill him
Ba is confused
Let go
Let go
With one hand he pries at her grip
In the chaos of instructions others in the coach are helping Gandhi, and Ba senses she is doing something wrong, but is still not sure what
She lets go
Close shot
Charlie
desperate sigh of relief
Long shot
Charlie is pulled on up to the top of the coach
Featuring Charlie as he sits, puffing and recovering from the fright
You see -- most comfortable
Charlie nods grimly
Featuring Gandhi and Ba
Gandhi, smiling, goes on the tips of his toes to get a better view
Ba grabs him desperately
Please, God, no
Featuring Charlie
He looks around at the rest of the passengers on the roof, their bundles and baskets clutched beside them
Their poverty is appalling, but they are all smiling at him, a sense of gaiety made in part by his Englishman's participation in their experience
They must shout over the train
(grinning) Are you Christian, Sahib
(nods) Yes, yes, 'm a Christian
(proudly) know a Christian
(Charlie acknowledges it politely
) She drinks blood
Charlie stares at him in surprise
(explaining -- obvious) The blood of Christ -- every Sunday
He is nodding, smiling, expecting Charlie's understanding
And Charlie gives it -- somewhat bleakly
Suddenly ' (alarmed) Charlie
The Indians turn
Charlie turns
-  - Resume Charlie and the Indians
It's all right, Sahib
Very safe -- bend -- bend
All the Indians are crouching
Charlie closes his eyes ruefully -- he's had better ideas than this -- and he gets as flat as he can
-  - The train, with passengers clinging to the sides and riding on the top, steams into the tunnel, its whistle sounding
Black
glimmer of light, through steam, the whistle echoing
' Pray to God, Sahib
Now is when it is best to be Hindu
Close shot
Charlie
In a flash of steamy light, staring wide-eyed at the Indian
Black, and sudden silence
: -  - High
Coming into focus is a lighted platform, and as the scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the banner which reads   , and we hear the emotional voice of Jinnah at the microphone
(gradually fading in) We were asked for toleration
We were asked for patience
Some gave it and some did not
Well, their war is over
And those of us who supported it, and those of us who refused must forget our differences
The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience
And there can be no excuses from the British now
India wants Home Rule
India demands Home Rule
And the audience cheers him
Newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him
Patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping
He is chairing the Congress
Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium
man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight
At last he moves back to his place on the platform
Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation
Others crowd around him
And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform
He is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah
Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands
And let no one question that Mr
Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims -- but for all India
And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda
He raises his hands, stilling them again
And now 'm going to introduce to you a man whose writings we are all becoming familiar with
a man who stood high in the esteem of our beloved Professor Gokhale
a man whose accomplishment in South Africa will always be remembered
Mr
Mohandas Gandhi
Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium
He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated
As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it
(politely) Your journal has made a great impact
Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause
am flattered by Mr
Patel (His grin
) would be even more flattered if what he said were true
He means about the journal
Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them
But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility -- (loudly; he is away from the mike) But it's true
--  read it
often
Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve
This is the first time we have seen them
He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium
He puts his glasses on and faces the convention
Since  returned from South Africa, have traveled over much of India
And  know  could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it
On the platform, the whispered politics go on
On the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things
and yet already  know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country
Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark
He touches Patel on the shoulder "Listen
" Here we make speeches for each other -- and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines
And now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too
But the people of India are untouched
Their politics are confined to bread and salt
Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly
Illiterate they may be, but they are not blind
They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of freedom
There is dissent on the floor and on the platform -- but it is muttered and English "polite
" Gandhi goes on
This Congress tells the world it represents India
My brothers, India is seven hundred thousand "villages" not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay
Until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent India -- nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one nation
He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform
cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly
On the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily
We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways
Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel
Have you read his magazine
No -- but  think 'm going to
'  -  - An open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail
Nehru drives, four friends as young as he with him, all dressed in the same expensive, British manner
This can't be the way
Nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride
The ashram is only half-finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost
They are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path
(a mocking quote) Yes, 'm sure this is the direction India is taking
The others laugh; Nehru suffers
To think  almost got excited by Mr
Jinnah when all this was awaiting me
-  - Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car
He carries sheaves of page proofs
We're looking for Mr
Gandhi
Ah, you'll find him under the tree by the river
(He points off, then glances at the car
) You'd better leave the car -- the ground is rather soft
Thank you
He looks around the ashram a little dismally
(drolly, as he climbs out) Come on
'm anxious to meet this new "force"
-    -  - Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes
Nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him
Beside them, the river; in the background the business of the ashram goes on
try to live like an Indian, as you see
it is stupid of course, because in our country it is the British who decide how an Indian lives -- what he may buy, what he may sell
And from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition
(He looks at them, a teasing but mordant grin
) So it is only natural that our best young minds assume an air of Eastern dignity, while greedily assimilating every Western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it
His smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and self-conscious
(defensively) If we have Home Rule that will change
Gandhi has finished the last potato
He glances at Nehru then drops the potato in the bowl
He lifts the pail of peelings to Nehru
Would you, please
Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly
His friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen
And why should the English grant us Home Rule
Here, we must take the peelings to the goats
He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism
We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere
(surprised) thought you were against fighting
They have reached the trough
Just spread it around -- they like the new peelings mixed with the rotting ones
Nehru has carefully walked around something distasteful on the ground, now he dumps the peelings along the trough and spreads them "delicately
" Gandhi scoops some peelings from the trough to feed a goat that nudges him
Where there is injustice, 've always believed in fighting
(He looks at Nehru
) The question is do you fight to change things, or do you fight to punish
(His smile
) For myself,  have found that we are all such sinners we should leave punishment to God
And if we really want to change things there are better ways of doing it than by derailing trains or slashing someone with a sword
He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them
Then something catches Gandhi's eye
He looks off
Ba stands, watching him, waiting
The fire is ready
Gandhi turns
The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes
He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen
You see, even here we live under tyranny
Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness, and his humor
He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends
They watch Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba
(reflectively) told you
Hm
but look at him
Some "fighter"
can see the British shaking now
Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of potatoes
-  - Clothes are dipped in the brownish water
Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river, washing clothes
It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water
But they are laughing at their task
But it's the ink that is the most diffic -- She stops, because coming along the riverbed toward them is a man (Shukla) who looks as though he has come a long, weary way
His face is gaunt, his little bundle of belongings pathetic
As he nears them, he pauses
am looking for Mr
Gandhi
'  -  -  - Shadowed, the end of the day
Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat
The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself
've wanted to speak to you for a long time
He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly
He does not eat yet, but his hunger is evident
Ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi
our crops
we can't sell them
We have no money
but the landlords take the same rent
His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him
He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it
Close shot
Ba
The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony
She glances up at Gandhi
-  -  - The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train
From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be
The station house
An open staff car pulls up through the press of the crowd
An English captain leaps out and pushes aggressively through the mass of bodies toward the platform
Again the darkness of the ill-lit station and the angle of the camera limit our vision
Clear the way there
Get out of the way
detail of British troops, already on the station, moves in his wake, just as aggressive toward the crowd as he is
Sir
Up here
The sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station
The captain turns briskly to two of his detail
Give me a leg up, will you
The two men join hands and the captain is hoisted up with an assist from Sergeant Putnam
We hear the train stop in the background
On the roof
The captain stands erect
What the hell is it, Sergeant
He is now standing and his face has frozen
It needs no answer from Putnam
Jesus
He turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at His point of view
The whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered thick with waiting crowds
They engulf the station house, back and front, and on the other side of the train more people are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the narrow street that stretches through the little collection of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered -- men, women with babes in arms, children
There is no excitement, hardly any movement -- just a vast congregation of people, waiting silently is the darkness -- and as the camera pans we see that the crowd extends, indiscernible, even beyond the range of light
(awed, a little frightened) What the hell is going on
don't know, sir
The agent says they got a telegram and it just said, he is coming
and gave the time of the train
Who the hell is he
don't know, sir
Featuring Gandhi
He has stepped down from the train
Shukla guides him, Ba and Charlie a step or two behind
Gandhi moves through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a little to either side
As he advances, the crowd parts -- it is almost eerily silent
As their clothes indicate, the area is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi as he moves through them
Most of the faces are gaunt and lean
destitute people
And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him
The sergeant and part of the detail and behind the captain
The captain stares
Then he looks around at the crowd, suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi
Who the devil are you
My name is Gandhi
Mohandas
Gandhi
There is a flicker of recognition, but uncertain
The captain stiffens; a steeling of the will
Another glance at the crowd, this time with an air of outraged authority
Well, whoever you are, we don't want you here
suggest you get back on that train before it leaves the station
(calmly, a glance at the crowd) They seem to want me
Now look here
'll put you under arrest if you'd prefer
On what charge
It has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the Captain is a little shaken by it
He glances at Charlie who stands behind Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain
don't want any trouble
He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown
am an Indian traveling in my own country
see no reason for trouble
It is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the Captain doesn't like, but Gandhi's unrelenting stare unnerves him
He glances at Charlie again
Well, there'd better not be
Again, the empty severity of weakness
He looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd
"Out of my way, there
Come on, move
" Gandhi smiles reflectively, and the crowd suddenly begins to buzz
Where all was silence before there is now the hum of excitement
Already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings
"Gandhi -- Gandhi -- Bapu -- Gandhiji"
'  -  - The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling
We feature a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha)
He lies on a straw mat
For years the landlords have ordered us to grow indigo, for dyeing the cloth
Always they took part of the crop as rent
Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening
It is the kind of listening that opens the heart
Behind him a mass of villagers sits stoically, outside the dwelling, waiting while their case is heard
Meha tries to speak unemotionally but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking through
But now the English factories make cloth for everyone
No one wants our indigo
And the landlords won't take their share
They say we must pay our rent in cash
Near to breakdown, he gestures around the empty house
What we could, we sold
The police have taken the rest
There is no food, we -- He cannot go on
understand
(He examines his hands a moment
) The landlords are British
It's a rhetorical question
Meha nods
Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, almost nothing remains
We see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the other older, and a girl, sixteen
And finally Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty
Meha looks at Gandhi and shakes his head hopelessly
Gandhi nods
He stands slowly
What we can do
we will try to do
The words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes
He glances at Meha's wife
Water comes to her eyes, and she lowers her head
Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps her to her, and the woman breaks, and sobs and sobs
-  -  - Gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant, his mind locked in sober reflection
Shukla shares the howdah with him, but does not dare break Gandhi's black mood
Is all Champaran like this, Shukla
Yes, Bapu
(He looks across the field
) The whole province
hundreds -- thousands
It registers with Gandhi -- but inside
moment
' Mohan --
Gandhi shakes himself from his absorption and looks back
Ba and Charlie are mounted on a similar howdah on another elephant, both being led by peasant boys
Charlie is pointing behind them
Coming along the path is a tall Indian policeman on a bicycle
He rides right past Charlie and Ba and comes alongside Gandhi
His attitude is superficially polite, but he is full of righteous authority
(he knows) Are you Mr
Gandhi
Yes
'm sorry but you are under arrest
am not sorry at all
It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but Ba
-  - ball is hit
The camera pulls back to reveal a lush, verdant pitch, white-garbed players, English, a few ladies dressed in First World War fashion watching under parasols near the clubhouse and in the shade of trees with a few officers and civil servants, while Indian servants discreetly serve cool drinks
The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then (to the wicket keeper) Who did you say would be buying the drinks
The wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again Oh, no -- He has looked up
car is pulling hurriedly in near the clubhouse, an officer in it, and people are streaming toward it
The car
major is standing on the back seat
An Indian corporal drives
've got no idea
All  know is there's a riot or something at Motihari in Champaran, and the whole company is ordered out
It's two days' march
That's why the match is off
It's mostly Muslim territory and the old man's taking no chances
Featuring the batsman and some of the players as they walk across the field toward the car
They know something's up
(disgusted) God, and it's the best innings 've had since Oxford
(dryly) India's full of grief, old man
The batsman "takes" on him facetiously, and we cut to: -  -  - small building on a little Anglicized square
It is surrounded by a milling angry throng of peasants
Featuring the front entrance
The English captain who was at the station when Gandhi arrived is on the top step, looking harried and tense
small detachment of Indian troops lines the step below him
Charlie Andrews is pushing through the crowd toward the captain
As he approaches, the Indian sergeant holds up his hand
(firmly) wish to see the prisoner, please
The captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, his determination
(reluctantly) All right, Sergeant
Charlie moves through the Indian soldiers and up toward the entrance
The captain stares out worriedly over the unruly crowd
-  - basement chamber -- dark, thick-walled and poorly lit
The camera has panned off a close shot of Gandhi as he turns in his cell at the sound of a door opening and approaching footsteps
We have seen only his head and shoulders, which are covered in a shawl
police guard leads Charlie across the rough, unfinished floor
As he comes to Gandhi's cell we get a fleeting glimpse of Gandhi sitting on a low pallet bed
Close shot
Gandhi as he recognizes his visitor
Charlie-- Reverse on Charlie
He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head
(a somber grin) Shades of South Africa
Close shot
Gandhi
Head and shoulders
He returns the grin, but anger and determination still dominate his mood
Not quite
They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing
Then it will be prison
(sympathetically) Did they take your clothes
And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time
He is wearing only a white loincloth, the shawl over his shoulders and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of his life
These are my clothes now
Charlie studies him a moment, and being Charlie, he understands
(affectionately) You always had a puritanical streak, Mohan
He grins, and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi
(in a tone of defensiveness) If  want to be one with them, have to live like them
think you do
( smile
) But  thank God we all don't
And Gandhi laughs
'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way
'm far too modest for such a display
And again Gandhi laughs
Charlie turns to the guard
Couldn't  be let in with the prisoner
am a clergyman
The police guard hesitates, and then unlocks the cell
Charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space between them
Gandhi has remained seated, pensive
Charlie studies him a moment
(a bit puzzled) They're calling you "Bapu
"  thought it meant father
(wistfully) It does
We must be getting old, Charlie
little grin, but his mood remains pensive -- and remote
What do you want me to do
Gandhi looks up -- his anger, his determination there, but then broken by a hopeless sigh
think, Charlie, that you can help us most by taking that assignment you've been offered in Fiji
Charlie is stunned, and obviously hurt
Gandhi proceeds more gently
have to be sure -- they have to be sure -- that what we do can be done by Indians
alone
And now Charlie understands
Gandhi smiles; warmth, and sadness
Then he speaks with a determined purposefulness, a friend's trust
But you know the strategy
The world is full of people who will despise what's happening here
It is their strength we need
Before you go, you could start us in the right direction
He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie
Charlie nods
He sighs, and rises slowly
must leave from Calcutta, and soon
You'll have to say goodbye to Ba for me
Gandhi rises, glancing wryly at the prison walls
He nods
When  get the chance
And now he faces Charlie; this is the moment of farewell
Well,  -- He doesn't know what to say, how to say it
Gandhi meets his eyes -- a smile that shelters Charlie's vulnerability, returns his love
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie
Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart
The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions
-  -  - It is packed to overflowing; restless
Gandhi sits in the dock
One or two sergeants-at-arms are trying to keep order, but it the uneven and menacing chanting of "Gandhi
Gandhi" coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the atmosphere with threat
The magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom; he signals his clerk (English) to him
(whispered conference) am going to clear the courtroom
(politely) 'm not sure we'd be able to
And it is a first hearing, it's supposed to be public
And he's a lawyer
The magistrate frowns
(worried, angry) don't know where they found the nerve for all this
'm sure  don't either, but the troops won't be here until tomorrow
How the press get here before the military
We see the front row from his point of view
Two or three Indian journalists and one European
That English clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday afternoon understand one of them even went to the Viceroy
The magistrate receives that news with some alarm
He indicates that the clerk take his place
Gandhi stands
The courtroom is silent, but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside
You have been ordered out of the province on the grounds of disturbing the peace
(defiantly) With respect,  refuse to go
The magistrate stares
The journalists write
The clerk swallows
The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside
(sternly) Do you want to go to jail
(not giving him an inch) As you wish
The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad
The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands for an answer
Finally (as much sternness as he can muster) All right
will release you on bail of one hundred rupees until reach a sentence
refuse to pay one hundred rupees
Again the magistrate stares
And so do the journalists
The magistrate wets his lips -- Then  --  will grant release without bail -- until  reach a decision
And now the court explodes
In the chaos of cheering and delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and heads for his chambers
The journalists are scribbling furiously
Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom
We hear cries of "Gandhi
-- Gandhi
-- Bapu
" Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony
huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below
As he smiles down at them, he is turned by Gandhiji
-- Gandhiji
Mr
Gandhi
Four young Indians -- elegantly dressed in English clothes -- are following him, having plunged through the crowd in the courtroom
beat -- and the first young man addresses him over the chaos
(his accent is as refined as his clothes) Gandhiji -- we are from Bihar
We received a cable this morning from an old friend who was at Cambridge with us
( smile
) His name is Nehru and  believe you know him
Gandhi reacts -- with surprise and caution
Indeed
He tells us you need help
And we have come to give it
Again Gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious
Behind him, the crowd begins to chant "Gandhi -- Gandhi
" want to document, coldly, rationally, what is being done here
It may take months -- many, many months
(they're eager, impressed) We have no pressing engagements
It sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even angry
You will have to live with the peasants
(They nod
) have nothing to pay you
(They only smile
) Hmm
He is looking at them with a soupcon of skepticism but he is beginning to smell victory
His name echoes around him and is taken up even louder as the news spreads to the street
'  -  -  - Almost total silence
The room is long, large and imposing -- hardwood floors, overhead fans, an aura of wealth and permanence
Footsteps pace its acres of space
and Sir George Hodge comes into frame
He is rich, middle-aged, Tory -- and at the moment feeling impotent and harried
don't know what this country is coming to
The Governor, Sir Edward Gait -- the portrait of the King prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as Sir George but for different reasons
His desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same covers -- and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers
We can just read "Gandhi" in a headline
He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand
But good God, man, you yourself raised the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition
Sir George looks at him -- half defensive, half defiant
They are old friends -- the same school, the same social class, long together in India -- and their argument is an argument between friend who accept the same premises
But even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly
And some of these others -- (he gestures to the folders again) beatings, illegal seizures, demanding services without pay, even refusing them water
In India
Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive
Nobody knows what it is to try to get these people to work
Well, you've make this half-naked whatever-he-is into an international hero
He picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle
"One lone man marching dusty roads armed only with honesty and a bamboo shaft doing battle with the British Empire
" (He lowers the paper dismally; then the ultimate bitterness) At home children are writing "essays" about him
Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily
Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk
couldn't take another two years of him to save my life
Sir George turns, and paces back toward him
For the first time we see Sir Edward's personal secretary (a male civil servant) sitting at a small desk and listening with highly developed unobtrusiveness
What do they want
It is the first sign of concession
Sir Edward lifts his eyes to his personal secretary
(reading precisely from a document) rebate on rents paid
(Sir George huffs
) They are to be free to grow crops of their own choice
commission -- part Indian -- to hear grievances
Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward
beat
(wearily) That would satisfy him
(a nod; then pointedly) And His Majesty's Government
It only needs your signature for the landlords
Sir George looks at the document on the secretary's desk moment
The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him
Sir George looks at it like a snake
The secretary picks up a pen and offers it
second, then Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily
It will be worth it to see the back of him
( flourish at the end of his signature, then he stands
) We're too damn liberal
Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet
Perhaps
But at least all this has made the Government see some sense about what men like Mr
Gandhi should be allowed, and what they should be denied
He turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal
(firmly) Things are going to change
'  -  -  - Jinnah moves from under the portico
His shining, expensive car is coming in the drive and stops by him
He opens the back door, but only the chauffeur is in the car
(in annoyance) Where is Mr
Gandhi
(distastefully) He said he preferred to walk, sir followed him most of the way
He's just turned the corner
Jinnah closes the door and looks across at the entrance in exasperation
The Prophet give me patience
He came Third Class
It's a disdainful comment and he drives the car off toward the garage
Gandhi comes around the corner of the wall into the entrance
He is carrying a bedroll and a bamboo walking stick
Herman Kallenbach is with him, dressed informally, also carrying a bedroll
Jinnah makes a "sophisticated" salaam
(with effort) My house is honored
Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality
(he makes the pranam) The honor is ours
May  introduce Mr
Kallenbach
He's an old friend (anticipating Jinnah's objection) and his interest is in flowers presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked
(the suave, but slightly ironic host) 'll send my gardener
'm sure you'll have much to discuss
'   -  - It is spacious, "English
" At the door, Jinnah introduces Gandhi to the room
Gentlemen -- the hero of Champaran
Again Gandhi grins at the extravagance
Only the stubborn man of Champaran
polite little laugh; Jinnah introduces him
Mr
Patel you know
(Patel bows
) Mr
Maulana Azad -- a fellow Muslim
recently released from prison
Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after that comment
Azad gives a gentle salaam
Mr
Kripalani
( bow -- we have seen him at the Congress Conference
) And of course you know Mr
Nehru
Gandhi turns
Featuring Nehru
He stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention
All the others have been dressed in European clothes
The handsome Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic -- much like the one that Gandhi once wore
For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile
(a play on Jinnah's introduction) am beginning to know Mr
Nehru
(to business: Gandhi has been admitted to the power circle, he is not the power) Well, 've called you here because 've had a chance to see the new legislation
It's exactly what was rumored
Arrest without warrant
Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious
He looks at Gandhi
Your writings are specifically listed
Gandhi nods at the "compliment," but they are all angered by the severity of it
So much for helping them in the Great War
(fire) There is only one answer to that
Direct action -- on a scale they can never handle
Again the temper of it produces a little silence
Then don't think so
He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea
Of them all, Nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician and Jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it
Terrorism would only justify their repression
And what kinds of leaders would it throw up
Are they likely to be the men we would want at the head of our country
His stand has produced a little shock of surprise
Holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile
've been catching up on my reading
He means Gandhi's of course
Jinnah looks at the two of them
Gandhi has removed his sandals and is sitting cross-legged on a fine upholstered chair
Jinnah's eyes rake him with anger and distaste
(coldly) too have read Mr
Gandhi's writings, but 'd rather be ruled by an Indian terrorist than an English one
And don't want to submit to that kind of law
(to Nehru -- diplomatically -- but with a trace of condescension) must say, Panditji, it seems to me it's gone beyond remedies like passive resistance
(in the silence) If  may -- , for one, have never advocated passive anything
They all look at him with some surprise
As he speaks, he rises and walks to the servant
am with Mr
Jinnah
We must never submit to such laws -- ever
And think our resistance must be active and provocative
They all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them
want to embarrass all those who wish to treat us as slaves
All of them
He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him
It makes them all aware that the servant, standing there like an insensate ornament, has been treated like a "thing," a slave
As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah
Forgive my stupid illustration
But want to change their minds -- not kill them for weaknesses we all possess
It impresses each one of them
But for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution
And what "resistance" would you offer
The law is due to take effect from April sixth
want to call on the nation to make that a day of prayer and fasting
"Prayer and fasting"
They are not overwhelmed
You mean a general strike
(his grin) mean a day of prayer and fasting
But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration
The country would stop
Patel is the first to recognize the implications
My God, it would terrify them
(a wry smile) Three hundred fifty million people at prayer
Even the English newspapers would have to report that
And explain why
But could we get people to do it
(he is half sold already) Champaran stirred the whole country
(To Gandhi) They are calling you Mahatma -- the Great Soul
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where  live
(continuing, to the others) think if we all worked to publicize it
all of the Congress
every avenue we know
The idea has caught hold
As the others talk of "papers," "telegrams," "speeches," Jinnah looks over his cup at Gandhi with an air of bitter resignation, but he tries to make light of it
Perhaps  should have stayed in the garden and talked about the flowers
- '  -  - garden party in full imperial splendor
military band plays discreetly in the background
Princes, maharajahs, generals, ranking British civil servants and their ladies taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic flowers
But over all there is a thread of anxiety, we pick up one or two nervous phrases: "At the West Gate there were no taxis at all
," "Of course, the Army will always be loyal
" And the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a door of the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable forms
He searches the assembled guests, then heads with almost indecorous haste toward his target
It is the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford
With him, talking quietly, are his aide-de-camp, the Governor of the province and his , and the commanding general of the Army in India
Lord Chelmsford's  is the first to react to the civil servant's arrival and his impatient attendance
Sir -- it's Mr
Kinnoch
Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly
Yes
(hesitant, stunned) Nothing
nothing is working, sir -- buses
trains
the markets
(Personal, incredulous) There's not even any civilian staff here, sir
Everything has stopped
(curt, firm) Is it simply Delhi and Bombay
His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb
He holds the telegrams forward
No, sir -- Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore
It's, it's total
He glances at the general
(the ultimate) The Army had to take over the telegraph or we'd be cut off from the world
That takes the wind out of all of them
Grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens
can't believe it
He's going to sell his own paper tomorrow in Bombay
They've called for a parade -- on Victoria Road
(clenches his jaw and turns to the General) Arrest him
-  -  - prison door opens
Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room
The door is held open by a prison guard
-   -  -  - Nehru waits for Gandhi
He rises when Gandhi enters
The guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from Nehru
The guard closes the door, but remains in the room
Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting
Bapu
Gandhi, who also looks worn, rises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name
You too
He means "Bapu" -- "Father
" (a real smile, but the same affection) It seems less formal than "Mahatma
" Gandhi sighs, and their faces and minds go to more somber matters
Since your arrest the riots have hardly stopped
Not big --; but they keep breaking out
run to stop them
and Patel and Kripalani -- they are never at rest
But some English civilians have been killed, and the Army is attacking crowds with clubs -- and sometimes worse
Gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair
Maybe 'm wrong
maybe we're not ready yet
In South Africa the numbers were small
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do
But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you
The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence
(a sad smile) 've never spoken for anything else
-  - The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering
The sound of a car, and marching feet
The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees and then suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness
He is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis -- immaculate, precise, awesome
Behind them a staff car with Dyer's English  and a British police officer
It is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding
-  -  - large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling wall
large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park
It is political, but the crowd is mixed
We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old men, little children, women with babes in arms
Some donkey carts, a sense of fair-time gaiety
We close in on the speaker -- a Muslim
He clutches a copy (we need not see the title) of Gandhi's journal
England is so powerful -- its army and its navy, all its modern weapons -- but when a great power like that strikes defenseless people it shows it brutality, its own weakness
Especially when those people do not strike back
(He holds aloft the clenched journal
) That is why the Mahatma begs us to take the course of non-violence
-  - General Dyer, his armored car, his sepoys, moving toward the gate
Dyer looks ahead calmly
His point of view
The Gate of the Bagh
rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall
On each pillar, poster notices for the meeting: "For Congress -- For Gandhi
" In the distance the speaker and the assembled crowd
Nearer, a few vendors, loiterers and children
At the sound of the armored car and marching feet, a few turn in curiosity
Another angle
The armored car grinds forward
It won't go through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post
Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away
Dyer jumps down lightly -- a man in splendid condition
He walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back
looking off at The speaker -- medium shot
If we riot, if we fight back, we become the vandals and they become the law
If we bear their blows, they are the vandals -- God and His law are on our
(He glances up
) side
Long shot -- his point of view
The two platoons of sepoys, rifles at the port, trot smartly through the gate and fan out on either side of the motionless and dominant figure of Dyer
Resume the speaker
(soldiering on) We must have the courage to take their anger
Medium close -- the sepoys and Dyer
He issues his commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers
Port arms, Sergeant Major
The sergeant major issues the command
The troops port arms
Load
Again, the sergeant major barks the command, the bolts slam back and forth, the magazines clatter
Featuring the platform and the front of the crowd
They have all turned now to watch, frozen in incredulity and fascination
The sound of the sergeant major's orders and the sinister rattle of breeches and bolts drifting to them
(almost to himself as he too is riveted) Our pain will be our victory
Their point of view
The distant figures facing them
Resume the crowd
Numbly they begin to back away, pressing against the speaker's stand, themselves
man picks up a child
Their point of view
The small, distant figures of the sepoys again
word of command
One platoon kneels and takes aim
Another command
The second platoon, standing behind the first, takes aim
Featuring Dyer
His  approaches
The British police officer stands off to one side
Do we issue a warning, sir
(stiffly) They've had their warning -- no meetings
It is final
Resume the crowd
ripple of panic now, everyone pressing back, but still they cannot credit what they see
Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter
It is too late
Close shot Dyer, still calm
Sergeant Major -- Take aim
Long shot over the sepoys and their sights, the wavering crowd distant
Fire
Flash shot along the line of sepoys; the rifles jerk and bang
The crowd, running, screaming
Reload
dreadful press of panic-stricken people flying toward the walls
And again the crash of rifles
Some fall
Others run off-screen in an aimless, irresistible wave
Dyer is walking behind his men, telling them, with a view to maximum accuracy, what he has told them on the firing range (it makes him a little irritable to have to repeat it)
Take your time
Take your time
He looks off at the crowd
His eyes narrow
group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, some disappearing, a few heroic individuals astride the wall reaching down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below
Corporal
Sir
Over there
He nods
The corporal looks
Sir
He directs the attention of his neighbors in the firing line toward the new target; they shift their aim
man reaching for a child -- who is also propelled upward by its mother from below -- is hit, falls, so that he and the child crash into the crowd below
Sepoys firing ad lib
Dyer watching the effect, careful and conscientious
Swift tracking a man running through the staggering crowd, over the litter of bodies, his mouth open, his eyes wild
He arrives at a well, throws down the rope and slides down it
Others seize the idea and in panic throw themselves into the well, dropping out of sight
Featuring Dyer
Meticulously, he taps a corporal on the shoulder with his swagger stick and indicates the well
The corporal signals his line of men
At the well
The gathering crowd -- men, women -- and laced with rifle fire
From behind the sepoys we see the whole Bagh, littered with dead and dying, a thick ruck around the well, the walls hanging with wounded and dying, the firing continuing, loud, loud, louder
until -- : -     -  - Silence
The camera is close as it crosses a table with legal documents
Gradually we hear a muffled cough, whispers, shuffled papers, and it at last comes to a large close shot of General Dyer
Another angle
Commission of Inquiry sits in the large Armory Hall of the Old Fort
Dyer faces a panel of Commissioners: Lord Hunter, presiding, Mr
Justice Rankin, General Barrow, a British civil servant, and an Indian barrister
The Commission functions like a public parliamentary committee -- little ceremony, no judicial robes, a small group of public and press, who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier that isolates the Commission's business
Much of that public is English -- fellow officers and civilians
Government Advocate (English) turns to face Dyer
General Dyer, is it correct that you ordered your troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd
Dyer glances woodenly at the panel -- a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise
(righteously) That is so
The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief -- more at his attitude than his statement
One thousand five hundred and sixteen casualties with one thousand six hundred and fifty bullets
slight reaction from the public section
Dyer's jaw tightens
My intention was to inflict a lesson that would have an impact throughout all India
He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point
The evasiveness, the only half-buried embarrassment of their response only deepens his own withdrawal into himself
General, had you been able to take in the armored car, would you have opened fire with the machine gun
Dyer thinks about it
Then unashamedly -- think, probably -- yes
muted reaction from the public section
The Indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes
General, did you realize there were children -- and women -- in the crowd
(a beat) did
For the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his manner
But that was irrelevant to the point you were making
That is correct
There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel
Not so quickly in the public section
Could  ask you what provision you made for the wounded
Dyer looks at him quickly
The question is unexpected, even a little "clever
" The officers listening clearly resent it
(a moment, then firmly) was ready to help any who applied
And that answer stops the Advocate
He smiles dryly
General
how does a child shot with a 3-0-3 Enfield "apply" for help
Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut
-  - Quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry
The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall
We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety
And finally the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left
He is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly, desolately
Nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, the same benumbed grief and incredulity
Resume the wall -- Gandhi's point of view
The camera continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, little pieces of clothing
Flies buzz around the debris
Abstractedly, Gandhi touches the bucket rope that lies across the surround
Nehru has moved to the other side of the well
Gandhi lifts his eyes to him
: : -  -   -  - The imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India
We establish then cut into -  - Featuring the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford
You must understand, gentlemen, that His Majesty's Government -- and the British people -- repudiate both the massacre and the philosophy that prompted it
Chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference table
Just in front of this is the "British" side -- two generals (a full general and a brigadier), a naval officer, two senior civil servants, a senior police officer
Across from them is the "Indian" side: Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Jinnah, Azad
This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader
The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer -- coolly, but accepting it
That lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little
What  would like to do is to come to some compromise over the new civil legis -- If you will excuse me, Your Excellency, it is our view that matters have gone beyond "legislation
" It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry
It stops Chelmsford in mid-pace
We think it is time you recognized that you are masters in someone else's home
(It chills, stiffens; Gandhi proceeds only an iota softer) Despite the best intentions of the best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us
General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle
It is time you left
The British are stunned almost to speechlessness -- the audacity, the impossibility of it -- and from Gandhi of all people
The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover
With respect, Mr
Gandhi, without British administration, this country would be reduced to chaos
(patient, ironic) Mr
Kinnoch,  beg you to accept that there is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to the "good" government of an alien power
(indignantly, choked) My dear sir -- India is British
We're hardly an alien power
Gandhi and the others just look at him
Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends
Even if His Majesty could waive all other considerations, he has a duty to the millions of his Muslim subjects who are a minority in this realm
And experience has taught that his troops and his administration are essential in order to keep the peace
He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this
Gandhi knows the trouble this can cause and he answers more for those on his side than the Viceroy's
All nations contain religious minorities
Like other countries, ours will have its problems
(Flat, irrevocable) But they will be ours -- not yours
Its finality is such that for a moment there is no response at all, but then the General smiles
And how do you propose to make them yours
You don't think we're just going to walk out of India
His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side
Yes
in the end you will walk out
Because one hundred thousand Englishmen simply cannot control three hundred fifty million Indians if the Indians refuse to co-operate
And that is what we intend to achieve -- peaceful, non-violent, non-co- operation
He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them
Until you yourself see the wisdom of leaving
your Excellency
- Close shot -- a crystal decanter
The top is lifted, whiskey pours
The camera pulls back
We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed
The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours
(mocking his exchange with Gandhi) "You don't just expect us to walk out
" "Yes
" And they all laugh
Extraordinary little man
"Nonviolent, non-co-operation" -- for a moment almost thought they were actually going to do something
There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused
(thoughtfully) Yes -- but it would be wise to be very cautious for a time
The Anti- Terrorist Act will remain on the statutes, but on no account is Gandhi to be arrested
Whatever mischief he causes,  have no intention of making a martyr of him
It is an instruction they all find correct
-  - roar of approval from a huge crowd
We are featuring two British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness
Another angle
And we can see its cause
huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent
As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform
Nehru is with him
Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic
Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them
But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd
(simple, direct) but now something worse is happening
When Gandhiji and  were growing up, women wove their own cloth
But now there are millions who have no work because those who can buy all they need from England
say with Gandhiji, there is no beauty in the finest cloth if it makes hunger and unhappiness
It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away
There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru
At last he rises, and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos
In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting
Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills
My message tonight is the message have given to your brothers everywhere
To gain independence we must prove worthy of it
We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly
Gandhi holds up one finger
There must be Hindu-Muslim unity -- always
( second finger
) Secondly, no Indian must be treated as the English treat us so we must remove untouchability from our lives, and from our hearts
Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it
Now Gandhi raises a third finger
Third -- we must defy the British
And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause
Gandhi lets it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture as before
Not with violence that will inflame their will, but with firmness that will open their eyes
This has sobered the audience somewhat
Now he looks out across them as though seeking something
Then English factories make the cloth -- that makes our poverty
( reaction
) All those who wish to make the English see, bring me the cloth from Manchester and Leeds that you wear tonight, and we will light a fire that will be seen in Delhi -- and London
There is an excited stir; he silences it
And if, like me, you are left with only one piece of homespun -- wear it with dignity
Close shot -- the ground
As suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile
Featuring the two British soldiers -- later -- on the edge of the crowd, staring off, their faces now brightly lit by darting flames
Their point of view
huge triangular pile burns before the platform, an excited half-naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it
Resume the two British soldiers
They look at each other with a kind of fear a rampant crowd can excite in those who must hold it
-  - The small train station near the ashram
Kallenbach stands by a new (early 1920s) Ford touring car, watching as a train pulls into the station
As people start to jump off the train he moves forward
Featuring Patel, getting out of a compartment marked "Second Class
" He lugs a bedroll and a bag
Despite the Indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive, patrician lawyer he is under the skin
As he moves through the crowded platform
Excuse me -- just let me get out of your way, please
(Someone reaches for his bedroll and bag
) No, thank you, 'll manage
He looks up; it is Kallenbach who is the insistent "helper
" (joyous -- it's been a long time) Ah, Herman
(Of the bags) No, no -- don't destroy my good intentions
'm feeling guilty about traveling Second Class
Kallenbach is smiling too
He reaches for the bags again
do it as a friend -- and admirer -- not a servant
Ah, in that case
And grandly, he relinquishes the bags and looks back
Maulana is made of sterner stuff
Our trains met in Bombay, but he's back there in that lot somewhere
Their point of view
In the chaos of the Third Class we see Maulana Azad coming out of a section of the coach
He is carrying a baby wrapped in rags
The child's mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out
' - There he is -- out Gandhi-ing Gandhi
Azad hands the woman the baby and she obviously thanks him
He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera
Resume Patel and Kallenbach
(shaking his head at it all) When  think what our "beloved Mahatma" asks,  don't know how he ever got such a hold over us
Is he back
Yes
Now that things are moving he's going to write and only take part when it's necessary
Azad approaches them
(to Patel) It was a Hindu child and it tried to wet on me
He and Kallenbach clasp with their free hands, both grinning
Of course
Muslim beef eater -- 'm only surprised he missed
He was a she
Ah, that explains it
(He grins
) Well, do  carry your luggage as penance or -- There's another passenger -- a Miss Slade
(He turns automatically, as Patel and Azad do, toward the First Class section
) She's the daughter of an English admiral
(Patel and Azad look back at him in quick surprise
Kallenbach smiles
) She's been corresponding with him for a year
And the camera pans with their glances at they look back with real interest toward the First Class coach
Porters are unloading the baggage of two or three passengers here and helping some others (English and Indian) to board
In the foreground we see a tall Indian woman in a red sari
Farther along there is a large stack of luggage being added to by a porter
An English woman is hovering about it
She is well dressed, but rather dreary and unprepossessing, and the camera zooms in toward her
And what does the daughter of an English admiral propose to do in an ashram -- sink us
(quietly -- his manner) From the looks of the luggage, yes
Patel grins
Like most witty men, he loves wit in others
She wants to make her home with us -- and Gandhiji has agreed
Patel groans
They turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall Indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely English despite the sari
The minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled Kallenbach
You'd be Mr
Kallenbach
Kallenbach recovers sufficiently to -- And you would be Miss Slade
(proudly) prefer the name Gandhiji has given me -- Mirabehn
The word means "daughter
" Patel and Azad stare at each other in something like bafflement
-  - An ox labors along in harness
We follow him for a moment, then move along the traces of the harness to the Ford touring car that it is pulling
In the car Kallenbach and Mirabehn sit in the front seat, Patel and Azad in the back
Closer
(of the car) It was a gift and it only worked a few weeks, but when Gandhi came home he struck on this idea
He calls it his ox-Ford
Comfortable -- and yet more our pace
He does what little steering is necessary and Mirabehn smiles at it all, finding everything delightful
She peers ahead in the direction of the distant ashram
Might Mr
Nehru be there too
(glibly) The irresponsible young Nehru is in prison -- again
Though there is a rumor that under pressure from your country, they will let him out -- again
Mirabehn has turned to look at him
She has the same sophomoric eagerness and intensity as the young Gandhi
You can't know how closely we follow your struggle -- (to Patel personally) how many in England admired what you did in Bardoli
It must have taken enormous courage
Well, in this country one must decide if one is more afraid of the government or Gandhi
(Of Azad, Kallenbach and himself) For us, it's Gandhi
Mirabehn is enthralled by the wit, the modesty that underlines the words
She faces Kallenbach
(a note of wonder) And you're German
Yes
And do you feel Indian
She thinks she does, and that he would want to
No
It surprises, but it doesn't deflate
But you've been with him so long -- why
Kallenbach, whose size and stillness carry the aura of some great piece of primitive sculpture -- solid, true, disturbingly profound -- searches inside himself for the answer
'd come to believe  would never meet a truly honest man
And then met one
It is so profoundly simple and deeply felt that it obviously touches the deeply emotional Mirabehn
'  -  - Ba has a spinning wheel on the small porch and Gandhi is sitting next to her with another
He is trying to imitate her action -- which is fast and dexterous -- and he gets in a terrible jumble
Ba watches, laughing
Stop -- stop
She leans across and tries to extricate his fingers
God gave you ten thumbs
(morosely) Eleven
And Ba laughs again and Gandhi smiles, tapping her with playful reproval on the top of her bent head
There are footsteps and Gandhi looks up
Patel stands in the doorway
Gandhi's face changes to something like elation
beat
Sardar
It means "leader" and it is the name the peasants have given Patel
Gandhi uses it with an intonation of novelty and respect
He stands and crosses to Patel, clutching him emotionally, and it brings a bit of emotion from the sophisticated Patel
Gandhi holds him back to look at him
What you've done is a miracle
You have made all India proud
Patel gets hold of himself, and affects his usual glib cynicism
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day
(laughs) Not true
(He means himself
) The secret is mastering the urge
He smiles again, then, his arm still around Patel's shoulder, he turns to greet the others
Azad looks at him, then facetiously, as though to put down Patel
He came Second Class
Gandhi laughs again, squeezing Patel's shoulder
Well, we can't expect miracles all the time
(Then to Azad, more soberly) Your news  understand is not so good
Azad shakes his head
No
Gandhi reaches forward and touches his hand, and he sees Mirabehn on the porch
For a moment their eyes meet and then Mirabehn moves forward quickly and takes his hand, kissing it, tears running down her cheek
Gandhi touches the top of her head
Come, come -- you will be my daughter
- '  -  - The camera is on a row of sandals by the door -- Patel's, Azad's, Desai's, Gandhi's
It pans to the room
Gandhi sitting facing Patel and Azad, Desai in the background, making notes of the discussion
Gandhi is carding fiber to thread as they talk
Mirabehn, seated like the others, is almost in the circle, sitting near Ba, and listening like her
Ba's spinning never stops
but then some rioting broke out between Hindus and Muslims -- violent, terrible
Gandhi looks up at Azad, Azad shakes his head solemnly Whether it was provoked
(he shrugs, a hint of suspicion) But it gave them an excuse to impose martial law throughout Bengal
(He looks at Gandhi, shaking his head grimly
) Some of the things the military have done
But he does not go on
It has a terrible sobriety
Is the campaign weakening
Azad shakes his head
The marches and protests are bigger if anything but with the censorship here (a nod toward Mirabehn) they know more in England than we do, and it saps the courage to think you may be suffering alone
Gandhi reaches out and touches his hand
They are not alone
And martial law only shows how desperate the British are
He holds Azad's eyes, giving strength
Then he turns to Mirabehn, made more aware of her by Azad's reference
For a moment he looks at her sari
Is that homespun
Or cotton from Leeds
The tone suggests he thinks it is homespun
Mirabehn nods, a little choked that his attention is turned to her
--  sent for it, from here dyed it myself
Gandhi smiles approvingly
Then a shadow -- What do the workers in England make of what we're doing
It must have produced hardship
Mirabehn beams
It has
But you'd be surprised
They understand -- they really do
It's not the workers you have to worry about
Good
( glance toward Ba
) Ba will have to teach you to spin too
would rather march
First spin
Let the others march for a time
Mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at Ba
Ba is spinning
She smiles
First lesson: To march, wear shoes, to spin, do not
Mirabehn looks down at the shoes on her feet -- and then at the others and their bare feet -- and she looks up in grinning, self-conscious embarrassment
Ba smiles at her affectionately
'll teach you all our foolishness, and you must teach me yours
Mirabehn looks at her, accepting the warmth behind the teasing
It is the beginning of an enduring friendship
-  - small town
Featuring the faces of six Indian police constables as a torch light parade passes them
There are enough of them in their group to be watching the marchers with a challenging disdain
The marchers are men in loin- clothes and tunics; they brandish torn and ripped English cloth and shout in unison
Home Rule
Long live Gandhi
Buy Indian
Long live Gandhi
We have cut to the parade -- and it is the tail end, going around a corner ahead
Some of the marchers wave their cloth tauntingly at the police
One policeman suddenly steps out and grabs at a piece of cloth waved at him
He pulls it viciously from the marcher
'll stuff your damn mouth with it
He chases the marcher and boots him with his foot
Another marcher runs at the policeman, swinging at him with his piece of cloth
Leave him alone -- he wasn't harming you
Another angle -- sudden
He is whacked across the face with a billy club and falls, clutching his face and spouting blood from his nose
Another angle
The police are now all attacking, swinging clubs and kicking at the tail-enders of the march
And the tail-enders begin to scream - Help
Help us
as they try to scramble away from the attack
Out of shot we can still hear the disappearing chant: "Home Rule
Long live Gandhi
" -  - The parade is on this street
tail-ender, blood streaming down his face, runs around the corner
lose shot -- the tail- ender
As he stops - (screaming) Help
Help us
Another angle
Some of the marchers turn at the shout
- few of the tail-enders watching, some running clear of the police, some being beaten
Two police have a man on the ground
One policeman looks up
Hey -- Their point of view
The corner where the parade has disappeared
It is now packed with more marchers, more flooding in from behind
We see the whole street, the marchers massed near the corner, spread out, staring at the police, who are now frozen in their mayhem, staring off at the marchers
For a second, utter silence
And then the police begin to back away from their victims
The marchers start to move forward
The police draw their guns, and the marchers suddenly run at them, a guttural roar, as though they were one single wild beast
Featuring the police
They start to run, some turning to fire at the pursuing crowd, then running on
-  - small building for this small town
policeman on duty holds the door and the fleeing police, first one, then two more, then the last three, run into the building
The crowd surges around it, smashing windows, hurling stones
Close shot
English cloth shirts pushed together and ignited
Second close shot
Trousers, already aflame, being hurled through a broken window
All around, the noise of the angry, surging crowd, stones raining on the building
Shouts: "Out -- Out
" Later
corner of the building engulfed in flames
The camera pulls back and we see the whole building swept with fire
The heat of it keeps the crowd back but they are still shouting "Out -- Out
-- Out" -- and a sudden cheer
At the door of the flaming building
One policeman appears, his face blackened with soot, his hands up over his head
Another appears in the smoke behind him, and they start to come out -- not only the original six but the five or six others who were in the building -- rushing suddenly from the heat of the fire
Close shot -- the crowd
We are close on the body of the first policeman as he runs into the crowd and on the instant we see a sword slash at his arm
Another angle
The crowd massed around the fallen figure, a flash of the sword going up over the heads -- a breathless pause -- and it comes down again
savagely
Later
The flames of the crumbled building
The crowd has gone and we only hear the roar of the flames
The camera pans across the flames, and we see a skull, charred flesh still clinging to it, the eyes black holes, the teeth bare as it burns in the fire
'   -  - Close shot -- Gandhi
His face drawn, stunned, as he stares emptily at the floor
He is sitting on the carpet in the center of the room
moment of silence and then we begin to hear the tick of a clock, the sounds of others moving in the room, and finally ' That's one bit of news they haven't censored
Another angle
Patel leans with one arm on a table, his mood as devastated as Gandhi's; he is looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand
moment then ' Oh, it's all over the world
(ironically) India's "non-violence
" He has been standing, looking out of a window
He turns, and tosses a newspaper on a desk
It is a New York Times and we just glimpse the picture of the severed head lying in the smoldering ashes
And now we see Nehru and Azad in the background too
And Desai
Jinnah as usual in a finely cut European suit, the others are dressed in tunics of homespun as they will be to the end
(bleakly) What can we do
(sepulchrally) We must end the campaign
They turn to him -- a sense of surprise, but they don't really believe he means the statement
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye
(he hasn't moved; the same tone) An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind
(Now he looks up at them
) We must stop
(a baffled smile) Gandhiji -- do you know the sacrifices people have made
He looks at him
Gandhi doesn't move
Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah
Azad keeps his eyes fixed on Gandhi, sensing, fearing what is going to happen
We would never get the same commitment again -- ever
He looks at Gandhi with a mounting sense of annoyance
Gandhi is listening, but still withdrawn into himself
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed  want no part of it
(pleading) It was one incident
(quietly) Tell that to the families of the policemen who died
Jinnah turns away in anger
Patel sighs
Nehru feels helpless but he continues to try
Bapu -- the whole nation is marching
They wouldn't stop, even if we asked them to
Gandhi stares into nothing -- mulling that
Finally will ask
And  will fast as penance for my part in arousing such emotions -- and  will not stop until they stop
Nehru stares at him -- surprised
Azad is not
(disgustedly) God
You can be sure the British won't censor that
They'll put it on every street corner
Gandhi does not react
And Nehru ignores the thought too, because like Azad his mind is already on the real danger
But -- but Gandhiji people are aroused
they won't stop
Gandhi looks up at him -- a resigned fatalism
If  die, perhaps they will
-  - Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi's bungalow
She carries a small tray with a pitcher and a glass
We see a few people working in the background, and a mass of people camped near the entrance, some sprawled, some sitting, some standing -- all waiting
The steps of Gandhi's bungalow
doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch, reading
On a small table beside him we a stethoscope and the equipment to measure blood pressure
He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps, and nods
Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is suddenly brought up
'  -   - '    - In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed
She is holding him as he heaves in a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall
When he is finished, he lies almost limp in her arms and she gently lowers him to the mat
She strokes his head
Mirabehn stiffens herself
She is not yet devotee and nurse
She removes her sandals and walks across the room
Ba looks up at her
She glances at the jug and glass, then nods
She turns to Gandhi
(softly) must get ready for evening prayers
Mirabehn is here
She strokes his sweating head again, touches his shoulder and gets up
For a moment the two women hold each other's gaze, then Ba smiles weakly, and leans her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder
With her free hand Mirabehn touches Ba's head
Then Ba straightens, and leaves without looking back
Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side
've brought your drinking water
May  turn you
Gandhi struggles to turn, and Mirabehn helps him
When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them
She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher
There is a little lemon juice in it
That is all
She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru -- there was a telegram
Almost everywhere it has stopped
Gandhi swallows with difficulty
He pauses, letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again
He tries to smile
When it is everywhere, then my prayers will be answered
Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability
Do you find me stubborn
(her own honesty) don't know
know you are right
don't know that this is right
Gandhi signals her down to him
She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear
(hoarse, strained) When  despair,  remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won
We intercut their faces, very close, as he speaks
There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible
But in the end they always fall
Think of it -- always
When you are in doubt that that is God's way, the way the world is meant to be
think of that
During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion
(the paternal smile) And then -- try to do it His way
( tear runs down Mirabehn's face
She touches his shoulder
Gandhi just leans his head back in exhaustion
) And now -- could  have another feast of lemon juice
Mirabehn straightens up, smiling, wiping the tear from her cheek with mock discipline
She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught
Her point of view
The doorway
Nehru stands in it
Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him
Panditji -- come in
She stands, moving back from Gandhi
Nehru crosses and kneels in Mirabehn's place
Gandhi looks up at him and his eyes light
He moves his shaking hand out and Nehru clasps it
moment of personal feeling between them, then Jinnah, Patel, all of Congress has called for the end of non-co- operation
There's not been one demonstration
All over India people are praying that you will end the fast
They're walking in the streets, offering garlands to the police -- and to British soldiers
It is a victory
Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin
(croaked) Perhaps -- perhaps  have overdone it
And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time
He buries his head on Gandhi's hand, clutching it to him
-  - Bright sunshine
little boy is pulling a goat by a tether
He turns with a bright smile
Good morning, Bapu
Reverse angle
Gandhi is walking, holding Ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and Mirabehn's with the other
It is some days later
Good morning
(Of the goat) Don't let her go
If she bumps me am done for
The boy grins at Gandhi's feigned alarm
Don't worry
milk her every day, she's not -- The sound of a motor disturbs them
Gandhi turns
His point of view
Coming into the entrance, along the bumpy path are two police cars (early 1920s Morris)
They have to stop because they are impeded by Gandhi's ox-Ford
Four Indian policeman hop quickly out of the second car British police superintendent, and his British deputy get more decorously out of the first
Another angle
Gandhi has turned with his two props, Ba and Mirabehn
The police are approaching him
Kallenbach is running from the fields
Nehru is hurrying from another building carrying sheaves of page proofs
Other ashramites converge from the fields and buildings
The British police superintendent (who is Scottish) stops before Gandhi
(a beat) Sedition
(it is too absurd) You can't be serious
This man has just stopped a revolution
(uncomfortably; he knows) That's as may be
only know what am charged to perform
Nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity
don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid
Panditji -- please, help me
It stops Nehru
He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side
Gandhi turns to Mirabehn
You must help Herman -- and Ba
(He releases her, and says more loudly to the others) have been on many trips -- it is just another trip
He smiles at them, then slips his free hand on Nehru's shoulder and he turns to the superintendent
am at your command
Featuring Gandhi, Ba and Nehru, as they walk to the car behind the somewhat surprised superintendent
(to Nehru) If there is one protest -- one riot -- a disgrace of any kind,  will fast again
He looks at Nehru firmly
Nehru knows him well enough now not to argue -- even at this, though his face shows the struggle
(and now he smiles -- Gandhi to Nehru, special) know India is not ready for my kind of independence
If  am sent to jail, perhaps that is the best protest our country can make at this time
And if it helps India,  have never refused to take His Majesty's hospitality
He laughs and Nehru struggles to join in the joke
-  -  - quiet hum in a packed courtroom
Armed sepoys line the wall
Featuring Judge Broomfield and the clerk
The Judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face
At last, he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk
The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice -- Call the prisoner to the bar
The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench
The courtroom immediately falls silent
The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly
He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly
Featuring Judge Broomfield
As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi
Featuring two English court reporters
One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge
Their point of view
The clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands
Resume the reporters
disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them
They glance back
Full shot -- the courtroom
The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all
Featuring Gandhi
He takes the prisoner's stand
He looks around, a little surprised, a little affected by the demonstration
He looks up at the judge
For a minute their eyes meet, the judge makes a little bow to Gandhi
Gandhi reciprocates
and the judge sits down
Featuring the reporters shrugging incredulously to each other, as they sit once more
Later
The Advocate General is speaking from a folded journal
"Non-co-operation has one aim: the overthrow of the Government
Sedition must become our creed
We must give no quarter, nor can we expect any
" (He looks up at Gandhi
) Signed
Gandhi, in your journal Young India, dated twenty-second March of this year
Do you deny writing it
Not at all
(To the judge) And  will save the Court's time, 'Lord, by stating under oath that to this day  believe non-co-operation with evil is a duty
And that British rule of India is evil
There is a little shock of reaction around the courtroom
The Advocate General smiles with a brittle disdain, then he turns to the judge
The Prosecution rests, 'Lord
The judge nods
He turns, glancing at the empty table for defense counsel, and then to Gandhi
take it you will conduct your own defense, Mr
Gandhi
have no defense, My Lord
am guilty as charged
(Then testingly) And if you truly believe in the system of law you administer in my country, you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible
It is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane Broomfield
The reporters scribble, watching the Judge even as they write, because the mere doubt in the Judge's face reflects on the whole position of the British to India
Featuring Judge Broomfield
He lowers his glasses soberly, staring at them for a moment
It is impossible for me to ignore that you are in a different category from any person  have ever tried, or am likely to try
He looks up at Gandhi and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest
(a long beat) It is nevertheless my duty to sentence you -- to six years' imprisonment
stunned intake of breath from the whole courtroom, then in absolute silence the clerk scribbles the sentence in his notebook
pause
The Judge lowers his eyes
(a personal statement, not a real hope) If however His Majesty's Government could -- at some later date -- see fit to reduce that term, no one would be better pleased than
He folds, and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone he rises
The court rises and he walks stiffly to his chambers
Featuring Gandhi
He stands, staring at Broomfield, and now it is his face that shows the respect
-  - Long shot
From far above the hills we see a car traveling along the road
Its style tells us some years have passed
Featuring Walker -- close
The reporter from the New York Times, whom we first saw as a younger man in South Africa
He is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees
' - (English accent) Yes, 'm sure that's exactly what they hoped
Put him in prison a few years and with luck he'd be forgotten
And maybe they'd even subdue him
We see from Walker's point of view an Indian woman walking along the road, leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce
Two young girls in ragged saris walk with her, and a boy of eight leads a smaller camel behind them
They are staring off at the car
Resume Walker
He swings back around, fascinated with what he is seeing of India
The car is an early 1930s Morris Minor
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten
And as soon as he got out he was back tramping the country, preaching non-violence and demanding a free India
Everybody knows another showdown's coming -- but when, and over what -- He shrugs, "Nobody knows"
Well,  read you account of that crowd in Calcutta and that he was twisting the Lion's tail again
Collins has suddenly slowed the car, then swerves around a pair of elephants hauling logs
(falteringly) and  knew something had to give
And  was determined to be here when it did
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway
Oh, 've been a Gandhi buff for a long time
Collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car around another procession of camels heading toward the port
He certainly makes good copy
( laugh
) The other day Winston Churchill called him "that half-naked Indian fakir
" Walker smiles too, but it soon passes
met him once
Collins looks at him in real surprise
You mean Gandhi
(nods) Back in South Africa
(reflectively) long time ago
What was he like
Lots of hair
and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out
Well, he must've found some of the answers
He honks as he goes around a wooden-wheeled cart
-  -  - Simple
Austere
Filtered light
Featuring Gandhi -- close
He is looking straight ahead
Reverse angle
Across the emptiness of the temple, Ba faces him
(a step forward) "In every worthy wish of yours, shall be your helpmate
" Another angle featuring Walker and Collins, who are sitting alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, watching with fascination as Gandhi and Ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them, Walker jotting notes occasionally, but his eyes always glued to Gandhi and Ba, who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know
(a step) "Take a fourth step, that we may be ever full of joy
" Wide shot
Showing the two of them before the altar of the temple, moving closer to each other
(a step) " will ever live devoted to you, speaking words of love and praying for your happiness
" Close shot -- Gandhi
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people
" " will follow close behind you and help to serve the people
" Featuring Walker, now too entranced by the ceremony, by the depth of layered emotions in Gandhi and Ba's voices and eyes to take any notes
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life
" " will follow you in all our vows and duties
" Ba and Gandhi
Near to meeting now
(a last step) "Take the seventh step, that we may ever live as friends
" Ba takes the last step, so that they are face to face beat
"You are my best friend
my highest guru, and my sovereign lord
" For a moment their eyes hold -- the many dreams, and hopes and pain -- the love of many years
Walker watches, his own face taut with emotion
Resume Gandhi and Ba
And Gandhi slowly lifts his hand
Then  put a sweetened wheat cake in her mouth
He touches Ba's lips with his extended fingers and she kisses them gently
And  put a sweetened wheat cake in his mouth
She has lifted her fingers to his mouth and he kisses them gently
Featuring Walker and Collins both touched, the overtly cynical American obviously even more than the likeable Englishman
Gandhi turns to them
And with that we were pronounced man and wife
(Solemnly) We were both thirteen
-  -  - tiny, beautiful city rising steeply out of the Arabian Sea with tall, thick-walled buildings, half-fortresses, half- homes, their white walls tinted amber and gold now by the early light of the sun
Featuring Gandhi, sitting on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation
He becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder
Gandhi smiles
Walker comes to his side, looking out over the bay and city, truly impressed
It's beautiful
Even as a boy  thought so
Walker looks down at him
Gandhi scowls up in the early light
Trying to keep track of you is making me change all my sleeping habits
Gandhi smiles
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen
Hm
(Then weightedly) Is it
Perhaps
've come here to think about it
They both watch the waves beat on the shore a moment, the changing hues of the sunrise on the whites of Porbandar
(musing) Do you remember much of South Africa
great deal
've traveled so far -- and thought so much
(He smiles in self- mockery, and turns toward the city
) As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians
(He looks at Walker
) The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami
It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped
He looks out to sea, and we intercut his face with Walker's, the sea, and the town itself as the sun turns it white
When  was a boy  used to sing a song in that temple: " true disciple knows another's woes as his own
He bows to all and despises none
Earthly possessions hold him not
" Like all boys  said the words, not thinking of what they meant or how they might be influencing me
(He looks at Walker
then out to the sea again, shaking his head
) 've traveled so far
and all 've done is come back home
Walker studies him as this profound man reaches, in his middle years, a profound insight
Featuring Gandhi staring out to sea, his mind locked in reflection, and suddenly his head lifts, his eyes become alert, he is caught by some excitement which he weighs for a moment, then he stands, his manner suddenly tingling with optimism
Walker stares at him, then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at
His point of view
The waves lapping the shore below them
Walker turns back to Gandhi, puzzled
But there is no mistaking the sudden glow in Gandhi's face
You know what you're going to do
Gandhi looks at him, a teasing smile
It would have been very uncivil of me to let you make such a long trip for nothing
The grin broadens, and then he starts briskly down the promontory
Walker scrambles up after him
Where are you going
Gulls fly over them, squawking in the growing light
Gandhi pauses, looking up at the gulls, then back down to the sea
'm going back to the ashram (then firmly) and then 'm going to prove to the new Viceroy that the King's writ no longer runs in India
He turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident, elated, then he continues on down the promontory
Still baffled, Walker glances at the sea, at him, then hurries after
Full shot
The waves running against the shore
'  -  - Close shot -- the Viceroy, a "new one," Lord Irwin
Salt
Another angle
He is looking in astonishment at his principal secretary
His , a general, a brigadier, a senior police officer are with him
Like him they hold the same offices, but are a new team
Yes, sir
He is going to march to the sea and make salt
Irwin looks at him, still trying to penetrate the significance of the act
The senior police officer helps
There is a Royal Monopoly on the manufacture of salt, sir
It's illegal to make it or sell it without a Government license
Irwin has listened; it's beginning to make a little sense
All right -- he's breaking the law
What will he be depriving us of, two rupees of salt tax
It's not a serious attack on the revenue, sir
Its primary importance is symbolic
Don't patronize me, Charles
The principal secretary blanches
No, sir
-- in this climate, sir, nothing lives without water -- or salt
Our absolute control of it is a control on the pulse of India
Irwin looks at his , then paces a bit, pondering it
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"
Yes, sir
The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India
" Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt
moment as Irwin considers it, then it is the general who speaks
say ignore it
Let them raise their damn flags, let him make his salt
It's only symbolic if we choose to make it so
(pointedly) He's going to arrive at the sea on the anniversary of the massacre at Amritsar
Irwin has turned to him
And this makes up his mind
General Edgar is right -- ignore it
Mr
Gandhi will find it's going to take a great deal more than a pinch of salt to bring down the British Empire
He is concerned enough to be angry, but certain enough to be dogmatic
-  - It is very early, the light just beginning to break, and we are looking out across the river toward the distant town, and against the pink glow of the sky we can see people in groups wading across the river toward the ashram
And suddenly a mass of people, hidden by the embankment, appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, and the camera lifts slightly with their movement and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river, all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city
And around the ashram many fires are burning, people are cooking breakfast, some are packing knapsacks for the journey, others are strewing the path from the ashram with leaves
'  -  - Quiet, just the buzz of activity from outside the building
Gandhi lies on a mat and Ba and Mirabehn are massaging him with oil as he checks page proofs, an oil lamp by his side
Nehru sits cross-legged next to him, taking the proofs as Gandhi finishes them
Maulana Azad sits to one side
Behind them Desai is making notes on Gandhi's instructions
(to Nehru) the real test will come if  am arrested
If there is violence we lose all our moral advantage
This time it mustn't happen
He looks at Nehru and Azad solemnly to emphasize the point
Nehru nods; a little smile
We're not beginners anymore
We've been trained by a strict sergeant major
He means Gandhi of course, and Gandhi accepts the reference, but it is the acceptance of the strict sergeant major: "Don't fail me
" Then he looks to Azad
If 'm taken, Maulana is to lead the march
If he is arrested, Patel, then Kripalani, then yourself
Nehru nods
Ba moves to massage the top of Gandhi's head
You should be relaxing
Gandhi grins, looking at Mirabehn, who is massaging his legs
'm sure 'm fit for at least five hundred miles
You should ride the pony
It is not necessary to walk to prove the point
Gandhi looks at Nehru, a benign shrug
have two of them bossing me now
Nehru smiles
He stands, having taken the last proof sheet
Azad rises with him
We must get these to the printer
(He looks down at Gandhi
) know it will succeed
Even my mother is prepared to march
Gandhi is pleasurably impressed with that
And Jinnah
(a beat) He's waiting
He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think
(smiles confidently) Wait and see
wait and see
He leans back and closes his eyes
Ba rubs his head soothingly
Nehru bends and squeezes his arm in farewell
Gandhi nods, not opening his eyes
Nehru and Azad smile at Ba and leave
-  -  - The sun higher, but still early light
green, white and saffron flag (the colors of India) is pulled up an uneven pole
The sound of gentle clapping
Gandhi is off to one side, just in front of the veranda of his bungalow, not paying attention to the ceremony
Ba and Mirabehn watch from the veranda as Pyarelal (Desai's new assistant), with a knapsack over his own shoulders, hands Gandhi his
As Gandhi slips it on, the ashramite boy whom we saw with the goat hands him a long staff
And Gandhi moves around the edge of the bungalow, heading toward the entrance of the ashram
long line of ashramites and marchers stretches from opposite the flagpole to the entrance of the ashram
As Gandhi walks briskly along it, they turn, ready to follow him
When he nears the entrance Gandhi sees Walker standing in front of a collection of newsmen, cameramen, a newsreel crew
He begins to smile, Walker returns it
Gandhi pauses by him
(of the press) You've done me a great service
(a grin, then a play on Gandhi's words to him) It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing
Gandhi smiles
He turns back toward his bungalow
Ba and Mirabehn stand there watching, Desai with them
Gandhi holds their gaze a second, then turns and starts forward
Pyarelal takes up a position next to him, the marchers follow
Featuring Walker
He steps back, letting Gandhi proceed into the range of the cameras on his own
The crowd around the entrance throws flowers in Gandhi's path, some calling out, "Long live Mahatma Gandhi
" Gandhi passes the cameramen and starts along the trail
'  -  - thinner crowd here, but going all along the path
To one side we see two police cars drawn up, and several policemen (a British officer, a British sergeant, and four Indian constables) lined up near them
As Gandhi nears them Walker moves up beside him
Some of the newspaper cameramen trot behind to get the picture of Gandhi's arrest
Among the newsmen we see Collins
Featuring Gandhi and Walker, Pyarelal just behind them all glancing ahead at the police, who are now quite near
Is it over if they arrest you now
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand
(He looks at Walker
) It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns
Walker smiles -- a little uneasily -- for they are now near the police
Gandhi nods to them amiably as he passes along in front of them
Walker is turning, watching for a move from the police but begins to grasp that there may be none
He hurries along closer to Gandhi again, one eye still on the police
What if they don't arrest you
What if they don't react at all
Gandhi glances at him
Walker too wears a knapsack
Gandhi nods to it, though never breaking his pace
Do you still have your notebook
(Walker fumbles for it; Gandhi goes right on talking
) The function of a civil resister is to provoke response
And we will continue to provoke until they respond, or they change the law
They are not in control -- we are
That is the strength of civil resistance
He nods politely toward the British police officer at the end of the police line
Walker stops, letting the procession march on by him, looking at the British police officer, then writing busily in his notebook
Collins stop by him
What'd he say
(wryly) He said he's in charge
-  - dusty approach to a dusty little village
Both sides of the track are lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves, all gazing expectantly down the road
Behind them the village is strung with the green, white and saffron colors of Independence
Two large policemen stand arms-akimbo at the front of them all, their postures imposing and threatening, though the impression is somewhat weakened by the children skirting around them
little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play
The crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky
"Gandhi
Long live Mahatma Gandhi
" Another angle
Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them
newsreel truck and crew ride along about two-thirds of the way back
car of cameramen and reporters tails at the end
Featuring Gandhi
He looks at Walker, walking along a few paces behind him, at the side of the procession
He is wiping sweat from his face
Are you going to walk all the way
(a weary grin) My name is Walk-er
And  intend to report it the way it is
Gandhi smiles and turns back
He shakes his head
(to himself) "My name is Walk-er"
And grinning at it, he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd
Long shot, high
As the procession trails into the village, we see several villagers, knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders, run around the police and join the end of the procession
-  - In the dark a large group of students comes stumbling, laughing, across the ditch that separates the road from the field
The student leader gets clear of the ditch and comes upon Pyarelal and Walker
They are standing near a group of American newsmen playing poker by a campfire
He addresses Pyarelal good-naturedly
We've come to join the march
What do we do
(bluntly) Be sure you're awake in the morning
(It comes from a knowledge of students
He smiles and nods off
) Find a place to sleep
The student leader follows his gaze and the camera pans off with his glance
We see that the numbers have grown immensely
Fires dot the field and spread and spread and spread
Behind Walker and Pyarelal the newsreel truck and three cars for reporters are spread out around the fires
We identify a couple of Frenchmen and a Japanese
Walker looks at Pyarelal and shakes his head in wonder at it all
-  - small Indian boy is high in a dead tree
Below him a couple of bone-thin cattle graze in the early light as he stares off
- '    -  - The huge procession stretched out along the road
Resume the boy
He grins as though he is privy to some great secret
""      -  - blunt, rotund, powerful-looking woman (Sarojini Naidu) in an outrageously colorful sari strides along the dusty road as though she could cover another thousand miles -- and means to
The sound of hundreds of marching feet, of cars, some distant singing
The camera lifts and pulls back
We see that Naidu is marching just behind Gandhi, like a determined lieutenant, and that the procession has grown even greater
Two newsreel trucks now, four cars of reporters, some people riding donkeys, some walking with camels trailing, loaded with belongings
And at the "" junctions the newsreel crews suddenly go into action because another enormous procession is waiting to join the first, mingling already, making one immense column of humanity
And as they pass the camera up close we see an extraordinary variety of participants: old, young, students, peasants, ladies in saris and jewels, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Christian nuns, Untouchables, merchants, some vigorous and determined, others disheveled, tired and determined
Suddenly the sound of waves and gentle wind
-  - The camera closing fast (helicopter) as the silhouette of a man appears running up a sand dune, lifting his arms to the sky and the camera sweeps over him and up, revealing a crescent of beach and ocean, and for a second it holds on the sea as it did at Porbandar, then pivots to the truly astronomical crowd thronging the shore, an immense wheel of human beings, and in its hub a gathering around Gandhi
We descend on that center, recognizing the newsmen, Walker, Pyarelal, Sarojini Naidu, and at last Gandhi picking up a handful of natural salt and lifting it high
During the last of this ' - Man needs salt as he needs air and water
This salt comes from the Indian Ocean
(The salt crystals are added to an urn already partially full
The camera pulls back and Gandhi lifts the urn
All around him the pressing crowd: newsreel cameramen, reporters -- Walker, Collins, Naidu, Pyarelal
Firmly) Let every Indian claim it as his right
wide-angle shot
Gandhi in the center of the wildly cheering crowd, the camera pulling back and back
and the shot becomes black and white, and we hear the music of Movietone News
' - and so once more the man of non- violence has challenged the might of the British Empire
And with that we get the Movietone Music tag and as the film fades, the lights go up on '  -  - couple of civil servants move about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office
The general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's  and the principal secretary are all present
The two men who ran the projector are quietly dismantling it
Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets, but answers the implied questions
They're making it everywhere, sir -- mobs of them -- publicly
Congress leaders are selling it on the streets of Delhi
Irwin sighs
We're being made fools of around the world
Isn't there any instruction from London
Irwin nods
We're required to stop it
(He stands, his mind made up
) And stop it we will
(He looks at the senior police officer
) don't care if we fill the jails, stop it
Arrest anyone, any rank -- except Gandhi
We'll cut his strength from under him
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma
For the first time he is truly angry
-  - young British subaltern trots up to the wall and looks down
His face falls
Oh, my God
The beach
Subaltern's point of view
Packed with people making salt, selling salt, buying salt
Resume the British subaltern
He looks back
His point of view
Behind him there is an open military truck and about twenty sepoys
Formidable for an ordinary crowd, nothing to handle this
The subaltern stiffens bravely and signals the men somewhat unconvincingly from the truck
Right -- jump to it -- clear this beach
-  - Men, women and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables
group of policemen barge into the room, knocking tables and salt and paper in every direction with their lathis, seizing some of the volunteers for arrest
In the chaos an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet
-  - Nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street
The truck is loaded with boxes that contain salt packets and Nehru and eight or nine others are selling them to people who flock about the truck
The sound of horses
Nehru lifts his head
Mounted Indian police are coming down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center
Some of the people run, others deliberately stand fast
The mounted police converge on the truck
Nehru is grabbed, and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street
One of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman
He is young and vigorous and he swivels on the ground as though to strike back
Nehru lunges toward him
No violence, Zia
And a lathi is brought smashing across the side of Nehru's head
He is knocked to his knees; blood streams from his head
He feels the side of his head, the blood soaking his hand
He struggles to his feet, facing the policeman who has struck him
(repeating quietly, as though to Zia) no violence
It stops the policeman for a second, and a sergeant suddenly intrudes, recognizing Nehru
You're Nehru -- 'm an illegal trader in salt
The sergeant sighs grimly
'  -  - The desk lights are on
Irwin, the senior police officer, the principal secretary
Tension, fatigue, frustration as the senior police officer outlines the situation
There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest
(Grimly, incredibly) And it still goes on
(impatiently) Who's leading them
don't know
Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail
and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother
(shrewdly) Has there been any violence
(distracted, offhand) Oh, in Karachi the police fired on a crowd and killed a couple of people and -- (and this hurts) and in Peshawar the Deputy Police Commissioner lost his head and
and opened fire with a machine gun
(He looks up at them quickly, defensively
) But he's facing a disciplinary court
You can't expect things like that not to happen when -- (dryly) believe the question was intended to discover if there was any violence of their side
The senior police officer looks up, realizing his gaffe and wishes desperately he could relive the last couple of minutes
Oh, no, sir -- no, 'm afraid not
(again the Machiavellian mind) Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi, it might -- He means incite violence
The Viceroy ponders it -- favorably
(to senior police officer) He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he
Yes, sir, he has
The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works
(calmly) Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail
The senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it
He looks at Irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty
Then Yes, sir
Yes, sir
It will be my pleasure
As he turns to leave Irwin speaks -- almost offhandedly
And Fields, keep that salt works open
The senior police officer stares at him, then (delighted) Yes, sir
-  - Barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockade-like entrance
Above the gate we see the sign
Before it six British police officers and two Indian police officers command a large troop of Indian policemen
They face their opposition, unmoving, tense
The camera pans from them, across a sloping dip in the ground, to a huge group of volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as the police face them
Walker is off to one side, climbing to stand in the back of Collin's car
He watches, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen
Collins leans against the back of the car near him, watching with an equally appalled expectancy
There are two other reporters near them
From Walker's point of view
We see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed
Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance
We hear only a shuffle of feet, the clank of a lathi against a metal police buckle
The air itself seems breathless with tension
Featuring Azad
He has approached the chief police officer
He stops before him politely
would like admission to the Works
(equally politely) am sorry, sir
That cannot be allowed
Azad looks at him a second, then glances at the troops
He is clearly afraid, but there is an air of tragic inevitability in his face
He moves back to address the volunteers
Last night they took Gandhiji from us
They expect us to lose heart or to fight back
We will not lose heart, we will not fight back
In his name we will be beaten
As he has taught us, we will not raise a hand
"Long live Mahatma Gandhi
" He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police
series of shots, as Azad leads the first row of volunteers down and up the dip
We intercut Walker, frozen, watching the inevitable onslaught, the British police commanding officer ready to give the first order
(finally) Now
And with the volunteers a foot from them, the police strike with their lathis
groan of empathic anguish from the waiting volunteers, but then we get  series of shots As the next row moves forward and the horror of the one-sided mayhem proceeds heads are cracked, faces split, ribs smashed, and yet one row of volunteers follows another, and another into the unrelenting police, who knock bleeding bodies out of the way, down into the dip, swing till sweat pours from their faces and bodies
And through it we intercut with Mirabehn and the Indian women rescuing the wounded, carrying them on stretchers to be bandaged
We see Walker helping once or twice, turning, watching, torn between being a professional spectator and a normal human being
And always the volunteers coming, never stopping, never offering resistance
And finally on sound there is an insistent click, click, click, like a thud of the lathis but becoming clearly the slap of an impatient hand on a telephone cradle and out of the carnage of the salt works we dissolve to -  - Close shot -- a telephone cradle being pounded
Walker is at the phone at a table in the corner of the small, cluttered store
His clothes are matted with blood and dirt
(into the phone) Hello
Ed
Ed
Goddammit, don't cut me off
(Then suddenly he's through
) Ed
Okay -- yeah -- right
And he continues urgently reading the story that lies on his notes on the little stand before him
"They walked, with heads up, without music, or cheering, or any hope of escape from injury or death
" (His voice is taut, harshly professional
) "It went on and on and on
Women carried the wounded bodies from the ditch until they dropped from exhaustion
But still it went on
" He shifts the mangled notes and comes to his last paragraph
He speaks it trying only half successfully to keep the emotion from his voice
"Whatever moral ascendance the West held was lost today
India is free for she has taken all that steel and cruelty can give, and she has neither cringed nor retreated
" (On Walker close
His sweating, blood and dirt-stained face near tears
) "In the words of his followers, 'Long live Mahatma Gandhi
' " '  -  - Silence
The camera moves across the empty room and discovers Irwin, standing by himself, looking out of the window down into the street
Closer
His numb, motionless face is stirred to consciousness by something outside
He focuses somberly on it
-  - '    - - Through the formal entrance comes a single black car motorcycle policeman precedes it
-  -  - The black car pulls up before the front of the palace and stops
There is no sign of activity
It is as though the building and grounds are deserted except for Irwin alone in his office
Gandhi gets out of the car
He too is alone
In his dhoti and shawl he starts to mount the grand stairs
Wide angle
The great palace, the magnificent entrance, and the little man in the dhoti, who in a sense has conquered it all, marching to the great doors
Two Gurkhas spring to attention and the doors are swung open
'  -  - The principal secretary, with a look of faint distaste for someone out of shot, discreetly moves out of the doors, and closes them behind him
Featuring Gandhi, just inside the door
He is looking across the wide office
am aware that  must have given you much cause for irritation, your Excellency
hope it will not stand between us as men
Reverse angle
Irwin is in shadows behind his desk looking, still, in some kind of shock, staring at Gandhi
Mr
Gandhi,  have instructions to request your attendance at an All- Government Conference in London to discuss -- to discuss the possible Independence of India
He faces Gandhi stiffly
The whirr of a camera, and a swift cut to -- "" '      -
Wide screen, but slightly under-cranked with the bad cutting and predictable music of the old newsreels
Gandhi, Mirabehn and Gandhi's secretary, Desai, waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails -- Mirabehn is holding the tether of a goat -- all of them smiling at the camera like voyagers everywhere
Gandhi on the steps of Kingsley Hall in the East End of London being greeted by a cheering crowd
Mirabehn holds an umbrella over him as he takes a bouquet from a little child
The now gray-haired Charlie Andrews beams possessively at his side
Gandhi, in his dhoti, waving to a small crowd as he enters the gates of Buckingham Palace
London bobby watches
Gandhi, taking his seat at the conference table among the formally -- in some Maharajahs' cases, elaborately -- dressed delegates
gavel is struck and Ramsay MacDonald begins his opening address
think our first duty is to recognize that there is not one India, but several: a Hindu India, a Muslim India, and India of Princely States
And all these must be respected -- and cared for -- not just one
Beneath its unctuous political veneer it is blatantly divisive and clearly reveals the true intent of the Conference
As Gandhi looks at MacDonald, we read on his face his perception of the sad truth
Gandhi, Mirabehn and Charlie walking under an umbrella in the rain, their heads bent in glum conversation
Gandhi being welcomed and kissed by a group of millworkers outside a large mill entrance identified by the sign ,
He is hugged and squeezed by some hefty female millworkers, all grinning happily, Gandhi not least
Gandhi in a radio studio, seated at a table, a large microphone labeled "" before him, technicians and Mirabehn in the glass booth behind him, Walker across the table from him, the "On the Air" sign bright
(to Walker) Do  speak into that
Walker cringes, glancing at the lighted "On the Air" sign
He signals "Yes" frantically
Are they ready
Do  start
He glances at the booth
Everybody including Walker and Mirabehn are nodding "Yes
" Gandhi shrugs, grins at everyone's excitement, and begins
am glad to speak to America where so many friends exist that  know only in my heart
As the speech continues in the thin, static-y tones of thirties' radio, we see Mirabehn and the technicians listening in the control room
/ Walker, across the table from Gandhi
/ The outside of Broadcasting House
/ The Empire State Building and Manhattan
/  mid-western farmhouse
/  thirties' radio set in a thirties' American living room
/  family, listening, kids playing on the floor, half ignoring it, the mother ironing, the father in an armchair, a newspaper open
' (continuing over all) think your interest and the world's has fallen on India, not only because we are struggling for freedom, but because the way we are doing so is unique as far as history shows us
Here in Europe mighty nations are, it seems, already contemplating another war, though  think they, and all the world, are sick to death of bloodspilling
All of us are seeking a way out, and  flatter myself that perhaps the ancient land of India will offer such a way
If we are to make progress we must not repeat history, but make history
And  myself will die before  betray our belief that love is a stronger weapon than hate
Gandhi shaking hands with MacDonald outside No
10 Downing Street, MacDonald smiling the politician's smile, Gandhi smiling rather sadly
Gandhi on the deck of a boat, sitting on a deck chair, wrapped in blankets, staring somberly out to sea
Reverse angle: the wake of the boat in the vast ocean
-  - The gentle sounds of the country
girl of twelve leads a limping goat slowly across the grass
She pauses and looks up questioningly
Reverse angle -- close
Gandhi is watching from the porch of his bungalow
We can tell he is sitting and turned to watch the goat, but we see only him and a portion of the bungalow behind him
It is only a sprain
Take her to the river, and we'll make a mud-pack for her
Go --  won't be long
He turns back
Another angle
He is spinning (expertly), and gathered on the porch with him are Nehru and Jinnah and Patel and Azad and Kripalani
Desai and Pyarelal are inconspicuously in attendance as always, Pyarelal now clearly sharing Desai's role as secretary
So the truth is, after all your travels, all your efforts, they've stopped the campaign and sent you home empty-handed
He is in his white suit, the black-ribboned pince-nez
He sits on a wicker chair, Nehru and Patel lean against the railing, Azad and Kripalani sit on the floor like Gandhi
They are only clinging to old dreams (looks up from his spinning to Jinnah) and trying to split us in the old way
But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple
The only question is when (another glance at Jinnah) and how
say when is now -- and we will determine how
Precisely
Gandhi winds up what he has done, and starts to rise
They are preparing for war
will not support it, but  do not intend to take advantage of their danger
(blithely, but to the point) That's when you take advantage
Gandhi has moved toward the steps
He stops and looks at Patel
wry, gentle smile
No
That is just another way of striking back
We have come a long way together with the British
When they leave we want to see them off as friends
(He starts down the steps and heads for the river
) And now, if you'll excuse me, there is something  must attend to
Featuring Nehru
He looks at Jinnah and shrugs
Jinnah takes it less philosophically and his eyes burn with anger as he watches Gandhi head for the young girl with the injured goat
(resignedly) "Mud packs
" Gandhi is moving with the stream of passengers disembarking from the Third Class section
Ba and Mirabehn are struggling along behind him, Desai and Pyarelal completing the little group
They pass a newspaper stand: "Hitler's Armies Sweep On
" As they move out into the flux of the station we see many uniforms, the sense of a nation readying for war
British captain stands before a full platoon of Indian troops
As Gandhi approaches, a British Lt
Colonel and his Adjutant (a Captain) move out from one side of the troops
Mr
Gandhi -- sir
Gandhi stops, looks up at him, at the troops behind him
have instructions to inquire as to the subject of your speech tonight
Gandhi shakes his head with a weary grin
The value of goat's milk in daily diet
(Into his eyes) But you can be sure  will also speak against war
The British Colonel signals back to the troops
'm sorry, sir
That can't be allowed
As a detail marches up to them, the colonel's adjutant speaks gently to Ba
It's all right, Mrs
Gandhi
have orders to return with you and your companion to the Mahatma's ashram
If you take my husband,  intend to speak in his place
She stares at the adjutant belligerently
He looks flummoxed
Later
Long shot -- high
The colonel and his adjutant striding toward the exit of the station
Following behind them, a detail of six soldiers accompanying Gandhi
The camera tracks across the platform and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba
And the camera tracks again and we see they are being followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Mirabehn
-  - jeep bounces along the road
It is driven by an American lieutenant and his passenger is a woman dressed in an American War Correspondent's uniform (Margaret Bourke-White)
As the jeep passes the camera we pan with it and see the walls of a palace ahead
- Stop
Wait a minute
The jeep slithers to a stop, and Bourke-White grabs a camera that is strapped around her, stands, and takes a picture of the palace
'  - -'    -  - The palace looks evocative -- a lonely, incongruous building
-  - It was the Aga Khan's palace, but they've turned it into a prison
Bourke-White slips back down into her seat; we see the arm band on her jacket: "Press
" The lieutenant starts the jeep up and they head toward the gate, where we see a British soldier on guard
(shouting over the motor) They've got most of the leading Congress politicians in this one
But Nehru and some others are over in Dehra Dun
Your timing's pretty lucky
They had your Mr
Gandhi cut off from the press but last month his personal secretary died and they've let up on the restrictions
Bourke-White just absorbs it, staring at the palace, taking in the experience with the appetite of her breed, and her own particular sensitivity
'  -  '  -  - Gandhi sits by the window that is grilled rather than barred
He is spinning in a shaft of light -- and looking off -- as we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement
His hair, only half-gray in London, is now white
Yes,  have heard of Life Magazine
( smile
) have even heard of Margaret Bourke- White
But  don't know why either should be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is blowing itself to pieces
Bourke-White -- who has been moving, crouching to shoot him and the light -- sags back against the wall, relaxing at last
She has a smile as penetrating and warming as his
- (a beat -- and she smiles) You're the only man  know who makes his own clothes
Gandhi grins and glances toward his dhoti
Ah, but for me that's not much of an accomplishment
Meaning he doesn't wear many clothes
Bourke-White bursts into an appreciative radiance -- already she has assessed him, and been won
-  '  -  - Gandhi walks along, Bourke-White loping along beside him, a little distance away, listening, but searching too for an angle, a moment that is right
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come
My only worry is what shape it will take
Jinnah has -- - Stop
She has Gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him
- Now go on -- just as you were
Gandhi shrugs but suffers it
We feature him, low, from her point of view, as he walks on, the soldier pacing on the wall in the background
- (coaching) "
what shape it will take
" Jinnah has -- what
(at first disconcerted, but then flowing) Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British
It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu
(He stops, lowering his head gravely
) That  find hard to bear -- even in prison
She clicks
-  - spinning wheel works rapidly
The camera lifts
Gandhi is at the wheel and he is smiling off at Bourke-White, who is trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning wheel
The garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful
- (archly, but emphatically of the spinning) do not see it as the solution of the twentieth century's problems
She's grinning at her own frustration and she keeps trying, but there's no doubt she means it
Gandhi's smile broadens
Wryly he lifts his own "product" -- a tiny roll of thread
have a friend who keeps telling me how much it costs him to keep me in poverty
And they both laugh
a guard on the wall distantly looks at them wonderingly
(a bit more seriously) But  know happiness does not come with things -- even twentieth century things
It can come from work, and pride in what you do
(He looks at her steadily
) It will not necessarily be "progress" for India if she simply imports the unhappiness of the West
And she responds to the sophistication of that observation
He pivots around, moving beside her, and slowly demonstrates the process, taking her hands, guiding her
Bourke-White watches him as much as the wheel
- But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler
(a thoughtful pause) Not without defeats -- and great pain
(He looks at her
) But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain
(For a moment the thought hangs, and then Gandhi takes their hands back to the spinning
) What you cannot do is accept injustice
From Hitler -- or anyone
You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so
And he smiles a little wisely at her
- Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that
(laughs) No
That is what you get for distracting me
- What do you expect when you talk like that
(trying to unravel the mess) expect you to show as much patience as  am now
His tone is not altogether patient
She looks at him in surprise and he sighs tolerantly
Then reflectively Every enemy is a human being -- even the worst of them
And he believes he is right and you are a beast
(And now a little smile
) And if you beat him over the head you will only convince him
But you suffer, to show him that he is wrong, your sacrifice creates an atmosphere of understanding -- if not with him, then in the hearts of the rest of the community on whom he depends
Bourke-White looks at him and there is enough sense in this argument to give her pause
If you are right, you will win -- after much pain
(He looks at her, then smiles in his own ironic way
) If you are wrong, well, then, only you will suffer the blows
She stares at him, and we know she thinks him much more profound than she had thought initially
'  -  '  -  - Ba, Mirabehn and Bourke-White sit on straw mats around the room, an oil lamp is the only light
It is women's talk, but Ba is defending her husband, speaking simply, but with total conviction
not at all
Bapu has always said there were two kinds of slavery in India -- one for women, one for the untouchables -- and he has always fought against both
Bourke-White accepts it at face value
She opens another line of inquiry
- Does it rankle, being separated from him this way
Ba pauses
Yes
but we see each other in the day
- (delicately) But not at night
She's terribly curious, but she doesn't want to offend
Ba sees both the curiosity and the hesitancy
She smiles across at Mirabehn, then In Hindu philosophy the way to God is to free yourself of possessions -- and the passions that inflame to anger and jealousy
( smile
) Bapu has always struggled to find the way to God
- You mean he -- he gave up -- (how to phrase it, finally) married life
Again Ba smiles
Four times he tried -- and failed
(Mirabehn and Bourke- White grin
The older woman gives a wistful smile
) But then he took a solemn vow
She shrugs
the implication is it was a long time ago
- And he has never broken it
(a beat) Not yet
She looks at them soberly and then they all burst into laughter like girls
'  -  - Military move quietly but urgently in and out around the main entrance
Two military ambulances are drawn up nearby
British major comes down the steps quickly
He is almost at the bottom when a British army doctor starts to go up them
The major signals him to one side
They talk quietly and confidentially
've got permission to move her -- he can go too
The doctor shakes his head
She's had a coronary throm -- a serious heart failure
She wouldn't survive a trip
It's best to leave her -- and hope
The major looks defeated and depressed by the news
'  -  - Ba lies on a mat, a pillow beneath her head, her eyes closed, her breathing short
Mirabehn sits next to her, rubbing a hand up and down her arm
Gandhi sits a little distance away, staring at the floor and into nothingness
Pyarelal sits inconspicuously behind him
Azad and Patel come to the doorway, Patel makes the pranam toward Ba and holds it as he obviously prays
Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her
Finally Azad takes just a step forward
Gandhi looks up at him
For a moment he folds his hands absently, then he stands
He moves to Ba's side and kneels
She does not open her eyes
It is time for my walk --  won't be long
Ba's eyes flutter open
She holds her hand out to him and he takes it
When he goes to release it, she clutches it
Gandhi hesitates, and then he sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap
He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go
Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell and stands
The doorway
Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with Azad
He looks back
His point of view
Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare
Another angle -- later
The light has changed
fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight
Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness
The doctor appears in the doorway
He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all
Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse
He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension
He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears
He puts the acoustic bell over her heart
a moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat
He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes
The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi
Gandhi
His point of view
His posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks
He does not move, there is no change in his empty stare, but the tears continue to flow
-  - The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done
Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal, stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead -- and the living, for Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never move again
Close shot -- Mirabehn watching him her face wet with tears
-  - Extreme close shot
piece of cloth, shimmering in a stiff breeze
For a moment we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder
And slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft
We cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door
An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music detachment of Indian Royal Air Force comes to attention at the shouted command of their
Featuring the aircraft doors
An elaborately dressed military aide opens the door and Lord Louis Mountbatten, resplendent in naval uniform, steps out onto the platform
He pauses and renders a salute
Nehru, Lady Mountbatten and dignitaries
English and Indians watch as Mountbatten approaches a group of microphones identified as , , , etc
We have come to crown victory with friendship -- to assist at the birth of an independent India and to welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations
( little smile
) am here to see that  am the last British Viceroy ever to have the honor of such a reception
He grins in his youthful, beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd
It is cut off by the sound of a door being opened, close
- -  -  - Jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the immense portico
It is a break in their Independence Conference, and as he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with Azad
Jinnah's anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table
He slaps his lighter shut and addresses Gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words
don't give a damn for the independence of India
am concerned about the slavery of Muslims
Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too
Jinnah raises his voice deliberately so Nehru will hear
will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus
(patiently, not yet believing it can't be settled) Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India
No one will be slave, no one master
Jinnah sneers at the idea, though he cools a little
The world is not made of Mahatma Gandhis
(He looks at Nehru and Patel
) am talking about the real world
The "real India" has Muslims and Hindus in every village and every city
How do you propose to separate them
Where there is a Muslim majority -- that will be Pakistan
The rest is your India
(a forced patience) Mohammed -- the Muslims are in a majority on two different sides of the country
(acidly) Let us worry about Pakistan -- you worry about India
Gandhi is staring at Jinnah trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear
He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion
Gentlemen, perhaps we should recommence
Gandhi nods, and reluctantly the adversaries move back to the conference room
Gandhi is last through the door
He pauses by Mountbatten, a little sigh -- "How difficult, how difficult" -- then he puts a friendly hand on Mountbatten's shoulder and the two of them enter together
'  -  - Featuring Godse waving a black flag and shouting
(with others) Death to Jinnah
Death to Jinnah
We have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of Hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram
Many wave black flags
couple of trucks that have brought them, and a car, are along the path
Kallenbach is stepping out of an old 1942 open Austin that he has put in a waiting position near the entrance to the path
The chanting shout "Death to Jinnah
" suddenly dies
The youths -- and Kallenbach -- look back toward the ashram
Featuring Gandhi's bungalow
Nehru has stepped out onto the porch and he glares at the youths
It is his presence that has silenced them
Kallenbach smiles
'  -  - Gandhi is rising from the floor, where his spinning wheel sits
He stops, halfway up, listening, then, a weary sigh
Thank God, they've stopped
Mirabehn is spinning across the room
She lifts her head as a signal to someone out of shot
Gandhi's two grand nieces, Manu and Abha, who help Mirabehn now that Ba is gone, rise quickly at Mirabehn's signal, Manu to help with his shawl, Abha to hold his sandals so that he can slip into them
'm your grand uncle but  can still walk either of you into the ground and  don't need to be pampered this way
It's cross -- he's worried about other things
Mirabehn just smiles at it
Gandhi looks down at Abha, and taps her sharply on the top of the head
Finish your quota of spinning
She nods obediently, the flicker of a smile around her mouth, youthful, irrepressible
The beauty of it almost saddens Gandhi
He taps her again -- gently -- and goes out
'  -  - Kallenbach shoos a chicken from the back seat of the Austin and dusts off the seat
He steps back out
Gandhi is approaching with Nehru and Azad, Pyarelal trails close behind
We have seen Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru
As Gandhi near the car a Hindu youth with a black flag calls to him
Bapu -- please
Don't do it
They are all awed, timid even in his actual presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether
Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others
(impatiently) What do you want me not to do
Not to meet with Mr
Jinnah
(Fiercely) am a Muslim
(He stares at them, then relents
) And a Hindu, and a Christian and a Jew -- and so are all of you
When you wave those flags and shout you send fear into the hearts of your brothers
He sweeps them sternly with his eyes, all his fatigue and strain showing
This is not the India  want
Stop it
For God's sake, stop it
And he lowers his head and moves on to the car, where Kallenbach holds the door for him, Nehru, Azad and Pyarelal following
Another angle
As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths
In the back seat we see two men, one of whom is Prakash (The bearded man at Gandhi's assassination)
'   -  - Jinnah is on the small balcony of this elaborate room
He is looking down in a slightly supercilious manner
As usual he is impeccably dressed
Now, please, if you've finished your prayers, could we begin with business
He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers
Nehru, Patel and Azad are on the same side of the room as Gandhi
They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the steps to them
Gandhi hesitates, then begins
My dear Jinnah, you and  are brothers born of the same Mother India
If you have fears,  want to put them to rest
(Jinnah listens impatiently, skeptically
Gandhi just glances in Nehru's direction
) am asking Panditji to stand down
want you to be the first Prime Minister of India (Jinnah raises an eyebrow of interest
) -- to name your entire cabinet, to make the head of every government department a Muslim
And Jinnah has drawn himself up
His vanity is too great not to be touched by that prospect
He measures Gandhi for a moment to see that he is sincere, and when he is satisfied with that, he turns slowly to Nehru, Patel and Azad
Nehru glances at Patel
They have all been taken by surprise by the offer -- and do not feel what Gandhi feels
Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi
Bapu, for me, and the rest, (his hand gestures to Patel and Azad) if that is what you want, we will accept it
But out there (he indicates the streets) already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away
If you did this, no one could control it
No one
It bears the stamp of undeniable truth
Gandhi's eyes sag with the despair of a man whose last hope, whose faith, has crumbled around him
Jinnah smiles cynically, he spreads his hands "See
" It is your choice
Do you want an independent India and an independent Pakistan
Or do you want civil war
Gandhi stares at him numbly
-   -  - On a platform in the foreground Mountbatten and Nehru band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the green, white and saffron flag of India is raised on the flagpole
-  -  - On a platform in the foreground Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary
band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as the white, green with white crescent, flag of Pakistan is raised on the flagpole
-  - Silence
The little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole
Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning
The hum of the spinning wheel
Inside we can just see Mirabehn, spinning too
But apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted
We hear the sound of a bell on one of the goats, fairly distant
-  - Featuring Kallenbach
He is taking the goat and tethering it near the path of the ashram
He stills the bell with his hand
As he ties it the camera angle widens and we see Margaret Bourke-White sitting on the grass, watching Kallenbach and looking off toward Gandhi's bungalow
- Aren't you being a little overprotective
Kallenbach looks at her
Her tone criticizes more than his stilling the goat's bell
Tomorrow
Tomorrow photograph him
- came all this way because  believed the picture of Independence Day was of him here alone
Kallenbach stands and looks across at her, judging, then appealing to her humanity
It is violence, and the fear of violence, that have made today what it is
Give him the dignity of his grief
Bourke-White grabs a clump of grass, twists it free, and sighs
She tosses the grass vaguely at the goat
- And while we're sitting here feeding goats, what will happen to all the Muslims in India and the Hindus in Pakistan
Kallenbach stops, staring absently at the ground ahead, then Gandhi will pray for them
-  - The camera is high (helicopter) and moving and from its position we meet and then pass over an immense column of refugees -- ten, twenty abreast -- moving down one side of the railroad track toward camera
Women, children, the sick, the aged, all burdened with bedding, utensils, household treasures, useless bric-a-brac and trudging with them every type of cart, wagon, rickshaw, pulled by donkey, camel, bike, oxen
It stretches endlessly to the horizon
Tiny green, white and saffron flags here and there indicate that it is a Hindu column and spotted through it we see people in fresh bandages, some on stretchers, sticking out like radioactive tracers in the huge artery of frightened humanity
And the camera lifts and tilts, slowly swinging to the opposite direction, and as it does, reveals another vast column across the track, several yards away, moving in the opposite direction: veiled women in purdah, the crescent flag of Muslim Pakistan here and there
As the camera levels and speeds along it, we see that this column too reaches to the horizon, that it too carries its wounded
An unbelievable flood of desperate humanity
The sound of the vast refugee column
woman's arms cradle a baby in swaddling
Blood has seeped through the swaddling in three or four places, some of it dried
Flies buzz around it
And suddenly we hear the woman's sobs and she rocks the baby and we know it has stopped moving, stopped breathing, and a male hand gently touches the back of the baby, checking, and the camera pans up to the face of a man
Again in extreme close shot so we cannot tell whether they are Hindu or Muslim
And the man's eyes knot, and he swings out of shot as he runs in fury and rage at the other column
- The two columns -- and a howl of hate and grief
And the camera sweeps to where men are running at each other across the track, some already fighting
Knives, pangas, hatchets; women screaming and running; a besieged wagon tipped
Another angle
And as the fighting grows more fierce streams of men from each column run back to partake, but the bulk of the two columns hurries off, scrambling, running, some leaving their bundles, fleeing the melee in terror
/   -   - / Muslim pulled through broken glass in an urban market shop
/ Night: a Hindu temple daubed with blood, the bodies of women and children strewn before it; screams, the sound of fighting
/ Mud and straw houses burning, figures running through them
/  city street: a truck crashes into a barricade of rickshaws and bales, and is set upon by a swarm of knife- and panga-bearing men
From the back of the truck opponents with swords and clubs leap into battle
'  -  - Chaos
It and the adjoining office have been made into something like operations rooms
Military and civilian aides move back and forth
Telephones at work everywhere
huge map on the wall is constantly having data changed by people receiving messages there
Nehru is glancing at a telex message; he turns and gives it back to the military aide who's given it to him
(fast, curt) No
There just are not that many troops
What's he to do
What he can
He turns
Patel has a message he was going to present to him
He hesitates, grins dismally, and crumples the message -- "No use
" Nehru sags
He looks at Patel with haggard eyes
He was right
It's insane -- anything would have been better
Have you found him
Nehru nods solemnly
He's in Noakhali
Patel reacts to that -- surprise, apprehension
He's tramping from village to village -- no police, no troops -- trying to quell the madness single-handedly
(He sighs, half in admiration, half in hopeless exasperation at the old man's audacity
) Maulana has gone to bring him back
Patel nods grimly -- the noisy chaos of the room
Someone shouts at Nehru, "Prime Minister
" - In silence -- looking tragic, tired and defeated
He is sitting in his characteristic manner, staring down at the carpet before him
' (dull, lifeless) What you have done in Noakhali is a miracle, Bapu, a miracle, but millions are on the move -- millions
There is no way to stop it
and no one can count the dead
The camera angle has changed
We are in '   -  - Patel and Azad are there and Pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the first time we have seen him among Gandhi's intimate group
In Calcutta it's like civil war
The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan
an eye for an eye making the whole world blind
It is an empty and despairing echo of Gandhi's words
Aren't there any troops to spare
(tense, fragile) Nothing -- nothing
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi can hardly keep the peace now
And each fresh bit of news creates another wave of  mad
ness
He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly
It has almost stopped him
Could we cut all news off
know -- Bapu -- please
Where are you going
(sounding like an old man) don't want to hear more
He is moving toward the door
It stops them all
Pyarelal moves tentatively to open the door
(impatiently) We need your help
There is nothing  can give
Where are you going
Gandhi turns, looks at him bleakly
Calcutta
-  - We are high
There are fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, of looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles and occasional sirens
The camera zooms in on a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets
Outside one of the houses is a car, an army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers and a group of people
It seems a little island of calm in a sea of wild chaos
On the roof of the house, a figure moves into the light
- ' The figure is Gandhi
He peers down at the dark, rioting streets
Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose house this is, Mirabehn and Pyarelal are with him along Abdul Ghaffar Khan
police commissioner moves to Gandhi's side, demanding his attention
Sir, please,  don't have the men to protect you -- not in a Muslim house
Not this quarter
am staying with the friend of a friend
There is a sudden commotion just below them and angry shouts: "Death to Muslims
," "Death to Muslims
" Gandhi peers down
His point of view
surging gang of youths, many carrying torches, and far outnumbering the little group of police and soldiers, are shouting up at the roof
We see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them
few hold knives still wet with blood
There he is
feral roar goes up at the sight of Gandhi, but he stands unmoving
(his voice emotional, tearful) Why are you staying at the home of a Muslim
They're murderers
They killed my family
Featuring Gandhi
It is a comment too grave for glibness, and Gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it
He pauses for a moment, staring down at the youth: Because forgiveness is the gift of the brave
He makes it mean the youth
For a second it makes an impact, but then the youth shouts his defiance at him and his message
To hell with you, Gandhi
An angry chorus of acclamation; when it dies (to the youth) Go -- do as your mother and father would wish you to do
It is ambiguous, open-ended, meaning anything your mother and father would wish you to do
Tears flush from the boy's eyes and he stares at Gandhi with a kind of hopeless anguish and rage
But the impact is on the youth alone; around him the others begin to take up the chant "Death to Muslims
," "Death to Muslims
" Gandhi turns from the street
He looks at the police commissioner -- at his fatigue, his concern, his manifest respect
Gandhi musters a weary smile
have lived a lifetime
If  had shunned death -- or feared it -- would not be here
Nor would you be concerned for me
(He lets it sink in then he takes the commissioner's arm and moves back toward the center of the roof
) Leave me -- and take your men
(An understanding touch of the arm
) You have more important things to worry about
The commissioner looks at him, uncertain, not knowing what to do, as the angry chanting continues above the sound of rioting
-  - An old, inadequate hospital -- dark cavernous
Margaret Bourke- White is moving among the densely packed litter of wounded women
She is positioning herself to photograph Gandhi, who is speaking to a woman who cradles a small baby
The corridors behind him are even more packed
The few doctors and nurses hardly have room to move
Featuring Gandhi
Azad and Mirabehn are behind him as he moves on, and behind them, like a giant guardian, Abdul Ghaffar Khan
We hear "Bapu, Bapu" muttered quietly here and there
Gandhi bends to a woman whose face is bandaged and a cruel wound is half-exposed between her mouth and eye
Bapu
Allah be with you
There are tears in Gandhi's eyes now
And with you
(He touches her wrinkled hand
) Pray
cannot help you -- pray
pray
And the weight of his helplessness hangs on him
-  - streetcar (tram) crashes into a barricade of carts, rickshaws, a couple of old cars, smashing through to breach the barricade, but stopped in the end by the mass of debris
The streetcar is loaded with Indian troops and they break from the stalled vehicle to chase  gang of Hindus -- organized -- runs down the street from the troops, some dragging the bodies of victims with them
We see several Hindu black flags
'  -  - He speaks across his desk to a senior police commissioner
The same activity going on in the background
(angrily) No
There will not be a Hindu Police and a Muslim Police
There is one police
An aide slips a newspaper on his desk in front of him
He doesn't look at it till the senior commissioner lowers his head and turns, accepting defeat
Then Nehru glances at the paper
In thick headlines: :
Nehru doesn't move for a moment
Then he lifts his face slowly to his aide
Why must  read news like this in the paper
The aide shakes his head -- there's no answer
Nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many
He grips his temples
a terrible sigh
Tell Patel
Arrange a plane
We will go -- Friday
Four days
Nehru thinks on it solemnly, then nods yes
'  -  - The sounds of rioting and looting on nearby streets, but here a mass of people are gathered
Many youths with black flags
Two black government limousines
Motorcycles
Police and soldiers
They are looking off to - ' It runs up the side of the building and is lined with waiting people
Nehru and Patel are climbing the stairs, moving past them almost irritably as they mutter "Nehru, Nehru," "Patel," and make the pranam to the eminent men
In the heat of the city Tahib's rooftop is still Gandhi's "home" and has become a center of activity
Azad clears someone aside and ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning
Nehru pauses as he lowers his head
His point of view
Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot
He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain
The camera pans
doctor sits near the foot of the cot, Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond him
Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White
They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting
She knows Gandhi's feeling for him
Bourke-White stares at him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly, almost reflexively, for her camera
Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at Gandhi's eyeline
Gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look, and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru
His hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him
Bapu
Gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand
He does so with effort, and at last he sees Patel
Sardar
(He looks him over
) You have gained weight
You must join me in the fast
Patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of them are on a level
Outside the canopied area, Bourke-White is crouched, her camera framing the three of them
(wittily, warmly) If  fast  die
If you fast people go to all sorts of trouble to keep you alive
Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him
Bapu, forgive me -- 've cheated could have come earlier
But your fast has helped
These last days people's minds have begun to turn to this bed -- and away from last night's atrocity
But now it is enough
Gandhi shakes his head
All that has happened is that 've grown a little thinner
It is despairingly sincere
But Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair
The distant sound of an explosion
Tomorrow five thousand Muslim students of all ages are marching here in Calcutta -- for peace
(The real point) And five thousand Hindu students are marching with them
It is all organized
Bourke-White captures the sense of elation in his face
From her discreet distance, she lowers the camera, holding it against her mouth, waiting for Gandhi's response
Gandhi nods to Nehru, accepting the news with a sad wistfulness
'm glad -- but it will not be enough
Nehru isn't prepared for this resistance
He glances at Patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced
Nehru turns back -- this time no confidence, only concern forced smile
Bapu, you are not so young anymore
Gandhi smiles, pain etched in his eyes
He touches Nehru's hand
Don't worry for me -- death will be a deliverance
(There is water in his eyes, but his words have the weight of a man truly determined to die
) cannot watch the destruction of all  have lived for
Nehru stares at him, feeling the sudden fear that Gandhi means it
Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White are gripped by the same realization
'  -  - An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, grown even larger now, and more women among them
The sounds of distant fighting
'  -  - The senior technician, in earphones, signals across to Mirabehn
She holds a microphone by Gandhi, who is lying on his side
He seems almost out of touch
Bapu
Gandhi looks at her, and then the microphone
When he speaks into the microphone his voice is very weak
Each night before  sleep,  read a few words from the Gita and the Koran, and the Bible
(we intercut with Bourke-White and those on the roof watching) tonight  ask you to share these thoughts of God with me
And now we go into the streets, intercutting with Gandhi but seeing Hindus listening around loudspeakers on corners, in little eating houses, Muslim shops where people live in the back, and neighbors gathering defensively in groups
(the books are there, but he does it from memory of course) will begin with the Bible where the words of the Lord are, "Love thy neighbor as thyself"
and then our beloved Gita which says, "The world is a garment worn by God, thy neighbor is in truth thyself"
and finally the Holy Koran, "We shall remove all hatred from our hearts and recline on couches face to face, a band of brothers
" He leans back, exhausted
Mirabehn is looking at him; she starts to sing softly
"Lead Kindly Light, amidst the circling gloom
" Gandhi, his eyes closed, takes it up in his weak, croaking voice
/ "The night is dark, and  am far from home, Lead thou me on
" '  -  - Two police motorcycles lead a black limousine to a stop before Tahib's house
The crowd now gathered is very large
More mixed than before but still predominantly of youths, many still with black flags
Nehru gets out of the limousine with a Muslim leader, a tough- looking man who carries himself with the authority and power of a mobster (Suhrawardy)
And they start to go up the outside stairs
Suddenly we hear the shout "Death to Gandhi
," "Death to Gandhi
" And Nehru turns, pushing past Suhrawardy fiercely and going back onto the street
He runs at the crowd, where the shout comes once more from the back
His face is wild with anger and shock
(hysterically) Who dares say such things
Who
(And he is running at them and they spread in fear
) Come
Kill me first
Come
Where are you
Kill me first
The crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move
We see, just in passing, the frightened, apprehensive faces of Godse, and near him, Apte and Karkare
Nehru stands, staring at them all, his face seething with anger
'  -  - We are featuring a copy of Life Magazine
On the cover is a picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut-out of Gandhi lying on his cot
The caption reads: "An Old Man's Battle
" As the magazine starts to be opened, it is suddenly put to one side
Another angle
Mirabehn is rising, leaving the magazine at her feet
She moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad ushers them into the canopied area
Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background
Mirabehn speaks softly
His pulse is very irregular -- the kidneys aren't functioning
Nehru looks across at Gandhi
The doctor, who is testing Gandhi's pulse yet again, glances at him -- no encouragement -- and moves away
Nehru moves to the side of the cot and Gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain
Bapu,  have brought Mr
Suhrawardy
It was he who called on the Muslims to rise; he is telling them now to go back to their homes, to lay down their arms
Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods
Gandhi looks back at Nehru
There is no hint of him changing his mind
(personally) Think what you can do by living -- that you cannot do by dying
Gandhi smiles whimsically, he touches him again but there is no change in his attitude
(pleadingly) What do you want
(a moment) That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again
Nehru looks at him hopelessly
-  - huge crowd, some smoke in distant buildings, some damage near to help us know this is still Calcutta, and all is not yet at peace
The camera sweeps over the crowd, past the loudspeakers on their poles
We see surly knots of belligerent rowdies, mostly young, but not all, hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a platform where Nehru speaks
Azad, Suhrawardy, and others sit on the floor behind him
We have heard his voice over all this
Sometimes it is when you are quite without hope and in utter darkness that God comes to the rescue
Gandhiji is dying because of our madness
Put away your "revenge
" What will be gained by more killing
Have the courage to do what you know is right
For God's sake, let us embrace like brothers
'  -  - Featuring the Muslim leader Suhrawardy, leaning against a wall, watching an action out of shot with evident tension
We hear a little clank of metal
Another angle
There are five men facing Gandhi
They wear black trousers and black knit vests
There are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful
They are Hindu thugs (Goondas)
Their clothes are dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives and guns at Gandhi's feet
Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, the doctor and others on the roof watch fascinated, a little frightened
It is our promise
We stop
It is a promise
Gandhi is looking at him, testing, not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture
Go -- try -- God by with you
The Goondas stand
They glance at Suhrawardy; he smiles tautly and they start to leave, but one (Nahari) lingers
Suddenly he moves violently toward Gandhi, taking a flat piece of Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and tossing it forcefully on Gandhi
Eat
Mirabehn and Azad start to move toward him -- the man looks immensely strong and immensely unstable
But Gandhi holds up a shaking hand, stopping them
Nahari's face is knotted in emotion, half anger, half almost a child's fear -- but there is a wild menace in  that instability
Eat
am going to hell -- but not with your death on my soul
Only God decides who goes to hell
(stiffening, aggressive) --  killed a child
(Then an anguished defiance) smashed his head against a wall
Gandhi stares at him, breathless
(in a fearful whisper) Why
Why
It is as though the man has told him of some terrible self- inflicted wound
(tears now -- and wrath) They killed my son -- my boy
Almost reflexively he holds his hand out to indicate the height of his son
He glares at Suhrawardy and then back at Gandhi
The Muslims killed my son
they killed him
He is sobbing, but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill Gandhi in retaliation
long moment, as Gandhi meets his pain and wrath
Then know a way out of hell
Nahari sneers, but there is just a flicker of desperate curiosity
Find a child -- a child whose mother and father have been killed
little boy -- about this high
He raises his hand to the height Nahari has indicated as his son's
and raise him -- as your own
Nahari has listened
His face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness
Only be sure
that he is a Muslim
And that you raise him as one
And now the light falls on Nahari
His face stiffens, he swallows, fighting any show of emotion; then he turns to go
But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father
second, and Gandhi reaches out and touches the top of his head
Mirabehn watches
The Goondas watch
Suhrawardy watches
Finally (gently, exhaustedly) Go -- go
God bless you
-   -  -  - Trucks with riot squads (shields and truncheons) in place, but they are lounging, waiting
There is silence, and air of somnolence
Some of the riot squad lounge in little groups around the courtyard
distant cough
Featuring a senior riot squad officer dressed and ready for action
He it is who coughed
He coughs again, clearing his throat
police sergeant stands by him, both are reading the front page of a paper the senior riot squad officer holds
We see two huge lines of headline:   / In one of the trucks one of the men offers another a cigarette
telephone rings sharply, inside
The senior riot squad officer and the sergeant run in as engines start; the men run to their places, lower visors, headlights go on
-  - constable mans the telephone
He listens as the senior riot squad officer and the sergeant run to him tensely
The sound of the great doors opening in the courtyard, more engines revving up
Yes, sir, yes, sir, (He holds up his hand to the senior officer) "Wait
" He glances up at the senior riot squad officer
(writing, from the phone) Accident, "Christie crossroads," a lorry and a rickshaw
Yes, sir, have it
He shrugs at the senior riot squad officer and hands the information slip to another constable behind the desk
The sergeant sighs, and moves to the outside door
We hear him bellow, "Stand down
" The constable hangs up and sighs heavily
The senior riot squad officer shakes his head, and turns and walks slowly to the door
-   -  - The senior riot squad officer and the sergeant stand in the doorway as the engines die
The men relax
the silence returns
dog barks distantly, disturbed by the noise bird caws once or twice
wouldn't have believed it, Mr
Gupta
Sergeant, it's a bloody miracle
-  -  - It lies in silence
'  -  - Mirabehn is bent over Gandhi
He is curled almost in the fetal position, his face looking wan and sunken
For the first time there is silence, no explosions, no distant shouts, no gunfire
Bapu, there's been no fighting -- anywhere
It has stopped -- the madness has stopped
We see the police commissioner, Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others
Nearer Gandhi, behind Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad and Pyarelal
Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man
No
no
In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other
His weary eyes look at her; he looks up slowly to Azad
Azad nods "It's true
" Then Patel Everywhere
Gandhi looks at Nehru
Nehru just nods tautly
Gandhi looks down, then lifts his head to Azad
Maulana, my friend, could  have some orange juice
Then you and will take a piece of bread together
The relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces
Nehru bends to Gandhi
Gandhi holds his hand out to him, and Nehru clutches it
Then You see, Bapu, it is not difficult
have fasted only a few hours and accomplished what you could not do in as many days
It is a joke in their way with each other and Gandhi's eyes light, his smile comes
But it is tired
He puts his other hand over Nehru's and Nehru lowers his head to it, crying silently
-  - As in the opening sequence -- but a few minutes earlier
The crowd is beginning to gather for the evening prayers
We see a tonga or two, a gardener opening the gate to the garden, three policemen standing, talking idly among themselves
-  - Laughter
Gandhi is eating muli; he holds his head back to capture the lemon juice
We hear the click of a camera That is how you eat muli
Manu hands him a cloth and he wipes his hands
Another click of a camera
He is not fully recovered, but well on the way
(to the photographer) 'm not sure  want to be remembered that way
It is all light and for fun
We get a wide-angle shot now and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite subjects again
She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor
Pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this
- Don't worry, with luck you may not be
And she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to Manu
Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's
No, he'll be remembered for tempting fate
It is wry, but waspishly chiding
Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see
It's one of him, ears wide, eyes round
Mickey Mouse
Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles
But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words
- You really are going to Pakistan, then
(Gandhi shrugs, and she chides too) You are a stubborn man
(a grin, in the mood of their "flirtation") 'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought
Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti
He glances at it, and holds his arms out
The two girls help him
- And what kind of a warrior have you been in that warfare
She is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls
Not a very good one
That's why have so much tolerance for the other scoundrels of the world
He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel
Ask Panditji to -- to consider what we've discussed
Patel nods soberly and Gandhi starts for the door, Bourke- White moving with him
(of the photographs) Enough
- (a plea) One more
He has passed her, he's in the doorway
We see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften
He turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women
You're a temptress
She shoots him against the door -- the crowd milling distantly, waiting -- then she lowers her camera
- Just an admirer
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man
He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them
Bourke-White watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance
She turns to Mirabehn
- There's a sadness in him
It's an observation -- and a question
Mirabehn accedes gravely
He thinks he's failed
Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him
- Why
My God, if anything's proved him right, it's what's happened these last months
Mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face
am blinded by my love of him, but think when we most needed it, he offered the world a way out of madness
But he doesn't see it
and neither does the world
It is laced with pain
Bourke-White turns and looks out at Gandhi -- so tiny, so weak as he walks between his "props
" He has now reached the end of the garden and is moving among the crowd assembled there
-   -  - Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha
He makes the pranam to someone, the crowd is bowing to him, some speaking, and we also see the crowd from his point of view -- "Bapu," "God bless you," "Thank you -- thank you
" He turns to a very old woman, who makes a salaam to him
Gandhi touches her head
Allah be with you
Smiling, he turns back
jostling, the sound of beads falling
(to someone) Brother, Bapu is already late for prayers
Gandhi turns to the person; he makes the pranam
Full shot
Godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly, wildly draws his gun and fires
The camera closes on Gandhi as he staggers and falls, the red stain of blood seeping through his white shawl
Oh, God
oh, God
Manu and Abha bend over him, silent in their first shock
The sound of panic and alarm begins to grow around them, they suddenly scream and begin to cry
/ Bapu
Bapu
-  - Blackness
Silence
moment -- we sense the blackness moving -- like dark smoke
The camera is pulling back very slowly and we can tell the blackness is smoke rising from a fire
And now we see that it is a funeral pyre
And all around that pyre a mass of silent humanity
Through the smoke, sitting cross-legged near the rim of the flames, we see Nehru
and Azad and Patel, Mirabehn and Kallenbach, the drawn faces of Lord and Lady Mountbatten, Manu and Abha
-  - helicopter shot coming slowly up the wide river, low, toward a barge and a mass of people in the distance
And now we are over the barge, and it is covered with flowers
Flowers flow downstream around it
An urn sits on it -- containing Gandhi's ashes -- and Nehru stands near it, Azad and Patel a little behind him
And as the barge floats down the river, Nehru bends and lifts the urn
Featuring Nehru
He swallows, restraining his own emotion, and slowly, ritualistically, sprinkles the ashes over the water
And as they spread, we hold on that stretch of the river, the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark, timeless current moves them toward the sea
' (weak, struggling, as he spoke the words to Mirabehn) There have been tyrants and murderers -- and for a time they can seem invincible
But in the end they always fall
Think of it -- always
When you are in doubt that that is God's way, the way the world is meant to be
think of that
And slowly the camera begins pulling back, leaving the flowers, the brown, rolling current as though leaving the story of Gandhi, going far out, away from the great river, reaching higher and higher, through streaks of clouds as end titles begin
And through them, once more we hear, dimly, reminiscently, through the rushing wind: "At home children are writing 'essays' about him
"
the croaky voice singing, "God save our gracious King"
Dyer: "Sergeant Major --," the Sergeant Major: "Take aim
," Dyer: "Fire
," the sound of massed rifle fire, screams
"You are my best friend
my highest guru, and my sovereign lord
" "Who the hell is he
," " don't know, sir
" "My name is Gandhi
Mohandas
Gandhi
"
the sound of rioting, women's screams, terror
"Find a child -- a child whose mother and father have been killed
little boy
about this high
"
"He thinks he's failed
"
"Long live Mahatma Gandhi
Long live Mahatma Gandhi
