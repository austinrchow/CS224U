The Black Men (,  , , ,  , , and ) are slaves just recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville Mississippi
The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called, The   ( and )
One of the seven slaves is our hero
he's fourth in the leg iron line
We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which has been    by Bull Whip Beatings
As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a  of misery and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip
Bare feet step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles

Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past
In this instance we see Django in a   at the Greenville Auction
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the cell door, his wife  being led to the auction block
He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance, he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold
" Then she's taken away to whereabouts unknown, never to be seen again
As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers; in the with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed for forty
yank him out
of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the structure
The ground floor is covered by the    who stand in front of the auction block

Django has never cared for white folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly
It's 's turn as the   wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on the auction block

/--"  -  -- It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride , keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the
sky to create a little top light
It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek
bed to keep from getting lost
Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on their horse, as
does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves, two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air
In fact the seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and all of them chugging out smoky breath, and
slightly moving in unison, resemble a human locomotive
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white fur collars
and a   appears ahead of them on the road
This makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their rifles for possible trouble
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, - from the background to the foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress
long grey winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler hat on his head
Who's that stumblin around in the dark
State your business, or prepare to get winged
Calm yourselves gentlemen,  mean you no harm
'm simply a fellow weary traveler
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his face
He speaks with a slight German accent
(to the Slavers) Good cold evening gentlemen
(to the shivering Slaves) Good evening-'m looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the'name of The Speck Brothers
Might that be you
Who wants to
know
do
'm Dr
King Schultz, and this is my horse, Fritz
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught him
You a doctor
Dr Affirmative
What kinda doctor
Dr Dentist
Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you purchase those men at The Greenville
Slave Auction
So what
Dr So,  wish to parley with you
Speak English
Dr Oh, 'm sorry
Please forgive me, it is a second language
Amongst your inventory, 've been led to believe, is a specimen 'm keen to acquire
(to the slaves) Hello you poor devils
Is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness
In the darkness a rings out; '  () 'm from The Carrucan Plantation
Dr
Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his lantern, illuminating our hero Django
Dr Splendid
And what's your name young, man
Django
Dr Wunderbar
You're exactly the one 'm looking for
So tell me Django - by the way that's a amazing name - during your time at the Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Brothers
Django nods his head, yes
Dr
Schultz is delighted
Dr Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj
Dem da Brittle Brothers
Dr So Django, do you think you could recognize - i12
The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their Slave in polite conversation
with a touch of disbelief
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that
Dr Like what
Like that
Dr My good man, 'm simply trying to ascertain Speak English, goddamit
Dr Everybody calm down
'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
don't care, no sale
Now off wit ya
Dr Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for sale
Ace raises his rifle towards the German
Move it
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer
Dr My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention
Last chance, fancy pants Dr - Very well - The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in darkness
The next    we see is the good doctors  out of his holster, and  point blank into Ace Specks face
the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt
Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans direction
Dr
his  in the head
The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we hear
:
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream
The Slaves watch all this
They've never seen a white man kill another white man before
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse, pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck
Dr Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast
But  didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses
Dr
Sch
ultz  the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over Dicky's body
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace
Dr
only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me
And  do believe  have
( ) one, two, three, four, five, six, seven witnesses who can attest to that fact
My damn legs busted
Dr No doubt
Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, 'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django
( ) As  was saying, if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, would you recognize them
Yes
Dr Now 'm sure
to you, all unshaven white men look alike
So Django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out The Brittle Brothers
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation
It's outside
Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops letting out a shout
The three overseers known as are outside peeking in through the window
They  in through the front door
Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg
they fondle his ass
they squeeze her tit
they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck faster
then they yank him off, as   climbs on top of Broomhilda
the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts, and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife
can point 'em out
Dr Sold American
So Mr
Speck, how much for Django
'm gonna lose this leg
Dr Yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, 'm afraid that will be the
end result
But back to business, how much do you want for Django
You go to hell
Dr Don't be silly
How much for Django
800 dollars
Dr Oh come now,  may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was  born yesterday
The
good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket
Dr In this most helpful pamphlet that  picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says that the going rate for African flesh' - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty to eighty dollars
Now handsome no doubt as Django is, technically, he is a field
nigger
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and why would they lie - puts his price at eighty dollars
So in light of that, how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young Django here
Dr
Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver
Dr And since your late brother
won't be using it anymore, 'd like to purchase his nag
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his
pocket, and tosses it on Dicky's body
He bends down and, puts the paper money-
in the saddle bags on Dicky's dead horse
With
his hands in there, he roots around and finds the keys to-the leg irons
He unlocks Django's leg irons
Django is free
Dr There you go Django,
Give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse
Also, if  was you, 'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver
Puts on the warm jacket over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse
Dr
Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground
Dr Mr
Speck,  am afraid  will require a bill of sale
Do you have one
Dicky just curses him
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket; Dr thought not
No worries,  come prepared
(as he writes) This will serve nicely as a bill of sale
(he stops, then says to Django) Django is spelled with a silent "", is it not
Huh
Dr Why not
He writes it in his book with a silent "", then stops to admire the way it looks
Dr Yes, that does add a little character
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen
Dr If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your mark here
The
Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face
The good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief
Then takes out a pocket knife
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear
He signs the bill of sale
Dr Mr
Speck,  would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in leg irons
Dr Now as to you poor devils
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles
Dr So as
see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices
One, once 'm gone, you lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town
Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came
Or
Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there
put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country
The choice is yours
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds; Dr Oh, and on the off chance that there's any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is
Tata
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse
Dr Just give him a little kick
Django does, and the horse responds by moving
Dr See, it's not so difficult
-    - The   on a western landscape
The two men ride their horses silently, horse hooves - among the rocks
Django wears Specks winter coat, with one of Dr
Schultz's white button down dress shirts underneath it
As they ride through the picturesque scene
Dr
Schultz breaks the silence
Dr So, Django, what do you intend to name him
Who
Dr Your horse
What horse
Dr
' The horse you're riding
This ain't my horse
Dr Yes it is
No it ain't, it's your horse
'm just riding it
Dr Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute - technically not
If it's my horse,  can give it to you, and as of now, 'm doing such
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse, congratulations
/1 can't feed no horse
can't put no horse up in no stable
Dr () Don't worry about all that
They ride a bit longer in silence
the good doctor composes himself
then says with a smile; Dr So
now that that's settled
what do you intend to name it
Half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name
For instance my steed is named Fritz
He's stubborn, ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but couldn't do without him
(he pats Fritz's neck) Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't something one does lightly
So once you've thought about it for awhile - - Tony
Dr - Tony what
-  dunno, Tony the horse
Dr Oh, you mean you want to name your horse Tony
Yeah
That's what you jus' asked me, right
Dr When you're right you're right, indeed  did
Why Tony
gotta tell ya
You didn't tell me  gotta tell ya
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a western town
They pass by a sign that says; "  , " / Dr Well 'm naturally curious, of course, but there's no reason you  tell me
In fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed
And  do believe Tony wears it well
Good job Django, well done
-      - As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr
Schultz ride Fritz and Tony through the main street of town
Daughtrey looks like a million western towns we've seen before in movies
But to the of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a million other visitors
Dr What's everybody staring at
They never seen a nigger on a horse before
Dr What's this bizarre obsession they have with
you not riding horses
You askin' me
Dr
Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts
Django has a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets done
Dr
Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions
Dr So what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"
Dr 'm just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you can't do, and if you can't do it, why can't you do it
Like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it
Would the authorities frown on that
Hell yeah, they gonna frown
Dr What part would they find the most offensive
13 All of it
can't be walkin' in no saloon
can't be sittin' my ass on no chair, at no table
can't be drinkin' no drink
And  definitely can't be sharin' no drink, with no white man, in public
Dr So if you and  did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance
Dr Well in that case Django, after you
Whoa -  ain't funnin,  can't go in there
Dr Django you're going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said; "There's no time like the,present
" He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment
-  - The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the saloon
The   () is high up on a chair placed high up on a table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier
His back is turned away from the two patrons
Dr Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open for about a hour
But by then we'll be servin' breakfast - He turns around and sees them
Whoa
What the hell you think you doin' boy, get that nigger outta here
-  - It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out of the bar to get the Sheriff
When Dr
Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls; Dr Inn keeper
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall
This wouldn't be the marshalls jurisdiction
'This is just a infraction, on what  assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the Sheriff
The Saloon Keeper runs away
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon
Dr It looks like we must act as our own bartender
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's from the tap into mugs
Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks; What kinda dentist are you
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's
Dr haven't practiced dentistry in five years - Not to say once  know you better,  wouldn't like to get a look at that mouth - 'm sure it's a disaster - But these days  practice a new profession
Bounty Hunter
This gets no reaction from Django
Dr Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is
The Black Man shakes his head, no
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer, ; Dr Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses
15 Dr
(') The state places a bounty on a man's head
track that man,  find that man,  kill that man
After 've killed him,  transport that man's corpse back to the authorities - and sometimes that's easier said then done
show that corpse to the authorities - proving, yes indeed,  have truly killed him - At which point, the authorities pay me the bounty
(lifting his beer) Cheers
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink
What's a bounty
Dr It's like a reward
You kill people and they give you a reward
Dr Certain people, yes
White people
Dr Mostly
few Mexicans
Couple Chinamen
Bad people
Dr Badder they are, bigger the reward
Which brings me to you, and  must admit 'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
On one hand,  despise slavery
On the other hand,  need your help, and if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better
So for the time being, 'm going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit
() Still
having said that,
feel guilty
So
'd like the two of us to enter into an agreement
'm looking for The Brittle Brothers, however in this endeavor 'm at a slight disadvantage, in so far as,  don't know what they look like
But you do
dont'cha
1G i12 Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis Brittle, as Big John  the "r" into his cheek with a
know what they look like, all right
Dr Good
So, here's my agreement
You travel with me till we find them - - Where we goin'
Dr hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but  don't know where
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them
And when we find them, you point them out, and  kill them
You do that,  agree to give you your freedom
twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother - that's seventy-five dollars
your horse, Tony even though 've already gave him to you -- but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust, 'll buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included
Dr
Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window
Dr And as if on cue
here comes the sheriff
-  - We see the sheriff,  , walk towards the saloon cradling a Winchester
Some  (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to watch
leads a herd of   through town
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch
As they do, The Sheriff says; 1 2 Now why y'all wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people
You ain't got nothin' better to do, then to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass - From his top step on the porch, Dr
King Schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff, as if to shake it
:
-  into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve
Once in hand, the dentist one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp
The tiny gun makes a tiny  sound
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the dirt
The  are startled
As is Django
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading his tiny pop shooter, a  yells out; What did you jus' do to our sheriff
Dr
Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's skull, killing him dead
In the background,   faints
The Boy and his Goats scatter
Dr
Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street
Dr Now you can go get the marshall
-    - snaps the   Daughtrey to attention
Move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon
And want six men and six Winchesters behind it
And  want two men with two rifles on this roof, and two men with two rifles on that roof, with all barrels pointed at that front door
And somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place
The last  on the rooftop takes his position
-  - Dr
Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player
terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains on the window
Dr
Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair
All of his weapons, including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest
Dr What are they doing
think they wonderin' why you playin' the piana'
Dr Good
() But what are they doing
buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front, now they hidin' behind it with guns
And a buncha other white folks are up on the roof, with rifles pointed down here
Dr Damn, they got that organized fast
Is the marshall out there
If the one  think is the
marshall is the marshall, he's out there
)9 Dr What makes you think he's the marshall
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'
' You in the saloon
Dr
Schultz stops playing the piano
' We got eleven Winchesters on every way outta that buildin'
You got once chance git outta this alive
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and  mean, right now
Dr First things first
Is this the marshall have the pleasure of addressing
Yes it is, this is
Marshall Gill Tatum
Dr Wunderbar
So marshall,  have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, 'm ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head
trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America,  shant be shot down in the street, by either you or your deputies, before 've had my day in court
You mean like you did our sheriff
Shot 'em down like a dog in the street
Dr Yes, that's exactly what  mean
Do have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein' somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town
Dr Fair enough marshall, here we
come
Dr ( ) They're a little tense out there
So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking
Django looks at him like, "as if
" - /  - lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon
Outside of range, the   watches the stand off
The saloon doors open, and Dr
Schultz and Django, hands raised, step outside
You unarmed
Dr Yes indeed we are
Marshall Tatum, may address you, your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred
Go on
Dr My name is Dr
King Schultz
And like yourself, marshall,  am a servant of the court
The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of two hundred dollars
That's two hundred dollars, dead or alive
The hell you say
Dr '
m aware this is probably disconcerting news
But 'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years
know this because
three years ago he was rustling cattle from, The
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock Texas
/ Dr
(') In my possession
is a warrant made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas
You are encouraged to wire him
He will back up who  am, and who your dear departed sheriff was
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks
Then Dr
Schultz delivers the coup de grace
Dr In other words marshall, you owe me two hundred dollars
-    - Django and Dr
Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to Gatlinburg
Dr
Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants, Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet
Dr One needs a plan, son
These are brutal times
man who survives, is a man with a plan
man who thrives, is a man with a good plan
So, having said that, what's your plan, young Django
What'cha mean
Dr Well, after this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and seventy five dollars in your back pocket
What's your plan after that
Find my wife, and buy her freedom
Dr Django,  had no idea you were a married man
Do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously
Huh
Dr Do slaves believe in marriage'
Me and my wife do
Dr Where is she now
dunno
They put us in different boxcars, and sent
to The Greenville Slave Auction
She got sold two days 'fore me
But  don't know who to
Dr
Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky
Dr Care for some jerky
Sure
Dr
Schultz rips him off a piece
Django chews on it
As he chews, ; Dr So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and purchase her
freedom
Only you don't know where she is
chewing Django nods his head, yes
Dr
Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating the dilemma, then pronounces; Dr Well that shouldn't be all that difficult
So how long ago did all this happen
few months ago
Dr Three or four
Three
Dr So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation, and shewassold at The Greenville Slave Auctiontosome :unknown customer three monthsago
Django nods his head, yes
Z3 Dr The bad part about slavery being a business, is it's immoral
The good part about it being a business is, they keep records
Somewhere in Greenville there's a book with your wife's name in it, and the name of the customer who bought her, and more then likely their address
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts
Dr Still, seventy-five dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's not going to get you very far in Greenville
Not to mention a slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the safest place you could visit
Free or not
'll have my freedom papers
Dr Yes you will
But say you show them to some rascals, and they take them from you and tear them up
They could do that
Dr 'm not saying they would, but they could
They do that 'll kill 'em
Dr Great
Now you get hung for killin' a white man
The point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you
Well  gotta go, when do  go
Dr When you get more dangerous
-  - Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga
We're in the back of a  that
sells /
Django comes bursting out of the stores back door
He's very distressed
One glance at the outfit he's wearing explains the distress
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at Versailles
Dr
Schultz comes trailing after him
Dr Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act"
You're playing a character
Your character is The Valet
This is what The Valet wears
Remember what  told you
During the act, you can never break character
-  - We see Dr
Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of , a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee
Django leads a riderless horse, behind him and Tony
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight
The patriarch of Bennett Manor,  " " , dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground
While there are plenty   out in the cotton fields, the majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty , fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "'"
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton
As Dr
Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of , , and   (')
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
Dr This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk
said niggers - ate` Dr His name is Django, he's a free man, and he can ride what he pleases
Not on my
property, around my niggers he can't
Dr My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
Allow me to unring this bell
My name is Dr
King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony
Fritz, does his head bow
This makes the pretty ' surrounding Bennett, giggle
Dr Mr
Bennett, 've been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man
And it is in these capacities that we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk with you now
State your business
Dr wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals, no appointment, no nuttin'
Dr 'm afraid so
Well what if  say,  don't like you, or your fancy pants
nigger, and  wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta say about that
Dr Mr
Bennett, if you are the business man, 've been led to believe you to be, have five thousand things  might say, that could change your mind
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett
Spencer laughs
'mon inside, get yourself something' cool to drink
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor
Dr Maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds
Absolutely
Betina
pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named , snaps to attention
Yes sir, Big Daddy
( ) What's your Jimmies name again
Dr Django
Betina sugar, take Django around the grounds
Show 'em all the pretty stuff
As you please, Big Daddy
Dr
Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner; Dr Mr
Bennett,  must remind, you, Django is a free man
He cannot be treated like a slave
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself
Understood
, Schultz
Betina
Yes, sir
Django isn't a slave
Django is a free man
Do you understand
You're not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here
Ya got it
Ya want  should treat 'em like white folks
No that's not what  said
Then  don't know what'cha want Big Daddy
Yes,  can see that
( ) What's the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass
His mama works at the lumber yard
He comes by and fixes the winda's when we have a problem
The     chimes in; Oh, you mean Jerry
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry
( ) You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar
Yes 'em, Big Daddy
Well that's it then
just treat 'em like you would Jerry
-      - Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite the pair
She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down
What'cha do for your massa'
Didn't you hear him tell ya,  ain't no slave
So you really free
Yes
You mean you wanna dress like that
Django fumes
-   ( ) - Both Spencer Bennett and Dr
Schultz sit on the back porch drinking lemonade
Dr 've been'told by those who should know, the most exquisite African flesh in the state of Tennessee is bred right here on your land
And from the look of these black angels, my sources weren't wrong
Oh  got my share of, coal blacks, horse faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the field
But the lion share of my lady niggers are real show pony's
Dr Well that's what 'm looking for, a show pony for young Django
So the only question that remains is, do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars
Dr
Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger, is practically my middle name
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds
The cotton fields and the  picking it, in the background
Betina, come over here,  need to ask you something
He moves her by the tree for more privacy
Betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested
What'cho want
'm lookin' for three white men
Three brothers
Overseers
Their name is Brittle
Do you know 'em
Brittle
Yes, Brittle
John Brittle
Ellis Brittle
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj
don't know dem
They could be usin' a different name
They woulda' come to the plantation in the last year
You mean The Shaffer's
Maybe
Three brother
Ah-huh
Are they here
Ah-huh
Can you point one of 'em out to me
Well ones over in that field
She points to the cotton field, at a  on top of a horse, whip in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and takes out a shiny brass , the type a sea captain might use
Obviously a prop from Dr
Schultz
He slides it open, places it against his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton field landscape
: Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself , but who Django knows to be  , looks on, oblivious to Django's observation
He remembers Ellis Brittle  a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a he lowers the glass
3 0 () Is that who you lookin' for
Yep
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse
Where's the other two
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs
They whippin' Little Jody
She nods her head, yes
Point me in that direction
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right
" Go git that white man,  came here with
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him and The Brittle Brothers
memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his wife Broomhilda, a peelin'
' :  punishment by bullwhip, across the back
makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped
the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his , keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy
3/ Please Big John, she won't do it no more
She's real sorry
The   her back
() Goddamit, Big John
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild
a, begs Big John Brittle with everything he has
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the ; like the way you beg, boy
-  - Little Raj Brittle, ties  , a petite slave girl (eighteen) to a dead tree stump
paces, taking a few practice  with his
begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy
goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'
You know yourself it's for your own good
Niggers are clumsy
You'd break everything in goddamn sight, you weren't cured
And the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin'
Little Jody begs to differ
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends who happily run along with the fast walking man who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels
Django pays the little dogs no nevermind
3 2- In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back
After this we'll see if you break eggs again
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them
They don't see him
Big John rears back to make the first
' , stops him; John Brittle
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks
up, and in a discarded full length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the stable wall, he see's , dressed in his powder blue satin Little Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French Bulldogs
on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's the same thing in the mirror
looks to his left at the sounds of the voice
turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize
just stares back
smile disappears
He recognizes Django
So does Roger
Django
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to shake his hand
Remember me
Django extends his arm, and Dr
Schultz's Derringer arm contraption,
the   into his hand, and he  a tiny bullet smack dab into  '
goes into shock
he falls to his knees
he looks up, clutching his heart, at Django
like the way you die, boy
3 3 Big John hears it
then tips over dead
can't believe what she's just seen
who just happen to be walking in the background, see it
is stunned
then comes to his senses, fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground
It goes off
himself in the foot, he     in pain
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound
of the
picks Big John's  off the ground
, and begins across the face and chest
gather
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it ( ) into Roger
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement
Dr
Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand
He sees Django, and the two dead bodies
Dr Who are they
That's John Brittle, and that's his little brother Raj
Dr Where's Ellis
He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying to make an escape
' goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel
Dr Are you sure that's him
Ellis gets further away
Yes
Dr Are you positive
Ellis gets further away
dunno
Dr You don't know if you're positive
Ellis gets further away
don't know what, positive,'means
Dr It means you're sure
Yes
Dr Yes, what
Yes 'm sure that's Ellis Brittle
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse
The dead man   horribly in the thick cotton brush
splashes on
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his  and his , and some   come around like a angry mob
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands
Django does the same with his pistol
Dr
Schultz addresses the
Dr Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm
Just who the hell are you two jokers
35; Dri12 am Dr
King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America
The man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my
deputy
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and Roger Brittle -- - They were goin by the name, Shaffer
Dr You know them by the name, Shaffer
But the butchers real names'were Brittle
These are wanted men
The law wants them for murder
reiterate, this warrant states dead or alive
When Django and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal
boundaries
Now  realize passions are high
But  must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is, you will be hung by the neck until you are dead
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust
After his dramatic pause for effect
Dr
Schultz says; Dr May  please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the paper
Gimmie
Dr
Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to the plantation owner
Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to what it says
Dr Satisfied
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German
Dr May  have that back
36 ,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper
Dr We good
Get off my land
Dr Post haste
( ) Load up the bodies as quickly as you can, and let's get out of here
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse the bounty hunters brought with them
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way for one final threat
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie while you on my property
But for lettin' a nigger kill a white man, and especially for letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make it out of the county alive
Mark my words Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin' from my motherfuckin' gate
Dr 'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your regulator playmates aren't shy about killing for what you believe in
But mark my words Big Daddy, if you make a move towards Django or myself, you better be prepared to die for it
The two men ride off
The Black and White Audience watch them go
--    - : Dr
Schultz's  , the doctor's hands remove /
from it
3 7 : The doctor's  bind the Three Sticks of Dynamite together
: The Three Sticks are   in a
: The Yellow Dynamite Sticks, are buried in dirt about half way, with the yellow part protruding from out of the ground
lying on his belly in the grass
That's them sonsabitches
' : We see the camp by the lake that Dr
Schultz and Django have set up
Both wrapped up in bedrolls
The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers lie by them in a pile
campfire slowly dims
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with observing the camp, from over a grade
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came
Where about -  are waiting for them  , all of the riders heads are covered by   with eyes and mouth holes cut out
Some carry , all carry  or
Spencer mounts his horse
"Big Daddy" issues orders astride his steed
Now unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em
That's way too simple for these jokers
We're gonna whip that nigger lover to death
And 'm gonna personally, strip and clip that garboon myself
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his head
He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack; Damn,  can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing
He sticks his fingers in the
eye holes, and rips, trying to make the holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured
We ready, or what
3 7 Hold on 'm fuckin' with my eye holes
() Shit
just made it worse
He rips
it off his head in frustration
can't see shit either
Who made this goddamn shit
0
Willards wife
Well make you own goddamn masks
( ) Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate what Jenny did
Well if all  hadda do was cut a bag, could cut it better then this
0
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see
Not too good
mean if
don't move my head, can see you pretty good
more or less
But when  start ridin' the bag starts moving all over, and 'm riding blind
Randy tears at his bag
Oh shit,  just made mine worse
He puts it on-then says; Yep, it's worse
He yanks it off his head
Did anybody bring any extra bags
No, no one brought a extra bag
3 9 'm just asking
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag
can't see in this fucking thing
can't breathe in this fucking thing
And  can't ride in this fucking thing
Fuck all y'all
'm going home
watched my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches
And all  hear is criticize, criticize, criticize
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'
Willard rides off
removes his bag, and yells after Willard
,  tole yo to keep quiet
They're asleep, not dead
But Willards riding off
Fuck Willard
Look, let's not forget why we're here
We gotta killer nigger over that hill
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em
Okay, 'm confused, are the bags on or off
Robert takes off his bag, and says; think we all think the bags was a nice idea
But, not pointing any fingers, they could of been done better
So how 'bout, no bags this time, but next time, we do the bags right, and then we go full regalia
Everyone takes off their bag
Wait a minute,  didn't say no bags
But nobody can see
So
So, it would be nice to see
Goddamit, this is a raid
can't see, you can't see, so what
All that matters is can the fuckin horse see
That's a raid
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well
-  - The  , all with    , come riding over the hill, hooting and hollerin
Since nobody can see they ride haphazard into each other
'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat ass
They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django don't react, they know something's up
But since nobody can see, everybody and everybody's horse is
confused
: "Where are they,  can't see" - "They tricked us" - "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "'all, Redfish fell off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad
" Then amongst the confusion
on the other side of the lake Then quickly cut into The Tree
Till we're in a   Dr with a    up to his eye
The Yellow covered    protruding from the ground, are inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it
Dr
SCHtJLTZ and  up in a tree
Dr Auf wiedersehen
, He fires
The Camp  Blowing Horses and Riders Apart
Dr
Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles
Dr Let 'em have it
can't see nothin'
Dr Just fire into the smoke
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire
pandemonium reigns
Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of bodies, of horses and men
Men with legs and arms blown off, yell bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry
Some struggle to get the sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic
Some are shot by the rifle fire
The rest of the men not blown up, and still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see worth a damn
And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes more bucking and riders falling
About fifteen of the men who can still ride, high tail it the fuck out of there
Whipped and whimpering like dogs
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators  for his life
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs
scope sight rifle up to his eye
Schultz next to him, says; Dr He's getting away
got 'em
' his hooves race and rip up the grass
riding for his life
scope sight rifle up to his eye
Dr He's getting out of range
got 'em
:  black finger squeezes the rifle trigger
we're behind him as he rides away,   we hear the whistling of what sounds like an incoming missle
we're in
front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet, his
got 'em
falls from his horse, dead
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks
to Dr
Schultz
Dr Like that, huh
Referring to the scope sight rifle; like
Dr Well,  think while they take this opportunity to lick their wounds, we should take this opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee
They hop out of the tree
Dr
Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle
Django gets his first initial "" etched into it
The men go to different stores to purchase Django's wardrobe
The outfit bought, is selected by Django, with suggestions offered by Schultz
When he's done, Django looks damn handsome in his new duds
Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket, Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat
He looks a
bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright on "Bonanza"
However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as his winter coat
-   - Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside the good doctor Schultz
The German carries a
Dr But 'm serious son, Greenville is just too dangerous for you to go fucking around there
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't even be forty miles on any side of Greenville
, You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her
If Greenville's where  gotta go to find out where she went, then  gotta go
Now you were sayin' where  gotta go first
Dr There'should be some sort of records office
You know when she was sold, you know where she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and you know her name
what is her name
Broomhilda
Schultz reacts
Dr Broomhilda
Django
nods his head yes
Dr Were her owners German
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that
Yeah, how did you know
She wasn't born on The Carrucan Plantation
She was raised by a German mistress, The Von Shafts
She can speak a little German too
Dr Your wife
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to talk German with
Dr So let me get this straight, your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft
Yep
Mouthful, huh
Dr To say the least
(stopping the horse) This looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic
What'd ya say, here
-     - The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a cup of tea
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters were German
Dr Broomhilda is a German name
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda
Dr No, not so much
Broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the German legends
Really
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda
Dr Yes there is
Do you know it
Dr Every German knows that story
Would you like me to tell you
Django nods his head, yes
Dr Well Broomhilda was a princess
She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods
Anyway, her father is really mad at her
What she do
Dr don't exactly remember
think she disobeys him in some way
So at first he's just going to obliterate her - Obliterate
what does that mean
Dr Like blow up
He pantomimes a explosion
Phew, that's pretty mad
Dr Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a little time, he calms down a bit
He's still mad at her
He still wants to punish her
Just not
blow her up
So instead what he does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain
Broomhilda's on a mountain
Dr It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere
So, he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain
And
then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
Does a fella arise
From now on as Dr
Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he wasn't aware of when the conversation started
Dr Yes Django, as a matter he does
fella named, Sigfried
Does Sigfried save her
Dr Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to his courage
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it
He defeats the dragon, because he's not afraid
of him
Dr
(') He walks through hellfire because Broomhilda's worth
it
After that last line of dialogue
the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches
know how he feels
Dr think 'm just starting to realize that
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he thinks about what he's going to say next
Dr Look Django,  don't doubt one day you will save your lady love
But 'm afraid  can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious
Let me ask you a question, how do you like the bounty hunting business
Kill white folks, and they pay ya
What's not to like
Dr hafta admit, we make a good team
But 'thought you were mad at me for killin' Big John and Rodger
Dr Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous
But normally, that's a good thing
How'd you like to partner up for the winter
What'd ya mean partner up
Dr You be my deputy, for real this time
lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs
Some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece
With one man, anything over three men is a risk
But with a partner
Creating cross fire
It's fish in a
barrel
lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills for the winter
You makin' another agreement
W7 Dr Yes
You work with me through the winter, till the snow melts
give you a third of my bounties
And while we're together, 'll teach you a few things you're going to need to know
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that head bow thing that Fritz can do
Dr That among other things
We make some money this winter, when the snow melts, 'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife
'm pretty good at finding people
Is it a deal
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him
So understandably, he's a little suspicious
Why you care what happens to me
Why you care if  find my wife
Dr Well frankly, 've never given anybody their freedom before
And now that  have, feel vaguely responsible for you
You're just not ready to go off on your own, it's that simple
You're too green, you'll get hurt
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,
it's kind of a big deal
As a German, 'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda
Django accepts that response
What follows is a  covering the five months that Django and Schultz partner up as bounty hunters
Schultz wears his normal ensemble
Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's really cold, which a lot of this Montage is
Then he still wears Ace Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes
to be improvised (more or less), where Dr
Schultz teaches Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going to be good at this
-  - We see Django and Dr
Schultz walking up a hill
Tony and Fritz have been left tied up downhill
Django leads a extra body  (named ) behind him
Dr
Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long case
They get to the top of the hill
It overlooks a small farmhouse
, 8 struggling behind a plow, and his helping him by leading the horse forward
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr
Schultz says; Dr Keep down or he'll see you
Who that farmer
Who cares
Dr Well since we came here to kill 'em, he just might
What
The little man pushin' that plow
Dr That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall
Smitty Bacall is a farmer
Dr No
Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber who's hiding out as a farmer, because there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head
He hands Django the scope rifle case
Dr And he's all yours my boy
lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye
: on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse and his son
Django's finger on the trigger
but he hesitates
Dr Oh what happened
to mister  wanna kill white folks for money
His son's with him
Dr Good
He'll have a loved one with him
Maybe even share a last word
That's better then most get, and a damn
sight better then he deserves
1I129 Django still hesitates
Dr Put down the rifle
Don't worry, 'm not mad at you
Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants
Dr Read it aloud
Consider it today's lesson
() "Wanted, dead or alive
Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang
For murder and stagecoach robbery
Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall
One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as follows,  ,  , and " Dr Well done
Bravo
is who Smitty Bacall is
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two, they would never of printed that
( ) But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it
You want to save your wife by doing what do
This is what  do
kill people, and sell their corpses for cash
His corpse is worth seven thousand dollars
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him
Django
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first
Then he figures'out his father was just shot
He goes to him in the dirt
Dr You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill
Why
Dr It's good luck
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body, leading the extra body horse behind them
50 As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's Son cradling his dying father
in his arms, the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies
Dr See, they're having a tender little father son moment now
No doubt the most heartfelt one they've ever had
-   - It's now full on snowy winter in the hills
Django practices his quick draw against a  he's built
He sticks a  in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's heart would be
He
Shoots the bottle heart
He
Shoots the left coal eye
He
Shoots the right coal eye
He
Shoots the carrot nose
Dr
Schultz comes up behind him
Dr think it's safe to say you're faster then the snowman
-   - outlaw gang known as The  -   (five guys) ride through a snowy forest at night
When all five men and their Horses, are up in a tree,    them
-      - The  continue to   as Dr
Schultz and Django ride down the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's with five corpses
571 The local ,  , watches the two men ride up, he knows them
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there
Dr The Wilson - Lowe Gang
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang
Dr
Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands it down to the friendly peace officer
Dr Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe
And three of their acolytes
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere
And if'in they do, god must love 'em, so who are we to say
Come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee
-  '  - The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them coffee
After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid, they get down to business
As Schultz and Gus discuss the bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall
On the third one he reads,  , and a two thousand dollar bounty, "That one", Schultz says
Django   off the wall
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty hunting team
And Django, a genuine bounty hunter
-   - The snow has melted, and it's
And inside of this meadow Django practices his fast draw against five men
by Schultz throwing   in the air
shoots three coins,  again hitting another, then falls to the ground to get the fifth
He looks up from the ground at Schultz
5L As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says; Dr You're pretty confident aren't you
Django nods his head, yes
Dr You have reason to be
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center
He drops them on top of Django
Still think 'm too green for Greenville
Dr
Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says; Dr Oh you're ready for Greenville
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says; Dr Greenville ready for you, that 'm not so sure
He blows out the match
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of slavery
Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man
He's not a slave anymore
He's a bounty hunter
(ala "Rocky" and "") -      - The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other
53 We see Django and Dr
Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi
The buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around
, , and  in  are everywhere you look
being marched one way or the other, move through the muddy streets of Greenville
on horses move them along
filled with   ( ), and pretty , driven by   roll through the street
(14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of through town
' , Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block
on the bottom of the screen: , Dr
Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock
Django is neither disgusted or
shocked, he knows first hand how Greenville operates
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the half dressed: in chains
He   with his six Other Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by The Speck Brothers
On that day he might as well of been a steer
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge , like a
At the moment there's no train in the depot
The , at a earlier time, pulling into the depot
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless  , Django watches the train pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar
: hatch in the roof of the boxcar is   , and (  ), peer down at their human cargo
Good god almighty these niggers stink
Niggers stink, where's the shock
(to the Slaves ) Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen well, 'm only gonna say this once
There's a slave corral right across from this boxcar
We gittin ready to open these doors
When we do, y'all run as fast as you can, right into that pen
'Anyone gittin off trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad
Now you niggers better comprehend
And that goes for any African garboons amongst y'all can't understand english
your American buddies better shove your ass in the right direction, or your trip to this country is going to be short, and pointless
Train to pen as fast as you can
The boxcar door is slid open, and a run full out from the train to the steer corral
We spot Django during the running
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed
with rifles act as prison guards
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up the boxcar holding the females
They do their run to their pen out of view
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild
a running with the other , then she's gone from view
() Django and Dr
Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of Greenville
Dr It's a spectacle out of Dante
You should see it from the other side
Dr Frankly,  don't know if  could endure this
You'd be surprised what you can endure
() Where to
675 Dr Records office
-   - Dr
Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man enter, and Dr
Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words routine
The
: -   - The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance
Then, as before Django loses sight of her
-   -  - We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and the leg irons scrap her ankles
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks
In other words, from his perspective, and memory
This is the,only time the story will shift to Broomhilda's perspective
The strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main Street
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django was sold in at the beginning
Instead She's just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon
Her  () starts his pitch on the  or so  that watch this puny make shift auction
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her breath which one will buy her
Among the ugly white men we see Mr
(), not quite as ugly as the rest
An older well dressed, classy gentleman
Next to him is his twenty four year old overweight awkward son
Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon,   , he nudges his dad
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd
Then her back, revealing her whip marks
Then pointing out the runaway "r" branded in her cheek
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight of the whip marks
The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle
- Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt nigger gal gentle
makes a bid
yikes
higher bid
reacts
makes leap frog big bid
reacts
makes a bid
makes a bid
make a bid

Mr
Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty
Broomhilda notices that
And makes more eye contact with Scotty
They look at each other as Mr
Harmony continues to bid
comes on the soundtrack
() On that day, eight months ago, the auction was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present for his fat boy son Scotty
Mr
Harmony congratulates his son
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners
Later they leave for the Harmony house
Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard
He hands her a little white bag
This is for you
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it
They're jelly beans
Try one
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth
Good huh
She nods her head, yes
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans
$ -   - The buckboard makes its way down a country road
Broomhilda in the back, and Scotty driving the wagon
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon
She's beginning to realize the young master is the shy type
Master Scotty
Yes Broomhilda
'm lonely back here
Can  come on up with you on that seat so we can talk
Please, 'd love that
She climbs into the driver's seat
In more ways then one
'8 -    - nice two story southern house
Very nice, but hardly a plantation
The household's
Broomhilda will be the fifth
The buckboard pulls up to the front of the house
Scotty's mother, Mrs
( ), waits to meet her son, and his new bought nigger gal
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her; Mrs What's your name, gal
Broomhilda
Mrs Follow me
into the kitchen, ('to her son) You stay out here
-  - Mrs
Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen
The that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady
Mrs
Harmony grabs Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her; Mrs want to have a word with you, wench
You met my boy Scotty
You can tell ain't no white girl gonna fool with him
And if they do fool with him, they fool with him for the wrong reason
Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a man yet
That's why you're here
Be nice to him
He's a very sweet boy
Play him right, he'll eat bird seed out of your palm
Play 'em wrong, you'll deal with me
like Scotty
He's just shy is all
All he needs is a little confidence
Mrs And you'll give that to him
'll do my best, mam
Scotty's a real sweet boy
Mrs He is, isn't he
Ah-huh
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist
19 () Basically The Harmony's bought a slave bride for young master Scotty that day
And the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime
At night they catch   together
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep, Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of
() As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if no visitors were about, Broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy
() And pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family
Mrs
Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together
The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard
After dinner, Mrs
Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano
Mr
Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook
() Scotty was never happier
Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour
Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him through it, making him feel loved and secure
() After three months of this bliss, Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for a romantic weekend in Greenville
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a fancy carriage
Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress, complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy
6O () White masters would take their pretty Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing how bad the other slaves had it, always made the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege position, (just in case they'd forgot)
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the march by in the mud
They watch her too
-   - Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel lobby, and rent a room at the front desk
: Scotty signs his name
The    checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion
-
- Greenville at night is a little different
At night, showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets
() And two, there was a sliver of society that ran through Greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to as, "Nigger love
" At night the streets, the bars, bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty Pony's
-   - An establishing shot
of the three story house that has been converted into private club called, The Cleopatra Club
() But the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra Club
: with the name,    on it, next to it is a profile of Nefertiti
6
-    -  - The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women)
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man,  , sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda
gotta tell you Broomhilda - don't care if  go to
hell for this - love you
And if loving you means  go to hell
Well then hello Mr
Devil
That was actually kind of funny
Broomhilda was right, all he needed was a little confidence
She puts her hand on his
() Then
speak of the devil and the devil appears
appears at their table
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie,  own The Cleopatra Club
And  would just like to welcome an attractive couple'like yourselves to my favorite place on earth
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin
Thank you so much, it's a great honor
We love it here
Pointing at a empty chair
May  join you
- Please, by all means
Calvin sits down
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless
How long have you been a member
We just joined this weekend
Well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage
Some may consider the dues excessive, but they're necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle we've all become accustomed to
Well said, and money well spent
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand
Candie sees this
It would be
my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie
She tries to imply they should stay where they are
He brushes her off with a, "Don't be silly
" We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they join the party
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named , whose dress is a little more revealing then the others
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time
But Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed
Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind
'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's disobedience
If these fancy
fucking white men weren't around making Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way
We  Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel
() After excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room
She got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didn't care, the night was ruined anyway
Some romantic weekend
Wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her
She'll fix his fat ass
Wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time
She's gonna scrape every pimple
'3 i12- The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends
() Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly card game
As the game wore on, it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony
Luckily for him, Scotty was holding
a inside straight
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him
She whispers something in his ear
( ) Really
( ) You know what Sheba just tole me
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says; What
She says she thinks you're cute
Really
Thank you Sheba,  think you're beautiful
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little lip
Want some lip
Scotty, is a little surprised
Well, she's your Pony
mean
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween friends
Go on honey, give 'em some sugar
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip intensive'soul kiss
The table enjoys the show
Then Sheba goes back to Calvin's side of the table
The game continues
Okay loverboy,  think you're trying to out brazen me in my own club, and  won't have it
If you're really holding cards, time to pony up
raise you five hundred
Candie throws in his chips
see your five hundred
(throws in chips) and raise you four hundred more
(tosses his last chips) Call
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night
Not so fast, boy
() Pot ain't fat enough yet
'm all in
Ain't that too bad
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his pot, especially with him holding an inside straight
would think a southern gentleman of such renown as yourself, wouldn't have to resort to buying a pot in his own club
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot
One final raise
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this
" It's Sheba's bill of sale
What
don't want her
Calvin
and the whole table laugh at that
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her
More laughter
In Greenville slaves are currency
And Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars
'm throwing Sheba in the pot
Match or fold
'm all out of money
But we ain't playin' for money no more
We matchin' nigger gals
And a nigger gal you got
can't bet Broomhilda
In Chickasaw County, she's money
Pony her up or fold
Somebody get him a piece of paper and a pencil
Somebody does
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards
Scotty makes a pressured decision
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for Broomhilda
Let me see your cards
Candie lays down his cards, he has a
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks
You cheated me
After Scotty uses the "" word, everybody quiets down
What did you just call me
called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch, cause that's what you are
Calvin calmly stands up from the table
He removes a small Derringer Gun
from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front himself
66 Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down
Scott Harmony
For calling me a card cheat in my own club, as a southern gentleman, challenge you to a duel
(to the Piano ) Piano player, will you hit three separate notes
( ) On the third note, pick up the gun and try to kill me
(to Piano player) Piano player please
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty
Wait a minute
no
ain't dueling with you
don't want to duel
Then get out of here, get in your buggy and get out of town
Sure
Let me just get my girl
You lost that girl, fat boy
Wait
Look
Mr
Candie, 'm sorry called you a cheat
But
please
can't give you Broomhilda
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta to fuckin' another one
() Or pick up that gun
Scotty can't leave
He can't go home without her
He can't face his parents
He can't walk out on her
No matters what happens he can't leave
6 7 Calvin Candie  Scotty Harmony dead
-   - Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the Hello Oliver
() Hello Mr
Candie, good evening
Good evening to you as well,
young Oliver
Could you please inform me which room your guest Scott Harmony is staying in
-   - Broomhilda is asleep in bed
Calvin comes' in the room holding his belt in his hand
He the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under
Broomhilda lies naked under the covers
Candie brings the belt down around her legs and backside
She hops out of bed

All to the amusement of the
-   - She  out of the hotel naked, and then She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking down at her
Welcome to Candyland
We do a   into Broomhilda's face
() That was four months ago
-    - Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning
Tons of   and  and   to be bought or sold fill the big hall

The ' () gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding
Many different    make bids on the big mandingo, including Calvin Candie
Dr
and  from a pair of /-
watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing
Dr
' We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave
bodyguard, , always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below
Candie's lawyer   joins him
Dr His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the owner of Candyland
Candyland
The mandingo fightin' place
Dr Oh, so you heard of it
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland
Dr Well apparently, that's where your wife is, and apparently the repellent gentleman down there is the one who owns her
i12i12` 6R The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction hall
Dr How much do you know about mandingo fighting
Not so much
little
Master Carrucan had a couple niggers he'd fight
Dr Can you play a mandingo expert
What
Dr Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters
Why
Dr Because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if  want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males
So my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game
And your character is the mandingo expert  hired to help me do it
They call that "One-Eyed Charly
" Dr
One-Eyed Charly
That's what you call it when you buy a slave expert
If you wanna raise horses, but don't know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses
He teaches ya
You wanna plant tobacco but don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco
Dr' Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly
70 You know, back on the plantation, my
job wasn't historian
Dr Testy
It's an unusual name
That's a perfectly legitimate question
So, can you convincingly play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly
Don't say, yes, if you can't
You want me to play a black slaver
There ain't nothin lower then a black slaver
Black slavers are lower then head house niggers, and buddy, that's pretty fuckin low
Dr Then play him that way
Give me your black slaver
Django gets that
Dr Can you do that
That,  can do
What's next
Dr To get ourselves personally invited to Candyland by Calvin Candie himself
-    - Dr
and  stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other
nice houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop steps to the front door
They ring the doorbell
pretty young black girl, dressed in a   outfit opens the door
( ) Bonjour
Dr () Bonjour, mon petite femme noire
We are here to see Calvin Candie
7) She's been taught to smile and say: Enter
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house
beautiful mulatto  greets the two men
( ) Hello gentlemen, 'm Cleo, can  help you
Dr
Schultz hands Cleo the guest card
Dr Yes  am Dr
King Schultz, and this is my associate, Django Freeman
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him
Dr We're here for a appointment with Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy
Yes you gentlemen are expected
Please make yourself comfortable
'll inform Monsieur Candie you've arrived
(referring to the ) Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen a tasty refreshment
Dr Not at the moment
Then Coco will entertain you while inform Monsieur Candie
Dr How charming
Cleo leaves
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside
-   ( ) - lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house
The are made up exclusively of well dressed  , and pretty () dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day
72 Some appear to be on dates
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary, special treat)
- Some are
two men with two women
Some are one man with two or three or more women
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef driven American dining
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana splits, and cookies
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink sarsaparilla
Dr
Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks; Dr Have you ever seen anything like this before
Django shakes his head, no
; - ( ) 'all gonna dine, it's real good
You like catfish, we got good catfish
They use alotta butta
You like sand dabs, we got sand dabs
descends from the clubs prominent staircase
Dr
Schultz, good to see you again
Dr Mr
Moguy, thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment
Mr Nonsense, it's my job
(') 73 Mr (') ( ) So this'is the One-Eyed Charly 've heard so much about
Dr Yes, this is Django
Django, this is Mr
Candie's lawyer, Leonide'Moguy
Just call me Leo
Calvin's in the billiard room, follow me
'all want Coco should come along too
Dr We would be quite lucky indeed if the charming Coco cared
to follow
Coco blushes
You better watch out doctor, you gonna steal this little pony's heart
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they ; Dr How long have you been associated with Mr
Candie
Calvin and  were about eleven when we went to boarding school together
One could almost say,  was raised to be Calvin's lawyer
One could almost say, you a nigger
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to Mr
Moguy
What did you say
Dr Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky
Anything else about Mr
Candie  should know before  meet him
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile
7EF Dr What civilized people aren't
That's why all the French ambiance
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie
Dr
Schultz says in    ; Dr () What ever he prefers
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz
Oh he doesn't speak French
Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room
Moguy slides the doors open
The party enters the billiard room
-   ( ) - Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba
Also, at this moment,   are having a bloody and savage fight to death in this closed room
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room
His name is Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says; Why do you want to get in the mandingo business
That's quite abrupt and aggressive
Dr
Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted; Dr You don't intend to allow your 2nd
(referring to Moguy) to make the proper introductions
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz; 7S Quit stalling and answer the question
The room is quiet
Dr The awful truth
() 'm bored, and it seems like a good bit of fun
Candie takes that to heart
He'll accept it for now
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight goin on that's a good bit of fun_ Dr
Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never ' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches
Which means not only must he watch
the two men beat each other to death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it
The bigger nigger is mine
just bought him today
What's his name, Moguy
Big Fred
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable Italian gentlemen to my right
Amerigo Vassepi
( ) What's your nigger's name
Luigi
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room
slave bartender named,  tends it
How 'bout you, boy
You find nigger fightin' a good bit of fun
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all
How'd you two like to try the signature drink of the club
79 Dr We'd love to
(yelling to the ) Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and don't spare the rum
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses
Big Fred kills Luigi
Candie and his friends cheer
Arrivederci Luigi
Well, Mr
Vassepi, looks like you owe me ten dollars
Amerigo pays up the puny bet
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks
They both take a sip
Schultz hates it, Django loves it
Candle turns his attention to Django
What's your name, boy
Dr His name is Django
( ) Where'd ya dig him up
Dr fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together
( ) 've heard tell about you
heard you're a real bright boy
() 'm curious, what makes you such a mandingo expert
'm curious, what makes you so curious
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django; What you say, boy
77 /i12
Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle
gentle
Dr Monsieur Candie,  would appreciate it if you directed your line of inquiry to me
Doc, 'm a seasoned slaver, you are a neophyte
'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you
Dr With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, didn't seek you out for your advice sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price
was'under the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business
No we weren't talking business yet
We were discussing my curiosity
Now according to Moguy here, if  do business with you
( ) ,
'm doin' business with both of y'all
( ) He does the eyeballin', you the billfold
Dr Well you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yes
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is
Candie turns his attention back to Django
( ) So Bright Boy,
Moguy here tells me you looked over my African flesh, and were none too impressed
we see
Django looking over
Not for top dollar
Well then we got nothing more to talk about
You wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me, those are the beat ass niggers wanna sell
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell
don't sell the niggers  don't wanna sell
Dr
Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;- Dr You won't sell your best
You won't even sell your second best
But your third best
you don't want to
sell him
But if made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it
who knows what could happen
What do you consider ridiculous
Dr
For a truly talented specimen, "The Right Nigger"

How much would you say, Django
Twelve thousand dollars
Calvin Candle takes in the figure
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity
Now you got my attention
--   --  - Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner in the restaurant
All the men eat thick -Bones
Coco eats Catfish
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads
77 How ya like that meat, Bright Boy
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval
( ) How's your Catfish, dew drop
Real good Monsieur Candie
( ) You spend a lot of time around niggers aside from Freeman here
Dr Not so much
Well if'in you did,
you'd know what a treat this was for 'em
You feel special Coco
Yes
sir, Monsieur Candie
You feel special Bartholomew
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads
Now Sheba always feels special
Dont'cha
Yep
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel special
( ) Not as special as her
The table breaks out in laughter
Well we're leaving bright and early tomorrow morning, and moving the
whole kit and caboodle to "Candyland
" You oughta come with us
Dr
Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment
so far
so good
Dr Well, that wasn't on the agenda
But suppose  could be amenable to that
How far must we trek
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be in Chickasaw County
Five hours
tops
There you can get a look at my best specimens
Have dinner with my sister and
Spend the night at Candyland as my guest
Dr Splendid
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles
-    - It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to "Candyland
" Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr
Schultz, Django, and ( ,  , and  ) ride horses
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled with'supplies
(Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus , , and ) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal possessions under their arm
They look like powerful warriors
(,  , ) Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal possessions under their arms
These poor devil's know their fate is pretty dismal
Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse
All the slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver
But the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse
sees it
He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let that shit stand
He yells down to the powerless man; Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy
Rodney looks away
No sir
You want a boot heel in it
No sir
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me
Flash that bad look at me again, 'll give ya reason not to like me
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but not without difficulty
Dr
Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him
Dr How do you like this side of the slave trade
Not so much
Dr Prefer the other side
didn't say that
Dr 've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland
Are you sure it's her
Dr He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and speaks German
Now while it's not wise to assume, in this instance,  think it's pretty safe
Did you offer to buy her
Dr opened the door to my possible interest
But naturally, sight unseen,  can only be so interested
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them
Am  intruding
Dr Of course not
( ) swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish
Dr You'd be surprised what a good conversationalist Django is
Oh by now,  don't think that would surprise meat all
Candie gives Django a creepy smile
Around now the audience may start noticing   in the distance
Dr When do we reach your property
1
3 You been on it
own the whole sixty miles 'fore we get to Candyland
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen
( him at Billy) Billy Crash, git up here
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth, rides up
Yeah, Boss
Find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack
Right away, Boss
Billy Crash    on his horse
You know, confidentially, just 'tween us girls, worse things about this business, ain't the slaves
It's all the white trash ya gotta deal with
Like these peckawoods we got riding with us
These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a niggers ass can't kick back
Yeah, they holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but it's just a thin membrane separate 'em
And don't think they don't know it either
It's about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know
But ya need 'em
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself
But these mountain boys  use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst
Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies
Now like that nigger gal we was talkin' 'bout
'm sure it
was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German
Django hears her name himself
His head does involuntary jerk, but his i12, emotions betray nothing
(') Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak English
can't understand a damn word most of 'em say
You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork
tell ya, if it wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run, they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog
Billy Crash comes riding back
What the hell's goin on
They got 'em a runaway
Who
-   - for the    (they track down runaway slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation
little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the bunkhouse
The  are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty long haired lot
Their Leader is Mr
,, the other three are , , and The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons, or just from the same hollow
Lex holds two    on a leash
Stew one on a leash
And Mr
Stonesipher holds one on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of runaway slave named, ', lies belly down in the dirt, surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who , , and  at him
One look at 'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one fight too many
One of his eyes have been 'poked out
Big  have been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites, not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off
Not to mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar patch
V5 The fourth Tracker, , doesn't engage in the melodrama
He hangs in the background,   with a big axe
Calvin Candie, Dr
Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look down on the runaway slave
Including the five new mandingos, and the three old mandingos who know 'Artagnan
Well 'll be, 'Artagnan
Now boy, why do a fool thing like run off
' can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie
Oh yes you can
You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight
- Mr
Stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up,  can't hear myself think
Mr
Stonesipher, yells to Marsha; Mr Hush now
Marsha
Marsha, hush up
Marsha, Marsha, hush up
(to the other ) Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, he's just makin' em hungry
The other two  the dogs away from the fallen Black Man
How long was he loose
Mr
Stonesipher spits tobacco juice
Mr night
Day
Half the other night
How far he git off property
Mr Bout twenty miles off prop
Pretty fer, considering that limp he got
Moguy, who was 'Artagnan suppose to fight Friday
(pointing behind him) One of this new lot
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em
( ') Boy, you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear
'Artagnan starts begging
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my soft heart
You in trouble now, son
Now you need to understand 'm runnin' a business
Now  done paid five hundred dollars for you
And when  pay five hundred dollars,  expect to get five fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over and play dead
You've fought three fights
' won every one
Well, yes you did
But that last one, you muddied the line between winning and losing
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway on the ground
But the fact remains,  pay five hundred dollars,  want five fights
So what about my five hundred dollars
You gonna reimburse me
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh
This whole spectacle is making Dr
Schultz sick to his stomach
Not Django
he's seen this little drama play out many times before
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester, watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of 'Artagnan to know what to expect from their new home
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor bastard
Calvin prods further
You even know what reimburse means
17 The Whites laugh
Then
The German Speaks; Dr 'll reimburse you
All eyes turn to Dr
Schultz
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the direction of the good German
You will
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket
Dr Yes
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a broom
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat
No he won't
All eyes turn to Django
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is all
And for that matter, so am
But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny, we ain't got no use for 'em
Ain't that right, Doc
Dr
Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached to Django you can never do
The doctor puts his billfold back in his suit coat pocket
Dr ( ) You heard 'em
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the green jacket, slack jawed
` Even the one chopping wood in the  stops his chopping
You'll hafta excuse Mr
Stonesipher's slack jawed gaze
He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
Ain't that right, Mr
Stonesipher
Mr
Stonesipher
,
Mr That's right
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse
Looking up at the black man, Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest
Well now since you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin' this nigger however  see fit
He's your nigger
Mr
Ston
esipher
let Marsha and her bitches send 'Artagnan to nigger heaven
Mr Marsha
git 'em
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German Shepherds back
The   towards 'Artagnan on his knees
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose
The   '
As we  the
Candie
staring contest with Django
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on
Dr
Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he appears not to enjoy it
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr
Schultz, then back i12-
to Django
P9 Your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fightin'
As 'Artagnan's  and Marsha's  continue
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs, is all
But you are use to it
Well, him bein' German an' all, 'm a little more use to American's then he is
Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're ready, we rode five hours so you could show off your stock
Let's git to it
Cause as of now, if he's a example, ' ain't impressed
Calvin
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on his horse, then looks at the black man
Follow me
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear 'Artagnan apart
-     - The caravan starts to approach Candyland
Calvin Candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of picking it
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth, Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio Corbucci Spaghetti western
is very beautiful
The fields of cotton, the way the trees hang green vines over everything
It's full of nature and natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in
One of the cottonpickers in the field, , looks up, and sees Django in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (), and points out Django
90 All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse
Django looks back matching their stare
-   - The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in
As the parade rolls through all the  snap to attention, and bow (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past
among his , a  with his , a  amongst his , a among his
playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and begins tossing them about
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest
rides by
The  moves from the slave village to the White Village the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the same village
And they too see Django
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation, or The Big House as everyone calls it
To the left of the Big House is big wooden  built for his Friday night nigger fights
All the   (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie family in the Big House), and   (overseers and stray farm hands) come out to greet the caravan
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a huge dust cloud behind it
Calvin's widowed sister   -, an attractive i12
fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of the Big House to greet her brother
Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out
steps
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan
Who's
Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate, and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum South
- Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy
And in (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil, scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power for their own self interest
Well that describes Stephen to a tee
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach
Out of the dust cloud
and
on  and
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse, and for a moment don't know what to think
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket, it's hate at first sight
Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a, limp
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses
Calvin sees Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do; Hello Stephen my boy
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's this nigger up on that nag
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me
Yeah,  miss you like  miss
a rock in my shoe
Like  said, who's this nigger, up on that nag
'  () Hey Snowball
: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony
If you wanna know who  am, or the name of my horse, you ask me
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy
'll yank your ass of that goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it funny
Django's a Freeman
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django
This nigger, here
That nigger there
Let me at least introduce the two of
you
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen
Stephen, this is Django
You two should hate each other
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at Candyland
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain
Django and his friend in grey, Dr
Schultz are customers, and they are our guests Stephen
And you - you old decrepit bastard
are to show them every hospitality
Do you understand that
don't know why  gotta - You don't hafta know why, do you understand
Yeah yeah yeah,  understand just fine
Good
They're spending the night
Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready
93 ( ) He's gonna stay in the Big House
Stephen, he's a slaver
It's different
() In the Big House
You gotta problem with that
don't gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin' the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone
That's my problem, they're mine to burn
Your problem, right now, is making a good impression
And  want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says; Yes sir, Monsieur Candie
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a   named , comes up to her brother on his horse
Dr
Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may  present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow
Dr
Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner
Dr am Dr
King Schultz, this is my 2nd Django, (Django tips his hat) and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow
Dr And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen
You're not from around here, are you
Dr Actually 'm from a far off land, Dusseldorf, to be exact
These two are in the market for a fightin' nigger
So  thought 'd invite 'em down, show 'em my stock
We'll all have dinner tonight, right
Half the reason  invited them
thought you'd find
them as intriguing as  do little sister
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles
All of a sudden    ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones
The'older one is the Cap't of the Overseers,  , and his two assistants  and While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to Dr
Schultz and Django, and says; You know since  started fightin' niggers about eleven years ago, it's been a new lease on'life
And the man ridin' up here now is the man responsible for all my success
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and Schultz
Howdy Ace
( ) This here is my Overseer
Cap't, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, Ace Woody
915 Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells Cody
( ) Ace, this here is Dr
Ring Schultz, and Django Freeman, they're big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger
So brought 'em out here so you could give 'em a little display of our African flesh
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at Django
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos
just walked from Greenville to here
These the new chickens
Yes siree bob
How many you get
( ) One, two, three, four, five
Five real strong bucks
How many you get rid of
We still got three left
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction
Leo Moguy chimes in; already wired the LeQuint Dickey people, they'll be here tomorrow
Ace turns to Brown
Get 'em away from the others
Put 'em in the pen till tomorrow
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into the slave pen
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,
and Joshua
'all stand over there and make a line
They do
Ace climbs down from off his horse
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse
Everybody, including Django and Dr
Schultz, watch the show
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says; What do you think
think you lookin' for niggers to push a plow, 'dem your boys
Candie rolls his eyes
What's wrong with them
Hold it
hold it, you done bought r em, let me look at 'em
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you buy that one
Which one
What you mean, which one
The one 'm pointing at, that one
77 Actually, that one was purchased by our mister Moguy
( ) You bought him
Yes  did
Why
like his prospects
His prospects
Now you know Mr
Moguy, ain't a educated fella like yourself
Remind me again what prospects means
Hope for the future
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question
You got hope for his future
did
Well  don't
Ace walks over to the slave in question
What's your name, boy
The mandingo says; Sidney James, sir
So long Sidney James
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and Sidney James point blank in the belly
Everybody reacts
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks
Django and Schultz, on their horses next
to Candid, watch
Ace looks up at his boss
Boss Candie, which one did you buy
Well to me the pick of the litter is Big Fred over there
( ) This one over here
Yes
( ) You Fred
very scared Fred answers
Yes, sir
Well good to meet'cha Fred, 'm'Ace Woody, 'm a man of influence 'round here
Now Fred am  mistaken, or were you already in a kurfuffle
had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers last night
' How is of Amerigo
His nigger lost
99 ( ) Really
You won
Yes, sir
Wup'ed his ass
Beat 'em to death
Smiling impressively at Big Fred
( ) Really
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em, but still, he still beat his ass to death
( ) You did
) Yes, sir
Good job, boy
Got any more wins in ya
Yes, sir
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody  Big Fred in the back
Candie acts out mock frustration
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile
Now why did you do that
He won his last fight last night
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos 1 00 ( ) Those of you with exceptional ability will find it ain't so bad here
Those of you who don't possess exceptional ability, will wish you did
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse
Run 'em over to the Arena
Git 'em doin push ups
First one gives out, shoot 'em in the head
( ) Welcome to Candyland, boys
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena
Candie leans over to Schultz and says; We only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy
But those two tend to be lucky
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse
You know Mr
Woody, 'm beginning to think that you don't trust my judgement
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says; Oh you know  always trust your judgement, Boss Candie
eventually
He rides off
Stephen limps back to the action
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready
All ready for your guest and his nigger
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration
Stephen, you're incorrigible
( ) Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your rooms
/+ (') There you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours
Then we'll have some lemonade, and 'll show off some of my finer specimens
Dr Splendid
Both Dr
Schultz and Django climb down from their horses
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load of oats
Django hands the boy the reigns
That's Fritz, this is Tony
You take good care of 'em now
Yes, sir
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one
Give that one to Fritz
Timmy leads the horses away
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when Dr
Schultz pretends to remember something; Dr Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about
Nigger girl
Dr believe you said she spoke German
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her
,oz
Dr Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room
don't see why not
( ) Stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi
want her cleaned up and smellin' nice, and sent over to Dr
Schultz's room
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news
Actually
Monsieur Candie
there's somethin' we ain't tole you yet
What
Hildi's in The Hot Box
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention
What's she doin' there
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box, she bein punished
What she do
She ran away again
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away when  was gone
Two
When did she go
Last night
They brought her back this morning
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon
If they sicked those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these motherfuckers right now
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for 'Artagnan's ass
Brown and Cody went out lookin' for her and found her
She a little beat up, but she did that to herself
Runnin' through them damn bushes
Django's hand moves away from his gun
How long she been in the box
What'cha think, all goddamn day
Little fool got ten more days to go
Take her out
() Take her out
Why
Because  said so, that's why
Hildi is my nigger
Dr
Schultz is my guest
Southern hospitality dictates  make her available to him
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest
realize it's inconvenient
Still, take her out
(to Cora and ) Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for Dr
Schultz
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot
Box
While Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box
Dr
Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's sizzling in it
The itself is a large      (from Yuma Prison) built into the ground
They put a key in the lock, and the two men lift the heavy iron door open
:  naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box dug into the ground
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine
Billy Crash  the bucket of water on her
Django watches this
' :
From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the (incoherent) out of the hole
as we move into a Sergio Leone  of '
Stephen breaks the mood
( ) You comin', or you wanna sleep in that little box
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Dr
Schultz up the front steps of The Big House
-    - Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of The Big House
Then down the hallway with the guest rooms
Dr
Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen
Schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him
Stephen takes Django to the room next door, opens the door, and leads him in
- '   - guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it
little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it
105 This one's yours, boy
That bed's damn nice too
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out
Broomhilda's gone
As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen rattles on in the background
Feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin' all this shit once you gone
'll have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready
Django sits down on the bed
Stephen turns to leave
Not so fast
got more important things to do then jaw with you
Nigger, when  say stop you plant roots
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead
He turns around
This tiny bell on this little table
is this for you
ring this, you do fer me
Me or somebody
Django reaches over and picks up the bell
(a soft) -- () What 'cha want
want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude
)' Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed
Gimmie
Stephen hands him the basin full of water
Django takes it from him
Then throws the water in Stephen's face
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like that
Django takes his hand and  the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor; That's my kinda bell ringin'
Git up
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as he does - Django      again
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the floor below his knees
've known me House Niggers like you my whole life
Play your dog tricks with your Massa'
Ya' lip off to him every now an' then, as long as ya' keep it funny
He rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think it's so cute
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your good side
Well this time Snowball, you gonna listen to me
You got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, 'm gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of  beatin' the off your ass
will make you drop your drawers, 'll take off my belt, and  will Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation
And after do that, let's see you play the rooster round here
X07 Calvin wouldn't
let you do it
Oh that's right, he gives you first name privileges
ain't that cute
Sass me me again nigger, see what happen'
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue
That's what  thought
Now git outta"here
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up
Before he leaves, Django tells him;, When  ring this bell, you better come a runnin'
You - not nobody else
While 'm on this property, you my nigger Snowball
Stephen leaves
Django lies down on the bed
He covers his eyes with his arm
door joins Django and Schultz's room
The adjoining door opens, and Schultz stands there
Dr Was that wise
Django doesn't remove his arm from
his eyes
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that
That's all that needs to be said
-  ( ) - Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr
Schultz's door, after Calvin's sister raps on it
Dr
Schultz opens the door
Dr Hello ladies
Dr
Schultz, may  introduce to you, Hildi
Hildi, this is Dr
Schultz, he speaks German
Dr ( ) 've been informed you do as well
() It would be my, pleasure to speak with you in German
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment
Dr Astonishing
( ) Please come inside Fraulein
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says, "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face
Miss Lara looks to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed
- '   ( ) - With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl
He gives her a pleasant smile
Dr They call you Hildi, but your real name is Broomhilda, isn't it
Yes
How do you know that
Dr Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name
Can  pour you a glass of water, Broomhilda
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl
107 on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue to present himself
Dr As Dr
Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins talking to her in    ; Dr () 'm aware you haven't spoken German in a long while
So 'll talk slowly
'm only speaking German to you now, Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are listening to us
Myself and a mutual friend of ours, have gone through a lot of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to find you fraulein - to rescue you
He hands her a tall clear glass of water
She looks at him weird, rescue me
Dr () Please drink
She absentmindedly obeys
Dr (
)
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's intention to take you away from here forever
() don't got any friends
Dr () Yes you do
() Who
Dr () can't tell you
Our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic, and he wants to surprise you
0 () Where is he
He points at the adjoining door
Dr () Standing right behind that door
Her head moves in the direction of the door
He looks to the young woman; Dr () Promise me you won't scream
She nods her head, yes
Dr () Say,  promise
() promise
Dr
Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it
The door knob turns
The door slowly opens revealing
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up
He smiles at her, and says; Hey Little Trouble Maker
Obviously a pet name between them
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock
first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and the water spills on the floor
followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead
faint
1/1 The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other; Dr You silver tongued devil you
to later, as we see Dr
Schultz and Django explain what- they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan is to Broomhilda
We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack
It's not a happy tune
per se
But it's pretty, and vaguely optimistic
The The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen
The same whistling tune continues over this scene
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django, Dr
Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to The Arena
Laughin' and joshin' all the way
The hatred Rodney feels for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker
study in powerless fury
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen
What you
whistlin', girl
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction
What was you whistlin'
Oh nuttin'
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were whistlin' somethin'
What'cha whistlin'
dunno
Somethin'  heard
don't know no
name
)/ It's kinder pretty
She doesn't say anything in return
That was a compliment
Thank you
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda
'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in such misery here, you hadda run off
So you run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours
Now here you are two days later, whistlin' while you work
'm just sayin',
wouldn' think you'd have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout
'm jus' sayin'
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face
'm done here, may  be excused
Yes you may
She moves off to another part of the house
He watches her shuffle off
-   ( ) - Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr
Schultz) sat around the dinner table
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr
Schultz likes her Broomhilda)
Along with an army of   acting as wait service
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the Domestic Slaves despise Django
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation
"5
Dr Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it
But the best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie, and Eskimo Joe
- By the way, why's he called Eskimo Joe
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started
His name was Joe-
maybe one day he said he was cold
who knows
Dr Irregardless, we all know Samson's your best, and you'll never sell him and  can see why, he's a champion
All three are champions
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak; Samson's the champion
The other two are pretty good
All the Domestic Slaves around the table  at witnessing Django contradict Calvin Candie
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat
After Django says that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed potatoes
Hildi
Broomhilda snaps back
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis, then issues his own appraisal; Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no
Can he take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the best dirty fightin' nigger  ever saw
But as long as you don't put 'em up against those two
, Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass
Maybe
The Domestics  for a jerky second when Django says that
// Dr You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a
neophyte in the nigger fight game,  do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus
Hence, have big ideas when it comes to presentation
need something more then just a big nigger
He needs to have panache
sense of showmanship
want to be able to
bill
him as
The Black Hercules
said
, and  quote; " would pay top dollar for the, right nigger
" Now 'm not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se
but is he right as rain
Everyone waits for Calvin's response
He milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep, then says; Dr
Schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, Monsieur Calvin
Candie
But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game
() nigger that can win fights
That should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern
After you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design
But since  enjoy oldest man 'at the table status - beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans
Dr
Schultz says something pleasant to her in German
She smiles, and says something pleasant back
see you two gettin' on
Dr
Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr Famously
( ) Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear you native tongue for four years
Hell,  can't imagine two weeks in Boston
A5 Everybody at the table chuckles
Dr can't express the joy  felt conversing in my mother tongue
And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie
don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk
sees it
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit
Stephen, you're amazing
haven't finished a drink in this house in twenty years
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a  drink
Chuckle
chuckle
Did you overhear that joke  said about me spending two weeks in Boston ( ) You don't have any idea the work  do to see food gets on the table
1/6 What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China
You think when 'm in that kitchen,  got nothin' better to do then listen in here to you tellin' unfunny jokes
Chuckle
chuckle
( ) What
They laughed
Of course they laughed, their parents raised them right
When they're a guest in somebody's house, and the master of of the house thinks he's- funny, you suppose to laugh
They'd be rude not to
Chuckle
chuckle
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth
No it was really funny, ( ) wasn't it
Now what do you expect these people to say
What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest
( ) Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being polite,  understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him
Chuckle-chuckle
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen
-  ( ) - Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks eyes on Broomhilda
He moves over to her
You know that nigger
/i12 She spins around
11 7 Who
Don't stall me bitch, you know who
At the table
don't know him
You don't know him
No
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you
She shakes her head, no
Stephen looks at her skeptical
Okay, if you say so
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it
But if it was my money, wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars for him
Dr What would your price be
Well, if  ,was inclined to be generous,
and  don't know why  would be inclined to be generous
nine thousand
maybe
Candie's lawyer chimes in
But the real question is, not how much he cost, but how much he can earn
Dr Django
In a years time, seven or eight fights - outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland pedigree weren't well known - Virginia
(') 11Y (') Georgia -- all goes well
twenty to twenty one thousand dollars
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya
Any way you cut that cake, that spells profit
Not to, mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger
However let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger, it was you who approached me to buy one
Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about, ain't too far off from right
And if wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, could sell 'em any day of the week
But like you said in Greenville doctor, don't wanna sell 'em
It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it
Dr
Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says; Dr You know Monsieur Candie
you do possess the power of persuasion
Candie smiles at that remark
Then  Schultz  the table hard with his hand, and says; Dr Why not
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars
The White people at the table get very happy
Dr
Schultz continues; Dr However, that is a tremendous amount of money
And the way you have your Mr
Moguy, have a lawyer, a persnickety man named Tuttle
And  would need my man to draw up a legal contract before  would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing
So say  return in about five days time with my Mr
Tuttle
And then my Mr
Tuttle and your Mr
Moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves
117 Splendid
( ) Stephen, time for dessert
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes
Broomhilda goes to Calvin
Can  take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle
Yes you may, Hildi
She begins gathering the dirty dishes
Candie looks up at her as she works
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big table in the big house
like it a lot Monsieur Candle
It's a lot better then sizzling in that hot box, or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush, ain't it
Yes 'em
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up
Stephen clocks this
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled" back
Seein' as he don't see many niggers where he from
( ) When you was alone with Hildi here, didja just speak German, or did ya git her clothes off
20 Dr We just spoke
So you haven't seen her back
Dr No  haven't
Then Stephen's right, you would probably find this interesting
Hildi, take off your dress, and show us your back
Django hears this
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django
Stephen clocks it
Calvin,  just got her all dressed up and looking nice
But Lara Lee, Dr
Schultz is from Dusseldorf, they don't got niggers there
And he's a man of medicine
'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain
mean Hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back
Lara Lee get one, she'd lose her mind
These niggers are tough, no doubt about it
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back
Django continues to watching this play out
Stephen watches him
Candie folds
Okay okay Lara
Maybe after dinner
During the brandies
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the kitchen
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind the kitchen door
121 -  ( ) - In the kitchen with the  , Stephen says to Broomhilda; thought you said you didn't know him
Broomhilda turns around
Huh
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch
said, you said, you didn't know him
don't
Yes you do
Mister Stephen,  don't
Why you lyin to me
As tears begin to well in her eyes
ain't
Why you cryin'
Because you're scarin' me
Why am  scarin' you
Because you're scary
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside
We hear Dr
Schultz in the next room say; Dr
() to speak German,with Hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea
1ZL His eyes to to Broomhilda
You, stay in the kitchen
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches Dr
Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda
Stephen knows these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's just figured it out
-   ( ) - Dr You indicated earlier you would be willing to part with Hildi
Yes siree bob  did
Dr Well in that case allow me to propose another proposition
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen  in the room, Dr
Schultz
- Monsieur Candie
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr
Schultz
(to Dr
Schultz) Oh,  do apologize, doctor
My hearin' ain't worth a damn these days
( ) Monsieur Candie,  need a word with you in the kitchen
What, you mean get outta my chair
If you could manage it
It's about dessert
What about dessert
would rather tell you in private
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there
123 Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear; Meet me in the library
Well that's a horse of a different color
That means whatever Stephen has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie
"Meet me in the library" is their secret signal
Fine friend Stephen, 'll be along momentarily
Stephen exits
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required
If you'll excuse me a moment
Candie exits
-  ( ) - masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie
Walls of perfectly bound books
Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on the walls
There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe
When    this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his brandy, and doesn't bat an eye
It appears, in this room, Calvin's and Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane
Outside of outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is dropped, and the number one and number two
men of Candyland can talk turkey
What's the matter
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos
They want that girl
- What the hell you talkin' about
They playin your ass for a fool, that's what 'm talkin' bout
They ain't here for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for that girl
What girl, Hildi
Yeah, Hildi
The niggers know each other
He just bought Eskimo Joe
Did he give you any money
Well not yet, but - - Then he didn't
diddly, not yet no how
But he was just about to buy, who he came here to buy, when  interrupted him
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin
Where you gettin' all this
Why would they go through all that trouble, to
buy a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth five hundred dollars
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in love with Hildi
She's probably his wife
Now why that German gives a fuck about who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love with, 'm sure  don't know
If she's who they want, why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind to four hundred dollar
But twelve thousand got you real friendly
Calvin thinks
as per usual, Stephen's right
Those lyin' goddamn
time wastin' sonsabitches
() Sonsabitches
You just watch, 'm gonna fix their wagon but good
Stephen, we gonna have us a Candyland tar and feathering
FL5 Now Calvin
not that  wouldn't enjoy seein' something like that
but why don't you sit down and let's talk about this
let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin' huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table, and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's discuss this
frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair
Now look, you knew, and  knew, there was something up with these two
We just didn't know what
But now we do
They don't want you to know how bad they want that girl
But these ole boys have rode a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl
They must want her mighty bad
Way  see it, ain't nothin' changed
They wanna buy a nigger, you wanna sell a nigger
The only thing done changed is the advantage
() Now we got it
So let's go back in there and busts these motherfucker's chops
-   ( ) - The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court melodramatically
Till
Calvin Candie enters the room from the kitchen door
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon ; There you are
was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he stares down the table at them
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it Lara Lee
(') 1Z (') Lara Lee,  just looked out the big winda
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys
Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball
That of boy knows everything to know 'bout mandingos, But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out, Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes
in behind Schultz and Django
Can  ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand he's holding a big ugly hammer
Now lay your palms flat on the table top
They put their palms on the table
Now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off
There's been a lotta lies said around this table tonight-but that
you can believe
() Mr
Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips
Mr
Moguy does
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court
Now where were we
Oh yes,  do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda
Right
Dr Right
( ) Stephen
Bring out Hildi
Ix
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding roughly in his grip, Broomhilda
He holds a small Derringer pistol against the side of her head
Django and Schultz react
Now it should be quite clear by now  know you're not here to buy no mandingos
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all want Broomhilda
But y'all don't want me to know how much you want 'er
So instead, you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe horseshit
( ) Stephen, put her in that chair
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz silently watch Candie's next move
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues
Now the way  see it, ain't nothin' changed
You still wanna buy a nigger,  still wanna sell one
So, with that in mind, in Greenville, Dr
Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount
" To which, me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous
" To which you said, "Twelve thousand dollars
" Now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger
" And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars
Dr take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues
Under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda is my property
And  can do anything with my property  so desire
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making everybody jump
And if you think my price for this nigger is too steep, what 'm gonna desire to do is, take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it
Right in front of both y'all
He  the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in
Put up or shut up, Schultz
You wanna save this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price
Dr May  lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold
Yes you may
Dr
Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket, and says;, Dr Easy come, easy go
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie
The plantation owner takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at the seated Schultz, and says; Pleasure doin' business with you
-   ( ) - : Calvin signing over Broomhilda's
Moguy signs as a witness
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her freedom papers
Dr
Schultz sits off by himself
He's very disturbed
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy
Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend
He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred dollars- for twelve thousand
Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him
( ) Rhubarb pie
Schultz looks at the pie and the man
Dr No
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya
Dr Actually,  was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, 'Artagnan
And  was wondering what Dumas would make of all this
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs
Broomhilda's bill of sale, and her freedom papers
As he says the following he examines he papers
Dumas
Dr Alexander Dumas
He wrote "The Three Musketeers
" figured you must be an admirer
You named your slave after that novel's lead character
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, wonder what he would of made of it
You doubt he'd approve
Dr Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best
Soft hearted Frenchy
Dr Alexander Dumas is black
1 30 Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket,
looks to his two companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says; Dr We got it, let's go
( ) Normally Monsieur Candie,  would say, auf wiedersehen
But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till  see you again, and since  never wish to see you again, to you sir,  say, goodbye
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit
When Calvin says to the German's back; One more moment, Doc
Dr What
It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands
It implies good faith
Dr 'm not from the South
He turns to leave
You're in my house, doctor, 'm afraid must insist
This turns Schultz around
Dr Insist what
That  shake your hand before  leave
Then 'm afraid  must insist in the opposite direction
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor
You know what  think you are
Dr What you think  am
No  don't
1310, think you are a bad loser
Dr And  think you're an abysmal winner
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands
Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand
Dr If  don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars
don't think so
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda
Dr Let's go
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand
Cut 'er down
Schultz looks to Django
then to Candle
and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks ; Dr
You really want me to shake your hand
Django gets it
insist
-Schultz smiles
Dr Well, if you insist
Django goes to stop him
1 714 The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand
Candie offers his hand to Schultz
The small   into Schultz's outstretched hand
He    in the heart
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor
Everybody is stunned
Schultz looks to Django
Django looks back
Dr ( ) 'm sorry
couldn't resist
Dr
is   by Bartholomew's
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda
We     to see: The soles of Django's bare feet
rope is tied around the ankles, and it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down
The  moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor
-  - Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face with a wet rag
They are all alone in the barn
Django begins to come to
(' ) Act like you still sleepin'
Where's Broomhilda
Who
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago
They had her in The Hot Box
don't know 'bout no girl
How 'bout that German white man  came here with
Oh he's dead
His body's over there
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor
The sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy
Git on outta here, boy
133 Django, slightly
swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp
So y'all bounty hunters,
huh
Django thinks, "How does he know
" knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all
We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags
gotta say, ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before
black boy paid to kill white men
How did ya like that line of work
Django retorts, upside down
Well, it turns out  was a natural
Ace woody laughs
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body length from the hanging man
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure 'round here
Now he's dead as fried chicken, everyone 'round here blames you
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist, he carries a    ina shoulder holster
He removes the big blade from its sheath
Yep, Boss Man's gone
Poor Calvin
Poor goddamn Calvin
We're burnin' him in a few hours
At sunset
Should be real pretty
However
don't think you're gonna be able to attend
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and
stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from Django's face
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down
As he does this, he says; Now  understand you didn't really have nuttin' to do wit it
It's that German sunbitch the trouble maker
You just wanted to git your girl, and hightail your nigger asses outta here
Now  appreciate that
But grieving folks 'round here need someone to blame
And  guess they figure if you hadn't brought your black ass 'round here in the first place, Boss Man still be alive
And you know what, they got a point
He  the knife again
this time   in the floor two inches from Django's face
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool
As he does he says; Now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways, believe me when
tell you,  know every goddamn trick in the book
Now there's a lotta ass busters out there try an' git creative with the way they bust ass
But me
always found the best methods are, tried and true
He  the knife again
Django  his head back
and the knife  in the floor, right where Django's head was
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the wood
, and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man
Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy
You know Blackie, here at Candyland,  had me a real sweet deal
These last eleven years training Calvin's mandingos  made me more money  made my whole goddamn life
And no end in sight, neither
() Then you came along
Knocked me right off that perch  was sittin' pretty on
You think Miss Lara gonna be as
interested in mandingos as her brother
Uuummmm
don't think so
What  think, is you done fucked up my good thang
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you could say  gotta axe to grind
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist
He takes his big Bowie, and places the razor sharp  against Django's nut sack
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against your ball sack, Blackie
Bowie right off the wet stone
Now that's what  call sharp
Django dances some more
Yep nigger, 'm gonna snip them nuts
() On the count of three
: '
Got to do it, boy
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith facility
He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you
She wanna talk about the Old Man's funeral
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin' Django
She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint Dickey people
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says; Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened
( ) How disappointing
171 ( ) Where she at
She in the big house
The kitchen
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn, and begins poking a   which lies buried in the fire
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace
You gonna look after our friend
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says; Oh yes sirree Bob, you know  am
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know, gonna have us a big of chat
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's Snowballs just makin' sure his talking stick is all nice and
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django, alone
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked hanging Django
bet you an' that German thought y'all was on easy street for awhile - didn't ya
'all track Hildi to the Old Man
You get the idea to go to Greenville - look up the Ole Man there
() That was a good idea
bet y'all couldn't believe how easy it was
You meet Moguy, he buys your horseshit
Ya' git your ass invited to Candyland, no fuss no muss
Ya' ride the whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking Big House
137 () And that's where you met me
And that's when you knew your goose was cooked
He  Django's  with the    of the poker
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and stoically
This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot poker
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours didn't know what's what
He still thought his ass hadda chance
But like the One-Eyed Charly you are, you always know the end is near 'fore the white folks
With the   poker, he   Django's other
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air
Stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils
Damn Nigger, you smell good
He walks behind Django with the poker
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather bed in the quest room in the Big House - After you slapped my ass to the floor You were sayin' something 'bout my ass, and how you were gonna
Remember that, Bright Boy
He places the       hard against Django's buttocks
Django
Stephen
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire
He goes through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants
He tosses them on the floor by the hanging man
You leavin', that's what you can take with you
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to him, he begins fondling Django's genitals
I31 Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours
Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin' up with different ways to kill your Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts
But while that might like a good idea
Truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out
Then  say; "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that
" Then they're, "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs
" And then  say, "What's so special 'bout that
We do that shit all the time
Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that
" He stops massaging Django's balls
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin' your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks
And trust me when  tell you it's gonna be 'bout as much fun as it sounds
We sell 'em the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more
Like them three y'all came back with
For them big garboons we get twenty a piece
They last 'bout six months
Skinny nigger like you, give two or three
Stephen turns to leave
Where's Broomhilda
She's all right for now
Miss Lara soft hearted on 'er
She gave her to Billy Crash
He was sweet on 'er
Now Billy Crash might not look or smell too good, but ain't nobody gonna bother her
Stephen limps away
137 -  - The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding up to the plantation
It comes equipped with one   (from a prison),  white trash  named  to drive the wagon, a 2nd white trash  named  to ride lead horse, and a white trash  named  to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have stopped the caravan and are having a powwow
It's chaos 'round here
Some bastard shot the big boss
Let's git the niggers and git out
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash
All three slaves carry the bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville
Chester wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them
You blacks line up
They do
What's your names
Chester
Chicken Charly
Rodney
'm
Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano
( ' ) What's that
It's my stuff
Throw it in the dirt
1 40 All three throw their only belongings in the dirt
Floyd takes the'hat off of Chester's head and sails it away
As well as ripping the corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt
(to Chicken Charly) You won't be doin' much smokin' mate
(to all three) You are now the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company
Git in the cage
This is going to be worse then the three even thought
They climb into the cage wagon
Floyd locks it behind them
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace Woody call out; () Hold on, we got another hammer swinger for ya
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope
We can't use that skinny bastard
We got an arraignment with Mr
Dickey to take punishment niggers from time to time
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment
Well if Mr
Dickey ain't takin' you into his confidence, 'm sure  don't know why
Look, no one tole' me 'bout - - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss Candie killed
And we want his ass punished
Now  know you need our bucks
So
unless you wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr
Dickey how and why you fucked up our nice little business relationship, take this nigger and hush up about it
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage
" Django sees the three mandingos in the cage
They see him too
Django stops Ace Woody
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there with them
They'll kill me
What about all that -turning big rocks into little rocks- shit y'all was
talkin' about
mean that was the idea ain't it
You put me in there with them big ass garboons they kill me on the way
mean if that's the idea, that's the idea, but  didn't think that was the idea
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd
He can't go in there with them
Why not
They'll kill him
don't give a damn
Well we do
He killed the fuckin Boss Man, we want the mine to grind him to gravel
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this black and make sure he keeps up
Oh, 'll keep 'em up
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists
and ties the other end around his saddle horn
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland
-    - The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him
J42 ( ) Hey boy
Jano ignores him
said, hey white boy
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got nothing to say  wanna hear
What's he pay you
Who
LeQuint Dickey
You gotta few more things to worry about black boy, then what  get paid
ain't worried about it
'm just curious
mean, 'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, ain't
Yeah
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, dont'cha
Yeah
Well,  know how much 'm gettin' paid, how much you gettin' paid
mean like for instance, how much you gettin' paid for today
Look black, it don't work like that
Dickey paid for our passage from Australia to here
We get a little money to send back home, and pay him back for the boat trip
" How long you been here
'bout two years
And you ain't paid him back yet
() No, not yet
() You a slave too, peckawood
They just bought your ass for the price of a boat ride
At least they didn't charge us for our boat ride
ha ha ha ha
() You shut up
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike Django, when the black man says to him; How'd you like to make eleven thousand dollars
What
Django steps closer to him
How would you like to make eleven thousand dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred, actually
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano; Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black, and keep up
Keep riding, just ride slower
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse
R44 Back at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode right past it
You be damned, blackie
We're not bandits
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's not illegal
You can't steal it, ya gotta earn it
If you got something to say, say it
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him
And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices, Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at Candyland
laughin their ass off
cause they just got away with murder
() But it don't hafta be that way
You and your mates could get that money
Who pays the money
The Court
The Court
The Austin Texas Courthouse
Oh, and by the way, the court don't give a damn about how you kill 'em
You can shoot 'em in the back, from up on a hill, in the back of the head, in their sleep - don't matter
(') (') Court doesn't care how you do it, just as long as you do it
They
pay us to kill 'em
No
You kill 'em, and they payyou for the corpse
Get it
think so
what did these jokers do again
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery
've got the handbill in my pocket
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty Bacall handbill that Dr
Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck
He hands it to Jano
What's this
told you, it's the handbill for Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang
Jano looks at the handbill
Whatsamatter, can't you read
can read,  just don't have my glasses
didn't take 'em with me, because  didn't think 'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run
What about that cowboy fella in the lead
Roy
Can Roy read
Look, get it straight black,  can fuckin read
just don't got my glasses
146 --     at The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co
Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to the side of the road
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any
clear comprehension of what they're watching
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion
That includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a piece of paper
:  ' Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks
ain't no goddamn slave
Do  sound-like a fuckin slave
'm a bounty hunter
Yesterday as a free man,  rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner, Dr
King Schultz
We'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County
Found them laying low at Candyland
We went in to get 'em, things went sour
My partner was killed, and Calvin Candie was shot
Everybody there decided to blame me, so here  am
( ) You know 'm not on the manifest
All of you know 'm not suppose to be on this trip
But those four men, are still back there
They're still wanted
And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs
And the last thing they'd expect is y'all rid
in back and gittin it
Django is damn convincing
What's your deal
You tell us who they are and we let ya go
ain't tellin' who they are
But, you give me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and 'll point 'em out to you
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook
he just needs one little push
1Q7 'all wanna ask somebody if 'm tellin the truth, ask them mandingos
You can't put me in the same cage with them without them killin me
Why ya think that is
Ask them am  a Candyland slave, or did  ride in there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos
As they walk, Roy continues to study the handbill
( ) "Wanted, dead or alive
Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang
For murder and stagecoach robbery
Seven thousand dollars for Bacall
One thousand five hundred dollars for each of his gang members
" This is a real handbill
Just because the handbill's real doesn't mean that other bunch of malarky
is
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one
That black's damn convincing
They get to The Cage 'Men
Roy startles them with a direct question; (pointing, behind him, at Django) That black ride into Candyland yesterday
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points the barrel at the cage
'm gonna ask again, and remember  don't like liars
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man yesterday
Yeah
They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode on a horse with a white man
This white man, was the black his slave
He weren't no slave
You sure about that
Damn sure
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall seriously
What happened at Candyland
Bunch of shootin, master got shot
Who shot 'em
The German
And why did he do that
The nigger and the German were actin as if they were slavers, but they weren't
What were they
Bounty hunters
Floyd is starting to get convinced
Goddamn Roy, this could be big
(to the Slaves) Do you know who Smitty Bacall is
, (barking at Floyd) They wouldn't go by their outlaw names you idiot
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano
Okay black, you gotta deal
Jano reacts
got one more condition
What
When we get there, when the time comes, you let me help you kill 'em
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists
() You got a deal, black
Django interrupts - You gotta deal, mate
Roy really laughs this time
As does Django and the other two Aussies
You're all right for a black fella
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them all sharing a laugh, with wonderment
"Who is this Nigger
" We'll give you that pack horse
What's them saddle bags filled with
Dynamite
so ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back
( ) Yeah,  can see why
Jano take those sticks off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door, and placing the bags inside
The Black Men in the cage don't like this at all
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The Cage Wagon
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says; Where's my pistol
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give 'em your gun and your belt
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over to Django handing it to him
Django accepts it
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django; Now don't drop it now
just had the sights fixed last month, it's perfect
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand
That's good to know
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, in the chest
Roy turns around
Django takes the gun out of the holster
is  in the    and falls to the grass dead
Jano goes for the gun on his hip
Django       over
Jano's shoulder
Jano is
The  knocks Django on his ass
The Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the blast
The image outside the bars of their cage is of  and  in the air, obscuring all visibility
sudden    comes and  all the smoke and dust away, in bright color focus
standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of Jano
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast, and climbs aboard him bareback
He leans over and snatches the  that Floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the beast's side
The pack animals    under the new rider
By now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and horses bring the best out of Django
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men
Using the rifle in a     he  the lock on the cage door
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says; Throw up that dynamite
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on his Horse
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland
The Three   Mandingos, watch him ride away
"Who was that nigger
" l
rz from the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on 'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard
walks out in front of the Procession
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers, Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best mandingos  and
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress, wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora) crying at her side
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara
Monsieur Candie think it real nice
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora
of Django    on the way back to Candyland
The bare backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the  in one hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a gorgeous  , looks like an Indian
-  / - The same    over the same shitty Tracker shack -Bunkhouse that Mr
Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share
The   (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse
-   - The   are
missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards
Mr
Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of your cards is different
Instead of chips they play with, " " (yes, the ears of slaves)
On a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small delicate  he's making
- -   - :   walking then stopping
Django's bare feet jump on to the ground
IS3 -   - The   lay out
when, Marsha hears something, and raises her head
moves quietly through the woods
rises to all fours, to listen and smell
out in the darkness, her three continue to lay out
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the    buried in the chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert
Django disappears
-   - They hear the barking inside
Mr Jake
Jake building his birdhouse
Yeah
Mr Check on Marsha
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs)
- As the  gets louder,      of The Axe in the chopping block, and Django's hand
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of him, Django standing there with the axe
Just as he reacts
After letting go of the axe handle, Django    toward Jake
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django has crossed the distance, and is  The Axe out of '
And with  in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers, till after a point where he's     , Lex, and Stew, and now there's only Mr
Stonesipher left
But Mr
Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic  , and is able to fight back against Django
You know Stonesipher's great with a knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack attack
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position
The expert Mountain Boy begins    on shirtless Django
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons
Then it's just a fight of brute strength, and survival
Mr
Stonesipher is physically bigger then Django
But if Django's going to save Broomhilda, not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has to take Stonesipher's ass out
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight each other for their life
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the mountain boy is big enough to lift Django
So like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his opponents neck
Django gets his hand on the  Jake was building the birdhouse with, and '
That weakens Stonesipher
He
That drops Stonesipher to his knees
He
That puts the mountain man down on his back
He          keep him down for good
The Trackers are all dead
Only the dogs mad barking remains
- The  - The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway
The Preacher reads some words over him
-   - Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps out of the shack
He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks over to the
Marsha and her three friends-continue to  like mad
He  a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl
He begins washing the blood-off'of himself
As he washes, he says outloud; What ya doin around here, boy
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes
was just walkin' by
Wanna help me out
Sure
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash
You know where his shack is
Sure do
You show me
Will  get in trouble
Not by the time  get through killin' everybody
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that
He believes him
'll show ya
Django turns towards the barking dogs
He turns back to Timmy and asks; You know what toadstools look like
15- Sure do
Go pick me a mess of 'em
:  picking  ( )
:  stirring a big pot of   with a wooden spoon in the tracker shack
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt
Django takes the toadstools and Mr
Stonesipher's   and the mushrooms into tiny pieces
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and mixes it up with the spoon
- '  - Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel
It lands on the ground with a
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up the stew
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile
You bit your last nigger, bitch
Bite on that
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse
First things first, boy
Take me to my horse
- The funeral is in full melodramatic bore
- - - Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds
Django goes straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello
Tony's happy to see him
Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him
He turns and sees the body of Dr
Schultz lying in a heap
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable
Saddle up Fritz and Tony
Timmy just stares
Now, boy
Timmy hops to work
Django bends down over the body of Dr
Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket
He also searches for and finds Schultz's hidden , he keeps it in a holster around his ankle
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks; Do you feel bad for your friend
Django rises from the body of his friend
Yeah, " do
As Timmy saddles the horses he says; know just how ya feel
lost a white friend once
He drowned in the lake
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr
Schultz and a white friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him understand
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the furnace
He Puts on his boots
His Green Jacket over his bare chest
And finally his hat
- The  - The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands, and beginning to leave
-  '  - Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda
She doesn't wail, she doesn't make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water
As Billy's fucking her he says; It's gonna be real nice 'round here now the 'ol man's gone
(') ' () Would you stop your galdarn cryin'
He stops fucking in frustration can't
Now girl, 'm tryin' to be nice
can't help it
'm really sad
He hops off her and yells at her
Well goddamit, you're a nigger
Life is sad for niggers
Git use to it
( ) Look you know Me, Hildi
'm an ass buster from way back
But you know 've always been sweet on you
don't wanna bust your ass
So don't make me
Now 'm gonna go shit
You calm down
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone
lying on the bed
She cries for Django, she cries for herself
She  an  , and a  "Ooomph"
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door
soft "Knock Knock" on the door

He hands Broomhilda her papers

Meet me around the side of the big house
But what about you - - Don't worry about me

Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house
(60 - The    The   - The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk back to The Big House for a drink
This Candie Family Unit consists of: (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress

and finally, and  (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos, wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew
This    walk to The Big House for a few post funeral drinks
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front door
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the property by some shed
They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House
The woman and little boy stop
But the group of enemies aren't looking their way
The moves closer towards the front of The Big House
The front of The Big House knocking the
Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses
and can't believe their eyes
I6 -  -  -  -  -  -  - hang in the air
The starts coming to their senses
Nobody was killed, or even seriously hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust
The' and  thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain

Nobody can believe Django's standing there
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester rifle held casually in his left hand
His right hand held casually by the gun on his hip
The all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of Wonder, Fear, and Hate
as she watches this
As  looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big House front lawn,
and as they look back from the grass at him
The black man in the cool green jacket says; bet

They stand up quickly
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie Family Unit
Enjoying their collective hatred
He tosses the rifle away
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a realizes 's intentions
Even  and

(to Lara Lee) Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till the shootin' starts
Then bring it up as fast as you can
- can't come to grips with what she's
in the middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to happen

The
16' , except for   is : The  watching on the side: ' ready, but no one wants to start this party
starts to go for the gun in his holster, and  starts to raise his Derringer
But it's no contest
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him, Floyd's Pistol was   in
his right hand, as his left hand the Pistols Hammer,   all five White People (and Stephen) standing in front of him
They all fall to grass in different ways

Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co
He removes Dr
Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand, putting it in his pocket
Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy wait for him with Fritz and Tony
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says; Hey Little Trouble Maker

Timmy hops off of Tony
Django climbs aboard Tony
He says to Broomhilda; tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me
