There is a dim point of light coming from a dot on the - which is the  : "When we could say good night and still stay together
wouldn't it be niiiice
we could be married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice
" Through it there has been the  of , distinct and rhythmic
It   as the
There are also from a woman
' Oh, no
' what
' That headboard
' Nobody can hear it
It  a couple of more times
' can
It makes me nervous
It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging of the headboard
She follows the scream with a few yelps
Silence
Now the  of the
'  (') (complimentary) Oh my God
Jesus
Jesus Christ
Jesus
Christ
The
'  (') (a slightly different tone) You going to answer it
' (meaning no) Uh-uh
It
' (being for her very mischievous) Want me to
' Let it ring
And it does
It   , killing all other considerations
' Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't give up
After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up
' Hello
(a little surprised) Ah, hi
The '  on the other end of the phone can be only , when George holds the receiver loosely by his ear
It is
' What took you so long
' Wasn't sure it was you
' (muffled) ' uh
uh
can't
' (laughter, sizing it up immediately) All right, who're you with
Jill
' No
' (lively but muffled) ' No
' (she's heard Felicia) Awww -- ' 'll call you back
' Come on by
' 'll call you back
' (raucous laughter, muffled) ' (to Tina) Okay, okay
He hangs up
Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and coughed
' You're rude
mean, you're very rude
' Hey,  tried to get her off the phone
' You know what 'm talking about
' No, baby
Now look, that girl that called --  have to talk to her, she'll do something
' Like what
' don't know, kill herself
She's 'd four times
This calms Felicia
pause
' Well, is she your girlfriend
' No
' Are you in love with her
' Her
' Are you
' No
' Then it's not your problem
' It isn't
' No
You know too many sick ladies
' guess so
' How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked
Particularly in your business
you deal with women every day
' guess so
' Don't worry, honey, 'll protect you
' Okay
' God,  adore you
She starts to kiss him, the  are
The '  (') Shit
' Hello
' You're home
' Yeah
' 'm coming over
' 'll call you back
' (firm but frightened) No you won't
' What do you mean
' told you  get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now
(muffled) 'm not kidding
' Okay
' (muffled) ' Yeah, yeah -- 'bye
George flips on the light
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she
No
Bare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something
What're you looking for
My keys
thought you said you weren't going anywhere
'm not
mean 've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes
You mean that girl, don't you
George finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes, a pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt
He leaves his shorts and socks on the floor
He's obviously in a hurry
What girl, she's not a girl, she's just a friend of mine
Felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses
You son of a bitch
George sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door
(') Wait, at least wait 'til 'm dressed
'm going
She starts to get out of bed
(') Oh, Christ -- do you have any Kleenex
George is a little desperate now
He runs to the bathroom, tosses her the whole box
(') Thanks a lot
(desperate) Listen, baby, don't leave, really
Why not
'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl
she has attacks
What
These attacks
it's got something to do with her
uh
pancreas
George is trying to remember the rest
(') She's got a
(suddenly interested) Does she have a pancreatic ulcer
(anxious to go now) Yeah,  think so
That's very serious
Who's her doctor
don't know
Gee, that's very serious
know
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer
She did
It turned out to be cancer
Wow
So what are you doing going over there
You're not her doctor
've gotta give her some pills
Percodan, she ran out
Before Felicia can say anymore, George goes to the bathroom and grabs the first pill jar he can find, moves to Felicia and kisses her
(') And listen, 'll be right back and want your ass in that bed when get back
(acquiescing) You're very rude
if you don't come back -- 'll be back in a while
don't want to see you anymore
'll be right back, baby, really
- George on his bike threads through traffic on the Strip this, we     of      "Monday, Monday
" He pulls up to a signal beside a faded Eugene McCarthy billboard
Somebody
' George
Hey, baby, what's happening
(not bad) Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas
That's too bad
have to see you
Hey, stop by the shop
He takes off
Winds through alleys and heads up the hill to Jill's
It's a shortcut whose precision should make it obvious he's traveled it a number of times
' - George jumps off his bike and pounds on the door
' (soft) Who is it
(furious) Who do you think it is
opens the door
She's shaking
There were some shots
What're you talking about
Gunshots, there were some gunshots
(looking around) Where
Here in the canyon
Well, it's a big canyon
(seeing she's upset) Honey, 'm sorry but 've gotta get back
just for a minute
Let me come, too
(pleading) Please don't leave me alone
What's gonna happen
(near tears) don't know
every once in a while  just get the feeling something awful's going to happen
Well, like what
don't know
just
somebody's going to get me
Jill starts to cry
She ambles into the carport in her nightgown
(') 've had these dumb dreams lately
What
They're dumb, somebody
don't know
(suspicious) Who
just
who what
You said somebody
who
She's not answering
don't know
can't remember
It was just in my dream
No shit
Jill laughs
George comes over to her
(') Nobody's gonna get you
Now get inside
(uncertain) George,  don't -- You'll do what  tell you
Now get the fuck inside
She backs inside
He moves in after her
George -- (moving after her) Keep moving -- Now, George -- Nobody's gonna get you but me
He leaps after her and she screams, delighted
George chases her into the bedroom
Jill screams
He throws her on the bed and leaps on top of her, kissing her
She likes it
(') How are you, baby
Fine
How are you
Great, great, fantastic
Fantastic
Incredible
Incredible, really incredible
What
'm gonna open the shop, baby, 'm gonna open the shop
'm getting it together
How
(rising) Right now -- 'm at the epitome of my life
Right now  feel so good 'm afraid something's gonna happen
He gets off the bed
Jill is fascinated
(') When  was a little kid,  used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever  am 'm gonna be in Europe
Honey, what happened
just came from a meeting can't talk about it now, baby
But in a few days -- see 'm disgusted with my life
thought you said you were at the epitome of your life
am,  am
But 've had it with chicks
They're like an occupational hazard
Six guys working for me
'm gonna retire or settle down or something
What about me
(meaning it) You're different
am
You're great
am
Yeah
Do you really mean that
Hey, baby -- 'm gonna retire with you
He kisses her
They start rolling around on the bed
Honey
Yeah, baby
Why am  great
George is a little annoyed
Jesus,  don't know
You're great
Jill looks a little perplexed
Will we live together
We live together now
But in the same house, you know, one house
(just a slight hitch) -- Sure
She hugs him
'  - George in bed, beginning to sleep
Hubert Humphrey expresses opinion at his chances tomorrow on
Maybe you don't even like children
Of course  like children
You've never even been around one
'm around you and  like you, don't
(smiling despite herself) Yeah
Okay
(sinking back down) Night, baby
(after a moment) George
What
Not right now,  don't mean right now
but eventually
(grumpy) Okay, baby
Okay
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world
That it's hypocritical and overpopulated
- "
"  George on bike whipping into bank parking lot
- George sits talking, with
, a bank vice president
He is perspiring a little
Somebody's breathing rather heavily
It's Mr
Pettis seated behind his desk now and opposite George
He's going over something
(looking up now) Oh yes
Mrs
Shumann called about you
(smiling) Right
How is she
Great
Wonderful woman
She is
went to school with her husband
Great
(pleasantly affirmative) So you want to go in business for yourself
Right
And you need money
Right, that's right
(smiling) You do know what money's like these days
(no) Well, yeah
you know
Pettis grabs a sheet off his desk, one in plastic containing rates
Jesus, look at this
Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate
And 'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it
They are
After all, Mr
Roundy, we're paying six percent
Six percent
's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days
guess not
It's got nothing to do with inflation
Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully
Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it
An uncomfortable pause
(') What sort of references do you have
Well,  do Barbara Rush
Pardon me
(embarrassed now) Her hair,  do Barbara Rush
mean credit references, Mr
Roundy
- Jill Haynes and  , in mini skirts and boots, are having coffee at one of the interior decorator hangouts outdoors off Melrose in West Hollywood
Cadillac pulls up to the curb
Its occupant again, obviously trying to attract their attention
Jill starts to look over
think you're crazy
Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman
Who is that
(deadly) real swinger
He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years
is now calling Jackie's name
Jackie can't avoid it anymore
(') (pleasantly) Hi, Leonard
Jackie, what're you doing
(they're having coffee) Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along
have to meet a client
who're you dating
Jackie looks off and spots a billboard
Poster-Kleiser
Oh yeah
That's right
'll call you
Fine
See you later
Anyway, you're crazy
am
mean why
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive
'm not
Maybe  am
No, listen
He's a very good hairdresser
Jill looks at Jackie
(') Well, he is
(annoyed) So what's your point
Jill, 'm just trying to be helpful
know, 'm sorry
spent three years with him just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent
his unemployment or mine
George was adorable but it drove me crackers
Now at least 'm comfortable
Lester does what he says he'll do
Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy
Are you
George is great but  know what you mean
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody
Face it, time isn't on your side
guess not
- George and Mr
Pettis
(giving it all he's got) 've got the customers
that's my point
'm the one they want
If had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me
have a lot of customers
Look, Mr
Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement
It'll save us both some time
Miss Michaels here can show you
have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there
Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms
Pettis rises, shakes George's hand and disappears
George is left with  , who has been more or less within earshot of the whole conversation
George is very upset
- Jill thumbs through a Life magazine with Eldridge Cleaver on the cover, waiting for an interview in the outer office of the 9000 Building whose open window overlooks a smoggy chunk of the city
She's one of so many girls that at first she's not recognizable
All of them have composites which they carry in leather folders
They eye each other uneasily
- There is the , Barry, and the director,
Egypt
That's right
But why Egypt
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad
Jill nods
You seem disappointed
No
how long did you say
Three weeks
Jill nods
Egypt
Pope, chagrined, shoots Jill a look
He's trying to get her the job
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go
Maybe we can change our location
No, it's not that
Do you have children
No
Are you married
No
Do you have something against traveling
(unable to interpret Pope's looks to her) No
Well, do you have something against us
Jill laughs, a little embarrassed
No
(to Pope, he's wasting time) John
(ignoring him) Go ahead, Jill, you can say it
Now 'm embarrassed to tell you
She is, too, and Pope can see it
We'll let you know tomorrow
Please don't misunderstand
'd really like to go
(a little sarcastic) Thanks for coming by
Jill is at the door
She turns back
To Pope
Oh
thank you
Sure
Jill leaves
(') (shaking his head) This town
At the shop on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills ' "  " covers George pulling up on his bike
The street is empty of traffic except there are scores and scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some meter maids
George starts toward the shop
pair of women in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop
They look like Medusas
They hurtle down the sidewalk as if they're running from something
Then they find their respective cars and begin pouring pennies into the meters
, , ,
George looks glum
He's walking along the street stops him
She's driving by in a 3
4 Jag
Hi, George
Hey, baby, what's happening
Nothing,  reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy  divorced last summer
Great, great
hope you make it
Somebody  in back of her
Call me
don't have your number, stop by the shop
(waving goodbye) Okay
George looks after her, smiling
Then: (disgusted) God damn it
He goes into the shop
large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop
It covers most of the wall it leans against
An attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything matching, a real French garden, leans forward   and looks at herself in the mirror
She studies her image carefully
She moves closer to it
She seems uncertain at first
Then as she looks her conviction grows: Great
great
great
great
great
She turns back to  , her hairdresser
She takes his hand
(') Great, Dennis
With her other hand she touches her hair
(') Do you think there's enough height
mean do you think there's enough height
Now she and Dennis look into the mirror at her together
Dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck
Felicia, in far corner, waits defiantly
George spots her
(') George, do you think there's enough height
(on way to Felicia) Yeah, sure
Dennis doesn't think so
Man,  didn't say a word
Well, what do you think
Is there enough height
Both Dennis and Tina turn back to the mirror for further deliberation
You're late, George
(taking her to his cubicle) gotta talk to you
don't want to talk about it
But you don't know what happened
don't care
George, do you think there's too much height
(seating her) It's great
You don't know what happened, this girl she almost got-- (a little hysterical) don't care about that girl, don't care if she's dead
Calm down, baby
(calming down) 'm perfectly calm, George, 'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood
mummers
-- What
Nummers
What
-- Numbers, and  don't need to place myself in that kind of position
tugs on George's arm
What're you here for
(as if giving away a secret) --  wash and set
No
No
You need a cut
But Mr
Norman said -- Said what
(whispered) just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all
Well, baby, 'm George and it needs to be cut
(to Felicia) But  don't want to place you in that position either
--  like myself far too much, far too much
don't want to place you in any position -- -- to be put in that kind of position
(to Gloria) 'll have Mary wash you
Mary
(a schvar) Yeah
Wash her
(looking at Gloria) What with
(nudging her) --  brillo pad,  don't care, anything
Mary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are several photographs of models and one of a handsome young black Marine in fatigues
George has gone to pick up a razor, changes it
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George
-- Oh yeah
(mixing) But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either
George laughs
-- White ladies
(laughing, too) -- Oh my yes
(burning with anger) George -- (calling back) 'm coming, baby -- (to Mary) How's Otis doing, anyway
That boy always does great
He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due
don't know if you don't know -- George
George winks at Mary, heads back
(') (going  right on) 'm not used to that kind of treatment
What kind of treatment
(going right on) 've never been treated that way, and 'm not going to start now
Jesus,  don't know, baby,  been cutting too much hair lately
'm losing all my concepts
Jill has entered the shop
She approaches George
George
Hey, baby, what's happening
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks
Great
Jill stands there now, not knowing what to say
(') Jill, say hello to Felicia
Hello
Hello
George
Yeah, baby
How did it go at the bank
George looks away
Great
Could  talk to you for a second
Hey, 'm, you know -- Could
George moves away from Felicia
Yeah
(with some feeling) said  wasn't sure if  could go
Go where
(impatiently) Egypt
Oh, great, listen, baby,  gotta get back, okay
Okay, but how did it go at the bank
Great
can we talk later
(the shop's owner) George
Yeah
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums
Buffums
Yes, Buffums
've got heads here, Norman
You promised you'd do the show
Oh fuck, Norman
Don't use that tone of voice with me
never mind, 'll take Gordon
George turns back to Felicia as  comes by
He's near tears
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did
(working on Felicia) No, man
-- Right after  sprayed her
What
(losing control) She touched it
Then she played in it and got it all into something else
Now  don't know what it is
He's waiting for George for sympathy
Jill steps away gathering patience
(') can't even stand to talk to her on the phone
(sympathetic) She's heavy
(to Felicia) See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk
gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense
can see that
You're looking great, baby
What're you doing later
(half kidding) Whatever you say
We have this political thing tonight
Could you comb me out at the house
George is torn
don't know
'm beginning to feel guilty
What about
All  ever do is play
should be doing something to get my own shop open
Why don't you see Lester
(a little alarmed) Your husband
Yes
(not sure what she's driving at) What about
The shop
think you're a good investment, and  don't mind telling him
Hey, listen, baby, 'm a star
Jill returns
George
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia
already said hello
Okay
George
Yeah, baby
When can  talk to you
Baby, 'm in the middle of work
know but this is important have to make a decision
About what
Whether or not 'm going
Going where
Egypt
Honey, have they offered you the job
No, but  think they might
(to Jill) Just a second, 'll be right with you
He turns back to Felicia
Jill moves away
(interested) Is she all right
don't know
Just a minute
George moves over to Jill
(') What do you want
Your advice
They didn't offer you the job yet
want your feelings about it
Right now
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, 've got to know
(really harassed) Look, baby, can we talk about it later
Felicia is watching them
When
When  get off work
When is that
'll call you
When is that, George
'll call you
(really upset) But  never know when you're working and when you're not working
(half to himself) Neither do , baby
What
Nothing, 'll call you, okay
Okay
Back to Felicia
As Jill leaves
-- Anyway
hope she's all right
She's fine
You really think 'd be a good investment
wouldn't say so if  didn't
No,  know
And  certainly wouldn't tell Lester
know
mean it or  wouldn't say it
That's great
You look great, baby, great
Dennis, look at Felicia's hair
Dennis stops
He's with the
Both of them: & Great
- Jill, in street, on verge of tears
moves to her car
gets in
sits for a long moment
- George on bike pulls into office building
The   is ' "
" '  - In his inner office
' on the telephone, staring out the window
Look, Kurt,  don't care where you have to go
want Beluga Caviar there
Call Jurgenson's, call Chasen's
don't care how much it costs
how much
then spend it
Just make sure it's there
You've got all the money in the world to buy it
You understand
Just make sure it's there on the table tonight
(he hangs up) Jesus
(to George, to no one) You've got to do everything yourself
You know
Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look
It covers his hair, his clothes
George is acutely uncomfortable
(') Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser
Well, yeah
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser
Thank you
didn't say it, she did
How'd you happen to get in that line of work
George sort of knows what Lester's driving at
Oh, well,  went to beauty school
you know you go to beauty school
and you get your operator's license
and you graduate
and you're a hairdresser
see
Long pause
George hasn't told Lester what he wants to know
(') It's an unusual trade
Yes it is
An awkward pause
But the important thing is you're successful at it
In a way
But
But what
'm better than the guy  work for
This seems to interest Lester
Well, George,  invest for a lot of people
make a lot of money for them
More than they could do for themselves
After a while that hurts
doesn't it
Lester smiles
He appreciates this
It's good you want to do something, George
Thank you
But personal services are not the kind of thing  usually get into
They're not
(suddenly direct, almost enthusiastic) No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything
It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am right or am  right
You're right
Who needs that kind of aggravation
Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age
When  finish work want to
The door bursts open
It's one of the
Mr
Karpf
Jackie is right behind her
She bounces in, not seeing George
'm sorry but  need an extra garage key
In Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she did with Jill
She's startled when she sees George
What for
What do you need the key for
Jackie continues to stare at George
The man from Sloan's is coming called you about it
How did you lose that key
Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie
Oh, hi,  mean hello, we've met
(a little suspiciously) Is that right
(almost immediately on the defensive) Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser
Is that right
Awkward pause
So how's Norman
Great
Who's been doing your hair
Jackie glances at Lester
go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood
The guy in the third chair's dynamite
nobody much
George is going to open a shop
(really interested) No kidding
Your own shop
George starts to say yes
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute
Sure
He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and Lester alone
Lester shuts the door
called to tell you  was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone
am
Who were you talking to
Who do you think  was talking to
My secretary saw you with that boy
Steve
Whatever his name is, that actor
Jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very emotional
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy
(a touch bitter) Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor
He couldn't get arrested as a boy
Then you were talking to him
ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was supposed to do, hide in the ladies room
Yes,  was talking to him
Lester's a little chagrined now but not much
(') (an outburst) 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody,  can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you
You're driving me up the wall, Lester
You're even jealous of the dogs
mean 've gotta have somebody  can talk to
'm not jealous of the dogs
Jackie looks at him in disgust
(') (very positive) Now listen, Jackie, 'm not jealous of anybody,  just can't afford to get caught
off base
So  can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, 'm going to tell him 'm screwing Lester Karpf
Of course not
That's not very logical, Lester
- picking up the tail end of this
He thinks the room is soundproofed
Don't tell him it's not
How come
He'll have that awful construction crew back again, and they can never do anything right
' (trying to think of why) It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world
You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth
Really
How about starting with tonight
By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this for months
Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to him genuinely upsets her
She's near tears and she's not the kind of girl who cries easily
Lester's sensitive to it
Sweetheart,  know it's rough but at this point -- my business involves handling money for some very touchy people, politics and so on
Felicia's at a very difficult period in her life
any divorce and settlement and so forth, my finances would have to be looked into
Jackie knows what he's talking about
(quietly) You and your touchy investors
(finally) Look
you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop
Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam
They all want their share
Jackie comes over to Lester
You're lying about one thing, Lester
What's that
You're still jealous
She's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can be with him
Lester smiles
He's almost benign
God, you're a doll
He takes her in his arms and she responds
(') (he means it) We'll work something out about tonight,  promise
- The door opens
Jackie and Lester emerge, distinctly subdued
Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key for the Bowmont House, would you
Yes, Mr
Karpf
Angie opens her desk and goes through some files, pulls out a key, puts it in an envelope and hands it to Jackie -- she's lightning quick about it, super efficient
Well, let's go down together
'mon, George, 'll walk you out
, Jackie turns to stub out a cigarette in a standing ashtray
(') (quietly) Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she
Oh yeah
Jackie moves back
(normal tone now) Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but  invest for myself and a lot of particular people
Oh yeah
mean  know
So 'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject
The elevator doors open
When
When
The doors close on the three of them
going down
George is looking at Lester, waiting for an answer
(looks up slowly) How about tonight
Jackie looks to Lester
Lester winks at Jackie
Tonight
Yeah, little election party 'm giving at the Bistro
It's a pain in the ass but -- have to do it
We'll have a little time to talk there
The elevator stops on the third floor
man in a suit and a middle-aged woman with a cane get in
They're strangers to each other
The elevator proceeds
(') (quiet, almost solemn in their presence) -- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here
(slowly) Okay
They've reached the basement and are standing as Bill the maintenance man, races around the cars to get to Lester's Rolls
It's good you want to do something, George
George doesn't answer this time
(') wish my son knew what he wanted to do
Oh yeah
-- Anything,  don't care what it is, just so it's something
know what you mean
Lester's car is backed up
The door opened for him
(thoughtfully) Maybe he ought to go to beauty school
Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay
Fine
Lester slips Bill a few dollars and takes off, leaving Jackie and George looking at each other
Jackie shakes her head
(') Jesus
-- Yeah
your car down here
Jackie nods
They walk toward it
(') -- Listen, 'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight
She's really going to be pissed if don't
-- Maybe she'll come with us
If tell her how important it is to me, don't think she'll mind
Do you
don't know
Probably not
Jill's really great, isn't she
Great
so how's everything with you
They've reached Jackie's 230SL
Great, more or less
She starts to get in
How long you had this
Oh, about six weeks now
Lester -- well, he's very sweet
'm sure
He's a very private person, actually
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he
Jackie has started to get in the car several times
This stops her again
-- Well no
It never came up
You going to tell him
(smoothly) -- What for
Honey, 'll see you later
They kiss each other's cheeks, she gets in and takes off
-    - tooling along the tracks in Jackie's 230SL
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie
You really are
(she glances over at Jill) You're sure you don't mind
Don't be silly
You're really a love -- you sure
-- No
No really
Well, what is it, honey
Nothing
It must be something
Well, it's George
thought you said things were great with George
Well they are
But we have problems
You say things are great with Lester
Is he going to marry you
We don't think marriage is important
But you have problems
-- Yeah, honey
don't know
One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me
It's driving me crazy
Jackie pulls away from the signal a little jerkily
Five times a day
(sighs, then) --  guess it's all got to do with this shop
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little
Five times a day
(embarrassed) Well, you know what  mean
After four years
No  don't
and don't know too many girls who do
'm exaggerating
How much
(giggling a little) Jackie -- What
(taking a little  breath) Well
it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's
he does it for a long time
He does
Well yes -- you know that about George
It's been so long  don't how long
Quite a while
an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It
would say so, yes
Honey
What
think you're going to hit that car in front of us
Jackie slams on the brakes
-    - standing there
-- See,  just know that if  go to Egypt, well, things happen,  just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time
Just continually, without stopping
-- Well -- not going in and out, don't mean just that
Why are you asking me
You went with George longer than  have
--  guess  just blocked it out, that's all
'mon
Well, there was this one time -- (a little devilish) -- Yesss
--  was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show
(meaning yes) -- uhh-huhh
-- Well it was very hot so 'd left the door open and the water was running so  didn't hear him come down the stairs
Mmm-hmmm
Now Jackie has begun to lose her self-consciousness and is into the story
little faint edge of nervousness or something like it begins to take over Jill
-- He came up behind me and  was wiping a dish and he just
lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there
Didn't you have any panties on
(remembering) -- He reached up and tore them
What did you do
Well
just kept wiping that dish
Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was
(faintly perturbed) No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot
The wood on the sundeck, everything
'  -   - gardener is riding a mower around the front lawn
There are three cars parked in and around the circular driveway
- He slips into a cardigan sweater
His vanity is restricted entirely to how well pressed and clean everything is he wears
He goes out of the dressing room toward the kitchen, passing Lorna on the phone in the living room and Felicia at dining room table, hair in curlers, reading Cosmopolitan magazine
Do you think George is a fairy
Who
That kid
the hairdresser
Well,  don't know for sure
he's a hairdresser
Mona brings her coffee from kitchen
(') Thank you, Mona
Lester has swallowed some vitamins in the kitchen
Turns to her
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that
Maybe
why do you ask
'm thinking of investing with him
He worries me
Why
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible
That's why  asked if he was a fairy
don't know
He's a hairdresser
(really asking) You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea
Yes, but
thought
What
That you were just indulging me
No, doll,  listen to you
And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right
He gives Felicia a peck and starts out
(') He's a nice boy
invited him tonight
'm sorry he's a fairy
-    - George is busy
He's working on
You're in a good mood today, George
Yeah, baby
Things are great
Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want
Chicken salad
Chicken salad, Devra
don't have any change
Get some at the desk
Anyway, you remember Harold
Yeah, baby, how's it going
The
Norman brings it to George
George
Jackie Shawn
George seems really surprised to hear the voice on the other end
Anjanette looks around
No, 'd like to but 've got too many heads here, can't you stop by the shop
(to shampoo girl) Two caps, Mary, yeah, two
(back to phone) Okay, but  have to be in Bel Air at four
He hangs up
It  again
Don't you think there's too much gold
(to Anjanette) It's great
(into phone) You wanna speak to Mary
Hold on
don't know,  think
(good natured, but firm) Look, would you argue with your doctor
No
Ricci comes up to him ready to cry
(to Ricci) Hey, what's happening
(calling) Mary
Telephone
(to Ricci) What's the matter
(furious) Wanda
Oh yeah
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here
Yeah
She's murdered her hair
you do something with her, 'm never going to touch her again
'm busy, man
If  have to touch her again, 'll throw up
(exploding) Don't talk like a child
You're a pro, now get out there and cut
Ricci is stunned
He says under his breath, "'ll throw up" again and leaves
Mary, her back to George, sits holding the telephone to her ear
thought you were in a good mood
am
except 've gotta do somebody at their house
Don't you like her
No, it's a very groovy girl
Then what's the problem
(really worried) She's a very groovy girl
That's the problem
What're you talking about, George
Well, it's a small town
Sooner or later things catch up with you
don't they
Mary runs out of the shop, tipping over a magazine rack
(') Where's the caps, Mary
She's exiting front door in a hurry
(') Mary
What's goin' on, Mary
-  - ,  , ", ,
" He pulls up to a rustic house
He gets his little case off the bike and then hesitates
He walks to the door and rings the bell
Jackie answers the door
She seems distracted and, at the same time, a little wary
Much the same, in fact, as George
Hi
'mon in
Jackie's wearing a robe
They walk into the living room, the dogs yelping
(') Shut up, it's all right
(to George, automatically) Do you want a drink
No, thanks
Well,  do
She starts to mix herself a drink
She changes her mind, pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back
She does it again
When she turns back to George he's looking at her noncommittally
(') Where do you want to do this
Probably the bathroom
Can't you do it out here
George looks around
Well, it depends
If you just wanted a combout
guess  could
Jackie turns to him, honestly uncertain
Well, what do you think
George himself is tentative
don't know
Why don't you sit down
Jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down on the glass-topped coffee table
(meaning her position) Is this all right
George moves in
He draws the drapes back so light comes in from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen
Yeah
He takes her hair in his hands
The contact makes them both nervous
She looks away
George continues to run his hands through her hair
(a little nervous) Well, what do you think
'd cut it
You would
Yeah,  think so
(almost irritable) You don't seem very sure
No, 'm sure
There is a moment where Jackie is trying to decide whether she'll let George actually cut her hair
(then) Okay
but  want you to know one thing
(almost a threat) 've got to look great tonight, mean  have to look great, okay
Okay
'     - Felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses
She seems in a hurry
She leaves the bathroom, moves quickly through the house to the kitchen
She passes Lorna's bedroom
is changing from her school clothes into a tennis dress
She watches her mother flash by
Felicia stops
She is holding a dangling pearl earring in her hand
Mona, Mona
comes out from the laundry room
Felicia has called a little too loud
(') (indicates earring) Have you seen the other one of these by any chance
want to wear them tonight
(before Mona can answer) Oh
when George gets here, tell him to wait
have to pick up a dress and  may have to have it fitted, but be sure
Lorna ambles into the kitchen, expressionless
(') to tell him to wait
Yes, ma'am
But  have to go to the market
Just be sure he doesn't leave
Felicia flashes out the door and into the carport, visible through the kitchen
She takes off
Lorna slowly slips a white swetlet onto her slender wrist
'    - which includes a sauna
Jackie's got on a terry-cloth robe
George has been wetting her hair in the basin
Her terry cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way
Jill's coming with us
Great
She's incredible
(after a moment) She loves you, George
Yeah
mean great
George begins to cut
Jackie winces a little
George notices it
Getting my hair cut is always a little nerve-wracking
The cutting goes on
The bathroom is very close
George has begun to perspire a little as has Jackie
(') don't get it done often
Whew
What's wrong
It's hot in here
(after a moment) It's the sauna,  keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot
Yeah
wow
George stops and takes off his shirt
He's wearing a purple shirt underneath
He goes back to cutting
Jackie's getting more and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and partly because of her concern over what he's doing
George on the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job at hand
(finally) Not too much, don't cut too much
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor
The shrink
Many times
George stops and looks at her
Both are perspiring freely now
(') Bernstein
seemed to think hated men
Do you
You still see him
Jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror
George gently pulls her back
(with some feeling) No
Why not
Jackie doesn't answer
(') Why not
he tried to
uh
make it with me
And
And what
Did you
Jackie looks up slowly
George is still cutting, not looking directly at her
It was after you, baby
After you
(breathes deeply) Boy, that sauna is really
can't you turn it down or something
No
Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it
'  - Jill, alone, sits on bed
Gazes into bureau mirror, shaping her hair
The
Hello
oh hi, Johnny
Oh really
Thank you
Are you serious
Tonight 'm busy,
Right now
Oh no, you really couldn't come up here
'  &  - with Jackie's hair considerably shorter
George is sitting now as he works, his knee wedged between her legs, working very close
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud
At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something
(amused) Did Lester know about him
There was nothing to know
Anyway
if  can't have love have to at least have money
have to have some pride  can do something
George has started to dry her hair
He stops
He picks up the scissors
Her hair is askew still so it's difficult to see what George has done
(') (staring at the scissors, a warning) George
just have to do one little thing
If you screw me up for tonight, 'll kill you,  swear to God, 'll kill you
won't screw you up
-   - his dark blue Rolls Royce
He's listening to the radio, keeps switching to pick up fresh news reports
He turns off Sunset and heads up Coldwater Canyon
'    -    - George
how about Felicia
(expressionless) What
Did you
Did  what
You know what 'm talking about
Hey,  don't tell
(teasing) Can  count on that
just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight
Yeah
Well, did you or didn't you
George shuts the blower off
He picks up his comb for the final comb out
Now, baby
if  told you about her
then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore
could you
You did, didn't you
They're very close and Jackie's moving closer
She's intrigued, amused and at ease
George is trying to keep some distance
Baby
You did,  know you did
One of my few virtues is discretion
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you
She's moving closer and closer, being deliberately provocative -- to seduce the information out of him
'  - Lester pulls into it
He stops, reaches in the glove compartment and pulls out one of the little airline bottles of vodka
He pours it into a glass, drinks it
He notices George's bike in the driveway
Next to him on the seat is a prettily wrapped package
'    -    - George sprays her
He turns her around in the chair to face the mirror so she can see herself for the first time
She should look really different, her hair significantly shorter, and modishly and beautifully cut to her face
Jackie's lips part
(softly) George
(staring at her) Yeah, baby
You're a genius
Her hand automatically goes up to take his
He starts to pull it back
(') (grabbing it, thrilled) You're a genius, do you know that, you're a genius
She turns and throws her arms around George, kissing him
It's too much for George
He kisses her back
(') (trying to resist) Oh, no
George is obsessed
He wraps his arms around her and she responds, passionately
(') Oh, no
They are grappling, pushing and pulling with each other
George kicks away the stool by the mirror and tries to bend Jackie to the rug-covered bathroom floor
(') (genuine) No
Don't
Please
(forcing her down) don't want to
swear
She throws her arms around him, kissing him and shoving him away
George is tearing at his trousers
They are on the floor now , rolling around, bouncing gently off the ceramic molding from the sunken tub
It'll ruin everything
know
you don't know,  know
Don't, don't, don't
They hit the sauna room door as they're rolling around and the door opens
Steam comes pouring over them, momentarily obscuring their struggles
George has trouble getting his pants down
At the last instant, Jackie gives them a helpful tug
(') (moans) Oh, no
Suddenly, the  begin to
There is the  of the Jackie sits up
(') It's Lester
She's frozen with fear
' (muffled) Hey, doll
Jackie
honey
where are you
Get up, get up, get up
George is already trying to pull on his trousers
Jackie is up and clutching her robe, unable to move
(') Oh God, oh God, oh God
do something, please God, do something
' (nearer) Hey, baby, are you sleeping
Sit down
(frantic) What are you talking about
(equally frantic, forcing her) Sit down
He's moved into the bedroom, carrying the package obviously a gift for Jackie
He's been a little puzzled
His puzzlement is rapidly turning to suspicion
Jackie
Jackie
Lester opens the door
He's hit with a blast of steam and the sight of George stripped to the waist, ostensibly working over Jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel
George has a comb in one hand and now turns on the dryer, blowing it with a somewhat exaggerated gesture
Shut the door, shut the door
Oh, 'm sorry
He shuts the door
Then he thinks better of it
He opens the door again and takes a step into the bathroom
George waves the comb at Lester a little impatiently
It's wet and sprinkles Lester
Look, either come in or stay out
Shut the door, Lester
What do you think this is, a picnic
(confused now) Sorry, honey,
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door
Lester shuts the door, feeling a little chagrined, and relieved
He sits on the bed and puts the present beside him
In a moment George emerges
(') she's very upset
What about, tonight
(seizing the opportunity) That, and
'll be done in a minute
He goes back inside
just stare silently into mirror at each other
' Jackie
Hey,  brought you a little something, doll
- George has his case of comb and scissors, etc
, and is standing with Lester
He's anxious to go
You look like you've had quite a work-out
It's nerve wracking sometimes
women can get you very upset
know it,  know it
this doing hair it's
know it, son
But tonight's going to be even tougher
George just looks at him
Lester walks him to bike
(') George,  know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, appreciate the way you've handled the situation
Oh, hey
It's a difficult situation, and want you to know  appreciate it
Tonight's going to be real tough for me -- don't know what to
Son, we'll do business,  can tell you that
George roars off on bike
Jackie is cleaning up some dog food
Lester stands there for a minute
(') 'd like a drink
(looking up) Just a second, 've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house
You ought to get rid of those dogs
Jackie looks up and then controls herself
(') They get hair all over the place
They're Yorkies and they don't shed
Jackie goes into the living room and fixes Lester a drink
Lester follows
(') (giving him a drink) Here
Aren't you going to have one
No
Why not
Because  don't want one
Lester goes over to her to kiss her
'mon, doll, it's five o'clock, have a drink
Jackie turns away and explodes
don't want one
First you tell me not to drink then you tell me to drink, which is it
don't want a drink
Lester's now a little intimidated, but even more suspicious
called to tell you  was on my way, but the line was busy, you're always on the phone
'     - George pulls into the circular driveway
by a few bars of The Mama's and The Papa's "California Dreamin
" There's only one car
George gets off the bike and goes to the door
Nobody answers
He hears the  of a
He looks toward the tennis court
- is banging away on the backboard
There's a basket of balls nearby
She hits with considerable skill and power until she misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh surrounding the court
George is standing there
Lorna looks at him
You here to see my mother
Yeah
She's out, but you're supposed to wait
(') Hungry
little
They're eating silently
Lorna has hauled all kinds of food out of the refrigerators
She watches George as he eats with some relish
She gets up and goes to the steel-doored refrigerators
(indicating refrigerators) This is the one thing  like about this house
want some lox
No thanks
You're my mother's hairdresser
(warily) do her hair, yeah
Chopped liver
No thanks
Are you gay
baked apple
they're cold but they're good
No thanks
Did you hear me
Yeah
Well, are you
Are you queer
yeah
(laughing) 'mon, are you or aren't you
(trying to avoid it) Gee, this is great
He slices a piece of cheesecake
Lorna sits down, in the chair nearest him now
'mon, tell me
Don't be afraid
Why do you wanna know so bad
See if you've been making it with my mother
(looking at her for a minute, he changes his tone) What would my being a faggot have to do with that
Lorna shrugs
Nothing,  guess
have you ever made it with a guy
Have you ever made it with a girl
asked you first
Yeah
've made it with a girl
Lorna smiles
pause
Well, are you
Am  what
Making it with my mother
George wants to avoid this at all costs
He stares at Lorna intently
'd like to do your hair sometime
Why
just, you could look very heavy
Don't make conversation with me
What
You don't have to make conversation with me, 'm not my mother
do you have a thing about older women
that's sort of faggoty isn't it
George is weary and getting annoyed
Yeah, it is
never get my hair done
No kidding
In fact,  don't think 've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life
No shit
You think that's funny, don't you
(laughing a little) Yeah
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence
(determined to be light) Yeah
Beverly Hills hairdresser
what kind of a thing is that to do
you might as well be a faggot
think that's funny too
No
Then what do you think
That you're just like your mother
am not like my mother
You are
am not
You are
Lorna is furious
am not
(he starts to placate her) Look
(then defiantly) Do you wanna fuck me
(defiantly) Yeah
George stops eating
He's not prepared for this
(uneasily) Right now
(a little more tentative now that the moment has arrived) Yeah
-     - scraggly bearded  with long stringy hair sets down two huge green salads before Jill and Johnny Pope
In so doing the Waiter drops a wooden menu he's been carrying
As he bends down to pick it up, he kneels beside Pope
Pope taps him on the shoulder
(tapping him) Oh, scraves
Yes
The Waiter looks up, and moves
Thank you
What for
Taking your hair out of my salad
Oh, 'm sorry
Pope nods, Jill giggles
The Waiter goes off
Pope tosses out a few pieces of lettuce from the top of his salad
Why don't you ask for another one
Are you kidding
His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here
See, you've reduced me to eating weeds
my friend doesn't like it here either
All right, forget this filth
Continue about your friend
Well he's not exactly a friend
Is he an enemy
(laughing) Of course not
he's sort of a boyfriend
-- sort of a boyfriend
Sort of
see
You mean he just sort of fucks you
Johnny
My God, did  say that
don't believe it
He looks under his chair to see if it was somebody else
(') 'm terribly sorry
(amused) -- never mind
What does he do
Is he an actor
-- no
Good for you
He's a hairdresser
Pope drops his fork in the salad bowl
-- oh, sure
hairdresser
How
how do you a
meet a hairdresser
Getting your hair done
(looks at him, abruptly) Would you like to go to a party
Not with your hairdresser
'  -  - pulls into the driveway
She gets out of her car, spots George's bike
She sees the food spread out
moving through the house
She stops by Lorna's room
Lorna has a sliding door, which is closed
Felicia opens it
Lorna
' Lorna is sitting on her bed, in her tennis dress but with her tennis shoes off
She's straightening a string in her racket
She looks to her mother, expressionless
(') Have you seen George
He's in the bathroom
Your bathroom
Yes
The toilet flushes
The sink runs, and George emerges
He's looking a little haggard
Hi
(coolly) Hello, George
They walk out to the lanai together and George picks up his case
There is considerable tension from Felicia as they walk into her bedroom
Felicia slides the bedroom door shut, an action which George unhappily notices
She turns to George
She looks very hostile
She's trembling
(') 've missed you
George is taken aback
He gropes for a moment
've
missed you too
Felicia comes to him
She comes to him and touches his arm
George suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds his fist into a high-backed chair, turning away from Felicia
She clearly misunderstands the action
(touched) It's okay, honey
it's okay now
She moves to the door and quietly locks it
George winces
She comes back to him and kisses him gently
She kisses him again with more passion
George tries to respond
(') Comb my hair out later, honey
No, that's okay, 'll do It now
No, baby
'm glad you're coming tonight
She gently tugs at him, leading him toward the bed
George is miserable
(looking toward the door) But aren't you
Right now,  just don't care
As they sink to the bed, Felicia switches on the -
The Tijuana Brass begin to play
- a few bars of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone"
Riding home
He turns down his street and pulls into his driveway
He gets off his bike and only as he starts up his walk does he see Jill
She's been quietly waiting on his front porch, hidden in the shadows of the overhang
She doesn't look happy
George stops cold
(
) Jill says nothing
(') Where's your car
friend dropped me off
Who
Never mind
Where've you been
business meeting,  told you that
They go inside
The living room is messy
George looks around in disgust
What business meeting
Look at the way  live
've been trying to reach you all afternoon
You weren't in the shop
What is this thing tonight
What do you mean, what is it
It's some political bullshit
have to have Jackie ask me
Don't you think you could call me and let me know
Look at my hair
Wait a minute, God-damn-it
Do you think  want to go to some God damned party
'm trying to get that God damned shop open
'm trying to get a little bread together
That's all 'm doing
George's outburst has shocked Jill
George maniacally begins straightening the mess
(') just wanna live like everybody else, that's all
want clothes in the closet, and food in the refrigerator, and  don't want shit all over the house and running my ass all over town
want my own house
want an appointment book
want to get up in the morning and go to bed at night want a normal life like everybody else, that's all
He collapses into a chair
She comes over to him and knee beside him
know, honey
Maybe  should get a dog
no, it would just shit all over the house and 'd never clean it up
(laughing a little, touching him) Oh, honey
If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and could take care of it
We're almost never here
- signal red Porsche cabriolet pulls up into mirror
The top is down
Under the brightly lit streetlights Jill's blonde hair and features are
in her Mercedes
George still looking through the rear view mirror
Jackie's a knockout
(looking at George looking in mirror) -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green
(he takes off) -- oh yeah
what do you know about this guy
-- what guy
(gesturing toward rear window) -- this guy with Jill
He's a director
-     - pull up, Pope right behind George
Parking  leap for the doors
few photographers of the movie freak variety ask each other who these arrivals are
One assures several others that they're nobody
(to Attendant) Do  need a ticket for this
We'll remember you
as they move to take his Porsche
(') (shaking his head) 'll park it
Pope drives his own car onto the lot
, waiting for Pope who is now ambling toward them
(to Jill) What does he direct besides traffic
Ha, ha
Television or movies
Commercials
(quietly, to George) Feel better
Let's go
Pope has joined them
They clear it to see the long elegant bar, bathed in soft light, filled with elegant customers
George looks and sees someone
fortyish , attractive
(to Jackie) Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern
Look at her hair
What about it
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job 've -- Norma comes over, hugs George
George -- (pointing to her hair) Baby, you've been chippying on me -- Yes, isn't it awful -- (smiling) -- yes
Jackie tugs him by the arm
We're upstairs, George
Now come on
Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor
Don't let me drink too much
(going upstairs) You don't do that anymore, do you
Jackie doesn't answer
They've reached the top of the stairs
They're hit by the full force of the upstairs gathering -- black tie, posters of Nixon, Agnew, Reagan, and Murphy, vaguely familiar faces crossing back and forth, clustering, watching early returns on television sets that are blaring from various points around the room
An   Meyer Davis Society Jazz
Jackie and George hesitate
Pope and Jill are behind them
Pope jostles George as he stops, abruptly
George looks around
Pope smiles
He's holding Jill's hand
George notices
Jill disengages her hand casually, as though it were necessary only for the walk up the stairs
Jackie nudges George, forcing him to move into the room with her as Lester comes toward them
He's stopped on his way over
Can  get you folks something
stinger, please
tomato juice
'll take a -- some white wine
And you, madam
(searching the room) Oh 'll uhh -- just a coke
The Waiter moves on and they wait for their drinks
Lester finally makes to them
George, glad you could make it, son
Hi, doll
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr
Pope
George turns to get his drink from the Waiter as do Jill and Pope
Lester takes Jackie's arm
Who are they
(quickly) Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, 've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything say
Does she know about us
Jesus, she's my best friend
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend
don't know
Why don't you ask him
'mon, Jackie, 'm only trying -- George -- He draws George aside
(') -- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight -- -- yeah
See she doesn't drink too much
Jackie has heard this last
Lester turns to her
(') See you later, doll
Jackie puts down her coke, picks up a glass of white wine from a passing tray and downs it in one gulp, putting it on another tray and picking up another glass of white wine
with cleavage carefully prominent in a strapless gown, spots George
She excuses herself from the couple she has been talking with and goes straight to the powder room
- checks herself out in the mirror, glossing her lips with a pale tint of something or other
She gives a final anxious look, then hurries out, nearly bumping into a lady coming In
she moves through the crowd up behind George, turning him around
George, darling
She kisses him full on the lips, lingering on it
(without batting an eye) Hey, baby, what's happening
Oh this is Jackie
Jackie, say hello to Felicia
It is only now that Felicia sees one of George's arms has been holding onto Jackie
(also without batting an eye) Hello, Felicia
(instantly suspicious of George) hello
Felicia looks from George to Jackie and back again
(') 'm so glad you could make it
've been looking forward to seeing you
pours his drink on the cuff of a distinguished  sitting beneath him at a table as he sees George and Felicia and Jackie clustered together
Lester, what the fuck do you think you're doing
Jesus, Nate, 'm sorry
Lester fumbles, tries to clean Nate off with a napkin
Never mind, 'll do it myself
He dips the napkin into a glass of ice water and proceeds to clean off his cuff
Nate goes back to the  monitor where Agnew is making some remarks or commentators are repeating his comment about being a household word
So far so good
Aw there's nothing to worry about
You never know
Why didn't you come alone
Lester invited you
Did you have to bring her
(looking toward Lester) Well she
She what
She's a friend of Jill's
And who's Jill
She spots Jill
Well, she's a friend of Johnny Pope's -- you know, the director
She looks at Pope who is saying something to Jill which is making her laugh
Oh
is threading his way through a crowd, holding two drinks, one of them a coca-cola
It's a little more raucous now, with election returns from the television sets creating a more festive mood
Now and then someone jumps up from a set and hugs someone so carrying drinks is a little dodgy
,
- ,
, Jackie sits alone by the bar, an unlit cigarette in her mouth
man offers her a match
She stares at the burning match as if it's obscene
She blows it out
No thanks
The man looks a little shocked, moves on
has his arm held
It's , a red-haired decorator
Excuse me,  know  know you, but can't think where
Look, 'd like to help but -- Felicia grabs George's other arm pulling him away from Kenneth
Kenneth looks a little shocked at the ferocity of Felicia's move
There you are
She tugs him with her
Wait a minute -- She takes him right into the ladies room, George still juggling the drinks
watches Felicia and George disappear into the ladies room, looking over Jill's shoulder
Jill has not seen it
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well
Well
sure
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room
Jill looks around and stares at the door
George
Was he alone
don't think so
Well did he go in there with Jackie
Pope points over to Jackie sitting at the bar drinking now
(') That bastard
George is a hairdresser, isn't he
Jill doesn't answer
- (desperate) Baby, you gotta let me out of here
Felicia kisses him
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there
let's lock the door
Holy Christ
You want to get us killed
Don't be silly
'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints
See
She pulls two joints out of her beaded bag
only a few seats from Jackie, Jackie staring daggers at him, Lester aware of it
He's talking to a pair of lacquered eminence grises
-- fellas, fellas, just listen, you both have tidelands, you both want Uncle Sam to come through with offshore drilling permits -- so do it together -- has taken an olive from an olive tray and hit Lester on the back of the head
He's finished this little dissertation
He sees the source of the missile
He grows pale, frozen
Sixty-four year old bejeweled  in b
g
So, little red riding hood says 'my what big teeth you have and the wolf says all the better to eat you with, my dear, and she says -- eat, eat, eat, doesn't anybody ever fuck any more
' Jackie has now picked up a carrot from a relish tray
George appears
Don't do it
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, 'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth -- (almost picking her up) 'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk
He takes her into the next room and Lester watches the move with a mixture of relief and concern
Jackie is now near tears
He just completely ignores me
He could have at least said something, introduced me or something
Sweetheart, you're drunk
She leans on George
Oh God, what do  want, George
Lester comes hurrying in, sweating, now
Hi, doll, what's wrong
You know what's wrong
Felicia trips coming into the small bar
Lester -- Lester straightens up like he's been shot
Oh, Felicia, there you are, you know George and uh -- uh -- He's genuinely forgotten her name
Jackie Shawn
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia
We've met
Yes
Well anyway
(to Felicia) Your hair looks -- well fabulous
That's George
It's just -- fabulous
(to George, an attempt at levity) Think you could do anything for me
(he takes it seriously) Well --  could try
Do you wash your hair every day
Isn't that bad for it
No it keeps the skin peeling
You've got to keep the follicles open
You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it
George actually touches Lester's hair, professional interest growing
(') This really ought to be layered
Layered
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out -- He starts to fluff Lester's hair a little when Johnny Pope walks in with Jill to this
Pope stares at them
think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner
Have they sat down
Everybody but us
They're waiting for you, Lester
Dinner is pretty much finished, waiters have begun picking up plates
(to Jill) guess it's almost impossible to get work in the business these days
Pope watches Sokoloff make his move
Well, commercials
read for a soap the other day
soap
daytime soap opera
And
was too old
What was it, somebody's daughter
Somebody's mother
' is untouched
She holds up her wine glass
Waiter
George looks at her
(') One word out of you and 'll gargle with it
The waiter pours the wine
George looks to Jill, shrugs
Jill mouthes, 'try and stop her
' George mouthes back, 'are you kidding
' has been eyeing Jackie
Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn
Jackie looks at Roth
Roth shoots his cuffs and smiles
Not for rubber chicken, no
Sid Roth smiles
Jackie smiles back
(intime) Well maybe  can get you something
That's very sweet of you, Mr
Roth
Sid
Sid
You must be a very important executive
(almost a whisper) Well, whatever  am,  think  can get you whatever you'd like
You do
Yes
(same tone as Sid's) -- well, more than anything else -- (indicating George) -- 'd like to suck his cock
She points to George
George chokes on the last of a piece of chicken
Sid Roth is stunned
He doesn't know what to do
George is coughing badly
Jackie slaps his back
- Felicia is listening to Lester
The Agnew and Nixon posters are directly behind them
(to East) -- Senator, you should've seen those little kids
About forty of 'em, all blind
We put out these mattresses on the front lawn and they came running out of the house, tripping and falling all over the place, having a hell of a good time
mean they were blind of course
But it really gave you a feeling of accomplishment
tell you  never had such a good time
Felicia during the above has looked up to see Jackie fawning over George
She can't believe her eyes
Lester -- -- let me understand this was exclusively a home for blind children -- Lester -- -- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear -- Lester, don't you think that uhh -- Now Lester spots it
He's very confused
(') That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself
(angry himself) What do you expect me to do about it
just thought you'd like to know -- Why would  like to know if there's nothing  can do about it, goddammit -- Quiet
Cranston's on
They quiet down
Jackie's now moving around kissing George on the mouth
Jill is watching
Johnny Pope is fascinated
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink -- -- oh  don't know -- (arm around George's shoulders tonguing his ear) -- Just get me out of here, baby can't stand it
It's killing me
(indicating head table) -- we can't now
-- why not
'mon, take me out of here, somewhere  don't have to lie to anybody and 'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, adore you -- is watching Jackie and George with ever greater intensity, her mouth growing more and more agape
(') (plaintive) -- don't you want to -- Jackie, can we -- (a little louder) Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world
'mon -- George looks around sweating now
(very quietly) -- you are
Fuckin'  -- With that she slips right under the table
It's a surprisingly fluid move
almost simultaneously rises, knocking her chair back
sees both moves and interrupts the Senator
(') Senator, excuse me a moment -- He turns to Felicia and then looks over toward Jackie's empty chair and literally doesn't know which way to go first
He's a little like the bear in the penny arcade that is shot and keeps turning one way, then another
Finally he heads toward Jackie's vacant chair and George
his chin to the tablecloth is fishing under it for Jackie
(') Now, Jackie -- (trying for aplomb) -- she's a very compulsive girl
can see that
Lester rushes up
(a desperate smile) Hello, George
Your friend feeling a little under the weather
Jackie surfaces through the tablecloth
(to Lester) -- you phony asshole -- (as if he didn't hear it) Oh, dear that's too bad
(with quiet desperation, to George) -- get her out of here, get her out of here
cheer goes up as some late returns come in
Dirksen is talking about a new mandate for law and order and peace with honor
(') (to Sid) What was that
Illinois
(doesn't know what he's saying) -- oh, good
Lester glances back toward Felicia who is watching him
Jackie, c'mon -- George moves to Jill
(') 've got to get her out of here
-- go ahead
-- well aren't you -- -- what
(indicating Pope) -- 'll see you later
(not liking it too much) -- okay -- (pointed) -- 'll see you later
Your house
He moves away with Jackie
Lester turns back toward the main table
230SL -    - driving down Sunset Boulevard
There is a long moment of silence
The '  the Eve of Destruction
George gives Jackie a couple of sidelong glances
(finally) -- gee
-- what
(she sits up, lights a cigarette) don't know what gets into me
You were great
No,  blew it,  blew it with Lester
No you didn't
You don't think so
do
You were great
You always say that
really care for Lester, don't
George laughs
That sounds like me
am you, you little bastard
She starts to scrunch over and kiss him, then stops
(') Where do you want to go
Sammy's
He still having parties
He never stopped
- fuming
woman, , is painstakingly and painfully introducing the Senator
and so
to have this man
here
among us
who has helped
as has everyone here to bring so many people together
of all races, creeds, and colors
Rosalind droning on, b
g
She finally introduces Senator East
- Lester
Yes, sweetheart, shh
He pats her hand
She gives him a look that could kill
--  hope you like Miss Shawn -- -- what, who
Oh she's very nice, yes --  mean normally --- -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart
' Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator Joe East
Glasses are raised, a little dissonant hurrah
We cannot go into this later
That's okay too
You make me sick
Just be straight for once in your life
There are now
calls for East to do his Indian chant
: -- this tells of the ancient grandmother who, upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood, stops a moment and says, hello garden gate, hello garden gate, garden gate, hello
- (finally exasperated) -- look, Felicia, this party involves more than you and me, you know
These people are concerned about more than each other, you know
-- is that right
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not
has begun his weird chant, beating out accompaniment on a cigar box and a pewter vase
(glancing up) -- is that what this is all about
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks -- Lester, you're a miserable man
You're not helping anybody
You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself
And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference
You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him
(he turns like a shot) What are you talking about
- (she laughs) -- think what you have time to think, Lester
Lester grabs her
What are you talking about, Felicia
Suddenly there's a rumble in the room and East has stopped chanting
Several men have stepped to the center of the room
One of them in a slate suit raising both hands
Excuse me, Senator
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have to evacuate this room as quietly and quickly as possible
There's nothing to worry about
We'd like you to exit through the door here on my left
down the steps into the street, please
There are whisperings and rumblings of 'a bomb' and rejoinders to the effect that it's a hoax
Nevertheless the exodus begins and grows to bedlam
Waiters who had been fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing them down the stairs, even going over them to make the entrance
the emergency doesn't keep autograph hounds from inhibiting the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that flows onto the street
Jill and Johnny Pope are caught up in the swirl of the crowd
Pope temporarily loses Jill
He looks around
Jill taps him on the shoulder
-- here  am
Now what
Pope turns
Well -- as  see it we've got two choices
We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party
Let's do that
Lester is with some security people, trying to find out what they're doing
are several police cars, a fire truck, and the fire truck ambulance
Lights are flashing
-- have they located it
Somebody shrugs
Lester is pulled to the side
(') (looking toward driver) -- oh, sorry
Then he sees it's Felicia
She gives him the finger, and lays rubber nearly sideswiping him
What was that all about
Somebody else says 'who was that
' Lester shrugs
'  - are dancing to a tape of 'Good Vibrations
' George's coat is off, his tie loose
They are near the entryway and sitting on a large staircase b
g
a young girl can be  breast feeding her baby
George and Jackie are obviously enjoying themselves
The tape ends
George's silk shirt is clinging down the center of his back
He moves with Jackie, where she picks up a coke at the bar
black in a caftan with a huge Afro offers Jackie a joint
She takes a drags, she and George move outside the living room
As they walk she hands the joint to George who hands the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the door -- all without really losing stride
' - There's a long rolling lawn
The lights are soft coming from the living room, the  more muted
Jackie, nevertheless, is breathing rather heavily from the dancing
George is looking at her intently, too intently for her not to notice
She appears not to notice
What are you looking at
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it
She turns back to George
-- yeah
-- look, you don't have to entertain me
(a slight laugh) Am  entertaining you
We're friends
-- sure
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play
Jackie looks past George into the living room
(') -- there's a lot of players in there -- The  come up behind George, and Jackie, grabbing George
The move should be a little startling almost as if it were an attack
George
George
They grab George and spin him around, temporarily pushing Jackie
(pleasantly) Hey, what's happening
We're going to the jacuzzi
Right now
(tugging) 'mon with us -- In the jacuzzi
Sure, why not
Come on, George -- No, later, maybe -- go ahead, 'll catch up with you -- (they head off) 've got -- He turns back to Jackie to finish what he was going to say, and she's not there
Only a wisp of her cigarette smoke hangs in the air, and then it disappears
George looks surprised and disappointed
Several tall stringy types are eating out of the refrigerator, with a couple of dogs eagerly watching, others are eating hash cakes off the formica counter
sits in a corner, sipping wine out of a measuring cup
He smiles and looks up to Jackie, who has her arm on his shoulder
Strobe lights from an adjacent room can be Where the fuck you been, Jackie
London
-- no
Real good to see you, man
- So what's been going on, Red Dog
Hey, it's the same old shit, ain't it
No matter where you go, it's the same old shit
Nothing ever changes, nothing, man, nothing
(with sudden intensity) Hey -- you ever been to Cuuliacaan
George, a little hastily moves through the kitchen, spotting Jackie
He's nearly upended by a couple, tall man and woman at the refrigerator
They grab him and kiss him, and he shakes through them moving to Jackie
-- where'd you go
-- oh  thought you were -- -- what
Nothing
Hey, man, what's happening
Nothing
That's right, man
And he laughs
George silently takes Jackie's hand and they move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds in the rear of the house
- The crowd has thinned out to a trickle, but Pope's red Porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other cars
Pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone else
Lester stands, swaying a little unsteadily in the lot
The Deputy secret service man seen twice earlier, comes on up to Lester
-- we can't find a thing, Mr
Karpf
(turns to him) Can't find what
No bomb
-- oh -- well that's good, isn't it
(he's serious) It's good if there's no bomb
If there is a bomb and we can't find it, that's not good
Lester thinks this over
No of course not
(coming up to Jill) -- we're going to be here all night
-- why
-- these bastards have me hemmed in
(to Jill) -- what's the problem, honey
-- his car
They have it blocked
Oh that's no problem
(to Deputy) -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene
-- sure
Pope and Deputy go off together
-- listen,  wonder if you kids could give me a ride
'm kind of stranded here
Sure thing, Mr
Karpf
'mon
They walk toward Pope's car
The trucks are being driven off
Everything okay, son
Terrific
Now all  have to do is find my car keys
He heads back into the Bistro
Lester and Jill stand outside the Porsche
-- 'll get in the back -- -- oh no, honey, 'll do that
-- there's not much room -- That's fine -- Lester opens the car door and pulls back the seat
He has a hell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be lighthearted about it
Jill gets into the front
The door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet are poked out it
His head is pushing on the canvas top
See, nothin' to it
Jill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's upper body is almost leaning on her as it is
Lester puts his hand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position, almost nose to nose with Lester
(') What did you say your name was, sweetheart
Jill
(not moving his head) Jill
Jill can't really move her head back and Lester is obviously captivated by Jill's face
(trying to be casual) -- yes, Jill
(still holding her) Gee
that's wonderful, Jill
(very uncomfortable) Thank you
(fondling her head, moving her closer) -- just wonderful
is heading back to his car
He stops when he sees Lester's feet hanging out the door
(') (another irritant) Oh, no shit
Pope gets into the car
(') Hi, what are we doing
Lester falls back and hits the isinglass rear window
Pope notices
Oh, Johnny, Mr
Karpf needed a ride home and  said we'd take him
Do you mind
(furious) Of course not
Call me Les
Where to, Les
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink
Jill and Johnny Pope exchange glances
Jill shrugs to say, gee 'm sorry
Pope nods
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party
Well
that's wonderful -- 'll stop by there for a drink
Pope is furious
He starts the car, backs it up quickly, jostling Lester around as he goes
Lester chuckles
-    - lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool
The house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges and all sorts of random shrubbery
Jackie and George watch the Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a couple of androgenous men
The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi, arm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another end of the jacuzzi
Jackie smiles
She stretches, yawns
(lazily) -- very nice, very nice
(yes) -- mmm -- pause
She glances at George scarcely moving her head
-- but you never were much of a tit man -- Mmmm -- -- ass and legs -- Look who's talking
Me
-- yes, you -- Well of course
Who loves a big fanny on a man
Not me, pal
Jackie laughs
The Twins have gotten onto some sort of splashing contest with the boys
Water hits George and Jackie
They're hit again
They shrug, George rises, takes Jackie's hand
They walk on around the pool, beside and along a maze of hedgerows
' - as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property
Whose place is this
' by the open staircase
Pope is greeting Sammy
Introducing Jill
Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that goes to the knees on his levi's
Sure  know Jill
Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still sitting on the staircase, nursing her baby
She looks up, smiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his eyes off the sight
(noticing) -- the bar's in there, Les
(embarrassed) -- oh, fine
He strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through the open foyer
where Jill and George were earlier
Lester's ordered a drink
The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke
Lester stares at it dumbly
(a little lamely, indicating drink) 'm
He takes his drink and half toasts the black
He stops and his eyes  the room
Lester is virtually the only person on his feet
Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep sofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely moving
In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke from the joints
- Lester shakes his head as if to clear it
He takes a drink and almost on cue the     and the strobe lights go on
Lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do with his drink
He manages to stagger out of the strobe light effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room
- , Jill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his measuring cup of wine still half filled
-- so what's new, Red Dog
Nothing, man
Same old shit
It's the same old shit wherever you go, nothing ever changes
Pope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door
Jill, scraves is a -- He points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like he's about to enter
Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had taken earlier
peers into the kitchen
It's filled mostly with unkempt beards
He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and continues up it until he finds himself in a den
Several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and watching television
They seem a shade better dressed than those in the kitchen
Lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of it
He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a pipe
(whispering) -- how's it going
(quietly) -- just fine
(squinting to see) -- is that Illinois
(taking a good look at Lester, then) No, that's Sally
Lester looks at the screen
Sally, handled by bare arms, is being placed on a foam rubber cushion
She laughs
(dumbly) -- Sally
(pointing with his pipe stem to a girl by Lester's ear, also watching the set) -- Sally
Lester looks at Sally
She looks at Lester, nods
Turns back to screen to watch herself
Lester turns from Sally to see a television camera and the foam rubber mattress, now abandoned
Lester shakes his head
They're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the pool
One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi
-- so when are you going to Egypt
You mean when are you going to Egypt
Jill laughs
She turns and shakes her finger at Pope
Now  didn't mean that, you rat
Two weeks from tomorrow
You're going
You're going
Jill stops cold
She turns to Pope
You're kidding
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes
(laughing) Johnny
(she hugs him) Why didn't you tell me before
-- just before  ask you out can't do that
Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again
There's a flash of light from the poolhouse window
Jill turns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind
to  on light from window
- George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge
He's looking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely
It opens again and he closes it again
What's wrong
-- do you want ice
Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside
-- no
George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie
Neither one of them drink
They're staring steadily at each other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis court lights which someone has turned on
(finally) -- we're kidding ourselves
(staring right back) -- we are
-- last night  dreamt  was fifty years old and Mary told me  was supposed to meet Jill at the shop
It seared me shitless
Why
can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old
can't imagine not being with you
George moves to her
Jackie is waiting for him
They kiss
It is long and lingering and deliberate
George breaks away and goes to the poolhouse door
There's no lock, only an eye latch on the screen door
He latches it, tests it
It gives slightly
Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to Jackie who stands waiting
-- but what about her
don't want to hurt Jill
George takes the coke out of her hand
She lets him
walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying
The strobe lights are going again in the living room
Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights
The vision disturbs him greatly
He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get near her
She seems to move
He moves after her through the lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as prudence allows
Finally when they reach the end of the living room she's disappeared
Then he looks out and sees her poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged path that leads down to the pool
He lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass door
have made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in sight
Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope
What's wrong
We can't really leave that poor man here alone
-- he'll never know the difference
Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going
'mon
(going along with it, protesting) 'm telling you he won't know the difference
- now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step is a possible disaster
(from Jacuzzi) Hey
Lester looks down, sees one of the Twins
Her arm is outstretched, her breasts dripping water  through the shrubbery spotlights
She's holding a joint
(') -- it's getting soggy
Lester takes it
-- just put it on the bench over there and come on in
-- in there
Sure
Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it over to the bench
He puts the joint down
Stares at it
He looks up and there's the other Twin standing beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel loosely flung over her shoulders
(meaning joint) Could  have that
Lester silently hands it to her
Stares at the pool and the other Twin isn't there
He looks back and the one who had taken the joint is gone
He looks back to the pool and the other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy in the pool
Lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost falling down as he does
Carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi
Say -- -- what is it now, man
Do you know where  can find a towel
-- the poolhouse
Holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over his boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse
He tries the door
The latch creaks
He pulls at it again and the latch pops open
He starts to open the door, then hears the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense love making
The girl is quite carried away
Lester hesitates
He listens as her sighs, interspersed with fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity
He thinks better of it
He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly closes the screen door
He starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side
He can't resist
He moves to it
He can't see anything
He moves closer
The dim, dark but classical outline of a man mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity can be
Lester watches
The  are not as loud from this angle, but gradually they can be  as the woman's cries grow louder
Lester is glued to the window
' -- there you are
Les
Les -- Les -- Les, we're leaving
The  has  to  Lester holding his pants, not taking his face away from the window
Jill and Johnny Pope stand beside him
Shhh -- (with genuine awe) -- now that's what  call fucking
Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window
As he does, a light begins to flood the room
It is the refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end table to another end table and to the refrigerator
It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of George and Jackie
who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him
His face freezes
It is harsh and determined
He turns slowly away from the window and walks past Jill without looking at her
-- what -- She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself
(') (watching) Oh my God
Oh no, oh no
Oh no
She turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it through the window, shattering the glass everywhere
(') (screaming) You son of a bitch
You bastard
George has leapt up
Honey
Where've you been
We've been looking everywhere for you
Jackie doesn't move, only stares wide-eyed through the broken window at the screaming Jill
(softly) Oh God
An ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the wall, and Jill can be  now storming off with Pope
George, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far window, pulls it open
Jill
Jill
Jill, goddammit
He's got the pants on backwards
He turns back to Jackie who has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose into a purse
(') -- Jesus -- -- well you better go after her
He bends down, turns his pants around, and is hopping into them
-- shit
(he grabs his shirt) wait here, honey -- He runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi and into the maze of hedgerows
The Twins stand motionless side by side in the water
George
(to Twin Two) Who was that
Far out
George, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill
He can't find her
He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy covered wall
He can't reach the top
He moves along the wall
arrives at a wrought iron gate
It's locked
He peers through the gate calling frantically: Jill, honey
Inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare teeth of a huge German Sheperd  at him viciously
George chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the house
He trips and falls
George running through the strobe-lit party to the foyer
He's bare-footed, but his pants are on
His frilly shirt is unbuttoned
- breathing heavily, spots Red Dog
Hey, Red Dog
You seen Jill
She just went out the door, man
George charges out the door in time to see the red Porsche's taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it purrs off into the night
George turns and runs back into the house and through the strobe-lighting living room
George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse
The refrigerator door still hangs open
Window glass is scattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his foot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard
Jackie's gone
Jackie
He opens the poolhouse bathroom door
(') Jackie
He runs back out the door of the poolhouse
Jackie
She went up to the house, George
You're a trip and a half, man
George runs through the living room again and the strobe lights
Again he reaches the foyer
Red Dog is still there
George is heaving deeply now
Hey
you seen
Jackie
(pointing) -- out the door, man
charges out the door, this time seeing Jackie's 230SL pulling away, tires screeching
(shouting) Jackie
He looks down defeated
His foot is bleeding on the pavement
- George on his motorbike,  by a few bars of Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth,' has thrown on a peacoat but kept on his velvet trousers
He's riding up what should now be a familiar road to Jill's
The lights from the city below flash in and out of view
'  - pulls in
Her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the oil slick stares at him
There's the  of a  coming down the road
He looks up expectantly
As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed at his feet
George turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door
He pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside
' -  - (swaying in) Jill
Jill
Jill
He looks in bedroom, then moves back to the phone and dials
It rings three times
' Jackie Shawn
-- yeah, this is -- ' -- yes, George
guess you haven't heard from her yet
' Not yet
Okay
thanks
He hangs up
Stares around the room
Jill's apartment is, as usual, good-little-girl tidy
( contrast with Jackie's particularly kitchen
) George walks over to the window and look's at the city
He walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair
: There is the  of a
George opens his eyes
Above him is the carport and Jill's yellow Mustang has just pulled in
George rises
He walks into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the kitchen, carrying the paper
The kitchen clock reads 4:44
George glances at it
Then back at Jill
She looks at him, frightened but not moving
Her hair is stringy and she's got no makeup on
There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of which George will note in the course of the scene
George looks her up and down
don't want to fight, George
don't want to fight either
Look
uh --  love you
Bullshit
(moving to her, taking her arm) do, Jill
At this point he notes the arm bruise
Jill stares back at him unflinching
George smiles
(') How come you took your own car
(getting a cigarette) didn't want him meeting me here
Well that's something
What is
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight
Jill doesn't answer
She walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe over it
(') You did fuck him, didn't you
'm very tired, George
Jill goes into the living room
George grabs her arm again
Didn't you, baby
Let go of me
George doesn't
(') Let go of me or 'll scream, 'll call the police
Oh, Christ
He lets go of her
The
Jill answers it
Her tone alters appreciably
Oh, hi
listen, can  call you back
Yes
no, everything's fine, really
bye
She hangs up
That was him
Yes
You told him  was here and he wanted to know if  was beating you up
Jill smiles thinly
Yes
Well, did you get a job out of it at least
'd like you to leave now
George doesn't move
Jill goes over and fishes into a tote bag by the wall
She returns with Felicia's missing earring
(') -- and take this with you
Where did this come from
Who knows, 'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any,  found it in your bed
George nods
Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is beginning to surface now
Tears start welling in her eyes
(') (unsteadily) So who else was there besides Jackie
Huh
huh
Baby, don't do this
do love you
Obviously there were others, weren't there
George stares at Jill
Then: Obviously
How many
What do you wanna know for
just want to know, that's all
What difference does it make
just want to know while we were seeing each other
just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing
Jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable
George moves to her and tries to put his arms around her
Baby, please don't
love you
(breaking away) don't want to be a fool want to look them in the eye and say,  know
(she's backing up, he's trying to touch her) Baby, don't do this -- (fighting for control) -- it'll help me if you'll tell me
-- please, baby -- -- no, it'll help me, really -- How
'll know you've lied to me
all along
'll know you're incapable of
love
that'll help me
not now, but eventually
It's been rising in him the last few exchanges
Now all George's restraints seem to leave him
He stops trying to touch her and stands his ground, exploding: You dumb cunt, everybody fucks everybody, grow up, for Christ's sakes
You're an antique, you know that
Look around you -- all of 'em, all these chicks they're all fucking, they're getting their hair done so they can go and fuck, that's what it's all about
Come into the shop tomorrow and 'll show you --  fucked her, and her, and her, and her, and her -- fucked 'em all
That's what do,  fuck
That's why  went to beauty school, to fuck
can't help that, they're there and  do their hair and sometimes  fuck 'em
stick it in and  pull it out and that's a fuck, it's not a crime
George leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not even bothering to look at Jill
Jill has been pulled together a little more by the speech
well 'm glad you told me
(his eyes closed) Jesus
His tone has indicated disbelief and disgust
am
mean, you know, that's
She can't finish It
What
What
What
What
What
honest
At least you're honest with me
Does it make you happy
Jill doesn't answer
wish you'd go now
That's all you've got to say
-- yes
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me
George
Did you
Please
that's not like you
Yeah,  know
Did you
George, now cut this out
Did you
Stop it
Did you
Yes, yes,  did
What did you say
George, if you keep this up 'm going to scream
What did you say
George
What did you say
said you were a loser
She starts to cry again
George smiles
No, 'm not a loser, baby,  just sort of break even
George turns and walks up the stairs and out the door
' George shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the living room
' George finds himself facing Lester and two other  who look like hoods
Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other night
Before him is a bottle of  & , a paper bucket filled with melting ice
The other men rise when George walks into the room
Lester, glass in hand, stares silently at George
(to the other two) Wait outside, would you
The two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side, coming very close
Both of them are much bigger than George
They stare through George as they pass him
George continues to stand there
Lester, drinking, continues to stare
Lester glances idly around the living room
Then back to George
(') You live like a pig
Yeah
(Lester doesn't answer) How long have you been here
(looking it) All night
Well
who are those guys
What do they look like
Look, Lester
are you unhappy with me about something
Yeah, 'm unhappy with you about something
Well, what
Godammit, George
Now wait a minute
Sit down
But
said sit down
One of the men opens the door and peers through the screen
Everything all right
'll call you, it's okay
George site down
Lester has risen to his feet, a little unsteadily
(') Now, George,  want to hear it from you
Either you admit it, man to man, to my face or 'll have him pound it out of you, and he does a hell of a job, believe me
George nods
believe you
Lester waits, standing over George
wanna hear about it
Oh Jesus Christ
Lester slaps him
wanna hear about it, George
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay
'm too tired to lie, 'm too tired to tell the truth
'm too tired for anything
wanna hear about it
What can  say
wanna know your thinking,  wanna know how someone like you thinks
Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me
Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them
Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment
'm not anti-Establishment
That's got nothing to do with it
You're so beyond my comprehension can't even discuss it with you
Then don't
just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do
No, not yet, not yet
You worry about it for a while, 've been worrying all night, now you can worry
pause
Lester freshens his drink
(') Was it me, did you have something against me
What, do you think  planned it
Did they have something against me
Didn't they tell you
wanna hear it from you
(agonized) how am  gonna tell you what they have against you
mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they
Have you ever listened to women talk, man
Have you
Well  do,  do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears
'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you
Being fucked up by some guy
That's all that's on their minds
'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it
All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em
They fucking hate us
Don't you know that
Lester has listened to this with some alteration of his intensity
yes,  follow your thinking on that
We're always trying to fuck them
they know it and they like it and they don't like it
that's just how it is
look, it's got nothing to do with you, man
It just happened
Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older
her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to meetings
Do you think Lorna hates her don't think she hates her
mean she may resent her a little
Oh, are you kidding, man
She hates her
Why, why do you think that is
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should know
Well,  don't know
pause
Lester goes to pour himself another drink
(') (to George) Want a drink
No thanks
Have a drink
Okay, thanks
Lester gets up and goes to the kitchen
You don't have a clean glass in the house
know
(talking to himself) 'll have to wash one out
He turns on the faucet in the kitchen
He brings the glass
(') Jesus, what a way to live
never lived like this, not even when was your age, not even when  never had a dime
George takes the drink
Lester just shakes his head
(') Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all  can say
Who
Me
Hey, you were never going to give me the money
(after a moment) was gonna give you the money
Probably  was
Shit,  don't know, don't know anything anymore
Lester sits and stares into his drink
(') tell you, you never know
you just never know
one minute you're here and the next
mean a man at my age, how long have got -- ten years
Five years wish  knew
what  was living for
George looks at him
(') You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are
don't know, what's the point of having it all
Look at me
don't have a goddam thing
the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson
Oh yeah
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something
What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks wouldn't let 'em run my business, can tell you that much
Not if had any choice in the matter
(after a moment) don't know what to do with you don't know,  don't know what's right or wrong anymore
don't either, Lester,  swear to you  don't
(suddenly) What about Jackie
What about her
mean, how did that happen
Lester, it just happened
She's nothing but a whore
No -- Just a whore,  go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off
'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore
No, man, no
You can say everybody's a whore
She's okay mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much
Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread
She's okay
Lester sits and thinks about that
You really think so
Yes  do
'm finished with her
Lester goes to the door
He turns as if he'd just thought of something
(') Oh, by the way,  think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap
What
Yeah, the clap
That's what she thinks
But who knows --  don't know
George nods
Lester shakes his head
(') don't know anything anymore
He opens the door and goes out
The two hoods are standing there
They look to Lester
(') (to hoods) Go easy on him, he's a nice boy
George looks shocked
Lester laughs, gives George a playful punch
(') Just having a little fun, George
(to hoods) Go on home
(to George) 'll call you later about the shop
'm beat
God, 'm beat
With that, Lester's off
-  - pulls up
He goes into the shop
- Norman is by the front desk
You're late, George
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you
And if you don't reach her, keep trying
(on desk) Mrs
Shumann and Mrs
Young are waiting
Mrs
Young is kind of p
o
'd
George nods
Where's Mary
She hasn't showed up yet
(grumbling something under his breath, then:) Norman
(to Devra) Devra,  asked you to call Jackie
Call her
(perturbed) All right
Norman from upstairs shouts down
What
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs
Young
Mary's not here
You do it
(he's had about enough) Look, Norman, 'm not the shampoo girl
You are today
George starts to say something but he's tired
He goes to his corner, slams his jacket down
Temper, temper, George
George fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses, knocks over one where the top was not on, and the shampoo spills all over the table top and starts to drip on the floor
Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary- He starts to look for a rag and sees that Mary, wearing a cloth coat is coming into the shop
(') Mary
Get over here
Mary moves very slowly, George waits, hands on hips
It should almost be a little faggy, his petulance as if, inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him
(') Mary, where were you yesterday
Huh
Mary doesn't answer
(') You ran out on me and you left it like a goddamn pig pen
Mary's swaying
(') What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk
Look, 've had a rough night, one of the roughest 've ever had, now 'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong
Are you sick
Are you drunk
Can you work
Otis is dead
-- Otis
She points to his picture on the wall
My son Otis
He was killed in Vietnam
They done phoned me at the shop yesterday
It's suddenly very quiet
The  of the on the floor can be
Oh, Mary
Mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on George's shoulder
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George
you know better
-- oh -- sweetheart
-- you shouldn't do me like that
(hugging her) -- please, please forgive me
(crying) -- you know better
(after a moment) -- why did you come in today
-- left my bag, didn't have no money
-- how did you get here
-- took a bus
-- c'mon, 'll get you home
-  - on his cycle drives up Bowmont into Jackie's driveway
Her car is there
George jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door
It's open and he barges in
He's met by Jackie's Yorkies who bark furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for attention
' -- just a minute, you're early -- Jackie comes walking out
She's carrying a large cooking spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a pantsuit
She's wearing more makeup than usual
She stops when she sees George
-- good afternoon -- -- you've got to leave
George is not prepared for this
've got to leave
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here
Why
Lester's on his way
George stares at her then walks past her into the living room
Bags are packed, a coat thrown over them
The wire kennel carrying cages for the Yorkies are beside the bags
George looks into the kitchen where Jackie's been cooking some pasta
Where are you going
Please, we'll have to talk later -- Look about last night -- (exasperated but not unkind) Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when  get back -- It's not okay,  mean we've got to talk now
Where are you going
Look -- either you leave or  leave because  don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives
just don't -- The level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty decibels
There's the  of a  outside
(') My God that's him -- George looks out the window
-- It's Malone's
That's it, then 'm leaving
With that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes out the door
George starts after her
The   comes to the door, stopping George
Cleaners
George has to fumble with Jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs contained
He does, tosses the cleaning down and races outside to his bike
he sees Jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill, winding around the curves
George guns his bike and takes off after her
- almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn
Jackie's on the curve above him
- catches up with her, pulls even to her
Pull over, pull over
He threatens to run her into the curb
She stops the car sharply and jumps out
They've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view lot' not built on
Yellow October weeds cover it and there's a huge television antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon wind
Jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk
She grabs one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down below her
Her house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck just pulling away
George comes up to her
(looking below her) You're going to kill me
No -- (turning to him, imploring) Well then what are you trying to do- want to marry you
want to take care of you and  want your children, and  want you to be my girl
That's all  want
That's all want out of my life, and it's a lot
She stares at him in disbelief
She actually clutches her stomach
(') Look,  don't know if 'll ever make it
mean 'm a fuckup, but 'll take care of you, 'll make you happy,  swear to God  will
Jackie doesn't answer
She slowly sinks to the ground
George sinks beside her
Her eyes are wet
(') Jackie
Jackie
answer me, for God's sake, answer me
If you knew how many times  wanted to hear you say that
So 'm saying it
It's too late
What's too late about it
Look, we're not dead, are we
That's the only thing that's too late
Lester's left Felicia
He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight
He's asked me to marry him
So what
You don't love him, do you
Answer me
What's that supposed to mean
don't know
Jackie
What
George now is very near tears himself
What he says now he has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he holds
don't trust
anyone
but you
George lets his head fall on her shoulder
She's kneeling, supported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly on her shoulder
She has her arm around him
Oh my baby
As she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's silver Rolls pulls up
Lester gets out of the car, goes to the front door
(') God, there's Lester
Don't go, Jackie
can't just let him stand by the door
Don't leave me
've got to
've got to tell him where  am
What for
don't know -- 've got to
She gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes back down the hill
George sits under the television aerial and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing Finally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth
She hurries to him
He taxes her by the shoulders
They talk for a moment
The discussion looks like Jackie is giving Lester directions
She glances uneasily up toward George
George is watching them
He sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist
They're going through the front door
