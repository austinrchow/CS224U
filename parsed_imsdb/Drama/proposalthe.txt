Written by Pete Chiarelli June 16, 2006 : '  - The sun peeks over the horizon
There's a stunning view of Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't watching
As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady , , echoes through the apartment
Eventually, we see (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The
" on Tivo, and reading a manuscript
She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero
As she hits a button to stop the treadmill
'  - hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure out where he is
There are multiple framed pictures of the same model on the walls
Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is 6:16
Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over
Where are my clothes
blob beneath the sheets next to him answers
is the model on the walls and is really, really hot
In the kitchen
think
Can  make you some coffee
Sorry,  gotta go
'm late
Richard hurries to the kitchen
Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle
Shoes in the sink
He finds his pants on the floor and puts them on
(cont'd) Have you seen my belt
Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard
In here
She unties the complicated knot
Richard comes back half dressed
He swallows a little throwup
Baby,  just can't do this anymore

'  - Margaret puts on a black suit jacket
Definitely not off the rack
She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves off
'  - Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly gets dressed as he talks
You're just too much for me
And 'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job
Fine
Whatever
Just go
Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone
Let's not end it like that
It's been an amazing three and a half weeks
Thank you
And you should know that you have the nicest ass 've ever been with
() You mean it
do
It's magnificent
work really hard on it
know you do
Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body
Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles
(cont'd) really gotta go
'  - Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while standing and reading a manuscript
Her eyes remain glued to her reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher
Her apartment is very quiet
- cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the street
His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch
3
'  - The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit and the  (60)
Before Margaret gets to the door, her She checks the caller  and excitedly points at her phone as she lets it ring
(to phone) knew you would call
Now come on, tell me what  want to hear
Give it to me
You have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you
You should get paid extra for being so darn funny
Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out the door
(cont'd) This is Margaret
- Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks
-  - Two coffees lie in wait for Richard
, a lovely Barista, smiles as he hurries to the counter
You're running late today
Jillian, you are the best
If you think 'm good at this, you should use that coffee cup sometime
As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie
See ya tomorrow
-  - The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close
4
Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors
Inside the packed elevator, Richard's - look sleepy
One particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard
- #1 How long is she gonna make us come in by seven
She doesn't exactly consult with me on these things
- #1 Well this sucks ass
Welcome to my nightmare
The doors close as
- Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone
You've been thinking about our talk because 'm right
Everyone does publicity
Roth, McCourt, Russo
Hell, Chabon practically whores himself
Know what they have in common
Pulitzer
(off answer) Yes,  know you haven't done it in twenty years, but that's how long it's been since you've written a book this good
- Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading 6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing
"   He hauls ass through a sea of cubicles
Along the way, grumpy employees begrudgingly nod their good mornings
At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on without looking in the mirror
Noticing his wrinkled suit, he pulls out a   out of the same drawer, sprays it all over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky cowlick
Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office
- Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking
Employees avoid her and pile into the elevator
5
'm not pushing so you'll sell more books, 'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature
Do the publicity
Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes
" (cont'd) You're making the right decision
Great news
Going into an elevator, think 'm going to lose you
Margaret hangs up
Never give them a chance to change their mind
'  - Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on
He picks up papers strewn about the room
He goes back to the computer, and opens computer programs
-  - Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic
Good morning
Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod
- Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff, who all look busy on the phone
When she turns the corner, they stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up
'  - Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out clock above the door reads 7:00
The paper clears the printer and Richard grabs it quickly
- Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other
Her office looks perfect
You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign
Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight, () 6
(cont'd) (big news) got Frank to do publicity
Nice job
When  want your praise, 'll ask for it
Is Bob here
'm sure
You want him on the phone
We're going to his office
Grab your pad
Richard calmly backs out of the office
'  - but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed to Bob's office
" - As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes their imaginary conversations
'  - Margaret comes out to Richard's desk
She notices his coffee cup with Jillian's number on it
She takes special notice of the hearts that dot the "'s" in Jillian
That's cute
You gonna call her today
What
Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she nods at the cup
He's embarrassed
Are you bored here
Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day
Uh
You have another late night out
7
Margaret starts walking
Richard quickly catches up, worried because he doesn't know where she's going with this
'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday
Oh
Well, it won't be wrinkled for long
You'll magically unwrinkle
Yes
You have magic pants
No
've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles
Does this work on more than just your pants
Anything that's wrinkled
Buy me some
Will do
Richard makes a note
Margaret stops to make her point
don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and  will not have your personal life affect you at work
If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, need you sharp, focused and professional
Got it
Got it
Great
Now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word
8
'  - Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with beautiful antiques and first edition books
But unlike Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner
Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door
(42) wears a prim bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of superiority
Hey, Bob
Ah
Our fearless leader and her liege
Margaret smiles
'm lettin' you go, Bob
Pardon
You're fired
What
What are you talking about
This isn't working out
You can't
asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity
You said it was impossible
It is
He doesn't do publicity
just talked to him
He's in
But
No more buts, Bob
've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball
You didn't even call to ask him
9
All you had to do to was pick up the phone
That's it
Now 'll give you two months to find a new job, and then you can say you resigned
won't tell a soul, my lips are sealed
Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door
- Margaret and Richard walk a few steps
Margaret looks straight ahead and whispers to Richard
What's he doing
Richard turns around and takes a peek
Bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door
He's up and about to pop
Oh Bob, don't do it
'
The office stops
This is going to be good
Margaret turns around with a disappointed look on her face
She's deadly calm
What are you doing
gave you a civilized way out of this
This is because 'm your competition
Because  threaten you
Oh, Bob
You could never threaten me
'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent
'm firing you because you don't work hard
So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk
Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass
Are we perfectly clear
Bob nods
(cont'd) Good
Now 've got work to do, so if you'll 10
Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones
(cont'd) We need to call his authors and explain what happened
And get Frank's publicity schedule figured out pronto
No problem
'll just cancel my trip this weekend
gave you the weekend off
It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday
But no big deal
You were right before, need to stay focused
Professional
'  - Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come home this weekend
He sounds like an annoyed teenager
Well tell gammy that 'm sorry
(waiting to speak) Mom, she's making me work this weekend
It's not like  volunteered
(waiting to speak) 'm sure dad is pissed
Margaret comes to Richard's desk
He tries to wrap it up
(cont'd) have to go
Yeah
No, 'm not going to do that
No
Sorta
Mom
No
Bye
Richard hangs up the phone
(cont'd) Sorry about that
Damage control
She tell you to quit
No
No
(off Margaret's look) Um
Yes
But as 've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is
Richard's phone rings and he picks it up
11
(cont'd) Your 10:55 is here
Mr
Gilbertson
Who is this guy
He said you knew each other
You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting
We rescheduled on him four times
Go get him
But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do
Margaret leaves and goes into her office
(to himself) 'll charge up the cattle prod
'  - Margaret reads as
(48) sits down
He's an intense man in a bad suit
He sits in silence until Margaret looks up
Margaret
Good to see you
know how busy you are
Congrats on the promotion
Read about it in -
Yeah
Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they
Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already
Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up
(cont'd) Have to admit,  can't place where we know each other from
Gilbertson smiles
He didn't expect her to remember
Three years ago
We worked together
Don't have it
Remember "Dandelion's Desire
" Margaret gets excited
12
Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me
That book is legend
Without a doubt the worst ever written
You think
It was a fever dream
900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability
The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist
Oh
And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language
believe there was a glossary
Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory
Did you see the pass letter  wrote him
() "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability
Save your skills for the office newsletter, you sir, are no writer
" beat
Margaret says matter of fact
You wrote the book
did
You're Dante Dickens
One of my nom de plumes
Gilbertson paces
Margaret stays seated, at a loss
'm sorry if  hurt your feelings
You obviously were spending a lot of time writing,  just thought you should channel all that passion into something else
Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a  from his coat pocket
13
Ms
Mills, 'm with
Citizenship and Immigration Services, and 'm deporting you to Canada
Excuse me
What
This is a mistake
've lived here since 1981
'm applying for citizenship
You need citizenship now
After the big promotion
Yes
And all the papers are in
Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down
Well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States
We must protect our sovereignty
'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States
Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system
(as if he doesn't know) Will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the
for the next two to three years
"Affect me at work
"   'll lose my job
(mock sympathy) Ahhhh
That's a shame
Too bad we can't work something out
Margaret stops looking at her file
It all becomes clear
Oh, no
No, no, no
won't do it
Do what, Ms
Mills
14
Gilbertson smiles
She's quick
've edited it down
It's better
Well then, get it published at another house
They all just don't get me
All
Well not all
Two hundred fifty, two hundred sixty-one
Ish
'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if  publish that book
'm at the end of my rope, Ms
Mills
'm an author
Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brother's garage
You're the last stop, and 'm desperate
will never publish your book
Ever
There's no need to make this difficult don't turn in your file until Monday
This is blackmail
'll go to your boss
've spent two years preparing for this day
Don't you think 've thought of that
Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on
Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting
Excuse me, Ms
Mills, risk management needs you right away
The sight of Richard inspires Margaret
She turns to Gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face
15
Know what, Dante
'm not going anywhere
We're getting married
Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about
Who's getting married
We are
You and him
Stop playing around, honey
Margaret is all smiles
Richard is very confused
(cont'd) Mr
Gilbertson is from the
told him about us
About us getting married
You are marrying your male secretary
Assistant
You are marrying your male assistant
(matter of fact) We're in love
We tried to fight it
When it's right, it's right
And this has nothing to do with my visit here today
Nope
True love
Got it bad
(to Richard) You
Is this true
Are you marrying this
woman
Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand
Of course we are
16
Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer
Margaret squeezes Richard's hand hard
Uh-huh
Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm around her
Richard is truly afraid
(cont'd) (more of a question) 'm, uh, marrying my boss
Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that she's ready for a kiss
The two slowly begin to come together
Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head
Five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine
What
If  prove you're lying, you go to federal prison for five years
Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes
(cont'd) (to Richard) You
Do you know what you're getting yourself into
We're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other
Do you even know her favorite color
Richard doesn't answer
Margaret encourages him on with a thinly veiled threat
'mon
Answer
You don't have a choice
Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents
Plum
You mean purple
No
Plum is "smokier" than purple
17
Favorite flower
Tulips
But only when they're in season
Childhood pet name
Miss Mittens
Are we done here
Who knows you're getting married
Margaret interrupts
No one
With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew
Have you at least told your family
() My parents are dead
How convenient
So you're not telling anyone that you are getting married
Nope
Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad
Pathetic
Four questions and 've got enough to send you to prison
We're telling his family this weekend
We are
Yes
We are
We're surprising them
(trying to remember) at his Grandma's 90th birthday party
18
And where's that going to be
(no idea) At Richard's parent's house
And where's that located
(still no idea) In his hometown
Sitka
Is that on Long Island
Only Richard has the answer
Margaret tries to cover
Why don't you tell him
Alaska
You're going to Alaska this weekend
(Alaska
) Yes
Of course we're going to Alaska
That's where Richard is from
Gilbertson begins to walk around
He's getting worked up
You think you can beat me with this - story
Forcing your secretary
Assistant
assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend
'm sorry, Dante
Did you not prepare for that
Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence
19
Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his appointment book and writes down some information
The  will see you both in ten days for your official interview
Your stories better match up on every account
Mr
Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her the piece of paper
(cont'd) Cross all your 's and dot your 's with this ruse, Ms
Mills
There are no "'s" or "'s" in "Love" Mr
Gilbertson
Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard
Margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work
(cont'd) Why are you from Alaska
Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient
So here's what's going to happen
We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this interview
Richard doesn't react
Margaret doesn't notice
(cont'd) So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone
Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face
(cont'd) But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold
Margaret holds out her coffee cup
Richard doesn't move
(cont'd) Hello
Richard
Richard
Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left
quit
Richard leaves Margaret's office
She still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand
20
- Richard powers through the office
Co-workers take notice that Margaret is following him
Richard, come back here
Margaret tries not to make a scene
(cont'd) Richard
Richard
Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception
(cont'd) Come back to the office
Richard can't take it
He gets up in Margaret's face
You shut up
You just lost your " get to tell Richard what to do" privileges
Well, we need to talk
You want to talk with me
Fine
Grab your broom and let's go
Margaret is dumbstruck
The receptionist is shocked
The elevator arrives and Richard gets in
Margaret follows
As the doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist
(cont'd) Watch my phones
- Richard and Margaret walk in silence through the park
Richard finally speaks
Your plan is psychotic
Well 'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time
Sometimes you need to sack up
Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice
You wanna be an editor
You need to make 21
Fine
Then if we "make this happen"
You're promoting me to editor
'm doing what
We go to Alaska and lie to my family risk going to jail
Well, you're making me editor for that
mean, did you think 'd do this out of the kindness of my heart
You work for me
You know, during my employee orientation, the  rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you
Look,  came to this town alone and with nothing
've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time
No way
Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that sounds like your problem
Not mine
Margaret is stuck
Richard really does have the upper hand
Fine
You take me to Alaska this weekend, and 'll make you editor
Deal
Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it
(cont'd) And 'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel
Do they even have hotels in Alaska
No
But they have huts
Teepees really
And you have to poop in a bucket
But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons
But with bears
- commercial jet   and leaves New York City behind
22
- Richard and Margaret sit in First Class and work on their lap tops
Richard looks up
Um
Shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents
Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question
Are you done with the press release
Almost
() Well let's finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk
Okay
Dejected, Richard goes back to work
- As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and talks on the phone
Still the assistant, Richard lags behind, weighed down by both their bags
Up ahead at the gate, a   (Female, 50's) final boarding to Sitka
Margaret gets off her phone
So what do  need to know up there
Bullet points
told a em we've been dating for six months
We've kept it a secret from everyone
(under his breath) and that you're a naughty minx in the sack
Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate
Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor
() Don't make me hate you
Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes through
The attendant gives Richard a look
Bringing her home to meet my folks
She's 23
Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass
The impatient attendant is getting frustrated
(cont'd) 've got it here
Sorry
Guess 'm a little flustered too
Haven't been home for awhile, hope they like her
The gate attendant smiles
(heard it all) don't care, sir
Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over
then
You're a sweet lady
Thanks
Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors
- Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed who is
She notices the title and he catches her stare
Margaret explains
'm sorry,  hate it when people stare at what 'm reading
It's just
worked on that book
You wrote it
Edited it
It was one of my favorites
Well you did a good job
It's great
You don't see many guys with that book
You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines
My ex-girlfriend gave it to me
travel a lot for work
'll read anything
() Ex-girlfriend, huh
24
(smiling, embarrassed) , you got me
'm a closet romantic
But let's keep that between us
Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion
Just then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags
There you are
Give me my lap top
Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag
(re: book) Hey, he's reading
know, Richard
Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment
The Handsome Man turns to Margaret
Did you two want to sit together
Sit together with who
The Handsome man nods at Richard
Your boyfriend
Margaret points to Richard indignantly
You mean him
The Handsome man nods
Margaret tries to set the record straight
(cont'd) No
No
No
He's my assistant
You're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska
Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer
Oh, you can tell him the truth
Well, he's
indispensable
25
The Handsome man isn't buying it
(cont'd) And gay
Takes care of me everywhere  go
Call him my queen mother
Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother
Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look
He has to go along
That's me
Richard turns to close the overhead compartment
You're awfully nice to fly him first class
Margaret nods her head and agrees
It sucks to be Richard
- We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska
Sitka is an island the size of Maui
Only an eight mile stretch of coast is inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness
At the center of the island is a mountain with smaller hills around it
The coast is dotted with fishing boats
Gorgeous
- Margaret and the Handsome Man chat like old friends while they walk off the plane
Richard follows with all the bags
As they all walk out of the jetway they see
-  - big banner that reads:
with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from New York to Sitka
The banner is being held up by a group of 30 with excited looks on their faces
Richard's mom  (60) is front and center
She's a sweet lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he left the house
(89) also waits
She's lived a long time and doesn't have a lot of time to screw around
When they see Richard, they
Margaret's face drops
There he is
Where's Margaret
Richard blanches white
Margaret looks back with eyes that say "What the hell is going on
" 26
(noting banner) That's sweet
Richard goes over to the group
Margaret keeps walking
What are you guys doing here
What's with the sign
So you're "just dating," huh
can't believe you didn't tell us
Didn't tell you what
We're not saying anything until you let us meet Margaret
Now, where's our girl
Richard looks around
Margaret keeps her head down and tries to avoid eye contact
Uh
Margaret
You need to come over here
Like now
Honey
The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for Margaret to come over
Margaret winces
have to go now
(putting it together) What kind of sick shit is this
Margaret nods
This would be a tough one to explain
Have a great life
Margaret walks toward the group
Richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for Margaret to hold it
At the last second, she takes it
Everyone, this is Margaret
It's nice to meet you
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady
We've heard it both ways
Everyone laughs
27
Annnie
It's not like he hasn't told her that he used to call her the Dragon Lady
They're getting married
(real "casual") Now, ah, where did you hear that
The whole "getting married" thing
Oh, that man from the government
Gilber- something
Said he was checking up on you two
Said it was technicality, because Margaret was from Canada
What, ah, did you tell him
Well for one thing, that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married
No
Really
What did you say
Just that you were coming up here this weekend
That we hadn't seen you in a while, and that we'd heard about Margaret for years, but that we'd never met her
Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands
(' (cont'd) The way that Richard talked about you
'll admit,  didn't see this coming
Me neither
Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the exit
Everyone else follows her lead
So why all the silly secrecy
It wasn't a secret
We didn't tell anyone
28
Well, is your family just anyone
No,  didn't mean
should be mad at you two
But, but
'm just so excited
(re: group) Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel
Oh, we cancelled your reservation
You're part of the family now
Family doesn't stay at a hotel
Also, we've got another little surprise for you two
Surprise
Another surprise
She's not good with surprises
'm really not good with surprises
-  - Debbie stops
Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone
Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other
Well you two
you're getting married this weekend
What
What
(cont'd) The whole kit and caboodle
Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you talking about
" When Gilber-something told us you were getting married
29
God rest their souls
or friends
we decided to give you a wedding
Engagement party tonight
and the wedding tomorrow at midnight
Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks
Are you witches
Just quaint
During the solstice it's good luck
It's an Alaskan thing
We've planned everything
Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher
'm old, Margaret
don't have much time left
Richard lives so far away, and never see him
Now  find out he's getting married, and  have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day
It's a dream come true for me
dream come true
Please let me see Richard get married before  die
Please
Long beat
Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say
Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say
Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get out
two big thumbs up
The crowd cheers
- procession of cars makes its way through town
- Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles
Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible in the backseat of the extended cab
30
Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out the window
Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps
He gives Margaret a "what did you do that for" look
() The Dragon Lady
Richard shrugs
To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday
Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding
Margaret stares at Richard
'm a lucky woman
Margaret does her best to smile
- The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small dock
Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the ocean
Margaret is confused
'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going
Come on, it'll be
promise
Richard points to a small island about a mile away
- Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht
Lots of polished wood and chrome
Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is festive
Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene
Who are you people
Richard lets Margaret wonder
- The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate
It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be
Richard's father,  (60) waits on the dock
He is a bear 31
So you must be Margaret
We've heard a lot about you
All of it bad
Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical sling backs
(cont'd) mean,  almost shit myself when  heard he was marrying the devil woman
thought it was the dragon lady
Either way
Hey dad
Richard shakes his father's hand
It's a little stiff
Welcome home
Good to see a ya
You too
Been a while
Yeah
You'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion
Grandma Annie interrupts
Help him with the bags Geoffrey
(to Richard and Margaret) Let's get you two settled
As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots Geoffrey a look that says "be nice"
- The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor
Somehow, it makes bear heads and deer antlers look good
Everything is first class
Margaret is a little awe struck
We'll show you around later
Uh huh
32
Out of nowhere, a small   startles Margaret and jumps on her
Balzac
Down
No
Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the kitchen
Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small talk
What a great name
Balzac's "Lost Illusions" is one of my favorite novels
Oh
Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis
Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to illustrate how Balzac really got his name
Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks away
Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel
(cont'd) No one on the island wanted him when he was born
We figured he deserved a home
And don't let him outside, or the eagles will snatch him
'mon dad
mean it
They come out of that rehabilitation center mean
And hungry
Don't listen to him, Margaret
- Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret
You'll be sleeping here
'  -  - The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest
Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the armoire by the bed
Just let me know if you 33
Thank you
Where's Richard's room
Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago
And don't worry, 'm under no illusion that you two haven't slept in the same bed before
Richard can sleep here too
Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie
It was her idea
Anything to help get her a great grandchild
Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother
Great
You know, 've gotten used to his breathing at night
thought so dear
Debbie leaves and shuts the door
Margaret reverts back to her old self
'm about 15 seconds from bitch
Calm down
What is going on here
Hell if  know
You had no idea they knew about us getting married
You think 'd bring you here if  did
Well, we just gotta tell a em
Tell a em what
Tell a em the truth
About us
34
Wrong answer
No way
What do you mean no way
This is crazy
No, crazy was lying to the federal officer
Well  don't like this
Well 'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class  felony
For one second could you not be so selfish
Selfish
Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day
How is it selfish to tell the truth
Look
We're awful, awful people
In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to
everyone
We need to protect the people downstairs
We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us
Let's keep the darkside to ourselves
Margaret takes a second to make up her mind
Fine
But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me
What've  lied to you about
Why did you tell me that you were poor
never said that
Well, you never told me you were rich
When does that come up
35
don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is Richard, 'm an Alaskan titan of industry
" Well, maybe  didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew
No  wouldn't
Come on
You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen
You're totally anti- rich
'm not anti-rich
Oh yes you are
And you know what makes it worse
You have money
earned
every penny  have
Blah, blah, blah
You need new material
Hey
Watch it
You're still my assistant
You were going to promote me anyway
Sure of that
Nope
Not at all
Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror
Well, come on
If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show
- Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing
The starched wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party- goers are all dressed in flannel, -shirts and baseball hats
36
Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy hair and beards
No dress code here
Like the house, the party is first class
Ice sculptures melt, champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows with salmon and king crab
Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some , Richard's parents, and Balzac
went to Union college in upstate New York
It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of
Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink
(cont'd) (looks at glass) Lime
Be right back
Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges
Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, "What was that
" #1 How long have you been with your company
Since  graduated college
Richard comes back with the lime
Margaret takes it and doesn't say thank you
She's been there since she was nineteen
Nineteen
Wow
That's how long
Oh, who's counting
Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her
No
How many years is that
Exactly
Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look
Well, let me see
That would be sixteen or seventeen years
Exactly
37
was never good with big numbers
That makes you
thirty six now
Just turned thirty seven
Born on May 20th
'm a Taurus
Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile
(cont'd) (to Richard) need some protein
There's some salmon
Margaret shakes her head no
(cont'd) Crab
Margaret nods yes
Richard steps away to find a waiter
Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding
Keep him on a short leash, huh
Does he roll over when you whistle
Debbie hits Geoffrey
He's just being a good host
Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow
For Geoffrey's benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard
Thank you, honey
You're being so sweet
Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple
Uh, sure
Honey
#2 So you just got some big promotion
'm editor in chief, now
Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret
() 'm so proud of my girl
38
From behind them, a melodic, etherial  interrupts
(
) Editor in chief
You're marrying up, Richard
Everyone turns around to find   (26)
She is Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland
Adding insult to injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on
Gert
Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and spilling her tonic water on her shirt
He doesn't notice what he's done, and leaves Margaret
She's peeved
(cont'd) () What are you
What are you doing here
Your dad made me come
From Chicago
Gertrude laughs
The group watches these two see each for the first time in years
There is instant chemistry, and Richard has forgotten about Margaret completely
No
live here now
You what
moved back about six months ago
'm teaching second grade
At Baranof
Did your husband move up here too
Uh, no
, ah, got divorced
Oh my God
'm sorry
Me too
But hey, we're being rude,  wanna meet the bride
Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret
39
(cont'd) Hi, 'm Gertrude
But call me Gert
You're a Gertrude
family name from hell
'm sure it's been a curse
Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school
Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence
Oh Please
Ancient history
Feels like yesterday to me
(ignoring Geoffrey) So tell me everything
hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight
Not exactly
Now Richard, what  want to know is how you proposed
This grabs the group's full attention
Everyone loves to hear a story like this
Well
Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude
(cont'd) Uh, uh, um,
Yeah
How did you pop the question
Richard is a deer in the headlights
This is getting ugly
Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in
Can  tell this one, honey
40
Uh
Sure
'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday
Well, it was our six month anniversary and  was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do  see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run
Richard
So ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh
"   So there  am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux
- riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear
Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green
Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early
Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says " didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that  would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife
Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me
" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher
(cont'd) said yes
The group gives a collective "ahh"
Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand
You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud
love you Richy
love you too, Grandma
Grandma hugs the couple
Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude
So did this happen before or after the agent came sniffing around
What is wrong with you
'm sorry Margaret
Margaret doesn't miss a beat
41
Oh please
'd wonder too
Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this
When you told us at the airport it was the first time 'd heard about it
'm so embarrassed
Don't be, dear
Geoffrey's just an ass
While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says "'ve got this under control"
The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a
He takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear
Margaret Mill's phone
(off answer) One second please
Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone
(cont'd) It's our friend, Frank
Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem
Excuse me, 'll just be a second
Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard
She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside
-  - Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear
Balzac follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him
Don't be a cliche, Frank
Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds
Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him
The dog starts to get attention
She walks away, but Balzac continues barking
Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear
(cont'd) (to Balzac) Sit and be quiet
Balzac sits and pouts
Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear
42
(cont'd) fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind
Our job is to help you succeed
He wasn't doing that
Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an  soaring in circles above her and Balzac
Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass
She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone
Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off
Margaret jumps
There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle
She stays calm on the phone
(cont'd) Could you hold on just a second
With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her
The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him
Balzac looks frightened
Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up
(cont'd) () Sorry, dropped my phone
Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her
She decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house
(cont'd) Frank,  don't want to sell you on anything
But know this
This book is your legacy
Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again
She runs
(cont'd) and--think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world
Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision
My-phone is- always-on
Talk-to-you-soon
The eagle bears down on them with talons out
Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle
To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off
Margaret freaks
(cont'd) 43
Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering
(cont'd) Take the dog
Take the dog
Inside, the elegant party carries on
Where's Margaret
We need to go
Go where
It's a surprise
Girls are going into town
And the boys stay here
told you, we've planned everything
Um
She's outside
Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window
They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head
Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my Balzac
- The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the dog trying to bait it back
This is a delicious dog, Mr
Eagle
'mon, bring back the phone
Richard calls out from the house
What are you doing
The eagle took my phone
Are you drunk
Your dad was right
The eagle tried to take the dog, so  saved it, then it came back and took my phone
44
Did the dingo eat your baby, too
Frank's going to call me on that phone need it
Relax
've got your information backed up on the laptop
'll just get you a new phone and switch the number
No problem
Oh
Now come on
You're going somewhere with my mom and the girls
'm not going anywhere
You want a new phone
You're going
- The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home
But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women for an oiled, toned, and   in a tiny thong who gyrates to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker
"   On stage with the dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her Work it Hank
Is that a salmon down your pants
The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from Margaret's face
Margaret remains straight faced
Definitely not a salmon
The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel
She can't help but give and embarrassed smile
Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits
Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation
Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek
She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand
45
Ah, ah, ah
was just the warm up
Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf
What's going on
Just sit there dear
Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often, show Hank how much you appreciate his assets
And now
Ramone
The room goes silent as a middle aged  comes on to the stage
He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache
Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it
Margaret is oblivious
What's that smell
Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face
(cont'd) (belly laugh) Ahhh
Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone
After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior
You are a naughty devil
Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns, Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies
Good lord
Ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years
No one has the heart to tell him to hang it up
Want me to do it
Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret
46
-  - Snow capped mountains watch 20  in short sleeves hit golf balls into the ocean
Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made up to look like golf greens
Golf balls are stacked in pyramid formations at every hitting area
Richard comes down from the house to join the group
Geoffrey jokes with
(60's, good natured) as they hit balls
yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water
How does she come up with this shit
She just does
stopped trying to figure out how
Geoffrey and Mr
Maguire see Richard coming their way
Mr
Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is
() 'm mad at you, son
Why's that, Mr
Maguire
You fly up here and don't call me
Sorry a bout that
What good is me owning an airline if  can't give you free tickets
You're right
Don't know what  was thinking
Damn, straight
Don't let it happen again
(hands Richard a golf club) Here, you take over
This game is for pussies, 'm getting a drink
Mr
Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with one another for the first time
Things are awkward between father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid conversation
Geoffrey finally makes small talk
47
Maguire's stepping down in January
He's, uh, handing things over to Matty
Richard gives his dad a look
He knows where this is going
That's great for them
So
How's work with you
Good
Busy
You know
do
do
Hey, did  tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan
Congratulations
We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore
We're going global
Uh-huh
Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second
He's been thinking about this moment for a long time
could really use your help
Dad
Please
'm in New York
Margaret's in New York
We have jobs
know
know
It's just
() It's just what
You're only a secretary
This pisses Richard off immediately
Again with the secretary thing
've told you, 'm an assistant
48
Just because you call yourself an "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary
Well if 'm "just a secretary", why would you want me up here anyway
Sounds like you're doing great without me
It's not like that and you know it
Then how is it
Explain it to me
Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening
Last week, a man stuck his finger up my butt
This man was a doctor
and it got me thinking about you
'm not sure this is coming out right
Just shut up for a second, okay
want you to have what  built
But 'm running out of time to show you things
Stop being so dramatic
'm not being
(takes a hard line) need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious
So this is all about what you want
That's not what  said
And me in New York with Margaret
That isn't serious
49
One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the next day she's the love of your life
How is that serious
Things change, dad
() Things change
Things change
Things change
Yes
Things change
Things change
That's your explanation
Know what  think
think you banged your boss and fell in love, that's what  think
Some sorta mommy complex
Nice, dad
We gotta have these Cosby moments more often
This is great
Richard drops his club and walks back to the house
- Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself
She's on a patio overlooking the ocean
It is late, but the sun is hanging just over the horizon
They can be a little overwhelming, but they're great people
What
'm just working on my tan
(off Gertrude's look) It's been a long day
Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging
Around the solstice they don't watch the clock
Pretty much party a til they fall over
50
actually missed it when  was in the states
Chicago, right
Yeah
Since college
And now you're back
Six months now
Call me crazy, but  love it
Think 'm back for good
Really
don't know
Don't you miss
Neimans
Starbucks
Escalators
Margaret laughs
She likes this woman
(cont'd) Yeah
miss it
Believe me, growing up never thought 'd end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school
That was always Richard's plan
For you to get divorced
(smiles, remembering) No
was going to teach, he was going to run his dad's business
He was like a little old man
Had it all worked out
Are we talking about the same guy
What do you mean
Well, Richard's such a player
Gertrude looks confused
(cont'd) mean he was a total player
Before we started dating
Six months ago
51
That surprises you
Did he ever tell you why we broke up
We don't really talk much about stuff like that
Oh
Well  should shut up
No, no
Please
mean, we are getting married
want to know these things
Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed
He proposed to me
When we were seniors
Margaret laughs
'm sorry
didn't mean to
He proposed to you in high school
He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee
It was so cute
You must have
freaked out
Oh you bet
broke up with him on the spot
would hope so
After getting rejected the first time, can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you
Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her
(cont'd) Anyway
The idea that my little old man could be a player
It's just not the Richard  knew
Good thing you're making an honest man of him again
52
Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig
She has a hard time finishing it off
(cont'd) Well 'm empty
'm going to go get another
think  hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls
'll be right in
Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean
Gertrude goes inside
Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers
(cont'd) We are awful people
- An axe slams down and splits a log in two
Hands quickly place another log down and
We pull back to find Richard playing the role of executioner
He's still mad after talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood
Rage Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world
Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht
Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves
Debbie's mood deflates when she sees Richard
() Richard
Honey
Is everything
With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear or see the girls
Annie shakes her head
Something is up
- Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch plasma television
The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step in front of the , blocking his view
Margaret watches from the door, not sure what is going on
Excuse me
'm watching that
Why is Richard chopping wood
And don't play dumb
What did you do
Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret
53
Nothing
didn't do anything
will you please move
The showdown intensifies
Margaret excuses herself
am so tired
Balzac  when he hears Margaret's voice
He's still mad
Margaret just smiles
(cont'd) Think 'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil
Thanks for a great night
Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night
Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey
He looks genuinely unnerved
Stop looking at me like that
- Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite a sweat
He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through shirt, and gets a whiff of himself
Ew
He stinks
'  - Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and shuts the door
We hear her turn on the shower
- Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great conviction
Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but doesn't notice anyone
He continues to listen to his iPod and his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the playlist "Songs  Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "'ve Been to Paradise, But  Haven't Been to Me
" '  - Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches for a towel
All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative hand towel
Shit
Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "
've been undressed by kings and 've seen some things that a woman ain't 54
Margaret's ears perk up
The bathroom is a disaster because she has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel
Richard, is that you
Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel
Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was
Richard isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting for her
How did she miss that
Richard, are you
Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles Margaret
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap
Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass
Her foot kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy
' Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on the deck attached to the room
He makes sure that no one is in the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well
Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret manages to pull herself up by the toilet
She wants a towel badly, but Balzac guards the doorway
She tries reason
'm sorry bout the eagle
But  saved you
Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily
Margaret grabs the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself
Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is open
That's weird
55
Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat, ready to strike
Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues to growl and not let her out of the bathroom
Margaret knows that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out
Then she spots the bathroom mat
Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod
Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat
Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top
Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the bathroom
With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the door behind her and
Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor
It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each other buck naked
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh
The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up rapid fire back and forth ensues
Why are you naked
Why are you wet
Don't look at me
You tackled me
It was the dog
You're blaming the dog again
Will you just hand me a towel
Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked
When he looks under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes
(cont'd) You're flashing brain
Richard quickly changes positions
Out of desperation, he pulls the entire comforter off the bed
He throws it Margaret's way, and she wraps herself in it
56
(cont'd) You can cover up any time
Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by the window
(cont'd) Explain yourself
didn't know you were home
was outside chopping wood
You didn't hear me
had my iPod on
() Why did you jump me
Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts
didn't jump you
(off Richard's look) didn't mean to jump you
didn't know you were here
You didn't see me
was running from the dog
Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously
Wait
Were you tryin' to seduce me
Oh please
Don't flatter yourself
Mmm-Hmmm
Go take a shower
You stink
Fine
But don't come sneaking in there
You're still my boss
That'd be sexual harassment
57
Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door
Margaret takes a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up again
Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his neck
He gently puts him outside their room
(cont'd) There you go, buddy
Go on and play before she makes a coat out of you
Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom
Without looking back, Richard gets the final shot
(cont'd) Puppy hater
Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find to create himself makeshift bed on the floor
Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with the sun still shining outside
She gets into her bed
'm never gonna to get to sleep
Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window
The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black
(cont'd) Oh
Well
Thanks
Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed
The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling
It was kinda weird seeing you naked
Can we not talk about this
'm just saying
It was weird
It wasn't weird
How was that not weird
Because we're
like teammates
We're like teammates
58
We are teammates
And teammates see each other naked in the locker room
All the time
It's not a big deal
Well, if we're teammates can  sleep in the bed
Good night, Richard
The two lay awake in silence for another beat
Margaret
Yes
Don't take this the wrong way
Okay
You're a very beautiful woman
Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard
Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow
-  - Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into his office
He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic oak desk
He finds a phone number with a New York City area code on a piece of paper
He dials
Yes
Mr
Gilbertson
My name is Geoffrey Paxton
Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the rest of the conversation
'  - Margaret wakes up
She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow
She stares maybe a beat too long, before there is a  on the door
Who is it
59
(
) It's me dear
made you two breakfast in bed
Can  come in
() Uh, sure
Just a second
Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up
She hits him in the head
What the
() Your mother
Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his makeshift bed
He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts his arm around Margaret
Come on in mom
Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee
(cont'd) Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls
Well, it's your special day
Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed
She is buzzing with excitement
(cont'd) You two need your energy, so eat up
We've got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then your wedding
gotta run into town to get Margaret a new phone
Will you pick up some champagne while you're there
No problem
And don't be gone for too long
Lots of work to be done
60
You don't have to go to all this trouble
Really
Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret
Don't be silly
This is the biggest day of your life
You are coming into this family, and when it's family, it's no trouble
If your parents were with us, they would do the exact same
Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes
Richard jumps out of bed and goes to the food
() Your mom is just so sweet
haven't had someone make me breakfast in bed since  was a little kid
Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll
(mouth full) wish she hadn't
mean she almost caught us
Damn, that was close
Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay attention to Margaret
You just take all this for granted
Your family, this house
Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret
(mouth full) 'm sorry, what
You gotta try these
Margaret looks at Richard with disgust
Why are you doing this to them
Huh
Why am  here
You didn't have to bring me here
You made me bring you here
You told me 61
didn't make you do anything
You could of said no
And what
Start over at the bottom again
No way
get why a not rich person would do this
But you've got everything
It doesn't make any sense
Know what
This is none of your business
wish it wasn't my business
But unfortunately, it has become my business, because  made a deal with someone  thought could trust
Richard stares at Margaret for a beat
He's exasperated
You wanna know why you're here
'll show you why you're here
Fine
We leave in a half hour
'll be ready in 20 minutes
Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate
She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes
beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls
(cont'd) These are really good
She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves
- Richard and Margaret board the yacht
They wear athletic clothes and running shoes
- Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself
62
- Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier
Located in the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large warehouses, and buzzes with activity
Fishing boats line the pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be processed
Everything is clean and organized
Richard and Margaret walk down the pier
He points to the that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps
Damn, they're cute
Richard waves hello to
An elderly Phillipino man, , yells at them as he walks into a warehouse
Hey, Richard
That the lucky lady
Yes sir, it is
(to Margaret) You look much younger than everyone says
That's great to hear
See ya on the line, Bek Bek
- Richard opens a locker and points
We don't see at what
Put this on
'll meet you outside
But  don't
Ah
Put it on
- Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face
She's wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing boots, and gloves
Is this really necessary
You'll thank me later
Richard walks towards the warehouse
Margaret follows in her 63
- Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different stations process the fish that come off the boats
At the top of the line, Bek Bek is  to the head decapitator machine
He happily feeds whole salmon into a guillotine, where the heads are chopped off
He awkwardly waves when he sees Margaret and Richard
Why is he handcuffed to the machine
So his hands don't go too far
So he doesn't
Richard makes a chopping motion
Margaret winces
Nice
From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out
(cont'd) You know,  shouldn't be here
was a vegetarian for six months in college
Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen
With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines
There he is
Big city boy come to show us how its done
Ah, it's been a while
'mon
Show her how we do it
Okay, okay
Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line
Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife
(cont'd) You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it
Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish
Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine
64
Margaret looks nauseous
Richard enjoys her discomfort
(cont'd) Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein
Then send her down the line
Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before offering a knife to Margaret
(cont'd) Wanna try it
Margaret doesn't say anything
All the other workers watch
(cont'd) If it's too gross for you
Gimme that
Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish
Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon
did this for five summers
Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before  took over
Is that why you're still pissed at him
Nah,  loved it here
(re: fish guts) You loved this
The slime line
Hell no
Nobody loves the slime line
loved this place
The people
Growing up, running this place was all  wanted
Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish
() You wanted this
wanted to run this place
It was comfortable here
It was what  knew
(re: fish) Don't forget the spine
65
wasn't gonna forget
Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence
But then things changed
And it wasn't so comfortable anymore
What kind of things changed
Stuff
(as if she didn't know) You mean, like, Gertrude
Yeah
Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something
(cont'd) Oh my god
She told you didn't she
() Told me what
Richard is embarrassed
He turns away
About the
you know
The creepy teenage proposal
Ah, shit
You were a freak by the way
, get it all out
And she was right to break up with you
You done
Margaret nods yes
66
(cont'd) know now that it was the right thing, but it screwed me up for a little while
For a little while
Don't sell yourself short
When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore
So you moved to the open arms of New York City
At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then  fell in love with it
With scheduling my pilates
With editing
See, as an only kid 'd always read a lot, but until  worked for you  didn't love it
mean, when realized that we could find the next Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or
(with reverence) To Kill a Mockingbird
It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird
Exactly
We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird
God damn, how great is that
Margaret smiles
She never knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job
(cont'd) So when  tell my folks that  want to spend my life finding books
My dad goes ape shit
"How dare you forsake your family
you'll come crawling back to us
you're nothing without our help
"    left that night and we didn't talk for a year
Haven't been back here since
So we're "getting married" so you can give daddy the finger
67
No
Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look
(cont'd) Sorta
, Yes
Coming back here with you
get the promotion and  get to show off
You're editor in chief
You make a good prop
() guess that's a compliment
So now you know 'm a petty asshole
Am trustworthy again
Oh yeah, we're good
By the way, you're more screwed up than  am, Paxton
Yeah
Thanks
One more question
Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian
That wasn't my question
know
Just lashing out
Margaret smiles
Can we stop gutting fish
need my phone
- Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store, filled with food, booze and electronics
mini Wal Mart
Hey Ramone
Hey Richard
Hola mi amo
Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night
68
() Hey
They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word
(cont'd) You know him
He was my shop teacher
Of course he was
How many people are on this island
They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne
Like eight thousand
Depends on the time of the year
Feels smaller
With the cart full they head to the checkout
(to Ramone) You got the phone  called about
Charged up, ready to go, number changed
Ramone throws Richard a phone
Thanks, Ramone
No problem
Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave
She awkwardly waves back
Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay
Margaret is confused
-  - Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up
Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff
It's our stuff
69
Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign
That must have been handy in High School
You have no idea
Should you leave the cart
It's our cart
didn't know you were such a prude
've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than  ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me
doubt it
When  started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things
(deadly serious) told you never to talk about that
'm just saying it's been a long time know it all
Margaret turns on her new phone
It searches for a signal
(up to the challenge) Did you know  took disco lessons in the sixth grade
Where
The
Margaret 1, Richard 0
Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang
At Woodstock
70
won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair
What'd they sing again
You know
() Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live
Richard shakes his head
(cont'd) Well they were good
You had a lot of soul there, Canada
really like "The
"
Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny  like this trash
really like it
Wow
'm getting shut out here
Allergic to pine nuts
Knew that
Afraid of penguins
Huh
Haven't slept with a man in a year and a half
Holy shit
You are a lesbian
walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty look
(cont'd) (to mother) My bad
The mother walks on
Margaret is mortified and walks faster
71
Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that gets a Holy shit
've been busy
That's a really long time
That hurts coming from Mr
Magic Pants
knew it had been slow going, but  figured there was a booty call in there somewhere
Yeah, well, 'm not good at that
find that hard to believe
No, not that
'm great at that
Aces
Top notch
'll have to take your word for it
Yes
You will
How, exactly, do you define top notch
Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone
In an instant, she's all business
need a computer and the internet
Now
'    - Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad nautical props and fishing gear
bored   in a greets Margaret and Richard
Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas
Our -1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a hurricane, but for now ye be needing to scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet
Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken
72
No, no, no
need on now
've got a Booker prize winning author demanding  send him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that "makes" him do publicity
The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese
Arrgh
Listen to me asshole
The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear
Look lady
You gonna put your name down on the list or not
Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her back
'mon
got an idea
Richard leads Margaret to the door
As they are leaving Margaret shouts out
didn't know there were a lot of pirates in Alaska
-  - Margaret sits at a computer, furiously opening her e-mail
Richard has brought her to his elementary school, where he and his old principal,
, stand over Margaret
'm so excited about the wedding
Thanks for letting us use your computer
No problem
(to Margaret) So what flowers are you going with
Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool
'm sorry, but could  have a minute alone 73
Oh
Sure
Show me around will you Mrs
Whiting
It's been years
-  - Richard and Mrs
Whiting walk around the elementary school
Do you think she'll be long
've got work to do
She'll be out of there in two shakes
Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of second graders
He stops transfixed
(re: Gertrude) We are so lucky to have her
Mr
Megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of the school year
He's living out in the forest now with his wolves
Full time
Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs
Whiting has said
He's hypnotized by Gertrude
She looks happy teaching these kids, and they hang on her every word
(cont'd) Will you excuse me
The bell is about to ring,  need to get ready for recess
(not paying attention) Uh, sure
Mrs
Whiting leaves
Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees him
Good lord can that woman smile
She waves him in
The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door
Class, this is my old friend Richard
(all together) Hi Richard
74
Richard and  used to be in this very same classroom together
We even had your old teacher, Mr
Megher
#1 Mr
Megher smelled like farty eggs
The class giggles
That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick
The
One girl gets up
Gertrude eyeballs her
(cont'd) Marcia
#2 Sorry
The child sits back down
Gertrude waits a beat
, everyone is excused for recess
All the kids pop up and head to the door
Mrs
Whiting directs traffic outside
Richard makes his way to Gertrude
Patrick's right
He did smell like eggs
It's still not a nice thing to say
And actually, Mr
Megher smelled like wet dog and
(makes smoking pot motion) Matanuska Thunderfuck
But let's keep that between us
-  - Margaret reads over her e-mail to Frank
() give you my word as an editor and a friend
The door opens suddenly, and Margaret
(cont'd) () Five more minutes
Please
75
Margaret turns to find a    in the doorway
Terrified
She  and runs off
Margaret wants to apologize, but needs to keep working
(cont'd) () Sorry
-  - Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together
They are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport
Remember when Mr
Megher made us do this after school for a week
That was your fault
Was not
You tried to kiss me
girl has to defend herself
'mon
(Tom Cruise ala Top Gun) had the shot
took it
Gertrude rolls her eyes
She's heard this a hundred times
No Top Gun
Please
What
You loved my Top Gun
No
You loved your Top Gun
just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend
That's right
Ice
man
am dangerous
Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise
Gertrude is not impressed
() Really
Stop
That cuts deep
'll have you know that 76
Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down
(cont'd) (noticing her change in mood) Uh, is something wrong
No
Nothing's wrong
It's been awhile, but  can still tell when something's wrong with you
Gertrude doesn't want to say anything
(cont'd) What is it
You know  hate it when you get all quiet
wish there was a better way to say this
Better way to say what
made a huge mistake
With you
Breaking up with you
'm sorry
Are you apologizing for high school
Yes
Oh, thank God
thought this was like, something big
This is something big
coulda used this about five years ago, but 'm all good now, promise
Thank you for saying that, though
Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point
She pulls herself together
think
(looking down) want you back
77
(more to herself) Oh God, he's making me say it again
(looking at Richard) want you back
Like
we should be together
All the time
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Rewind
know this isn't the best time to bring this up
() My wedding day isn't the best time for you to bring up the idea of us dating
Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up
Bringing this up is very hard for her
'm not talking about dating
You should move back here
We can have the life you always talked about in High School
'm ready for that now
Why are you doing this
know that the timing here sucks
But we are meant to be together
know it think you know it too
No,  don't
don't know it
Richard begins to pace
Not sure what to say
Every time he opens his mouth, he can't find the words
Then, from the door, an interruption
Hey guys
Holy shit
Did Margaret hear anything
Her face gives nothing away
Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but look guilty as hell
Oh
Hey Margaret
Uh, you all done
78
Yeah
We'll see what he says
Great
Great
You ready to get back to the house
Uh
Yeah
Uh-huh
Well let's go
See you at the wedding, Gertrude
Gertrude just smiles
Yeah
See you at the wedding
- Richard and Margaret unload champagne
Richard is still thinking about Gertrude and wanting to be alone
So, what did you and Gertrude talk about
Richard lies
Nothing
About her school
The kids and stuff
Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head
That was it
was gone for awhile
(cuts her off) Yeah
That was it
You know,  can do this
You should really go try on the dress for my mom
was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since  got out, 'm feeling crazy
(could care less) Whatever
Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but doesn't push it
79
- Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods
She's running hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's accumulated over the last thirty six hours
She's lost in her own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop
What now
Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious
She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a dancing around it
He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up
His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire
The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old
Yai
takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm
Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance
He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs
Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath
He yells out again
(cont'd) Margaret, welcome
She looks around
Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity
(cont'd) Come to me, Margaret of New York
Nope, that's her
She carefully steps out into the clearing
(cont'd) It is , father Paxton
Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up
What, ah, are you doing
My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head
As you know, things have been a little crazy around here
You should join me
Ya know, 've got to get back
You closed minded southerners amuse me
Never willing to leave the nest and try 80
'm a big fan of the nest
Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher
Dance with me
You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle
Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents
,
"accept your circle
" Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire
Clear your mind and follow me
Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body
Margaret follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it
After a few moments, Margaret stops
'm gonna head back
We're not done
think  am
Margaret begins to leave
Geoffrey calls after her
Margaret
Margaret stops and turns around
(cont'd) 'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot
But 'm making an effort here
Don't leave now
Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays
Geoffrey is pleased
(cont'd) Thank you
(switching gears) Yai
takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k
Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance
Margaret is getting better, but it is still painfully awkward
81
(cont'd) tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm
Geoffrey speeds up the dance
(cont'd) Now you
Me what
Chant
Chant what
Whatever comes out, just chant
It is the way
You'll feel better
can't
Close your eyes
Chant
Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing
Margaret closes her eyes, but can't figure out what to say
(cont'd) Chant
don't know any chants
Chant
() Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low noise
(cont'd) ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Chant
The drum beat continues
82
They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it
(cont'd) to the wall
More sand
More fire
(cont'd) to sweat drop down my balls
Geoffrey stops dancing
What did she say
(cont'd) to all these bitches crawl
Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken out into a a Lil John song
She continues to dance
(cont'd) To all skee skee motherfucker
Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off
(cont'd) all skee skee got damn
From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out
Geoffrey
Margaret stops chanting a Lil John
Oh Debbie,  didn't do anything
Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing
Is she singing about balls
He told me  had to chant
Oh, you poor dear
Geoffrey, you can't do this
(to Margaret) He's an eighth Tlingit, dear
He does this to keep in touch with "his people"
83
Don't make fun of my heritage
And it was helping
Don't you feel better
feel better
Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned up
You've got a dress to try on
And Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and help us with this wedding
Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and the drum beat stops
Fine
With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end
- Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master bedroom
They talk to Margaret through the door
am so excited
Aren't you excited
This was my dress from 1929
My mother made it by hand
Amazing how things come back into style
How does it fit
Margaret speaks through the door
(
) Just buttoning up here
Drum roll
Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds
Margaret opens the door and smiles
She's unsure of herself, but looks fantastic
The dress fits great, except
(cont'd) Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were
Yeah, it's a little snug
Come over here
Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror
Grandma Annie follows
84
() It's a lovely dress
Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying
(through the tears) You're so beautiful, and such a great match for my Richard
know 've just met you, but a mother can tell
When he looks at you,  can tell he's in love
'm so happy get to share your day
Debbie, please
We've got work to do
You're right
Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again
You go work downstairs, 'll finish this
Debbie tries to calm down, but can't
(cont'd) Go
Debbie nods in agreement
Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in tears
Margaret and Annie watch her go
(cont'd) Had to get rid of her before  gave you this
Don't think she woulda recovered
Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around Margaret's neck
When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays on Margaret's neck
(cont'd) You needed something blue
It's silly, but didn't want to take any chances
It's beautiful
It's hematite
Alaska diamonds
The blue ones like this are very rare
My great grandfather gave it to my great grandmother when they were married
They were quite a scandal, you know
He was Russian and she was Tlingit
() 85
(cont'd) Back then, you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married
It almost broke them up
How'd they stay together
Don't know
But 'm sure happy they did, none of us would be here if they hadn't
Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror
(cont'd) want you to have it
This is awful news for Margaret
She might as well be stealing from Annie
No, no, no
can't
Really
don't want to hear it
It's yours
Grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren
Makes us feel like we'll always be a part of your life, even after we're gone
Take it
Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time feels like a complete and total fraud
(cont'd) Are you feeling all right, dear
Margaret doesn't speak
Annie patiently waits for her reply
Well
Thing is
Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't
(cont'd) the dress is just a little tight
Oh, don't worry about that
We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy
Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk
(cont'd) We can fix this no problem
Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong
86
- Richard helps  build a stage for the band
He's still in a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic
We need to talk
'm a little busy
Well 'm freaking out
need to get away from here
From everyone
Now
Go for another run
No
did that
It did not help
'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping
(re: wedding stuff) We're not going to need any of this if don't get out of here
, high maintenance
Let's go
- Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and maneuverability
Richard starts her up
Move over, 'm driving
Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel
You don't know where we're going
Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off
It doesn't matter
Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the horizon
87
As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees, blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the coastline have a calming effect on both of them
In Alaska, it doesn't take long to leave humanity behind
Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep mountain walls on either side
Although it is still warm out, an icy beach can be seen straight ahead
(cont'd) Where are we
The north pole
Congratulations, we made it
(off Margaret's look) It's a glacier
Tracy's Arm
You better let me take it from here
'm fine
Oh
So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields
And not died
Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer
(cont'd) Lady, you've got issues
Yeah
'm a control freak
Fine
It doesn't stop there
This coming from the sociopath
Oh, please
'd never bring me here
You drove
mean to Alaska
Are you kidding me
Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine
88
You're sick
Doing this to them
explained to you
They love you
Do you get that
Of course
And you're still willing to lie to them
Like you didn't know
Didn't know what
That we were going to lie to them
didn't know
Well that makes you either stupid, or ignorant
You think 'm stupid
No, but what's behind door number two
() forgot
forgot
Forgot what
What it was like
What what was like
To have a family
forgot what it was like to have a family
've been on my own since was thirteen, and 'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces
89
Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of breath
She goes to the side of the speed boat
(cont'd) 'm going to take a walk
We need to head back
Alone
need alone time
What
Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look
'm, uh, about to lose my shit
Big time
need a second
But
() Stop right there
Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put
(cont'd) 'm going to be over there
Away from you
Just sit down, turn around, and act like you're not here
Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down and turn around
He does
Margaret gets off the boat and walks away from him on the glacier
Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down
(cont'd) (manic, to herself) You can do this
Couple more hours, and then you'll never see these people again
Eventually you'll write a letter
Apologize
Send the necklace back
(from the boat) Margaret
No talking
90
(from the boat) Watch your step,
It can be dangerous
Again, you're not supposed to be
Margaret doesn't finish her sentence
Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her reply
He doesn't hear anything
That's weird
(back still turned) Margaret
Richard turns around and looks for Margaret
He doesn't see her
He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the direction he last saw Margaret
(cont'd) Margaret
know 'm breaking "the rules" here, but where are you
He takes one more step before he hears
(
) () Richard
Help
Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her voice
He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that -- Margaret's been swallowed by the ice
Her upper torso sticks out of the glacier, held up by her arms
Her eyes are wide, and she's almost hyperventilating
It's a bizarre sight
(cont'd) Oh, thank God
Richard tries to control himself, but
Margaret is really scared
(cont'd) Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing
'm sorry
'm sorry
Just relax
'll get you out of there
You've broken through an ice bridge
It happens all the time
No biggie
Don't do that
91
Don't do what
The thing that doctors do in
when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be
Don't do that
It's not like that
Really
We do need to be careful here though,  don't want us both to fall in
Stay still,
Uh-huh
Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now
He's checking the ice to see if it is stable
He slowly walks her way
So, 'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out
'm really cold
Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice
(makes sense) Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to his knee
He calmly looks down on her
So 'm going to pull you up by your armpits
'm probably going to touch boob
But don't freak out
Margaret shakes her head yes
Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice
Margaret doesn't say a word
(cont'd) When  get you all the way out,  need you to hold onto me
'm going to carry you over there
Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard
He's strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice
He speaks once they're safe
92
(cont'd) 've, uh, never done that before
You said it was "no biggie"
Yeah
Well
You
Yeah
'm fine
Richard smiles
Margaret smiles back
Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms
She fits just right
Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully
(cont'd) () You shouldn't of laughed at me
You woulda laughed at me
Yeah
While  was getting my camera
The two stare at each other for a beat
There's a real spark
They might kiss
Gertrude wants me back
Whoah
Not what she was expecting
She looks down
And
Well
It seemed like you were having
second thoughts
Yeah
was
Maybe we should do it
Come clean
Put me down
Richard puts Margaret down near the boat
She tries to regain her composure
(cont'd) You wanna call it off
93
If you do
Fine
It's over
We'll tell them when we get back
Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her
Richard drives the boat
They don't talk
- Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting married
The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a hurry
He's clearly been waiting
Come with me
Where's mom, dad
We all need to talk
Not now
'mon
Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do
Geoffrey storms off and they follow
- Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the guesthouse
Geoffrey stops before they go in
(to Richard) haven't told your mother about any of this, and  don't plan to
(to Margaret) was really beginning to like you
Sorry about this
Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside
The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court
In the middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding chair
It's Gilbertson
He smiles
Hey there kids
Good to see ya
94
(to Dad) What did you do
Geoffrey doesn't answer
He's not proud of himself
(cont'd) (getting angry) What did you do, dad
called him yesterday
He told me that you were lying, and that he was going to catch you
That he was going to send you to prison
(to Richard) We made a deal and dad here flew me up
Now you tell the truth, and get off scott free
It's like it never happened for you
You made a deal with him
On my behalf
You were making a mistake
That's none of your business
It's fine
The hell it is
It is not fine
Oh quack, quack, quack
Just tell me what really happened, and 'll be on my way
No one gets hurt, we all get what we want
Margaret takes Richard's hand
It's
Tell him
(to Geoffrey) You do not get to make this decision
This is my decision
(to Gilbertson) The truth is
've been working for Margaret for three years
Six months ago we started dating
recently asked her to marry me, and she said yes
See you both at 95
What are you doing, Richard
(grabs Margaret's hand) Come on, we gotta get ready
Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court
-  - The couple walks briskly to the house
What was  thinking
They act like they're nice, but really, they're evil
He's only doing it because he loves you
Are you defending him
Are you defending the king dick
Just stop
Think about this
Oh, 've thought about it
And know what think
think you saved my life
Thank you, Margaret
Getting married to you is the best thing that's ever happened to me
Without this,  might've ended up back here
Up at the house, Debbie opens the door
There you are
You two almost gave me a heart attack
'mon, get dressed
Coming mom
(to Margaret) Time to sack up
Richard winks and goes inside
Margaret follows, not sure
-- Chairs are set up outside
-- Guests arrive via boat
-- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo
Gertrude arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes
Richard waves hello and mouths "Sorry
"   He goes back inside
96
-- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches
He's not dressed for the wedding yet
Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror as she puts on her ear rings
-- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him
'  - Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside
We see Margaret from head to toe
The dress, veil and flowers look amazing
If  were one to brag, 'd say that dress is perfect
Matches the shoes
Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers
Those'll be your best friend
Wedding shoes stink
You ready
- With the ocean in the background, 200  sit in white chairs
Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the front row
He ignores Geoffrey
Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson
From the gazebo, Richard nods at a    , who begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and the Gang, Cherish"
Heads turn with the start of the music, to see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle
When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles
(mouthing to Richard) Nice song
Richard shrugs his shoulders
Is that your song, dear
guess so
Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle
Looking up, Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone
(Yes, the same guy from the liquor store and the strip club
) 97
It's me, Ramone
Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard
They whisper while they walk up to Ramone
You look gorgeous
() You look disgusting
So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl
Oh, you bet
They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits
(cont'd) Ramone
() Mi amo
(To the crowd) We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments
To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways
Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this
(cont'd) of Richard and Margaret's true love
"True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices
(cont'd) before their family and friends
"Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey
She purses her lips
He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated
(cont'd) For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today
98
(cont'd) And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace
Gilbertson stays quiet
Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask
Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention
He's not sure what to do
(cont'd) Mi amo, do you have a question
We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself
No
Then why is your hand up
have something to say
It's not a question though
Can it wait a til after
Uh
Um
No
What are you doing
Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd
They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner
Hey there, folks
Thanks for coming out
've got a little announcement to make about the "wedding
" Don't do this
Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand
Not sure the best way to tell you all this
But, uh
made Richard marry me
This is all a sham
Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air
99
(cont'd) was going to get kicked out of the country -- so  told Richard that  would destroy his career if he didn't marry me
Now wait
Richard
Please
Let me finish
(to the Paxton family) Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but  wouldn't let him
Don't blame him
This is all my fault
(to Ramone) Could you get the band started
And give these people something to drink
(to Gilbertson) And you
Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport
You got it
Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her
She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down
Take care of him
Promise
Margaret walks back into the house
Alone
'  - Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed
Her bag is packed
Richard knocks and comes in
Margaret is on the phone
(unenthusiastically to phone) Uh-huh
Yeah
That's great Frank
Good news
Talk to you on Monday
Margaret hangs up
So Frank's back in
Margaret nods distractedly
Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now
Yup
He's in
For now
100
Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird
Yeah
Right
Margaret starts collecting her bags
Great exit back there
Thanks
Fun weekend
Same old, same old, around here
Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so  just left them
'll let her know
() Why did you tell them all that
It was getting too messy
We weren't going to be able to keep it up
Don't start lying to me now
Margaret stops for a moment
heard you and Gertrude at the school think she meant what she said
She's a great girl, you should stay
It's the right thing
You're perfect for each other
But
but what about you
What are you gonna do
Margaret wants to keep the conversation short
Don't worry about me
'll survive
So what
This is it
Yup
This is it
101
Margaret walks to the door, but stops
She turns to Richard
Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself
(cont'd) () Have an amazing life,
You're a good person
You deserve it
She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it
It's electric, but Margaret denies it
(cont'd) Goodbye, Richard
- Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase
She can hear that the party is in full swing and smiles
- Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her suitcase tight
It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud
The two have to yell to talk
want you to say the words
'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now
Say it
Margaret closes her eyes
Hating that it's come to this
'll publish your book
Gilbertson smiles
Now was that so hard
- Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore
Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers
So here's the deal
'm going to have a million questions for you tomorrow
Gertrude sits down next to Richard
102
(cont'd) but for now  thought we'd just sit here and drink beer
Richard nods
Gertrude hands him a beer
Thanks
Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek
Then, realizing where and who he is with, he puts his beer down
He turns to Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss
When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed
Richard looks worried
Something is wrong
You have been practicing
Waddya mean
Well
Margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man whore down there
Richard looks down
bit ashamed
Gertrude makes light
(cont'd) You're gonna have to put that in check if you move back
Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real options up here
and 'll kick that bitch's ass
Richard gives her a polite smile
He's not really in the mood to joke
Gertrude notices
(cont'd) So no jokes yet
Too soon
'm sorry
'm just a little
confused
That kiss didn't seem "confused
" Richard takes a beat to collect himself
You're amazing, Gert
And 've thought about being with you for a long time long time
When you said those things at the school
've dreamed about hearing you say those things
() 103
(cont'd) But as crazy as this seems
know now
that we're just not meant to be
Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched
(cont'd) Thing is
when  said goodbye to Margaret
felt sick
For the three years we worked together,  wanted to be as far away from her as possible
But now that she's gone
'm just really
sad
want her with me
What is that
The question hangs in the air
don't know
think  have to find out
Find out what
If she feels the same way
Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry
Well
then
What's a girl gonna do
(voice cracking) guess you want who you want
Gertrude gives a melancholy smile
'm so sorry
() But,  gotta go
Uh-huh
Richard gets up
Are you
'm fine
Really
Go
Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party
104
-  - Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar, dumbstruck looks on their faces
Ramone mixes drinks and flips bottles
Richard runs up to them all, looking excited
What are you so God damn happy about
What
Oh
Well, 'm, uh, going to see Margaret
What
She violated you
We should report her
Who you gonna report her to, mom
Oh my God
He's got the Stockholm syndrome
don't have the Stockholm syndrome
And she didn't violate me
What is going on, Richard
Richard slows down and explains to his mom
'm sorry  lied to you
That was an awful thing to do
But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me
think she's
the one
But you already thought she was the one
No,  didn't
Not until she left
Really
Does she think that too
don't know
've got to get to the airport to find out
Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile
105
(so romantic) He's going to stop her from leaving
At the airport
But  gotta hurry
Her plane leaves any second
might not make it
(so romantic) He's not sure he's going to make it
Are you buying this horse shit
Oh, Geoffrey
don't have time to explain this to you
Well then make some god-damn time
Cause won't let you throw your life away for some woman
don't care
Excuse me
don't care
love you and want you to understand
But 'm not asking your permission here
'm doing this
Oh, really
From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts
Boys
Stop it
Stop it
Stop it
But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face
She grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth, causing a loud crash
Geoffrey and Richard run over
Mom, are you
'm having a
need to go to the hospital
Fast
106
- Margaret and Gilbertson board the jet together
Margaret finds her seat in first class and discovers the Handsome Man from the flight before sitting nearby
(re: Gilbertson) Is this another gay assistant
Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat
- carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting helicopter
Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind
They all pile into a large chopper and fly off
-  - An oxygen mask covers Annie's face
Geoffrey holds her hand
Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down
Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise
Richard
She has something she wants to say to us
Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie
Their three heads are very close together
Annie speaks to them both through the oxygen mask
Listen to me
You two need to stop fighting
You'll never see eye to eye, but you're family
If this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it
(to Geoffrey) Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if you don't agree with him
promise
And Richard
Promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family
promise, Grandma
, then
Annie closes her eyes
She looks peaceful
moment passes
107
Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th pilot
(cont'd) (as if nothing happened) 'm feeling much better
don't need to go to the hospital
Take us to the airport, please
Richard and Geoffrey are confused
Stunned even
What
what is going on
(so the Coast Guard can't hear) Did you fake a heart attack
We didn't have time for your squabbling, and knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport
It seemed like the best way
The best way
And remember, you two promised me that you're going get along
wasn't kidding about that
Ma'am, 'm not authorized to take you to the airport
(to pilot) Larry Ferris
Don't make me call your mother
- Gilbertson talks non-stop
Margaret is in hell
want my book launch to be special
'm thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky Monastery
In St
Petersberg
Margaret stares at him blankly
(cont'd) (as if she should know) Where Dostoyevsky is buried
Hello thought you were a professional
Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain
108
- The helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out
His family follows as they run to the control tower
- has an easy job
Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only about six flights a day
He is half awake as he radios Margaret's flight
Reggae music plays in the background
Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff
(
) Roger that, Chuck
The   in the tower
Chuck picks up
Intercut as necessary, with Richard running on a cell phone
Tower
Talk to me
Hey Chuck, it's Richard
Hey man
Heard about your lady bailing
How often does this happen to you
Need you to do me a solid, brother
gotta see my girl and she's on that flight
Could you stop it for me
No can do brohan
Need a good reason for the  holes
Lose my jobby job if delivered that favor
Oh, c'mon Chuck
- The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff
Margaret studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson
so next topic
Celebrities
Let's invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the Paris Hilton's,
Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave Sitka
109
- Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch Margaret's plane take off
Well
That's it
Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened
Richard looks defeated
Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath
So, you know  think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right
You've made that crystal clear
Good
(looks at Annie) Well, consider this me keeping my promise
Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button
He waits for an answer
(cont'd) (to phone) Hey
Maguire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something
But that's what 'm calling about
've got a favor to ask you, a bout one of your planes
- Gilbertson continues to talk
Margaret is in a stupor
you know those two hundred pages  took out
'm going to put them back
flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts
Ms
Mills
Would you come with me
Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson
Yes, of course
She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat
What's this about
110
(never done this before) There's someone on the radio for you
The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant  located at the front of the plane, outside the cockpit
(cont'd) Uh, a Richard Paxton
Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt
Tell him 'm not here
: - Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower
Chuck sits nearby
(
) (from radio) 'm sorry
She won't come talk to you
Shit
She's never going to pick up
(to Richard) Know what, home slice
Cut this chica loose
You remember Beth Cable
She'd totally be into you
Suddenly, Richard has an idea
He picks up the hand mic
Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor
: - The captain comes on over the loudspeaker
(over plane loudspeaker) Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is your captain
We've reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet
Flight time'll   be three hours and thirty minutes
And Margaret
Richard has something he'd like to say to you
111
(
) (over loudspeaker) Uh, hey Margaret
And cause 'm on the loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane
The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's Margaret
Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she doesn't know either
(
) (cont'd) (over loudspeaker) This certainly isn't how  wanted to do this
mean, 'm not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing, but  figure it's now or never
So here goes
: - Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure
His family encourages him on
You're doing great, man
Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike
know you're used to being on your own
And that you're comfortable with your life the way it is
And that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together
know, because  felt the exact same way
: - Every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the loudspeaker
The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone
(
) (over loudspeaker) And you know what else  know
know that 'm tired of being alone
And  think you're tired of being alone too
So come on
Talk to me
Please
The Handsome Man turns to Margaret
(with genuine concern) Do you really feel like you're alone
112
Oh, good lord
: - Richard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if there is going to be an answer
Chuck crosses his fingers
(
) (from radio) What the hell are you doing
Everyone in the tower smiles
They're making progress
We need to talk
(Intercut as necessary
Margaret stands at the front of the plane with the passengers watching
) About what
Have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years
As boss and assistant
Things change, Margaret
() Things change
Yeah, things change
Is that the best you got
Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what  said
" Richard composes himself
Now, tell me the truth
When you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore
Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up
That was a good one
113
What's your point
Because  am sick that you left
And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together
Margaret goes to answer, but stops
Richard is right
She wants to go back
Even the passengers on the plane can see it
Gilbertson panics
Are you thinking about going back to him
Margaret doesn't answer
(cont'd) We have a deal
You can't back out now
The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying to break up Richard and Margaret
Sir, you need to sit down
will do no such thing
Sir, 'm ordering you to return to your seat
Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson
Who said that
Sir, this is your third and final warning
Listen sweetheart
(he pokes the flight attendant) 'm a federal officer, so why don't you get me another cocktail and mind your own
400,000 Volts of electricity surge through Gilbertson
He twitches violently and crashes to the floor
Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge
Well, 'm a federal Air Marshall
And you're under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible intoxication
114
The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom
He then takes the  from Margaret and speaks to the passengers
(cont'd) Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need to get this unruly passenger off the plane Sitka's the closest airport, so if it's  with you, 'm gonna have the captain turn this bird around
There are wild cheers from the passengers
Margaret blushes
(cont'd) (winks at Margaret) Told you  was a romantic
- Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing
Richard and his family wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them
truck drives stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens
Margaret steps out
Richard walks up the steps
This wasn't supposed to happen
Richard looks Margaret in the eye
But it did
Margaret looks down
little embarrassed
'm not the kind of girl who gets saved
Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him
The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson
Uh, sorry, but excuse us
The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson down the steps
(to Gilbertson) Hey
Do you think getting arrested might affect you at work
Gilbertson has no retort
115
(cont'd) Oh, and 'm not going to be able to publish your book after all
So you are getting married this weekend
() Absolutely not
But who knows
(looking at Richard) We might by the time you get out of jail
Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off
Margaret turns back to Richard
All smiles
(cont'd) 've got some explaining to do
Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of Richard's family
(cont'd) (to Debbie) Hi
'm Margaret
've known your son for years, but we've just recently begun to see each other romantically
(to Geoffrey) want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska
(to Annie) 'm not sure when you are going to see him get married, but  promise as long as 'm with him, he'll be happy
Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen
That's all we ever wanted
Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug
Debbie joins in
Then Geoffrey
Passengers cheer
: -  - The party is in full swing
Balzac chases his balls
Ramone slides onstage and  with the band
He has a beautiful voice
Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug
They've done this before
116
Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table
The Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink
Grandma Annie winks and leaves these two alone
Margaret and Richard dance
All smiles, even though they aren't very good
And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the island, to an eagle's nest at the very top
Inside the nest, three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's phone
