12, 2011 --  6:12 -    -- - It's still more night than day as we look down on the The lit sign for the   may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle
--   -- - We follow the metallic rattle to a door
The rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope
" We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase
, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage table out of the motel room
With her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse
She finds a beat-up candy tin
She opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue
Nothing
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made
She flips open her cheap phone and makes a call
she thinks better of it and hangs up
--   -- forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988 Toyota Tercel and slams it shut
1988   --   -- We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on "speaker phone" mode
The phone rests on the passenger seat
We pull up to find  slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel
She is exhausted and irritated
(as the phone rings) Don't pick up
don't pick up
don't pick up

answers with music in the background
"Yo
" quickly picks up the phone
(') It's Nic, do you have any
Good morning to you too
You're what
Well, where are you guys shooting today
Where
Text me the address
You have some
Okay
She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview she tries to smile
--  7:14 -  --  -- The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey clouds
We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando
The sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture
-  --  -- Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter
An attractive   wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed
She crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing
Back to the bed as   rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo
wears his 40 some years of life experience like a medal
Smoke hangs in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as snatches up his phone and answers
For the love of Christ
Look
just hold
He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket
The naked,   bends over to pick up her clothes
We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle
Whip smiles, taking it all in
3
(into the phone) 've been up since the crack 'a dawn
What check
Tuition
How much does it cost to go there
The   has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as  is beckoning with his large hands
The  , looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to  who takes a masterful drag shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone
He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone
(') You decided he needed private school
lemme talk to Knuckles
He's not
Tell'em the phone works both ways
Oh he's my son because you need a tuition check
that's great Deana
'm glad you tracked me down in Orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money
Does he even like the fucking school
No 've never seen it
Yeah  wonder why not too
gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till  get back to Atlanta
How am  a liar
What
No, 'll call you
hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window
Was that your wife
That was my ex-wife
But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just 'mere
The   we now know as  smiles seductively
Whip, don't even joke about that
Our flight's at 9, let's hit it
is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands  his pants
can't help but pat that perfect ass as  tries to skip away
We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem
's "'m Feeling Alright" 4
Yeah, 'm feelin' a little light- headed
shoulda ate somethin'
leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half
He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke
--- wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway
continues to wail, perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that  maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper
-  - leans against the landing gear of the - 88   -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the tarmac
wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual walk around
He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder
His foot slips, sending his shoe  in to a puddle
Son of a bitch
Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs
-  -- enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance of the plane
is greeting a  and his
Morning Miss Marquez
Morning Captain Whitaker
waits as  politely parts the stream of folks to allow  to enter the plane
-- exchanges a look with a   , She can't help but smile
5
Captain Whitaker, that sky gonna hold
You're not gonna make me spend another night in Orlando
Don't worry, Margaret 'm gonna get you home for your prayer meeting at
what is it
Jesus Christ Superstar 27th Baptist King Church
and  , the other flight attendant, laugh
That's right, Christ the King First Baptist Church on Hazel and 9th Street
And 'm still saving you a seat next to me
Offer stands
come on down
One of these nights, Margaret, 'm comin'
You hold my seat
The girls laugh at the familiar exchange
- enters the cockpit, removes his hat and nods to , our clean-cut, young first officer
'morning
Walk around is complete
Whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and takes a huge hit
(') Emergency oxygen, checks
(offering the mask to ) You want a hit
No thank you sir
(tries to break the chill) My pleasure to share the chair with ya'
Didn't we fly together
lets him hang
6
No sir, not that  remember
Ken Evans, sir
Call me Whip
Yes sir
studies this little Bible Thumper for a second before
(calls to the galley) Margaret
( ) Sweetie, will you get me a coffee, black, lots of sugar
And some aspirin
You want something
(looks to Margaret) No ma'am
Thank you
( ) Sir, it's 8:50
Then let's push

Yes sir, you gottit
And how you feeling today, sir
focuses on , trying to read into that statement
Tired, sir
But, this is a quick turn for me
Ten turns in three days
Off tomorrow
returns with the coffee, placing it down near 's chair on an airline cocktail napkin
Here's your coffee and the final manifest
102 souls on board
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're a life saver
And Margaret gettem' tucked in, we're ready to push
7
goes to the head
and  exchange a look
: -   -  - gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before it closes
She checks the address on her phone and looks up at the enormous mansion
--  -  - pushes through the overly tall front door of the house
At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished
in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second floor
Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down
On the staircase she immediately encounters another holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet
The holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips
quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at the odd duo
We now hear activity downstairs, music
the    frantically points at the Othello you bastard
And she grabs the   and hustles downstairs waits with the    until we hear
(
) is free to walk all the way downstairs now
-    -   - enters to reveal a large porn set with a Shakespearean theme, specifically "Othello
" We see an Elizabethan Four- poster bed with a canopy surrounded by stone arches and cardboard Venetian Columns
In the bed we find an laying with
-  stands naked next to the throne smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a man's electric razor
8
approaches a    who only wears board shorts
He's talking with an    as they groom a pile of coke for snorting
- He sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her, she turns her cheek avoiding the coke-frozen kiss
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot
He's my partner in this new series, he knows a lot about porn
Kip  need 2 grams of "h
" Tiki and  are trying to put the narrative back in porn
Our Desdemona hasn't shown yet
(a great idea hatches
) You should play Desdemona You got that fair skin
is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it
Desdemona
What the fuck
does a line and comes up babbling
She do anal, two thousand, one hour
don't do porn, Kip
Just lemme see the "h
" Just listen, we're doing an Othello theme where the Moor finds you in bed with your nurse and- He fucks me in the ass
9
Well
yeah
We're giving a whole new meaning to the "beast with two backs
" That's actually a title we're toying with
'beast with two backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole- thelo
would you be up for it
College kid, very clean
tall thin kid joins them
He wears a Moorish Headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist
(') Show her the pipe- drops the towel
Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your ass and call me in the morning
Kip, have  ever done that shit for you
Never
Asshole

follows her
at the door
Nic

You were clean for a while and

pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket
No, keep your money, okay
But, Nicole, this is the Taliban baby, very big time
It will take you down
can handle it
10
(') Don't shoot this shit, it is way too heavy
'm just gonna smoke it

Okay, no needles and take a little coke and if you start going down just whiff a little
Okay wanna see you
hands her a tiny baggy of coke
He kisses her cheek
: -- Out the window
nothing
the rain pounds
leans close to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view
reaches down and throws a switch
The windshield wipers go on
We can now see very clearly the path of lights the plane is to follow
looks to , smiles with stoned eyes
Thanks junior
looks out at the rain
Looks pretty ugly, sir
little rain never hurt anybody
We're not made of sugar
What's the
Half a mile
Right at minimums
Wind's gusting to 29
30 is our crosswind max

( ) SouthJet 227, say intentions
looks right at
keys the radio
Orlando ground
SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end
stares forward, not looking at
- Nervous passengers stare out the windows as the -88 lumbers along the tarmac, headed for the runway
We follow  whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt as it does split bare with orange fluorescence speaks into the  mic
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign
Please be sure your seat-belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on items are safely stored in the over- head bin, or under the seat in front of you
Also, all personal electronic devices must be switched off, at this time
Today's flight time to Atlanta should be 52 minutes
Flight attendants please take your seats
16  straps into her jump-seat
16 --  -- Heavy rain lashes the nose of the plane
Lightning
We watch the plane steer on to the  center-line
Whip inhales his coffee and readies himself for take-off
tries to relax, continuing with the checklist
(reading the check-list) Elevator trim - set
Flaps, One, two, three - set
Radios - set
12
One, two, three altimeters - set
Lights, pitot heat, de-ice - on
Transponders, set
( ) SouthJet 227, wind is one-zero-zero at seventeen
Runway 18L, cleared for take off
has razor focus as he places his hand on the throttle
sits upright and prepares for battle
(keys the mic) Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227
Whip pushes the throttles and the engines  as they spool up to full thrust
After a beat, he releases the brakes
- The passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them towards flight
The main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit
- mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep the nose between the lights of the runway
It's like a video game, right
laughs and turns to his copilot
is visibly nervous as he begins the take-off check
Airspeed's alive, both sides
Engine instruments are in the green
100 knots crosscheck
The -88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane
Yep, nothing like a little 30 knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle
Evans is jostled violently
13
That's wind shear
micro burst
Whip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway
The    are approaching fast
The plane is not lifting off
(') Less than a thousand feet to go
Whip snaps at him
Just watch my airspeed
The airspeed indicator reads 145
V1
and
Now the air speed indicator climbs to 160
(') rotate
Whip pulls back on the yoke, and
The plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we leave the ground
The plane is immediately buffeted by severe turbulence
(') That's wind shear for sure
Yeehaw
Ride `em cowboy
- The passengers are rattled like a bag of marbles
- The plane is loping up as the rain continues to pound the windshield
The ascent is very bumpy as the turbulent wind tosses the plane side to side
Copilot  is communicating with Air Traffic Control

Orlando Departure
SouthJet 227, climbing out of 2500 for 5 thousand, runway heading
( ) Roger SouthJet 227
Turn left heading one-seven-zero
Climb, maintain niner thousand
Left to 170
Climb, maintain niner thousand
quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto- pilot
don't want the auto-pilot
'm flying
( ) What's your ride like, SouthJet 227
Before  can answer,  jumps on the radio
Ah, Departure, we've got some rough chop here
'd say moderate to
The plane hits a severe bump
's headset turns sideways and he quickly rights it
chokes back a nervous chuckle
(') (into his mic) No, severe
Definitely severe turbulence
No meal service today
Roger that
Whump
Once again the plane is violently rocked
- The passengers audibly  as the roller coaster dip lifts most of their stomachs into their throats
few overhead luggage bins fly open and bags and coats rain down
15
The   calmly collect the luggage and stow it in the kitchen
They talk loudly for the benefit of the passengers
(to a passenger) This happened last week, always bumpy outta Orlando
Right Cam
grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers
Ladies and Gentlemen, the captain has asked that until we clear this air you stay seated with your seat belts fastened
Thank you
- The plane rocks and shutters
seems oblivious as he continues to serenade Evans
() Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself - Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself
is interrupted by Air Traffic Control
( ) SouthJet 227
Be advised there is a large convective cell four miles at your 11 o'clock
And another cell, 2 o'clock, 10 miles
Both moving rapidly
Copy, Center
( ) Did you get that
Gottit Skippy
'm just tryin' to get birdie here outta this wind bowl
What did they clear us to
We're cleared to Flight Level one- eight-thousand
16
' headset flies off
His tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground
Goddamnit
Enough of this shit
pushes the yoke forward
The plane pitches downward
What are you doing
Leveling off
What
points to the  screen
See that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards
screen:  narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells
(') That's a little pocket of smooth air squatting right over Lake Kissimmee
nervously squints at the screen
(') And we're gonna thread that fucking needle
Turn me thirty degrees right
jumps on the radio
(into his mic) Center
This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right
For weather
(into his mic) for weather
17
SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center
30 Degrees, right, approved
Report back on course
Report back on course
banks the plane to the right
Suddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds
huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the -88
From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream holds on to his headset
(') Oh, Lord
He can't help you now, brother
remains cool as he rides more bad air
The plane now bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps
- The passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble head dolls; it's getting worse
- pushes the throttle and the 17-year-old Jackson- Ridgefield -88 accelerates directly into a huge black cloud
He begins to dip the nose level to the ground
Why are you leveling off, sir
'd like to spend less time in this shitty air, Kenny
Is that alright with you
pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield -88 directly into a huge black cloud
He begins to dip the nose towards the ground
We're approaching maximum airspeed
18
Fucking right
'm gonna need some speed to punch through this crap
- The passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward
- calls out to
You're over-speeding
Not yet
The   moves from  right up to the line
banks the plane steeply to the right
From the cabin we the passengers
Now  comes on the radio
( ) Uh, SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center
Say altitude
Tell `em we're climbing
(scared and lying badly) Center
uh
SouthJet 227 is leaving niner thousand
for Flight Level 180
( ) SouthJet 227, this is Center
You need to check your Mode-
Your transponder indicates you're descending
looks at  -- panicked
You're useless Evans, shit
(keys the radio) 19
Center
This is SouthJet 227, we've encountered some bad air here
Some pretty severe downdrafts
We're in our climb now
( ) Roger
The shaking gets incredibly violent
from the cabin
Evans points to Whip's airspeed indicator
() Look at your airspeed
You're too fast for this rough air
'm right on the line Kenny
Right on the line
starts to hum the Joe Cocker song again as he cranes his head up close to the windscreen -- looking intently at the dark sky
(') 'mon sweetheart, show me the sun
Suddenly, we see a beam of light breaking through the black clouds -- 12 o'clock high
God ray
(cont'd) (') Finally, daylight
banks the plane hard, lifting the nose -- pointing it directly at the crack in the darkness
He shoves the throttles to full power
The plane is banking, rising and accelerating
- The screaming passengers go quiet with the strange new development
The shaking has eased from a 10 to a 5
- Whip keeps the plane climbing steeply
The Vertical Speed Indicator shows we're ascending 2,000 feet per minute
The altimeter spins up past 12,000 ft
20
The murky grey outside becomes lighter and brighter, until suddenly, in a dramatic reveal
Instantly the air becomes perfectly smooth
Whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud walls -- smooth as silk
Gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the shimmering rays of the sun -- it feels like  just flew the -88 into heaven
joyous   from the passenger cabin pulls the power back and switches on the auto-pilot
is cheery, almost giddy
Glad that's over
, however, is very shaky and beaded with sweat
How tall are we
16 thousand
That was incredible sir
Ken, turn us north and take us home
Your plane
looks at him and nods
My plane
(picks up the phone) Margaret, 'm coming out
hangs up, puts on his pilot hat and exits the cockpit
'     -- has her keys out as she hustles for her door
She looks to find the door slightly open
She pushes it fully open to see , the building manager, standing in her living room holding her camera
He tries to be casual
21
Where you been Nicole
She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space
Fuck
Fran
get out
You're like a little ghost never know when you're here
Get the fuck out Fran
She grabs the full-bodied 35  camera from him
As the building manager  have a legal right to enter an apartment if  believe the occupant is unwell
Especially if said occupant is not current on her rent
He takes a slimy step towards her
She steps away
Fran, please just gimme a minute
Get out
have the rent
will bring it down to you
Just let me shower
You could just bring the check down now, use my shower
got good water pressure
You know that
leans against the door frame, trying to strike a seductive pose
smiles and holds up her camera
You're in the perfect light Fran
(he smiles, preening) Back up a little
little more
steps outside and on to the landing
'    --  -- kicks the door shut and locks it, escaping  who calls through the door
22
(
) Tricky tricky, girl
Alright, so you shower up and come down
For real
We don't gotta talk about the check
Hang out a lil bit
puts her camera down gently on the table
() In your fucking dreams
She now flings her purse on the ground in frustration
the contents spill on to the carpet
Amidst the flotsam we focus on yet another candy tin that springs open
fixes her stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside
-  - exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel
He looks down the aisle to see  far down the cabin sees , comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers
opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig
He then pours half of it in the sink
places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers
Folks, this is Captain Whitaker
If you look up, 'm here in the galley
will wave to you
steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him
waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease
(') Good Morning
apologize for the bumps, but Florida just doesn't seem to like us Georgians
Must be the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall
Titters of laughter from the passengers as  moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart
(') Stretch out and relax
The air might stay a little cranky so 'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened
23
We now watch from behind  as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out
(') We won't have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and 'll have you in Atlanta in about 40 minutes
Thank you
puts the mic to its hook
Alone in the galley and out of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap
Whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash
Whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half
knocks on the cockpit door
emerges and disappears in to the cockpit
'  --  -- Framed photos on a bureau show: Christmas around the tree with Mom (30) and Dad (33) and a girl who's 8 and a boy who's 5
(In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking heroin in a spoon
) Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party
(In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off
) last photo shows  (30)and her mom (54)
They are both wearing kerchiefs
We can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief
(In the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm
) is placed in front of that picture
Next to the photos is a small  station that  taps to life and turns up
The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's "Medication" begin to play
We pull wide to see  pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with
Her face is pure happiness
Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down
She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter
She laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush
She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her
She leans back and uses the wall for support
"Medication" is hitting its chorus
24
Oh man
She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria
slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face
She exhales slowly
She reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits
looks up with fear
(cont'd) (') Oh no, oh no, oh no
She reaches for the little bag of coke that  gave her
Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open
As she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees
somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading
The little bag of coke falls from her fingers
There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose
's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor
On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away
We hear a pounding on the door
is on the other side
(
) Open up, Nicole
can smell that shit cooking
Open Up
Nicole
Nicole

He has two approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask
His lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep
Margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans
How long has Sleeping Beauty been out
maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress
The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear
(looks at his watch) 26 minutes
We're going to start descending any second now
Well,  guess you'll need to wake

The radio interrupts
SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center
Descend and maintain Flight Level 30 thousand

Evans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the "Descend" position
Instantly the autopilot's Shut-Off

Evans grabs his yoke and pulls
The stabilizer feels really stiff

The passengers shriek with terror

Everyone's belted in
Are we going down
The plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives again
Get belted in, everyone belt in
Brace position

Whip grabs his yoke and pulls
The plane inches up

My plane
Your plane
Whips keeps back pressure on his yoke

We need drag
Throw out everything we've got
Speed brakes
Gear
(keys his mic) Uh, Center we're in a dive

SouthJet 227, Roger
Evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes
The wind  as the gear doors drop
The airframe shakes and rumbles violently
( ) there enough hydraulics to drop the gear
28
Gear's down
don't think hydraulics is the problem
Throw out the flaps
Too fast for flaps
We need to start dumping fuel
Evans hesitates
(') Do it
Evans quickly throws the "  " switch
The airplane bucks and drops violently --  chorus of terrified   from the main cabin

Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair
She's crying
Oh God, Whip
What's happening
Get strapped into the jump-seat need your help
Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness
Throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness

Evans pushes up the throttles
Whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick

The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed
pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in
Evans is starting to lose it
Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000 Here's what we're going to do
( ) When  say, you retract the gear, retract the flaps and trim both ailerons
But every things gonna be opposite, so be sure to trim down

Trim down

Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle levers

4 smoked black limos fly outta the driveway and the fans jump on the limos

Those limos
Empty

helps him into the front seat and they pull away
The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play

Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of survivors
'  -- Whip watches through the rear window -- the "Media Circus" disappears as the Caddy rounds a corner
The back seat is piled with Whip's clothes, most of them still on hangers
lights a cigarette and hands one to  who takes it
couldn't find any suitcases so just put your shit in grocery bags
pulls a cold Becks from a cooler on the floor of the back seat and uses a bottle opener that's been screwed to the dash of his car next to the radio to open the beer
He offers the beer to  who waves it off
gladly keeps it for himself
"Gimme Shelter" continues to play
(') So you're stayin' with me down on University, right
It's nice lotta young people

Harling tosses Whip a freezer bag marked:"" -- Whip begins to open it
No
'm gonna go to the farm
The fucking farm
62
My dad's place
can't stay at my condo
thought you sold that fucking place
Not yet
'm not sure  wanna stay at the farm
You're not
Just take me to the airport to get my car
Whip finishes opening the freezer bag -- it's full of cash
starts to laugh

Really
Don't you know the 58 first place every two-bit thief looks is in the freezer

He gets out of the car
With his cane in one hand, he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags close to the steps and heads inside

His keys, wallet and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone attached to an old answering machine
plugs in his cell phone charge, dials in for his messages and puts it in "speaker mode" as we hear
You have 127 messages

"This is affiliate  in Athens we're looking to contact William
Whitaker for

"Captain Whitaker, this is Karen James, media relations with the pilots' union
" again deletes the message and decides to just shut the phone down
He continues to empty his pockets
In his jacket pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills
holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand
--  -- pours the pain pills into the toilet
He then opens the medicine cabinet and starts to empty all of the bottles into the toilet
--  -- goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the sink that act as a makeshift bar
He picks up a bottle of vodka
He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents
He slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink
Whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of beers
He pops them open and pours them in the sink
The faucet running to offset the pungent smell
64
-- Whip opens a dresser drawer and finds a couple of zip-lock bags of "bud" hidden under the socks
-- Whip dumps the weed into the toilet and  it
-- cigarette dangles from 's mouth as he ferrets around the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial killer cleaning his kill site
He finds rolling papers, roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another "pint
" -- Whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his "packet of veal" and finds another fifth of vodka
He pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the trash -- which is piled high with empties
Through the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old weathered barn
Whip furrows his brow
--  -- slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of stagnant storage
lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of aviation history resting in his barn

pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff
We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce
We see bikes, weights and fishing gear
Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office
Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- from happier times
Now Whip comes upon       of he and Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an -14 Tomcat
Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger
puts the photo back and spots his golf bag
He roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket
Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag
He goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf
-- 63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63 to the house
-- 65  uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of 65 empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans
He tosses the bag of empties in a can
His work done,  lights a smoke and stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the landscape of his mind
He quietly tries to grasp the horror he endured and the reality of his survival
-- We hear the microwave beep and  retrieves a frozen dinner
66

is startled by the phone that never rings
He snaps off the  using the remote
is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues
goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on
We hear
' ' You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides
Please leave a message and it will be returned
Thank you
think that was the beep
Hey Cowboy, it's Charlie again
reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to (speaking to voicemail) 'm back in town and  stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went home
so  guess you're feelin' pretty good, but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned

Glad you got my message

Coffee
(Whip nods, sits) Miss, can we get some fresh coffee
She smiles and nods
She's off to get the coffee
(') We were just talking about your copilot's wife
She told a newspaper that "God landed that plane

God landed the plane

too believe that God landed that plane
The same way  believe that God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent
'm good with coffee
Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning
(Whip seems lost) Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site
So
is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting
(') Whip, as you know, when a plane crashes, the  sends a "go team" to the crash site immediately
They find the flight data recorders
Yes they found them, perfectly intact
Great
That solves everything
The recorders will tell the story
Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago
Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence- Criminal negligence

Death demands responsibility
Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay
The plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet
The airline will try to prove equipment failure
Which would make the manufacturer responsible
The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline
Or pilot error
had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh
Do you get the picture
100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground
Do you have any idea what that sounds like
do
heard the black box last night
Are you a pilot
No 'm not
Then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about
Hugh's on our team and it's the 's ball game
They run the investigation and they will ultimately rule on the cause
They interview the entire flight crew and the passengers
They hold - 70
Charlie, what do  need to know
'm already tired of this guy
The  `go team' collects blood, skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report
studies the two men, trying to read their poker hands
When did they do that
In the hospital
It's the first thing they do
Do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash
looks at  and then to
Do they have the results of these blood tests
Yeah, they do
The  checks in
Anything else for you gentlemen
Did  just see warm cinnamon rolls come out
Yes sir
Bring me one wouldya
Actually bring me two, okay sweetie

It's still quiet
What does that mean
had a beer the night before  flew
And what
That made the tail of the plane explode
Separate issues Whip- need a lawyer
Hugh is your lawyer
need a bigger lawyer
lawyer who understands that  flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, not 6
We're talking about prison not funerals
Somebody has- To write checks, well it's not me promise you that
And as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane
'd love a check
- This tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine, felonies punishable by 24 years in jail
And if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the 4 passengers you'll get 4 counts of manslaughter
That could be life in prison
72
Can  now do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report

tries to reign it in
He'll get it done, Whip
It's what his entire life is about
Trust me, trust him
(Whip stares at Hugh) Don't worry Whip, you're gonna walk away the hero you deserve to be

He stops at a local report
74
-- gives a lead in at the crash site
#1 Kevin, it's still chaotic here at the site
Apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down
So the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders, was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago
1 We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs --  saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad
didn't see her again
#1 More details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around
can tell you that there appears to be many, many survivors
That's all  have for now
Kevin
Another reporter has a passenger's account
#2 Rebecca, surviving passengers are being put in ambulances, police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment
Some of the injured appear serious and it's safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities
Let's roll the tape of the passenger  caught up with earlier
with    explains his experience
75
2 We turned like a corkscrew and all could think was, "this is really happening, 'm going to die" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way
He flipped it back over and landed it hard
#2 Obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane
This is Callie  Kenner for News 5
third Reporter gets a  's perspective
#3 Folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses
thought it was thunder at first
But it shook the ground hard
Thunder don't do like that
ran outside and  could hear people yelling and  could see a small fire at first
just took the dogs and headed down there
Then saw the plane crumpled on the ground
never seen nothing like that in my life
#3 Just like that plane, this community is shattered
Folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies
Back to you, Tom
-- news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a small hill above the crash field
76
#4 We're gonna take another look at the cell phone footage that captured the last moments of SouthJet's Flight 227
After the  levels off and smacks down in the field, we return to  #4 in the crash field
#4 (') Many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night
Using flood lights and miners' caps, teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down SouthJet's flight 227
Those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft
Hopefully sunlight will bring answers

If only the left wing had come off at impact,  think everyone would have walked off that plane
The left wing partially pulled away- It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe
So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail

Yeah
so what's the deal Lenny
Is your union gonna survive this one
More importantly
How big a check you think 'm gonna have to write
There were 6 fatalities on the - The 2 crew members don't get settlements like the passengers
That's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract -- they do a dangerous job and they know it
You're the lawyer for the pilots' union
No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker's situation
Yes, and what is Mr
Whitaker's situation
is up my ass with a flashlight
We had to give them access to everything

Through a glass wall we see
flew with him
He's a great pilot
Is he a drunk
He's a heavy drinker
Should bring him in
Everyone steals glances at  as  continues to dominate
In a minute
Alright, so let's get down to it, Lenny
What does the union plan to do about this blood test that says Whitaker was high on booze and coke
This guy's a real peach
'm gonna kill the toxicology report
(feels eyes of disbelief) It was done incompetently
The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code
Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete
And they aren't sure who stored them
They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test
That's what 've done so far can handle this
like this guy Lenny
He makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet
88
Mr
Carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield, the manufacturer
Oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch
Good fucking luck
What's my exposure Jim
' The awards to the families could kill the airline
Fuck the airline
The insurance companies can have the goddamm airline
just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets
Speaking for the pilots' union
We don't want your airline to go away
We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitaker and in turn protect your airline
That's sweet Mr
Caldwell, but if the  leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk
We're all fucked

He's going to jail
He belongs in jail
You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is
is he gonna die in jail

returns the nod as  86 quickly puts a hand on 's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight instructions
'   - We are now in 's living room watching
' Get up
What
You can't get up
(Whip is laughing
) 'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long
go
We watch an 8 year-old   run long as the ball flies to him
He catches it and on-screen  hollers
'  (') Touchdown Whitaker
Atta boy
'mon back
What
Come back and do it again
Tired
Junior, you don't know tired
'm not going out
You go out
Keep running
We pull away from the screen to find  who sits on the couch
large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows
moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it
He freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset
His stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet
Oblivion
The light from the  of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room
We hear a car door open and women exchange good byes
(
) Keep coming back, Nicole
One day at a time
91
(
) know, one day at a time
87A We hear them laugh as  still stares in to space
87A --  -- The door pushes open and  comes in with the Big Book of in her hand
Hey
Sorry 'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the meeting
(Whip doesn't look) Whip
goes close to see  look at her with a non-focused stare
She sees the table and reads the situation
watches as  stands up
In his oblivion he tries to focus
Don't, don't, don't
'll get him
Knuckles, junior
See him
Yeah
'm not calling again
Fuck him
He didn't call
Not back
Not calling back
backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion
motions to his lips as if he is smoking
He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table
Whip falls to the ground
checks 's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out
goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers  with
She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke
looks around the room
She begins to collect the bottles and straighten up
--  -- 's  as he struggles with a thick hangover
He rubs his face and smacks his lips, he's dry as a bone
shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through the bedroom window
He looks out to see  sitting on a chair enjoying the landscape
rubs his head before walking to the kitchen
92
--  -- pulls open the door to the fridge and pulls out a gallon of water in a plastic jug
stands and takes a long pull of the cold water
--  -- sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table in front of her
An  Book rests on the table
She snaps a picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy landing strip and the rolling hills
enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from the kitchen
Morning
coughs and rubs his eyes
Are you okay
You were in bad shape when  got home
Tired
Guess  drank a bit
bit
You wanna count the fuckin' beers
They're still in the garbage
Vodka too, is that okay with you
It's more than okay, Whip
Good
It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass
've been watching the sky change as the sun rises
Beautiful
(holds up the camera) Perfect light,  went out and took some great shots
reaches for the camera
She hands it to him
93
Lemme see that camera
My mom got it for me
Towards the end, when she knew she wasn't gonna recover
She maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit
takes a moment to tamp down some emotions
(') It's just so beautiful here
Did you grow up here
still holds the camera as he sits down
It was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here
He was a pilot in World War , flew with the 332nd
See the landing strip out there
He built that
He ran a crop duster outta here until the put an end to that
(she nods, listening) He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna
He flew that damn thing all over
It's still in the barn
was gonna sell this place after my dad died
Then  got divorced
And your mom
Dead
she's dead
Your dad still alive
'm pretty sure my father lives in Colorado
You got no relationship with him
He drank
It was my mom that raised me
She was incredible
lights a cigarette as the memories are tough
94
(') She held it together for so long, couldn't tell how sick she was
Even through chemo she looked beautiful
leans over and blows out the candle
(') They gave her very heavy meds for pain
Dilauded, morphine, oxycontin
started taking them with her
We would get all medicated and sit in our back yard and talk and talk and watch the sun go down
We'd be so stoned that we couldn't get up to go inside when it got dark
(laughs, fights the pain) know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom, but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like teenagers, trading stories about boys and whatever
She loved me
lifts the camera and points it at
She contorts her face into a sly smile
snaps it
she laughs
89A         89A The blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal
-- in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the church
The center of attention is a large, distraught woman in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and his wife
The  wears a pin that holds a photo of
stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks, looking for someone
Suddenly, a 9 year-old  stands in front of him
The  locks eyes with him
'm Trevor
You saved my mom
looks up to see   walking towards him
She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket
We can see a bandage along her hairline
smiles, obviously uncomfortable
hugs him
95
It's great to see you, Whip
You too Margaret
Broken collar bone
Yeah, and some stitches but 'm fine
really am
(she goes quiet) It was a nice service
mean, look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye
She looked beautiful in there
(Whip is blank) Didn't you think so, Whip
Like she was gonna wake up and smile
didn't go in
couldn't
is sensing 's struggle
Trevor, find Dad
He's by Mr
Benton, there
( ) Are you okay
You should come to the counseling group
The union has great people for us to talk to
No
can't, really
will, but just not now
It's quiet
smiles and leans in and kisses  on the cheek
Take care Whip, okay
She starts to leave
stops her with
Yeah
y'know
'm in the middle of this investigation
The  is investigating the crash- know
'm going in to see them next week
96
'm nervous because  was out the night before the crash at dinner- With Trina
Yeah and  had two glasses of wine
And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought  had anything to drink
appears speechless
(') What
've known you 11 years and you're gonna stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine
Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip, which one was it
You have to tell them it was an ordinary day
mean it was an ordinary day
You know  was in shape to fly
You have a problem with saying that
It's a lie
Whip, it's a lie
Trina told me you two hadn't been to sleep
My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret
'm just trying to get it straight
You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives
didn't say that Whip
can't imagine another pilot doing- 97
Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there
Or my son having to come and see me in prison
fights tears as  has struck a blow
Please Whip, enough
Don't you think we've all had enough
(Whip is quiet) What do you want me to say
It was an ordinary day
The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day
The tears flow now as  can't hold them in realizes he's gone too far
Not knowing what to do, walks away
-      -- --   - watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his car smoking a cigarette
He wears his suit from the funeral
approaches
She's in a great mood
Are you okay
How was it
It was okay, okay
How're you doin'
beat
Well,  got through my first day
They haven't fired me
That's good
Cause for a celebration
They needed someone to work the night shift
They asked me and it's time and a half so
98
She sorts through her shoulder bag
(') gotta vest and here's my name tag
Oh oh oh
got you something
(hands him a nice lighter) It's a -51 mustang on there
(flies her arms like ) You're dad flew a -51, right
(stares at the lighter) He did
So should we get some dinner
promised Sheila  would be at the meeting tonight
She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor
Can we do it tomorrow night
And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the meeting
nods, playing with the lighter
No, it's okay
You should go
Why don't you come with me
We'll eat after
It's an open meeting
Open meeting
That means anybody can come
Anybody
Even me
She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot
She's hard to deny as  can't help but smile at her
--  -- stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie
He is lost in the energized retell of a story
99
# 1 The cop is shining his flashlight on me
'm standing there behind the dumpster, wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, vomit on my chest and  say to the cop
about two beers
The room erupts with laughter
is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter
# 1 (') That's why they call me "Two-Beer" Barry
makes eye contact with a
holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man
# 1 (') Don't worry Ed,  got the format right here
'm sorry, Ed's giving me the stink eye
Let me get back to the format
(reads from the format) 'm Barry
'm an alcoholic
( ) Hi Barry
# 1 Are there any other alcoholics present
glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-handed alcoholics
few look at  with no judgement
# 1 (') like meetings that have us all identify
Because it makes me tell the truth about who  am
It reminds that  never ever told the truth
lied about everything
My whole life had been a lie
And was told that  would never get sober if  kept lying
is very reserved, poker-faced
#1 mean, lying's what 'm good at
If  know anything in this life it's how to lie, especially about my drinking
100
We pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected
Except  who leans over to
gotta go
Okay
( ) Can uh
(points to Sheila) Yeah, Sheila
She can take me back to work
(extends her hand) 'm Sheila
shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a fire
We stay close on 's face as he walks out continues his pitch
#1 Like  said,  would lie about everything
It didn't matter what it was
My whole life had been a lie
series of lies strung together by me
And when  drank
It was worse
What  came to understand was that, my lies were killing me
And that remains the great fact for me
My lies will kill me
93  is gone
93 --  -- enters the bar and we hear off camera a voice coming from the  above the bar
(
) The  is focusing their investigation on the flight crew, specifically Captain Whitaker
(
) Sir,  am not at liberty to discuss Captain Whitaker or any of the flight crew
looks up to the
101
-- ( ) And in truth,  don't have much to say about him
(on a split screen) So, safe to say that he remains a mystery
( ) Sir, those are your words not mine
exits as fast as he arrived
He's gone continues from the
( ) 've been speaking to some people who are very close to the investigation and they are very confident that they will be able to determine exactly what brought this plane down
( ) 'm sure they will sir
( ) Thank you, Ken and Vicki Evans
( ) Thank you, and God bless
-- steps off an elevator and walks down the quiet hospital hallway toward a room where a few  are packing up the last bits of  equipment
--  '  -- stands in the doorway and addresses
102
How're you feeling, Ken
stares at  with a blank look
Happy to be alive
Blessed to be alive
'm Captain Whitaker,  was flying- know who you are
senses an unwelcome undercurrent
He locks eyes with trying to read him
Silence before  speaks to the Ma'am can you give us some privacy
Thank you
( ) Come on in sir
Shut the door
The   files out placing a chair next to the bed as she leaves
enters
It's again quiet
Listen, how long have you been
Outta the coma
Two days
didn't mean to disrupt your whole day
know they been swamping you with interviews
You were great on smiles at
Both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped
'll probably never walk again, least not without a walker or braces
'll certainly never fly again
'm sorry Ken
103
That plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair
You reeked like gin or somethin'
called Vicki from the plane before we took off
That's when the rain kicked up
nods, holding her cross with the chain across her lips
don't know how much you remember, but the plane started to fall apart
remember everything until we crashed
know what went on
What are we talking about
don't know Captain Whitaker, what are we talking about
just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash
Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before
goes white and drops his head
(') The  is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me about the events on the flight
You think you'd be alive without me on that plane
No, we'd all be dead
But are you gonna argue that your physical state was tip top
'm not gonna argue anything with you
104
gets up
Sit, please sit
( ) never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight
've never said word
sits and studies
(') The flight was pre-ordained
've prayed on it Captain
Vicki and have prayed on it
There's only one judge -- Praise Jesus
And he has a higher plan for you sir
This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life
begins to mist up with sincere inspiration
(') Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake
Praise Jesus
Captain, will you pray with me
stares into ' eyes and sees a believer's conviction
reaches out his hand to
slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of ' bed
takes ' hand and bows his head as he reaches for 's at the same time
It's quiet before
(') Jesus our Lord and savior we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker with courage and wisdom
For guiding his hand on that fateful morning
In his divine light we were saved
Praise Jesus
105
Praise Jesus
It is quiet for an extended beat
Finally
Praise Jesus
97  looks at  and his  whose heads are bowed with 97 reverence
--  -- small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway
We hear music and laughter as  gets out
Thanks for the ride guys
'll see you tomorrow
Keep it up Nicole, you could be employee of the year
They all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off
She walks towards the house which is dark
She hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls
--  -- slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door
Her curiosity compels her to pull it open
/
--  -- The door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine
Lenny Kravitz, "Fly Away" blares from the stereo
emerges from the cockpit
He's still in his suit but with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up
He's energized like an excited kid
He runs up and kisses her
notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers
Looks great right
106
It's kind of
beautiful
wipes at his nose
It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's
He kept it perfect
takes in this cool trinket of aviation history
Does it work
Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died
learned to fly in this plane
You can land it anywhere
laughs, remembering
(') My friend Harling and  flew it to Jamaica
Jamaica
In this
We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here
We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica
You're insane
It was like a picture on a post card
The white sand and sky blue water
Most beautiful place 've ever been
Was the water warm
Yeah, really warm
That's my kind of place
Let's go
107
Sure, why not
laughs thinking they're playing a game
Let's go tomorrow
You're serious
We'll leave in the morning
we'll just go
Start over
realizes he's serious as he opens another beer
Whip, we can't
It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise
'm worried about you
(laughs a bit lit) 'm fine thanks
No you're not, you're really not
You need help, Whip
think you need rehab
You go to a couple of  meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ
Worry about yourself
We're the same Whip, you and me, we're the same- ' - - 108
didn't suck dick to get high
And don't give me a whole
Never Whip,  never in my life- Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit -- Stop
Please stop
Is that why you shot dope
That's not fair- Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life
You're sick, Whip
walks away, leaving  with his plane and his dream of freedom
calls after her
choose to drink
Do you
You choose it
don't see a lot of choice goin' on
choose to drink
And  blame it on me
'm happy to
've got an ex-wife and a son  don't see
Why
Because  choose to drink
-- '  -- We follow  as he enters the house and approaches the doorway of the bedroom
sees  sitting on the bed
She quickly tucks her cell phone away as  holds up his hand to signal a truce
109
Alright look,  was loaded when crashed that plane
With this investigation going on,  don't know what's gonna happen
Come to Jamaica with me
Whip
'm afraid 'll use again
Come with me
need help,  do
'd love for you to get help, Whip
When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital
'll do it for you
Anything you want
looks at the sincere love in his eyes
don't wanna use again
can't
won't make it back
'll be sober
won't force you to stay
promise if you don't like it or if  don't clean up
You can leave
This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard
(') It's so beautiful there
We'll leave before noon
'm a great pilot
You'll get to see so much
wraps his arms around her
We stay on 's face as he holds her tighter and tighter
--  -- is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table
Past we can see  lying in bed
She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet
She finishes a handwritten note and places it down
picks up the note and begins to reread it
110
She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping
She leaves, careful not to make a sound
--   -- quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her stuff
She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to 's car that we see parked at the top of the driveway, far from the house
--  -- stirs, wakes up and looks around
walks around looking for
He finds the note and reads it
The reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn
returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of  on the table near where the letter was left picks it up and throws it across the room
He then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall
After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall
The bottle explodes and  stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son
We hear the antiquated ring of the relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him
Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine
' ' You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides
Please leave a message and it will be returned
Thank you
The beep concludes
(speaking to voice mail) Hey Whip, if you're there pickup
got some good news
snatches the phone of the hook
111
Yeah, 'm here
What's goin' on
104  listens as  talks
104 --  -- sits in his car
Rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice
gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink
takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box
gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar meets him and takes him inside
--     227 - is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar
He sees the plane
The -88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible
Like the skeleton of a -Rex in a museum
The sight is awesome, breathtaking
walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops
is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave
steps out of the passenger door and calls down to Here's our guy
'mon
walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be
stands at the top of the ramp
Suddenly  steps out of the plane
Captain Whitaker, we've won
doesn't move as  starts down the ramp
(') This is what we call in my profession a "walk over
" They've scheduled the hearing
It's in 10 days
and  reach the bottom of the ramp
112
But these hearings can be tough
You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly
It's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane
This picks directly at the scab of 's guilt
(') 've had an "Act of God" successfully added to the list of probable causes
Look, it's simple
flew a broken plane
You got it
That's right
And what about my toxicology report
(trying to stay calm) killed it
They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane
And no eye witness claims
But there's a problem
This stops  cold
(') Because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash, there was never any drink service on the flight
But, they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin
There was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no , no finger prints
But both the bottles were uncapped and empty
The only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew
Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou all had clean tox reports
That leaves you and Trina Marquez
They let that land
nods
113
Okay
see
where this is going
That's funny that they found two bottles
Why
Because  drank three
One's missing
explodes in frustration
When  met you  couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were
Fuck you too, Hugh
But  did the research and heard the analysis from the experts
'm in awe of what you did
Can  go now
gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation
10 is so loud and emotional even  lends focus
(') Do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes
Everyone waits for the response as  acknowledges the debris around them
(') Not one
Every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board
114
Yeah
So
You have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved
Great
'm going home
pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack
Do you want to go to prison
'm trying to save your life
steps between them as this exchange spirals
What fucking life
Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh
starts to walk away
Okay, 'm done here
'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, Charlie
(turns on Hugh) You wanna talk about me like 'm not here
Like 'm fucking dead
(to Whip now) This  hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing
Do you understand that
It's in 10 days and if show up with you like this
turns and walks
wheels on  and lights him up
(') Everything we've done
Everything 've done
Goes out the window
That's not on me
did my job
It's your job, Charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time
115
Yeah Charlie just get him home
Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline
Fuck you shoulda died on that plane
106  walks away from them -- away from the bright, clean, 106 shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm
-- The rain has subsided as  pulls up to his driveway
Whip turns into the driveway and spots a   in front of his house
He makes a -turn and speeds away
-- The rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as bangs his front tire in to the curb as he attempts to park in front of a well-maintained house
'  --  - 111  checks the mirrors before taking a long drink from a 111 large orange juice bottle
-- gets out of his car and makes his way across the street and towards the house
We notice
The      that has been parked farther down the street gets out of his car, talking on a cell phone
--    -- walks up the steps and knocks on the door
He waits a beat and knocks again
Finally, it opens -- , an attractive, well-dressed woman in her 40's, stands there staring
What are you doing here
It's lovely to see you too Deana
May  come in
116
takes a moment before stepping aside to allow  in
-- glides into the kitchen of this fastidiously kept home
Thought `d come see you and Will
(calls out, loudly) (it's very quiet) We haven't talked at all since this whole thing happened and  just thought we should talk
You know that  prefer that you call us
Call you
Like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than "Where's the money
" Have you been drinking
Well that took
what
17 seconds
(fake checks his watch) It took 17 seconds for you- 'm gonna ask you to step outside of the house, please
(has continued to rant) and  it took 17 to ask me if  have been drinking
'm calling the police
You're asking me to leave the house bought for you
Very good
(
) 'm telling you to leave
117
turns to see his 16 year old son, , standing at the foot of the stairs near the door
William Whitaker, junior
The man of the house
Nice of you to call me back
'm telling you to leave
You are
Are you the man of the house
You upset my mother
You gotta go
'm your father, tough guy
You're a drunk
Now get the fuck out
You don't know who the fuck  am
(pulling open the door) sure don't
What did you say
said, " sure don't
" Why don't you tell me
Who the fuck are you
Who are you
Huh now steps between them and pushes  towards the stairs as she puts her hand on the doorknob
'm outta here
'm outta here know where 'm not wanted
turns quietly
He opens the door and walks outside to find
118
is completely caught off guard
They step right onto the tiny landing with him
Through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at '   #1 How come you won't talk to the press
'   #2 lot of people are going out of their way to keep you out of the media, are you hiding something
We hear the squelch of a police siren as a   lands on the scene
'   #3 Do you still live here, Captain Whitaker
'   #1 How well did you know Katerina Marquez, the flight attendant that died
trips down the stairs
grabs one of these news rats and just before pounding him, he breaks in to a relaxed smile
Folks, please give us some room
(gets down the stairs) At the appropriate time  will tell my story
Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured
Thank you
appreciate your interest in me but  ask that you leave my family in peace
The  quiets to listen and record his words again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and under pressure
We can hear the squawking of approaching
starts to head down the porch and the frenzy erupts again
119
The  begin to disperse the
pulls an officer aside
'm Captain Whitaker,  was- Yes sir,  know who you are
Can you get me to my car
( ) Anything you need, sir
walks with the   who shields him from the fray
'  -- '  -- We can see the   standing in front of the driver side door, shielding  from the press who stay away
116  exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head
He's 116 drunk but controlled
He looks at his hands
They are shaking
'  --  -    - We see  on the  repeating the speech he gave reporters on 's front lawn
Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured
Thank you
appreciate your interest in me but  ask that you leave my family in peace
now wraps up the piece
reasonable request from a quiet, heroic man who's been through so much
This is Tilda Banden reporting from Devonwood
Now a   changes stories

In a related story, tonight at 10 Cale Rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight 227 could have been avoided

holds an unlit smoke
The      and 's gestures towards

Hey, Charlie
Thank you
Amanda was so nice to let me in
It's just
couldn't find a safe place
slides the door shut as  throws his bag and his coat down with gusto
He reaches up and pushes a button on the  and it goes off
What the hell is wrong with you spoke to Hugh, he told me that you went to your ex-wife's house
Drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up
(Whip just stares) And the police escorted you out
think it's okay
've been watching and  think it's okay
Hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like we're good
You come off fine
Okay
Good then
Listen Charlie, here's the deal- No Whip
No deals
Look at you
have no idea what you're gonna do or say, ever
You're all over the place
was the one guy in your court
was your apologist, your defender
But not anymore
121
No
can do this
You're about to be questioned by a Federal Agency about piloting an airliner drunk
an airliner that crashed
And you continue to drink and stumble around
What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that
'm scared of you
Let's just stick to the plan
You can't stick to anything
This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me
Tell Hugh, can do it
Look,  really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit
This hearing is 10 days away
Hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused, but there's no way
You have to appear
Let me stay here
They have my houses all staked out now
Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie
won't leave the house
takes a long look at his old, troubled friend
You can't drink here, Whip
You can't drink in my house
Can you do that
won't drink
118  nods, hoping that  can deliver on that promise 118 122
--   -- We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in 's hand
We pull out to find  walking with  down a hallway of Time has passed as  looks the best we've ever seen him look
He is well rested, well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag
As we approach the open door to a guest room,  pops out
plain clothes   follows  out of the room and stands behind him
You look great, Whip
mean that
Thank you
feel really good

Yes sir
Whip, Officer Edmonds will be staying here tonight
Any problems he'll handle it

Well, Whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible

Relax, order up a steak, get a movie
is checking his phone
gestures to  for him to leave so they can be alone
(') Okay, cowboy, 'm out
The hearing starts at 10, so we should plan on 9 for breakfast here in the room
Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you
needed it
You did great cowboy
You've got a beautiful family
'm very blessed
leaves and  joins  at the window
hands a thick folder
made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and wrote out some non-damaging responses
It's all in there; photos, testimony, interviews called Ellen Block let her know that you're here and all tucked in
So does she have the knife out for me
Remember she's limited in what she can ask you
You're not on trial but you are under oath
She's probably not happy that  killed the tox report, but you'll be fine
laughs a little
124
(') 'll see you in the morning
The two respectfully nod
leaves and the door shuts behind him
puts the folder on the table and steps to the mini-bar
He bends down and opens the fridge
sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices
Every soft drink you can imagine
No booze, anywhere chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke
unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line
-- '  -- Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak
The File Folder sits on the table
'  -- Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the bed watching television
The File Folder now rests on the bed
'  -- Whip is meticulously shaving
He stares a long while at the disposable razor as the water runs over its blade
After a moment he goes back to shaving
'  -- Whip sits at the small table looking through the file
He leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion
He looks to the clock radio -- 12:37
'  --  -- We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors
'  -- wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his neck
He looks to the clock -- 2:07 lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any creases
'  -- 125
The room is dark
soft wind  the window sash
lies on the bed
He sighs, sleep is alluding him and the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head spinning
He hears a metallic click
He stays quiet to listen for it
there it is again
An annoying click
The clock reads "3:43"-- He sits up and switches on the
He rubs his eyes and goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there
As he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again
He goes to investigate
-- The connecting door is unlocked
arrives and waits
He now watches as the connecting lock-bolt  against the frame -- the door swinging in a draft
He looks up to see the culprit -- a heating vent
flips the vent closed
Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few inches
Nothing
Darkness
Hello
Anyone
Whip enters
-- The room is vacant
The bed is made
The drapes are pulled open
walks quietly on the carpet towards the window
The night is clear
Quiet
Whip takes in the city lights
'  -- Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a church spire
simple cross is perched on top
Whip looks at the church, deep in thought
Then suddenly
We
turns from the window and scans the room
It's the - refrigerator --  to life
126
Whip stares at the gleaming black box
The  of the motor seems to get
Calling Whip
Beckoning him
Whip looks at the fridge
His face is blank, His eyes tell us nothing
Then
Whip steps toward the box
-
Whip swings open the door
--
as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles  like jewels in a chest
stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon
The bottles  -- , , ,
reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge
He holds up the mini vodka and considers it
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey
He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away
The   on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly
Then suddenly
In a flash,

We follow our guys as they approach 's room, finding exactly where we left him -- in front of 's door
-  - '  - stands up as  and  approach carrying coffees
Good morning, how's our man
127
Not a peep
knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for  to answer
cocks his head, knocks again
think your pilot overslept
You didn't let any girls in there last night did you
No sir, not a soul
No one came in or out
They all wait awkwardly as  checks his watch and knocks on the door
More silence

takes the room key and lets himself in
-- '  -- carefully enters 's room
He is spooked by the silence
joins him as they take in the room
The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but  is nowhere to be found
Did he disappear
tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door
He turns to  with a surprised look
Whip
Hello
knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door
No response, so  lightly tosses the door open
-- looks in to find the scene of the crime
Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room
joins him
128
Where is he
Whip
closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom
--   -- is stopped by the sight of 's lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet
turns  over to see his non-responsive face arrives and freaks out
Is he dead
'
Yes
'm dead
shows immediate relief that  is breathing
has joined them
Should  get an ambulance
Yes
Wait
just wait, Charlie
let's think about this
The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament
Get him to the bed
(to the Officer) 129
Can you wait outside and don't let anyone in here
Thank you
leaves
and  drag  out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed

Son of a bitch
You worthless motherfucker, what a waste cleared the decks for you

How much grace do you think we got
Amazing grace

We probably have an hour before we really need to get him to the hearing and it's just downstairs

Whip needs bananas and you need to bring them to The St
Jerome Hotel downtown
how many bunches of bananas

() Come mista tally man tally me banana
Whip, what's the deal man you look like you're hurtin' for certain
shut the door, interior lock
places a leather doctor's bag on the table
An anxious  reaches for the bag which sets  into a frenzy
(') It's quiet as  gives orders
(') Everyone except Whip and myself take three steps away from the table
As they step away,  now pulls a beautiful silver- framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly but sternly delivers orders

(focuses on Charlie) Two glasses of water, a credit card and a hundred dollar bill

Okay Whip, just two small whiffs first
one on each side
just a primer
Using the mirror as a tray,  holds the rolled up 20 dollar bill just above the line of coke

It's tense as his head wobbles

The banana boat is here

As we disappear in to 's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air
-   -  - On    we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of   227's final moments in the sky
the Video is the   of the cockpit voice recording
The room has a dais where the  board members sit large blue curtain is the backing for the round  shield that hangs above the proceedings
large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the
confident woman,  , approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium
Those are difficult images to watch
For the record, 'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing
Captain Whitaker, good morning
136
We see  who looks rough but stable in his witness chair
Morning
What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact
However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude
Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft
The  has created animated simulation that would like to play at this point
points to the screen
An  animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew
The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said
We hear
"What's your son's name
" "Why
" "The black box" " love you, Trevor
Be a good boy, Mommy loves you
" "What are we doing
Why would  trim down
" "We're gonna roll it
Ready
Here we go
've got control
" That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up
We return to the hearing in progress
(') That audio is tragic and compelling
chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, 've got control
" You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down
Is that correct
137
'm not sure it was conscious
It was more of an instinct
What led to that decision
is clearly struggling in his chair
The coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon
don't recall
Let me quote from an investigative summary
"From 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are"
again quote, "bold and remarkable"
"By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field
We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable
heard a metallic bang
We pitched nose down
No control
looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame
You had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft
There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft
glances towards  and  who are poker-faced
As  said before you can add any details you like to any comments make
Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary
Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape
138
takes a minute to digest this question
Yes
It was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it
There was some convective activity in the area
However, my first officer and  discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums
Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same

(') want to show you something
is frozen in a steely gaze;  seems to hold his breath
(') Nothing's happening
points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work
(') This remote is not working
Apologies
can do it manually
She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to  where she can advance the slides by touching the projector
We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal screw the size of a trombone
(') This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly which articulates the horizontal stabilizer--also known as the elevator
As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone
" 139
Substandard thread life" is how we reported it
This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2010
It was never replaced
This had 1200 additional hours of flight on it
It finally failed
We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend
(') Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive
The loss of the elevator was, and  quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible
" Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate
's tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth in sheer terror
It is deathly quiet in the ballroom
Even the  are silent
(') Again  quote
"From 9:34 until 9:42 the piloting decisions made by Captain Whitaker were bold and remarkable
The fact that Captain Whitaker commanded that the aircraft stay inverted while descending to an extremely low altitude shows a miraculous intuition that in this instance saved 96 lives
" genuine applause spreads from the hearing room allows this moment to happen
is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected adulation
He stands up
appreciate that
140
The room gets quiet as 's demeanor seems terse
stares at , white with sweat and chemicals
We see grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on tilt
Mr
Whitaker,  want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident
But before do,  want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings, do you understand what that means
nods
(') Captain Whitaker, for the record need you to verbalize your answer
Yes,  understand
On the three days leading up to the day of the accident -- Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th of 2011 -- did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements

No
did not

On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job
141
No
did not
wraps up this line of questions
Mr
Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction
waits for her to look at him
this takes a while
No
maintains a poker face;  appears relieved
sorts through her notes one last time
Okay, Mr
Whitaker, we're about done
(She refers to her notes) Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane
Is that correct
Yes
suspended the drink service
Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin
Slides now show the     in evidence
Yes
There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley
Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members

(') toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons
Hugh smiles -- satisfied
(') And one tested positive for alcohol
It registered a
17 blood alcohol level
Are you aware of that
am now
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work
Correct
Outside of work
Not really
Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem
No
did not
Did you ever see her drink to excess
No
did not
143
Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction
The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines
No
did not
picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane
smiles at the photo of  as if she can see him
He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit
He gets serious as he bears his look down on
Can you repeat the question
Your opinion Captain
Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight
Whip shakes
He runs his trembling hand through his hair
'm sorry
My what
Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight
Whip drops his head and
(') 'm sorry Mr
Whitaker,  couldn't hear you
What did you say
God help me
144
confused  rises in the room
Whip's response flusters  for a moment, but she recovers quickly
Yes, well
However, is it your opinion
Whip cuts her off
( ) '
(lowers his voice) It's my opinion
Trina
drink the vodka
Excuse me, Mr
Whitaker
(softly, to himself) She saved that boy's life
Captain Whitaker can you speak - ( ) Whip stops
His whole body trembles, his face tightens
He looks right at
(') because  did
drank the vodka
The crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard
rockets out of his chair
#2 Please be seated sir
This is not a court room
Now  returns to his chair to find that  is gone
looks around for , no sign
He's vanished
leans close to the microphone
145
drank the vodka bottles on the plane
Mr
Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress
You don't have to readdress anything
On the three nights before the accident, October 11th- On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th  was intoxicated
drank alcohol on all of those days drank to excess
Chaos erupts further as  outnumber
Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee
Mr
Whitaker, on the morning of - was drunk
'm drunk right now, Miss Block
'm drunk right
(Whip finally breaks down) 'm drunk now, because
Because 'm an alcoholic
We have pushed into a tight shot on 's face as the sound in the room fades away
We stay tight on 's face as he lets the moments unfold
Suddenly the noise cuts to silence
is looking at the assembly
wipes tears from his eyes
We hear 's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face
(
) That was it
was done
It's as if 'd hit my life long limit for lies
new angle shows  speaking these words
146
could not tell one more lie
And maybe 'm a sucker
Because if had just told one more lie
could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months
We hear laughter as we pull out from  to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an meeting in a Federal Prison
(') It looks like  will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence
And that's fair
betrayed the public trust did
That's what the judge explained to me
had betrayed the public trust
The  took my license
And that's fair
The chances of me flying again are slim to none
And  accept that
--  -- large room houses an  meeting for about 50 inmates wearing white jumpsuits
continues his story
've had time to think about all of it
Doing a lot of writing
've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight
Some were able to hear my apology, some never will
've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but  couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife,  mean my ex wife
(he gets emotional) and my son
Again, some were able to forgive me
some never will
( ) But at least 'm sober, and 'm grateful for that
Whip gives it to us straight
147
(') And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison
but for the first time in my life
'm free
We hold close on 's face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting
On the sound we cut to
--  -- We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage
We see a photo of  and and a few other   surrounding  who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison
We see a photo of 's  as an airman
We ultimately land on a photo of
We recognize it as the photo  took on the porch of the Whitaker Farm

As he gets closer we see a smile break across his face

Can we pick up where we left off

Okay
Who are you
Good question

a great, familiar question
He begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son
