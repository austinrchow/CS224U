Written by Pamela Gray January 25, 1999 : The photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian immigrant family
a b&w snapshot of , a nine-year- old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)
Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a wooden music stand
a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion dress
Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same refrigerator, eyes on the music stand
a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a sandcastle on a beach
a color photo of a groom in a white naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword
a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing with another couple at an outdoor taverna
Roberta's husband and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile
as we now see the  open on the floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed
We are: , ,
-  -  (1988) '  (
) Wake up, Roberta
We hear the sound of  as the   a small, darkened guest room
few streaks of daylight filter through Venetian blinds
'  (
) Come on, Bert -- get out of bed
The  finds a  lying face down on a twin bed, thick wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders
'  (
) Please, Bert -- you need to get out of that bed
The  continues, and she puts the pillow over the top of her head
- The  --  - (38) -- retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it
She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell
She stares at the photo -- it's the two couples dancing
quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half
There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices
'  (
) Can you come out now, Mommy
Please
She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces
#2 (
) Mommy, Nick broke my crayon
#1 (
) Well, Lexi hit me and he almost broke
he almost broke my ear
arguing "
" "
" "
" etc
As if that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the
voices
'  (
) Hear that
Your boys need you
-  - (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian- American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended working-class home, addressing a young   who holds a lengthy delivery inventory
It's a gray day with ominous storm clouds
Late 70's  are parked on the street
But  have no room for this
'm sorry, 'am
We have orders to deliver these
Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed
Large wooden  cover her front lawn, and plant down another
They hurry back to the , grabbing the next crate too quickly this time
It slips from their hands,  to the ground and splinters open
Several spill out
The crate looks like it holds a whole lot more
Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far
Watch it, you idiots
Be careful with those
The men scramble to pick them up
Assunta looks at all the violins, then up at Roberta
Why so many
Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut
- The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, labelled by the
And on the floor, in the middle of the boxes, are    of various sizes, also with Greek and
labels
(7) and  (5) climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks
(calling) Mommy, which box has our toys
- ' on the phone, yelling at someone
She's still in the same ratty nightgown
Look,  know he's there, so quit lying to me
Then check under Lana Holden -- Mrs
Lana Holden
Fine
Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his wife called and -- grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up
Ma
No
want you to listen to me
You can't keep doing this to yourself -- or to the boys
They need their mother now
You're a beautiful, talented woman and you have your whole life ahead of you
If 'm so beautiful and talented, why did Charles leave me
Because Charles is a big jerk
(beat) Now get dressed
She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words
- Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on a rack
We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage
As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, Roberta enters
She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or done much with her hair
It's a start
You really think Charles is a jerk
From the day you married him
Why didn't you say something
Since when do you listen to me
Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits down at the table
(sighs, then) What am  gonna do
First, you eat breakfast
Second, you go out and get a job -- any job
Your boys, god-bless-em, are good eaters -- but  can't afford it
Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- you'll see
Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this
Well in the meantime, get a job
-    - ,
- Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons, bows and stickers
At one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect
She looks pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy housewife
There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers
male  appears behind Roberta
Just wrap
You're not Picasso
He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task
(
) Picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box
Roberta looks up to find   (40), a handsome, sexy guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket
Brian Turner
Hello, Roberta
thought you moved away
did
'm in town for my Mom's birthday
He holds out his hand
Roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand
No -- that's her gift
(embarrassed) Oh
Sorry
Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping
It looks very pretty
Thank you
(beat) heard you had a book published didn't read it but
That's
My parents didn't read it either
It looks good on their coffee table, though
Roberta smiles
So what are you doing here
thought you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now
as she takes this in
- ,
- Roberta sits opposite Brian
Her lunch is untouched
My college professors said it was too late --  hadn't had enough training to be a concert violinist
So  got a teaching degree instead
'll bet you're a great teacher
think  am
It's just that
(sighs) See, every time 'd get started somewhere, Charles would be transferred
then  had my kids and took time off to raise them
and then when  decided to teach again, no one would hire me 'cause you can't count on a navy wife to stick around
finally decided 'd start my own program -- Charles gave me the money and  bought fifty violins from this little Greek shop -- got started at a private school and then
Your husband ran off with your best friend
beat
She wasn't my "best" friend
She was a friend
(beat) Charles is the last person you'd think would cheat on me -- he never broke a rule
(a few beats) wake up one night -- it's like one in the morning -- and he's not in bed
go outside and our neighbor -- this old Greek guy -- is sitting out there, smoking a cigar, so  ask if he's seen my husband
"He's taking a walk with the other officer's wife," he says
"He takes a walk every night with the other officer's wife
" beat as she gets lost in the memory
She takes a bite of a french fry
God, these are cold
So you're just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back
You sound like my mother
That's not very sexy
Are you trying to be sexy or be my friend
little of both
Roberta smiles, blushing a bit
Brian looks at her, getting an idea
You know,  know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school -- wrote a piece on her
It's a public school, but it's alternative -- she might be able to create some kind of gig for you
Let me give her a call
Great
(takes his last bite of sandwich) If she hires you, though, you have to be willing to relocate
Where is it
,    -   - as we see stores with Spanish names and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand
this is the  of Roberta from the back seat of a cab
The   plays on the cab's radio
Roberta looks scared shitless
Suddenly, two   flash down the middle of the street, dart   of the cab and the driver  on the brakes, jerking Roberta forward
Welcome to East Harlem
( 1) - -  - '  - , a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume
sign on her desk indicates that she's the
Also on the desk is a   of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and son (12)
Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her
(looking at resume) Aside from half a term in a private school -- in Greece -- and a year teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten years ago -- it doesn't look like you've had any other teaching experience
Well, not traditional teaching experience
've been doing private lessons
Janet looks for this on the resume
It's not on there
taught my sons
Janet smiles politely
'd like to help you, Mrs
Demetras
Brian spoke highly of you and  told him 'd consider starting a violin class
But without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an inner city school
Roberta nods, defeated
'm very sorry
1 -  - Roberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching the children noisily running through the hall
'  - Roberta knocks on Janet's door
(
) Yes
As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are with her
All three have violins
, Janet's in conversation with   (38), an uptight man with a tie that doesn't match his suit jacket
He's showing Janet a large scheduling chart
'm sorry to interrupt, but  wanted you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi
They enter
'  - Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a little off
Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis
Roberta Guaspari-Demetras
Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily
This is Dennis Rausch, our music teacher and program coordinator
(beat) Mrs
Demetras, didn't  make things clear yesterday
If  could just show you something -- it'll only take a minute
Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position
Janet and Dennis exchange a look
Are we having a talent show
should have brought my tap shoes
Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys
The three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an in three-part harmony
For the first measures, Janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over
Dennis watches impassively
Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and Dennis joins in to be polite
The three take bows
beat
Will you hire her now
Janet laughs, then gestures for them to sit
How long have you boys been playing
Since  was three
(contemplates, then) Maybe since  was three and a half
Your mom must be a good teacher
(shrugs) She's
Roberta gives Nick a look, but Janet smiles
(to Roberta) If you could teach our students to play like that, 'd be thrilled, but -- can
Any child can learn the violin
Assuming they had the discipline
'll teach them to have discipline
lot of our parents are struggling to feed their kids and pay the rent -- they don't have time to help them learn violin
They don't have to
If they can help, great -- but these kids will be committed
They'll practice on their own, they'll help each other in the classroom -- Dennis laughs
Roberta looks at him, a bit miffed
(with an edge) think  know these students, Miss Demetras
Their attention span doesn't go past do-re-mi
Maybe on a good day,  can get them to "fa
" You're underestimating them
They can play as well as any other kids
That 'd like to see
You will
beat
Janet observes the tension, then turns to Roberta
(to Roberta) For now 'll put you down as a sub, but  have to warn you -- even if it works out, the Board may not let me create a permanent position for you
That's
'll worry about that later
(with a grateful look) Thank you
We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face
(to Janet) Well, 've already planned out the whole term, and  can tell you right now, there's no room for this
Besides, where you gonna find money for violins
You need violins
- In a noisy music room with bad acoustics, Roberta tries to take control of fifty kids, third through fifth-graders, who are in a state of manic excitement over the on the floor
(gently) Please do not open the cases,
They ignore her
Look, can everyone just settle down and listen to me -- please
- Three girls open their cases
(starting to lose it) Keep them closed
Please
- Two boys open their cases
(to the boys) Did you hear what  just said
- Three kids are using the violin cases as pretend machine guns -- and shooting each other
Put those down, please
-  boy and a girl are having a "sword fight" with their bows
(to the fencers) Don't do that
Put the bows back in the cases -- right now
There's the  of violin strings being plucked
Who's plucking
Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin like a banjo, and doing a little dance
This is , a skinny Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion
What have  been saying
Put that away
Back in the case
Roberta takes a breath
The kids settle down a bit
Thank you
That's much better
(takes another breath) 'll be dividing you into five classes, but for today -- -  boy plays "bongos" on his violin case
-- that's it
You
Stand up
The bongo player stands
You will be the first student who will  be in my violin class
Out
The child looks stunned
said
With a sheepish expression, he exits
The room is finally quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked
She puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control
Who else would like to be kicked out of my class
The students stare at her, afraid of her now
, a small but tough Black boy, raises his hand
Are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out
Yeah
Why
don't wanna learn no stupid violin
It's for wimps
Who told you that
just know
What's your name
De Sean
Well, De Sean -- you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying
She looks around the room
Anyone else
Silence
- In front of the class, Roberta helps , a graceful Black boy, hold the violin
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek
Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, but it appears that the boy is playing music
He smiles
Hey,  play pretty good
Roberta laughs
(to Naeem) See how easy it is
(to the class) Maybe in the spring, we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school
(to the boy) What's your name
Naeem
Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring for violin sizes
(to class) If you listen to me and do exactly what  say, you're gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you're gonna be so proud of yourselves
(to Naeem) Good, Naeem
Your hand's staying soft
(to the class) But if you don't listen to me, you'll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you
They might even throw up
, not used to a teacher speaking like that
'  -   - funky apartment on the Upper West Side
Nick and Lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby
Brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne
He knocks on his office door
(
) Come in
'  -  - Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair
She's tidying up her suitcase, etc
, next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed
Leftist political books line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his own,    :     by His desk is covered with files and books pertaining to
Brian enters
(referring to champagne) What's this
It's a toast
(giving her a glass, holding his up) To Roberta, who's made it through her first week
They clink glasses and drink
don't know, Brian
'm hanging on by a thread there
Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me
Look at the progress
Didn't you say no one was listening to you on Monday
Roberta laughs
really appreciate all you've done for us
And  promise -- this weekend 'll start looking for a place
There's no rush
No, we've put you out enough
You're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us
(crosses to his desk, flips through his Vietnam book) 've started your book
It's very powerful
Thank you
Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck
Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening
So what made you choose migrant workers for your next book
mean, how do you know what to write about
(kissing her neck) follow my gut, pay attention to what 'm being drawn to
Roberta's aroused, in spite of herself
She turns around and faces him
What are you doing
've been waiting to do that since Mr
Baines' orchestra class
You didn't even notice me
Sure  did
You used to ignore me and it drove me wild
You had at least five different girlfriends
It didn't mean  had the one  wanted
He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her rollers
You're not a navy wife anymore
He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him
Yes  am
legally
And is it a navy requirement that you dress like it's the 1950's
do not
(goading her) Who did you vote for in the last election
What does that have to do with anything
Tell me
(hesitates, then) don't know
Charles filled out my absentee ballot
Oh my God -- it's even worse than thought
(touching her hair) Is this the same Roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave us new uniforms
She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad
That Roberta's not around anymore
He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe
don't believe that
They kiss and it heats up quickly
Roberta pulls back
shouldn't
Because
The boys -- They're sleeping
know, but
'm still married
And what's your husband doing right now
few beats, and she moves towards him
'  - Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed, a look of afterglow on her face
She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock
Oh shit -- the boys
(
) They're still sleeping
She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a suitcase
Where are you going
Texas
He dashes out
Roberta sits up, rattled by this news
'  - Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around his electric typewriter
(
) What's in Texas
He turns to see Roberta in the doorway
Farm workers
just got the call -- it came through -- my research grant
It came through
Isn't that great
Today
He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip
In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion
've got a few families lined up there, some in California -- How long will you be gone
Two, three months
What
'  - Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag
Roberta enters
thought
just thought you were gonna be around
And then last night -- He stops what he's doing and looks at her
Whoa
Roberta -- last night was great but did you think  was gonna marry you in the morning
No
Of course not
We see in her face that part of her did think that
It's just that
we just got here and we're barely
don't even know where to buy groceries
Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is
He takes her in his arms
You're gonna be fine
You have a job, a place to stay, your kids have a school to go to -- and there's a 'Agostino's around the corner
She attempts a smile
Congratulations
He kisses her forehead, then exits
, looking hurt and frightened
- Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to their violin cases
The kids are Black and Latino, with a couple of white faces
They're all talking and ignoring Roberta except for  and , a petite Mexican girl with a long dark braid
[: We'll see other violin students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow for Roberta's first year] And what am  doing now
/ Rosining the bow
Good
And what am  doing when turn this little screw
(raising her voice) Everyone stop talking
Right now
The kids quiet down
Only Naeem raises his hand
Naeem
Tightening the horse hair
(touches the heel of the bow) And what do we call this
Again, only Naeem raises his hand
Roberta sees him but turns to  , who's talking to his neighbor
De Sean
Yeah
What do we call this
don't know
Why not
wasn't here
Yes you were but you weren't paying attention
Do you want people to think you're stupid
This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off
All right, Naeem -- tell them
It's called the frog
Some kids giggle and joke about this
Roberta points to the scroll of the violin
Anyone remember what this is
, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers
Lucy
Do you like people snapping their fingers when you're talking
Yeah
The kids laugh
Roberta doesn't
She points to the scroll
What is this called
The jeri curl
Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough
'   - Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached theatre-style seats
Dennis sits at his desk, a ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red pen as a baton
He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen
---, ---, ---
- Roberta stands in the hallway at the open door, dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching
She enters and crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him
Excuse me -- sorry to interrupt -- The students immediately start to chatter
No talking
He looks back at Roberta, annoyed by her intrusion
'm supposed to take kids out of Miss Cooper's classroom for my ten o'clock class -- there's nobody there
Miss Cooper's students have phys ed on Tuesdays
But you scheduled them for violin
You must have read the schedule wrong
(trying to remain polite) don't think so
Well,  can't solve this problem for you right now
(nods to his class) 'm trying to teach
So am
She exits
'  - Lexi and Nick are in Brian's bed
Roberta's tucking in Lexi; he holds a toy truck with Greek writing on it
Can  bring a puppy for show and tell tomorrow
Honey, we don't have a puppy
Daddy said we could get one when we moved back to America
Roberta looks at Nick, then turns back to Lexi
How about your truck
'll bet you're the only one in school with a truck from Greece
When's Daddy coming back
Roberta turns to Nick and tucks him in
Well, he's still on his tour, so we'll just have to see but
It shouldn't be too much longer
Is he gonna live with us and Brian
No, honey
We're just staying at Brian's house for a little while
She turns back to Nick who looks worried
She kisses him
Good night, sweetie
She kisses Lexi, then reaches to turn off the lamp
No
Leave it on
Roberta nods, smiles at her sons, and exits
- Nine children stand, violins under their right arms, bows hanging down from their right hands, and try to position their feet as Roberta addresses them
Now take the right foot and put it on a tile
Good
Now with the other foot take a tiny step forward and put it on a line
Try to make a box with your feet -- She walks over to , a white boy with glasses, and corrects his feet
She sees Lucy dancing in place
Lucy
Would you like to leave the class right now
Lucy nods, giggling
Roberta walks down the row of students
You should feel very strong -- so strong and balanced that if  wanted to knock you over  couldn't
She crosses to , a sweet-natured Black girl with her hair in tiny braids, and gently pushes her belly
You see
If you're standing strong, can't even push you
Roberta turns to De Sean, who's talking to , a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy
De Sean
James
Quiet
(as she crosses to another student) Does anyone know where Naeem is
saw him this morning but he's not here
Yes,  know he's not here -- that's why 'm asking
She gently pushes Guadalupe's belly
The girl stumbles back
See how  pushed you
It means your feet aren't centered
Guadalupe tries to correct her feet
Roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears   under her pants
Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys
Can you bring over a chair
(to Guadalupe) It's probably better for you to sit
The boy brings the chair
Guadalupe sits, embarrassed
- Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up
She sees Naeem and crosses to him
Where were you today, Naeem
can't be in violin class anymore
Why not
My mother won't let me
What
' ,
, steps
She's an attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of African fabric
My son's got more important things to do than learn dead white men's music
They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
How many Black classical composers can you name
How many Black classical violinists do you know
That doesn't mean it's the way it should be
Naeem's learning to play music -- and that makes him feel good about himself
Why should it matter who wrote it
Please, Mom
Can't  be in the class
Mrs
Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then addresses Roberta
Look
've seen this before
You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place
No thank you
She walks off with Naeem
He glances back at Roberta, then turns away quickly
Roberta watches after them
'   - Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted
She glances at her purse, then back to the book
She puts the book down and dials the phone
Brian Turner's room, please
While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book jacket
There's no answer and she hangs up
She starts to straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures
- Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them
She's really depressed herself now
- (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her fifth-graders a globe
She doesn't turn as Roberta enters and crosses to her
In the b
g
we see ' waiting in
And which ocean is this
Kids simultaneously yell out "" and "
" Excuse me
'm here for the violin students
(icy) You're late
Just a couple of minutes -- 'm sorry
They're having a lesson now
But this is when they have violin class
That's not my problem
Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits
- Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up
thought all the teachers agreed to this
In theory
(to a student) Adam
want you in my office right after lunch, you understand
What'd  do
Think about it
(to Roberta) Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed
Some teachers resent it
Well, can't you talk to them
Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket
took this off a second-grader this morning
'll help you Roberta -- but  can't hold your hand here
Janet starts to walk away, then turns
word of advice
When you're picking up your students, go to Alice's classroom first
Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead
- The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta addresses them
So pretend you're driving a car and 'm the policeman and  say
Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat palm
Now you be policemen, but turn your hand and make it say stop to yourself
, attempting this
She walks around and helps
(to himself) You're under arrest
Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting
Knock it off, De Sean
(to all) If you kids can't take this seriously, don't want you here
'm teaching you a difficult instrument because respect you and have faith that you can learn it
But none of that matters if you don't have respect for yourself
Some of the children think about what she's saying
couple, uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles
Now turn your wrist so it's flat against the fingerboard, and that's how you'll set up your hand
Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling
Guadalupe
You've got the violin in the wrong hand
How did that happen
Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position
'  - At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts stickers in a sticker book
Roberta's cooking dinner; she grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the oven
The   and she answers it
Hello
(
) Hello, Bobbi
Her face falls as she hears the voice
She holds onto the counter to steady herself
Where are you
(
) (calm, detached) 'm back in the States
'm at my parents
Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage
Are you still with her
beat
(
) No
We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming relief
as she steps into  , then stretches the phone into: '  - She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts to cry
(through tears) We've missed you so much, Charles
The boys
they can't wait for you to come home
know we'll have a lot to work out and it won't be easy right away, but we're gonna get through this, you know
We're a family and we belong together and -- (
) (more emotive than before) Bobbi -- stop,
Just stop
Roberta looks as if she's been slapped
beat
(
) want a divorce
What
Silence
But you said
you and Lana
you said it was over
(
) It is
(beat) It's over between us too, Bobbi
, devastated
on , watching her through the door
'  ,  - Brian's on the phone with Roberta
He's in a t-shirt and sweats, and his papers are scattered on the bed
(
) He wouldn't even talk about it
No explanations, no discussion
Roberta in Brian's living room
She's extremely agitated and her eyes are puffy from crying
can't believe you were still holding out hope
The guy hasn't called you or the kids in three months -- thought you'd moved on
never said that
No
Maybe not with words
This embarrasses her, then pisses her off
You know what
shouldn't have called you
This was a mistake
No, no -- 'm sorry
Look,  know it hurts, but you're gonna get through this, Roberta -- you will
'm moving back to my Mom's
What
You're gonna quit teaching in the middle of the term
don't fit in there -- 'm not making any progress with the kids
What are you gonna tell Janet -- your husband left you and nothing else matters
don't know yet
'   - Roberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken
'  - Roberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep
She lies down beside them and closes her eyes
- Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in the middle of confronting a boy student
Janet holds a - Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to speak
My mother gave it to me
Why would she give you fifty dollars
To buy breakfast
Janet gives him a stern look
Do you know how hard your mother works
Do you think it's right for you steal from her
didn't
Well let's go call her right now and ask her
As Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her
need to speak to you
It's important
It'll have to wait
(to the boy) Come on
In my office
Roberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow
- Guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to set up her violin
Roberta enters, surprised to see her
Guadalupe
What are you doing here
can't get the stop sign
Honey, your teacher's probably looking for you
Guadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin
can't come anymore
It's too hard
The violin is hard for everyone
But everyone else is better than me
'll always be slow
Roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case
Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman
No
He's one of the greatest violinists in the world, and he has problems with his legs too
He walks with two canes -- but he still makes the most beautiful music
And he sits down when he plays
He has to
Guadalupe takes this in
He was your student
Roberta laughs
No
But if he was, 'd tell him the same thing 'm telling you
You shouldn't quit something just because it's hard
But  can't stand strong
Standing strong doesn't only mean using your legs
You can stand strong on the inside too
(beat) Know what  mean
Guadalupe nods
Roberta holds out the violin case
Guadalupe lunges forward and hugs her around the waist
Roberta awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and strokes the girl's hair
Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin and exits
as she absorbs what just happened
pokes her head into the room
You wanted to speak to me
Oh
Umm -- that's
It's taken care of
Janet looks at her curiously, then exits
-   - Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her expression somber
Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen
An older Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place
Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows
Is just for you and your boys
Yes
No husband
No boyfriend
beat
No
-   - Roberta enters the yard from inside the school
It's filled with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi
She waves to them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork
Look what  made you, Mommy
He gives her a tempera  of a man's face, the background decorated with glued-on macaroni
It says
(covering her discomfort) That is so beautiful
He runs off
Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and takes out her lunch
She smiles at   and another but they cross to another bench
(25) approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New York accent
Whatsa matter -- you got cooties
Apparently
'll take my chances
(extends a hand) Isabel Vasquez
Second grade
Roberta Demetras
'm the -- Violin teacher
know
She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch
Is it my imagination, or does everyone hate me
It's hard to fit in when you're doing a special program
People figure you're not gonna be here very long, so why make the effort
(beat) It may take a while for folks to warm up, but nobody hates you
(sotto) What about Alice Crowley
(sotto) ) she thinks the violin's a waste of time
and ) -- she's a bitch
Roberta laughs
And then there's Dennis
The Music Man
You've had the bodacity to threaten his private little empire -- not to mention the fact that you messed up his sacred scheduling chart
How come you're being nice to me
Ulterior motives
want my daughter in your class next year
Roberta smiles
If 'm here next year
You will be

She's gotten some used furniture, cleaned the place, and it's less depressing
' On the street below, three prostitutes stand at the corner
Two men sit on a stoop, smoking a joint, and in a parked car, three men seem to be making a drug deal
One of the buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door
Nick, in his pajamas, enters and crosses to his mother
She smiles at him and they both look out the window
In Greece, we could see the ocean
Remember
remember
And the fishing boats
And the octopuses
Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him
Is Daddy coming here soon
Roberta tenses up
Well, that's something 've been wanting to talk to you about
Daddy's not gonna live with us anymore
You and Lexi will have special times when you stay with him, like at Christmas
beat
Can you tell the birthday story
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news
Don't you want to talk about what told you
want to hear the birthday story
beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then: It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, and  was sad because he had died a few months back
But you knew 'd be born that day
So  packed a bag and got all ready -- And Daddy laughed
said, "It's my father's birthday, and the baby's gonna be born today
" He didn't believe you
But  was born
The same day as Grandpa
It was a happy day
Was Daddy happy too
She looks at him, taken aback by the question
Of course he was
Then why is he leaving me
Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer
He's not leaving you, Nick
He loves you and Lexi very much
Then why can't he live here
(struggling) It's very hard to explain
Sometimes things happen between grown-ups
and they just can't be together
The  moves behind them as they continue to look out the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother
- The kids play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and they sound awful
Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them
Slow bows
Slow bows
Don't squeeze
Stop
Everybody stop
(to De Sean) How much did you practice this week
My asthma -- it was very bad and had to go to the hospital
Again
You told me you went to the hospital last week
Oh yeah
Maybe it was last week
Roberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy
Lucy -- you sounded the worst of all
Have you practiced
No
Why not
You can't be in this class if you don't practice
My grandma got mugged
beat
Oh
'm sorry
Is she
She died
Roberta stands there, sobered
'm really sorry, Lucy
(tries to get her bearings) Just do the best you can
- group of kids stand together with their violins and chat
Roberta exits the building and they greet her
She waves back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with Lucy
She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them
Hi, Roberta
Hi, Naeem
Can  talk to your mom for a minute
Naeem nods and moves off
Look,  didn't come up here to rescue anybody
'm a single mother and needed a job
And  know you think you're protecting your son, but you're not
mean, what if Arthur Ashe's mother had stopped him from playing tennis because it's a "white man's game"
(beat) The important thing is that when Naeem plays music, his whole face lights up
You should see him
Mrs
Adisa takes this in
Roberta exits
Mrs
Adisa looks for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing to be among them
She watches her son with compassion
- Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market in their neighborhood
The boys suddenly rush over to   sitting on the ground with mixed-breed  in a cardboard box
The boys pet them excitedly
Roberta watches her sons; they're happier than she's seen them in ages
'  -   - brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh delightedly
Roberta is putting down newspapers
We all have to take turns cleaning up,
The boys are oblivious to her -- they're in heaven
(to herself) Yeah, right
- Roberta's  at the kids as they play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
" First finger on the
Three -- two -- one -- open
(to a white girl with pigtails) Wrong string, Becky
We've done this fourteen times
And look at your nails
You're supposed to cut them for violin class
, everybody stop
It sounds horrible
can't believe how bad it sounds
They stop playing
Tanisha raises her hand
Is this an important question, Tanisha
Tanisha nods
Do you have two of those skirts
What
You wore a skirt just like it on Monday
Some of the kids crack up
You know, Tanisha --  don't think that's such an important question
(to class) Let's try -- The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs
Adisa
Roberta crosses to them
Naeem and  were wondering if he could still be in the class
beat
'd love that
(to Naeem) You'll have a lot of catching up to do
You think you can work that hard
Yeah,  can
Maybe we can also arrange some private lessons at my house
wouldn't have the money for that
That's
(to Naeem) Why don't you go grab one of my spare violins
Naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the room; Mrs
Adisa nods to Roberta with a look of gratitude, then exits
Roberta crosses back to the front of the room
(to class) Let's try it again
They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and join in
As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something she's hearing
She crosses to Lucy
What are you playing
Twinkle
(to class) Everyone stop
(to Lucy) Let me hear
Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble
She plays a jazz variation of the song
Roberta smiles
Did someone teach you that
No
made it up
That's really great, Lucy
'm proud of you
Lucy beams
(to class) All of you -- try it
The class plays Lucy's jazz variation and Naeem happily joins in
'  - Roberta sits opposite Janet and
, a white woman in her 30's
You're shouting at them
All the time
Not all the time
But if they don't listen -- Didn't you tell them that they were making their parents sick
Janet raises her eyebrows at this
That wasn't exactly what  said -- 'm raising Becky in a supportive atmosphere
don't send her to school to be abused
'm just trying to discipline them
If they're gonna learn an instrument, they need to take it seriously -- think what Mrs
Lamb is trying to say, Roberta, is that you're a little too harsh
'm sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children
She gives Roberta a long hard look
Roberta nods
- Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" -- badly
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response
Well, that was
that was pretty good
that wasn't too bad
They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other
It wasn't
thought we stunk
wouldn't put it that way
You all just need to practice a bit more
(to James) James, have you practiced this week
The boy nervously shakes his head no
Can you please try a little harder for next week
James nods
The kids are baffled by her politeness
Good
Just do the best you can
Why you acting like that
Like what
Nice
Don't you want a nice teacher
already got nice teachers
You added some variety
Yeah
We like you better the way you used to be
Oh
(to Becky) What about you, Becky
Yeah
This is even worse
You're acting weird now
beat
Well, then --  take it back
You all stunk
The kids laugh
But don't tell your parents  said so
The kids laugh again

as Roberta kisses and hugs Lexi and Nick goodbye
stands nearby
Can't you come with us
Please
Honey,  told you
This is Daddy's special time with you
Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic
Roberta hugs them one last time
The   steps forward
'll take good care of them
The   escorts them into the jet way
Roberta holds back tears as they get further away from her
At the last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not
Roberta waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from sight
She observes all the families travelling together, and feels like the loneliest person in the airport
'  -   - Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and double-locks the door behind her
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness
She crosses to a small Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and plugs in the tiny blinking lights
It's not exactly Rockefeller Center
She turns on the

She sits down on the couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles some on top, then drinks
She sighs, glancing miserably at the tree and the
Pathetic
She couldn't look any less festive if she tried
There's a  on the
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door
Who is it
(
) Santa Claus
She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the door and opens it, revealing , giving her a big smile
He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other

Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him
She embraces him, and they kiss passionately

Brian, Roberta, and a couple of workmen knocking down the walls in an old brownstone

Roberta, covered with plaster dust and overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a beer
The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken windows, and the front stairs need repairing

We can see from the   that we're on 118th , a few houses off
Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a football

Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of breath
He takes a swig of her beer

You trying to kill me
She laughs and they kiss

She casts a dubious glance at the lovers

Roberta rolls her eyes

You hear that
Gunshots
How you gonna live here by yourself
(calling) Boys, come eat
work in this neighborhood, Mama want to live here
The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches
Lawrence hangs back
Assunta calls to him
What's your name
Lawrence
You hungry, Lawrence
Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich
Roberta smiles at her mother's gesture
The kids move off to Lawrence's front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches
(to Brian) Why did you let her buy this house
Hey, your daughter does what she wants -- or haven't you noticed
've noticed
'  -  - Robert washes dishes and Assunta dries
The leftovers from an Italian dinner are on the counter
still don't understand the rush
Having my own place will make me feel like 'm really starting my life again
But if you invested your divorce settlement, you could buy something nice someday
It's bad enough that you've been renting in this neighborhood, but to lock yourself into a mortgage -- (snapping) Mama, please
Just stop
Assunta backs off
Roberta feels guilty and moves to her
Don't worry,
Besides, if things keep going well, 'm sure eventually Brian will move in with us
few beats
How much do you know about this man
Brian's a good person, he's helped me a lot, he's great with the boys -- since he got back to town, it's been really sweet
(with an attitude) And how long has he been back
Two months
That's not very long
Don't make the same mistake twice, Bert
You barely knew Charles when you married him
(defensive) don't get it -- you're ragging on me about buying the house --  would think you'd want Brian to live with me
Not if he's the wrong person
Roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's right
- The kids play "Allegro," Roberta leading them
Get ready, now -- we're coming up to the fermata
They reach a certain note, then pause
Hold
Hold
Don't anybody move
Now at the Spring Concert, the audience is gonna be dying for that next note -- but we'll make them wait
As a matter of fact,  think 'll go grab a cup of coffee
She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: "Come on, Roberta
" "Roberta, get back here
" She smiles
Well,
But you have to promise you'll all start together
She nods
They begin again -- all at different times
Man
We'll never get that right
That's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates
(to class) How many people think they can get it right by the concert
All the kids raise their hands
De Sean looks around, embarrassed, then raises his too
Roberta smiles
'  -   - Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon
They lie in each other's arms, still breathing heavily
love you
Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing
Did you just laugh
'm sorry
It's just
Roberta looks at him, offended
What
Why do people feel like the minute something's going great, they gotta name it
(beat) Once you name something, you snuff the life out of it
She disentangles from him
Jesus, Brian
Do you still get away with that crap
It's not the Sixties anymore
Well, maybe if you'd actually gone through the Sixties, you'd know what 'm talking about
Fine
We won't name it, we won't talk about it, we'll act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever
She angrily turns on her side with her back to him
Brian regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder
'm sorry
'm being an asshole
(sweetly teasing) You can say you love me if you want
Forget it
changed my mind
He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce
- (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall
Roberta approaches
How's it coming, Ernie
Well, if  could just remember what did here yesterday, 'd be moving a whole lot faster
(beat) You look real pretty today, honey
Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside
You're crazy
Why did you hire him
He needed a job
Besides, he's wired all of East Harlem
When
Fifty years ago
Brian sighs and walks off into another room
Two  carry in large panels of sheetrock with old  on it
Why is there wallpaper on it
#1 That's how it comes
They lean the panels against a wall
Roberta turns to Ernie
Yep, that's how it comes now
The guys quickly exit
Brian re-enters and sees the panels
What the hell is this
Sheetrock
You've gotta be kidding
Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off -- and you too
Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it
Look -- this house is taking every penny of my settlement
can't afford fancy union workers
(throwing up his hands) Fine
Do it your way
He stomps off
- Nick watches them fight and looks distressed
- Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a fight in progress
As we move through the crowd we see that 's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding and he has the boy in a headlock
run over to break it up
'  - Nick sits outside, holding an ice pack to his bloody nose
'  - Roberta stands opposite Janet
'm giving him a two-day suspension -- but next time he'll be expelled
There won't be a next time -- promise
Have you noticed your son lately
He's tied up in knots and he needs help
Janet, kids fight
You're making too much of this
He was choking the kid
(beat) Nick's in trouble, Roberta
You need to deal with it
Roberta takes this in, upset

Lexi plays along with them
Nick enters from the kitchen, eating a cookie, ignoring the students
He turns on the

Roberta crosses to Nick and shuts off the
You can watch when we're done
It's my house
They don't live here -- do

You could probably give them some pointers
don't feel like it
He reaches for the
dial and she stops him

She crosses back to her students; Nick turns on the
- Brian, Nick and Lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a Roberta watches, relieved to see Nick enjoying himself
Good catch Nick
Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the
(mock sternly) Uh-oh
You know what that means
He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends he's going to throw him into the water
Nick laughs hysterically
(through laughter) Don't
Don't throw me in
Whatsa matter
Afraid of a little water
The ducks aren't afraid
Are you a chicken or a duck
Don't
Don't throw me
Looks like you got yourself a chicken, Roberta
'm not a chicken
Well then you must be a duck
He pretends again to throw Nick in, then puts him down
Lexi holds out his arms to Brian
Throw me in the water, Brian
Do it to me
Brian swoops him up and Lexi starts laughing
Roberta laughs along, happy to see the affection between Brian and her sons
- Brian and Roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead of them, dragging sticks along the pavement
In the b
g
we see   bordering the park
You seem to be the only one who can get Nick to laugh these days
He misses his dad
'm just a surrogate
No --  think Nick really likes you
(taking his arm) You know
we're all hoping you'll move into the new house with us
Whoa
Can we just slow down here a minute
It's too much like getting married
What's so bad about that
That kind of commitment just isn't realistic
mean, how can we know that you and  will even be able to stand each other in five years
Well, we don't
But if two people care about each other, they take a chance
And look what happened to you and Charles
'm not talking about Charles
'm talking about us
Look, Roberta
Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs
just don't buy that
This is making her nervous
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying
(carefully) What are you saying
If there's some need you have that  don't meet, you'd go and get it "met" by someone else
He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question
'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days
One out of two marriages ends in divorce
You didn't answer my question
(beat) If  don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship -- forget marriage for a minute; 'm just talking about a relationship -- would you go to someone else
beat
In theory, yes
In theory
Roberta looks very disheartened
Brian feels badly
Roberta, we've got something good right now -- that's the important thing
Let's just keep it that way, He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away from him
, observing with an anxious expression
'  - (
) (whining) Why can't he
Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park
He just can't,
Brian's at his house tonight, and we're at ours
Well then  wanna go to his house
Enough, Nick
Now why don't you and your brother practice while  make dinner
don't feel like practicing
Well do it anyway
wanna go to Brian's
Stop whining, and get your violin
Nick stomps off to get his violin
Lexi follows
Roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat
While Lexi sets up his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly
What the hell are you doing
The problem with you is you're mean to everybody and then they don't want to be with you
've heard just about enough from you, young man
Now set your violin up properly and start practicing
Nick  the violin against the floor
Roberta's speechless
hate the violin
You pick that violin up right now and don't you ever ever -- Nick picks up the violin and  the violin down even harder, then  at Roberta before she can even respond
It's all your fault
You made Daddy leave and you're gonna make Brian leave too
You're gonna be all alone and 'll have to take care of you
Roberta is stunned
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about
Nick -- you don't have to take care of me
Then who's going to
'll take care of myself -- and 'll take care of you and Lexi
promise
You didn't try hard enough
You made Daddy leave us
This hits her in the solar plexus
Her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out
That's not true
begged him not to leave, but he didn't listen
Why not
Roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth
She addresses both boys
Your father met someone he liked more than Mommy, and then -- Who
Roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this
She can hardly answer him
Lana
Remember our friends Lana and Tom
Is he gonna marry her now
No, but he's not coming back
to me
Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain
Roberta moves closer to them
'll take care of you, Nick
You too, Lexi
promise
'm not going anywhere
We're still a family
Nick starts crying
Roberta takes him in her arms
Lexi starts to cry and Roberta holds him too

Eggshells are white
Brian watches this interaction as he sands a door
You're an idiot

You're right

Wake up, Ernie
He looks at her groggily
You're fired

That's more like it
You're fired too
Brian laughs
No, Brian

need that, and my sons need that
(beat) So can you

Get out
He looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't give her what she wants
He exits
Roberta stands in the middle of the room, a determined look on her face
- Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin
The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations
Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific
As the   the audience, we recognize:
, tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem;
and her husband, watching Becky in amazement;  and her daughter sitting with ,  and ; , impressed as hell; and , seething with jealousy
As the kids start the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a  elbows her husband: That's the one Lucy wrote
The  returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing, including , who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty
- The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the fermata
They hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation
Roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison
An involuntary smile lights on 's face
They finish the song, the audience applauds, and Roberta turns to face them
She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta
: 1 -  -  -   (1998) The side of the building now has an impressive mural: an urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican, Black, and white -- rising up out of the street
It reads - Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first- graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting on the floor, chatting excitedly
Even though Roberta's ten years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic
Beside her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who looks pretty much the same
The classroom teacher is , a little older, a little tougher
'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet wants to talk to you
Today's a very special day because we're starting the tenth year of the East Harlem Violin Program
This is a wonderful opportunity for you, so want you to talk to your parents about whether you'd like to try this
My daughter took violin with Roberta when she was your age, and now she's in high school and she still talks about how much she loved it
Janet and  started this program because we knew how much you kids could benefit from it

You should know, however, that the violin is a difficult instrument

Roberta's gonna explain to you about the "lottery
" Roberta steps forward
(7), a small, adorable Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration
used to just teach fifty kids at this school
But now  teach a hundred and fifty kids at three East Harlem schools and there's so many children who want to take violin classes that we have to have a lottery
raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and accessories are always adorned with cats
Can  be in the class
Roberta's explaining that
Just listen
After your parents sign your permission slips, 'm gonna put them in a sack, and 'll pick fifty names from each school
- Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed
So everyone bring in your slips by Friday, and 'll come back and tell you who's in violin class
Remember, she's just picking names from a hat
It doesn't mean that anyone's better than anyone else
raises his hand
(to Roberta) really really hope that  get in the class
Roberta looks at him, struck by his sweetness
hope so too
118TH  -   -  - '  - The brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it
Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming in pots in front of the building
Roberta steps  , walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog
- The house is transformed: the first floor is one long open room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block
(17) practices cello and  (15) practices piano; they play Haydn's "Trio #13
" Now handsome young men, their blonde hair has darkened to brown
Nick is huskier; Lexi has a slighter build
Both are passionate, talented musicians
On the couch,  (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl, rosins her bow
How come you guys don't play the violin
Well, picture her being your teacher and your mother
Rachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as Roberta enters from outside with Allegra
Hi Rachel
Be right with you
As Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a conspiratorial look
In the b
g
, Nick packs up his cello
(to Nick) You're gonna practice upstairs
No
'm done
Already
You've barely practiced
What -- are you timing me with a stop watch
Why don't you pick on Lexi for a change
'Cause 'm perfect
Nick jostles him and heads upstairs
Lexi gets up from the piano
(to Rachel) Have a good lesson
He crosses to a sharp-looking bike parked behind the front door and addresses Roberta
'll be back in a couple of hours
Be careful
Lexi mouths "be careful" along with her
- Lexi plays basketball with a group of Black and Latino guys
Despite his small stature, he's a great athlete, and an accepted part of the group
The game ends
He and his buddy Lawrence (now 16), both all sweaty, cross to a water fountain
As Lexi takes a drink -- (
) Can  try your bike
Lexi wipes his mouth and looks up at  (18), a tall, intimidating Black teenager who towers over him
Lawrence watches tensely
'm gonna be leaving pretty soon
Just wanna take it for a spin
'mon, Henry -- he don't want to loan you his bike
didn't hear him say that
(to Lexi) Is that true
Did you say that
Lexi looks at him, knowing there's only one right answer
- Roberta and Rachel play Bach's "Minuet One" together on the violin
The girl has obvious talent
Vibrato
don't wiggle your wrist
Rachel stops, frustrated
Dang
can't get that right
You almost have it
Almost isn't good enough
Did  turn you into such a perfectionist
No
came that way
(smiles, then) Just as long as you get it right for your Julliard audition
What
've recommended you for a gifted kids scholarship
Rachel looks at her in wide-eyed gratitude
- Lexi enters the front door, a glum look on his face
Where's the bike
/
- Roberta drives with Nick in the front, Lexi and Lawrence in the back
They're in a dangerous looking part of East Harlem
Mom, please
Don't do this to me
'mon, Mom -- why don't you let me handle this
Are we getting closer, Lawrence
It's the next block up
(to Roberta) You don't have to do this
'll pay you back
How
It took me six months to save up for it
'll help him,
We'll both pay you back
Or we'll ask Dad -- he'll help us out
Yeah, right
, slow down
It's the second one on the right
Roberta slows the car down next to a
- Not a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time
this is their  from
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission
'mon Mom, let's get out of here
Lock the doors
And she exits
The boys watch as she heads for the building, then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face
'm dead
She's gonna get me killed
Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her
'm coming with you
No
Get back in the car and stay with the boys
Nick hesitates and heads back
Roberta presses on
Lawrence opens the window and calls to her
Don't take the stairs
-  - with a handwritten  that reads - Roberta stands in front of the elevator, staring tensely at the sign
She takes a deep breath, then heads for the staircase
-  - Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building
a  , a couple of 's
-  - At the top of the stairs, Roberta turns down the hall, passing a door riddled with bullet holes
She finds the apartment and knocks
No response
She knocks again
(
) Yeah
'm a school teacher
Henry has taken my son's bicycle and  want it back
beat, then the door cracks open, an   visible through the chain lock
Henry's not here
Well you tell Henry that if he returns the bike,  won't have to notify the police -- or his school principal
Although since  am a teacher, it would be very easy for me to do that
couple of beats
He's not home
He doesn't get home till late
How late
Not till after ten
'll be on the steps of  1 at 11 'll be waiting for him
The door closes
Roberta exhales
Did she just do that
1 - Roberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of the school
The street is deserted
You're crazy
He's not gonna show
Roberta sits confidently
You think he actually cares that you're a teacher
You think he even goes to school
'mon, Mom -- let's just go
It's only five after eleven
Nick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's nuts
Suddenly, there's the  of a bicycle
Nick, Lexi and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous
Lexi stands
Henry rides up on the bike and dismounts
Lexi looks directly at him as he takes the bike from him
was just borrowing it
He glances at Roberta, then walks off
1 -  - Roberta stands in front of Isabel's class and calls out names, handing the selected children acceptance letters
The kids are charged up; "My heart is pounding
" "Please pick me
" Shandra Wilson
pretty Black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps up and down, then runs up for her letter
The kids and  for each student called
Shandra hugs her best friend , a chubby Black girl who also holds a letter
Justin Brady
raises his fists in triumph
-  anxiously waits to see if his name will be called
sits down next to him, waves his letter in Ramon's face, taunting him
Vanessa Klein
Vanessa takes her letter and smiles
She puts it into her cat-shaped backpack
One more name
Ramon crosses his fingers and holds his breath
Leonard Hood
looks crushed
taunts him some more
, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it
He starts to cry
It's too hard
don't wanna do it
Don't you even wanna try, Leonard
(through tears) don't want to
Isabel looks at Roberta
Well,
then
'll pick someone else
(she picks a name) Ramon Olivas
Ramon's face lights up
- As Roberta walks through the yard, she sees kids excitedly showing acceptance letters to their moms
and  hold hands as they run to Shandra's mom, , pushing a stroller
She looks at the letter and hugs Shandra
-  reads his letter to his mother, (45), whose eyes tell you that she's lived through a lot
She speaks with a Puerto Rican accent
This is to inform you that your child, Ramon Olivas, has been chosen by lottery to be in the violin program
You happy
Ramon spins round and round with the letter in his hand
think you're happy
- Roberta illegally parks her old Honda, rushes out of the car, grabs her book bags and three violins, pulls a parking ticket from her pocket and puts it on the windshield
'  (
) (German accent) Does that really work
Roberta turns
It's , the  we saw in the classroom
No
But  keep trying
And maybe someday the school will give me a parking space
She rushes towards the school and Dorothea follows her
Wait -- She hands Roberta a thin box
Roberta puts down her violins, glances inside it and forgets about being late
-- Terrific black and white shots of Roberta's advanced classes playing violin
(
) God, these are great
Those copies are for you
Thank you
Can
pay for you them
Don't be silly
Besides -- you'll need your money for parking tickets
They smile at each other
What you're doing for these children is wonderful
My husband's a violinist -- he was quite impressed when  told him about you
What's his name
Arnold Steinhardt
Of the Guarneri String Quartet
Dorothea nods, and hands Roberta a card
Stay in touch
Let us know when the kids have a concert
, heading for school, calls out to Roberta
Don't be late for violin class hear the teacher's really mean
Roberta smiles, slips the card in her pocket, nods to Dorothea and follows Rachel
-   - Roberta's advanced class plays "Can-Can
" Rachel's one of the eight sixth-graders
Roberta plays along, crossing to , a white girl in a country-western outfit
Amanda, what did  tell you about wearing cowboy boots to violin class
They're too slippery
She crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses
Relax your two, Simon
She glances at , a white girl with red hair, next to , a Black boy with an earnest expression
Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny
Stephanie, it doesn't look like you ever had a lesson with me
(13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball jacket that says "
" He looks 15
Where's your violin, Carlos
It's coming
He nervously looks down the hall
What, is it walking here by itself
Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos his violin, then runs off
Roberta crosses to Carlos as he quickly readies the violin
Your buddies giving you a hard time
Look, it's just not cool
You wouldn't understand
Hey, you want your sister to carry your violin, that's fine
But is she practicing for you too
Because lately, that's how it sounds
've been busy
've been -- 'm not interested
Just get here on time, and commit to this class or don't want you in here, you understand
He nods sullenly
You're a good violinist, Carlos -- and it's definitely not "cool" to waste your own talent
Carlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student
'  -   -  - It's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street
'  -   - Ramon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with Legos, while his parents argue in the
His father is a stocky, muscular man
between the two areas
This is a modest, well-kept apartment
Off the kitchen, religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine
Why didn't you show it to me
It just needed one parent's signature
(with some Spanish) Well, 'm his parent and  don't give permission
He should be playing baseball, not the violin
It makes him happy
, looking far from happy at the moment
- Rachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin
She passes two sixth-grade boys and a girl
#1 (loudly) Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead
She carry that violin with her all the time 'cause she think she special
Rachel turns to them
am special
She proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards the school and catches up to her
(nonchalant) So  heard from Julliard
Roberta stops and looks at her
And
They said yes
Roberta gives her a big hug
1 -   - ' , including Ramon, as they play "Lightly Row
" Roberta walks around, making corrections as she addresses the students
She doesn't see Justin poking Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at his nemesis
Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away from the violin
So when you take the violins home, tape your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play with perfect posture
Your parents are gonna be so excited to hear you play
'  -   - comes from Ramon's room as he practices "Lightly Row
" His brothers,  (18) and  (17), cringe as they try to watch
Ernesto gives up and puts on his Walkman; Pedro's ready to break the violin
Concepcion listens patiently as she folds laundry, but even she winces
(yelling) Ramon
How many cats you killing in there
- He plays with pride, eyes on the music taped to the wall
1 -   -  (   ) , his improved playing showing that time has passed
- the beginner's class plays "Lightly Row
" is struggling more than the other students
Roberta plays along with the class, eyeing each student
More bow
To the frog
Myesha, your stop sign line should be touching
Don't let it wiggle
You're on the wrong string, Justin
And look at your feet
Vanessa enters the front door without her violin
Where's your violin
forgot
Goodbye
And you may be dropped
Vanessa pouts and exits
Roberta moves to , a Puerto Rican girl
Look at those nails, Rosario
She pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them
nervously glances at her own nails
see you over there, Myesha
She moves to Ramon and corrects his bowing position
(to Ramon) You're doing much better
As Roberta walks on to the next student, Justin purposely knocks over Ramon's music stand
Drop dead, Justin
It was a accident
Was not
Ramon,  don't like that kind of talk
Justin, pick up his stand, now
Our spring concert is in three weeks and you might not be in it
Is that what you want
1 - As Roberta heads for her car, she sees Vanessa being helped into a car by her , his suit wrinkled and tie loosened
There's  on the ground
Mr
Klein
'm gonna have to drop Vanessa from the class if she keeps forgetting her violin
(sotto) She's going back and forth between houses
My wife and  split up
(softening) Oh
'm sorry
Roberta leans into the car window
Vanessa, maybe you could write down for your Mom and Dad which days are violin days
(almost in tears) The tape doesn't stick
What
taped the music to the wall at my Mom's house and then  took it to my Dad's house and it doesn't stick anymore
Mr
Klein's eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them
Well you know what
That's an easy problem to solve
She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music and gives it to her
Now you have two,
One for each house
Vanessa nods, clutching the piece of music
Roberta and Mr
Klein exchange a look
She touches his arm, then walks off
'  - Ramon, holding his bow and violin, crosses to his father who's watching a baseball game on
You wanna hear my new song, Papa
(in Spanish) Not right now
Ramon exits, hurt
Concepcion watches from the side, and crosses to her husband
We made mistakes with Pedro and Ernesto and we can't fix them now, but Ramon -- he works so hard
The violin makes him want to be good at everything
He shows no response, and she exits
Manuelo ponders what she said
1   -  () Roberta approaches the school on a winter morning
She smiles as she sees Vanessa get out of her ' car with her violin
Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and some teachers huddled in conversation
few students are crying
(to Isabel) What happened
- The beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows
few chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for  who is "blessing" kids with his violin bow
You go to heaven
You go to hell
You go to hell
heaven
Roberta enters slowly
She looks very shaken up
She takes note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and Shandra in mid-conversation
My grandpa died and my uncle, so that makes six
know more than that
At least seven people
maybe even nine
Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on a child-sized chair in front of them
(quietly) know that you've all heard the bad news about Justin
didn't hear
There was a drive-by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died
Myesha takes this in, looking sad
Does anyone want to talk about it
(angry) think we should just play violin
Roberta watches him
'  -  /  - Concepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling along to Ramon's
violin playing "We Shall Overcome
" There's a  on the door
Concepcion answers it, revealing Roberta
Roberta
Come in
Roberta enters
came by to check on Ramon
(confused) Why
Didn't he tell you what happened at school
Concepcion shakes her head no
'  - Ramon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter
When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more
Roberta wants to talk to you,
He nods
Concepcion touches his head, then exits
Did that sound
Yeah, it did
Ramon smiles, pleased with himself
've been thinking about Justin
Remember how mad  got the last time saw him
Yeah
You got very strict with him
It wasn't always so easy to be nice to him, you know
Ramon looks away from her, upset
You think Justin's in heaven or hell
Heaven
Ramon runs his fingers along his bow
told him to drop dead
Roberta touches Ramon's back
Justin didn't die because of what you said
promise
How do you know
don't think you're that powerful, do you
mean, if you had such powers, just imagine what kind of violin player you'd be by now
Yeah
'd be better than you
They laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again
It's
to cry, you know
Not for a man
My boys still cry and they're big, strong young men now
(beat) bet Justin's daddy cried
Ramon's eyes get teary
Roberta quietly leaves the room
'  -  -  () '  -   - Roberta brings in the mail, looking curiously at a manila envelope with a return address from the
She opens it, looks inside, then pours out a batch of other letters onto the table
They're addressed to   127
She opens one, reads it, then rushes to an
Nick, Lexi
Get down here right now
'  - We were just trying to help
Nick and Lexi stand by the table, opposite Roberta -- with the incriminating pile of letters between them
This is humiliating
Mom, no one knows it's you
mean, you don't even have to read them if you don't want to
(glances at pile) Although obviously, a lot of guys are interested in dating you
No
lot of guys are interested in dating you and Lexi
(beat) What did you say about me, anyway
They thought she'd never ask
"Beautiful musician, late 40's, tired of playing solo -- -- seeks a healthy, stable, attractive man who's not afraid of a duet with a strong, independent woman
My violin playing will feed your soul
And my lasagna will be music to your palate
" They beam with pride
Roberta looks at them, mortified
Oh, my God
Did you catch all the music metaphors
Don't you think it's a little weird that you're trying to get your mother a date
Don't you think it's a little weird that you're not even interested in dating
Boys, look
Number one -- even if wanted to date,  don't have time
And number two -- 've got my teaching, 've got you guys -- that's all  need
The boys nod, disappointed, and she exits
They look at each other with glum expressions
(to Nick) really thought she'd like the music metaphors
'  -   - Roberta lies on the couch, reading the personal ad letters
She tosses one aside, then opens another
The letter is designed like a newspaper with a headline that reads:       ; Roberta can't help but be charmed
'  -   - Roberta, Nick and Lexi play Haydn's "Trio #13" together on their respective instruments
We sense that this is a special family ritual
They play throughout their conversation: think you're flat, Nick
'm not flat
The  sounded flat
Just play the violin, Mom
'll take care of the cello
They play for a few beats
You nervous, Mom
No
'm fine
The  rings and Roberta jumps up, bolting into the bathroom down the hall
Lexi and Nick exchange a smile, then Lexi crosses to the door and opens it
- Standing in the doorway is a man in casual college professor attire
He's nice-looking, but no Prince Charming
He shakes Lexi's hand and smiles warmly
Hi
'm Dan Paxton
Lexi shows him in
'  - - Roberta takes a last look at herself, wondering if he'll find her attractive
She touches her hair, adjusts her dress, then takes a deep breath as she builds up her courage
'  -   - Roberta enters the living room where Dan is chatting with Nick and Lexi
Dan sees her and is instantly smitten
(shaking her hand) Wow
An honest woman
Honest
Your ad
When you said you were beautiful, you were telling the truth
She smiles, blushing, and avoids eye contact with her sons who are trying really hard not to laugh
As she and Dan start to exit: Make sure you're home by midnight, young lady
'  -   - It reads 12:30
- Nick and Lexi play a video game on the  screen
, there's the
They race to the window
Ten bucks he tries to kiss her
That's a no-brainer
Of course he'll try
The real question is whether she'll let him
-- ten bucks she lets him
You're on
They stare out the window intently
'  - Dan pulls his car up in front of Roberta's house
Beside him, Roberta holds a program from a Lincoln Center concert
Roberta's tense, but Dan seems relaxed and centered in his attraction to her
had a lot of fun tonight
Yeah,  did too
have a confession -- 've never answered an ad before
did it on a dare
Well,  have a confession -- my boys placed the ad behind my back
They both laugh, then smile at each other
An awkward beat: will he or won't he
Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta turns away, uncertain
Look, Dan --  went along with this 'cause it's been a while
Quite a while
And  had a very nice time
but 'm not sure if 'm ready to get involved with anyone right now
beat
Roberta feels badly about rejecting him
(deadpan) Does this mean  don't get any lasagna
Roberta cracks up
Dan smiles at her
'  - Roberta enters
The boys are back to their video game, covering that they've been spying on her
Why are you guys still up
(all innocence) Why
Is it late
Good try, Nick
So how was it
Well
he's nice
"Nice"
As in "let's just be friends" nice
don't know yet
We'll see
Nick looks disappointed
There's still a lot more letters
Good night, Nick
She starts heading upstairs
Hey, Mom -- can you loan me ten dollars
1 -   - reads:    10 Roberta rushes in, frazzled, not noticing at first that the beginners are very quiet -- and that most don't have violins
Guys, 'm so sorry --  got stuck over at  2
She puts her stuff down, then looks at the kids
What's going on
Where are all your violins
We heard you got fired
What
- Janet and Dennis talk outside Janet's office
Roberta storms over to them
Janet looks at her, alarmed
Is it true
Why don't you come in my office
It's true
You're firing me
It's not me, Roberta
The Board of Ed
cut the budget, the District had to comply, and as of the end of this term, the violin program has been
excessed
Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless
In the b
g
, the beginners slip into the hall to watch
Excessed
(beat) They specifically said that my violin program has to go
They've slashed the budget -- music and art programs got hit the worst
What about Dennis' classes
'm tenured, Roberta
Roberta looks at him, then back to Janet
When was this decided
Things happened very quickly wanted to tell you myself -- (reeling) just
can't even believe this is happening
Why not
You're a sub
Your position has never been permanent
Shut up, Dennis
You're not helping
(softly, to Roberta) Come into my office, please
They leave Dennis standing there, looking as if he's had his face slapped
'  - There's gotta be a way to fight this
Fight it with what
don't have any other extra programs to give them instead
Oh,  see
So after ten years, after fourteen hundred children have learned to play the violin, this is just an "extra program
" You know  don't feel that way and you know damn well 've been standing by you all these years
You think haven't noticed what you've done for these kids
Then do something
(points to her phone) 've been on this phone for the past three days trying to "do something" -- the District office can't even stand the sound of my voice
Believe me, there are some people around here 'd much rather get rid of
But as far as the Board's concerned, violin classes are not a priority
Roberta's fury starts to give way to grief
She looks terribly wounded
Janet looks at her helplessly
don't have the power here, Roberta
'm so sorry
beat, and Roberta exits
- Roberta's dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds of children, oblivious to kids calling her name and waving
'  -  ( ) Nick and Lexi enter the darkened house, chatting as Nick wheels in the bike and Lexi bounces a basketball
They turn on a light to reveal sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine, her face ashen
What happened
-  ( ) Roberta, Nick and Lexi walk Allegra in their neighborhood
Roberta looks worn out
'm a good teacher
've worked so hard to give these kids something to be proud of
Lexi moves to comfort her
'm so sorry, Mom
can't believe they did this to you
It's like when my father got killed
For twenty years, he followed every safety rule the factory had, and then someone else flips the wrong switch
(she chokes up) It's not fair
You do everything right and then
It's the wrong analogy
You couldn't do anything about Grandpa's death
It was irreversible
This isn't
Tell that to the Board of Education
Let me ask you something
Why did you risk your life for a bicycle
Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance of the question
did not risk my life
Of course you did
That building
Threatening Henry
And for what -- two hundred dollars
No
Not for that
Then why
When someone steals something that belongs to my kids, 'm not gonna sit back and let that happen
beat as she realizes what she's just said
The boys look at her and the three of them stop walking
Guys -- you need to think about this
If  try to fight this -- with no salary coming in --  could lose the house, screw up your college plans
It would be a lot safer to just go out tomorrow and get a job in a private school
Yeah, but is that where you really want to be
'  -   - Roberta frantically searches through her purse, then crosses to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats and jackets
She feels inside a jacket pocket, then finds it: ' -  - -
- as he walks down the hall towards his office and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of his office door
He picks it up
--  foil-covered plate with a note on top: Dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of

Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano
proudly leads the children
At the side of the stage, we see photographing the concert
of teary-eyed parents, many of them with
We Ramon's family
Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, and he starts to cry
Concepcion knows this without looking
She takes his hand
-  stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears
She tries to stay composed, then discreetly exits the auditorium
The song ends and the audience , rising from their seats, including  (now 65), next to  and
Someone remains seated: a  (40's), sitting beside Dan and taking notes
The  bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes the stage
She gestures for people to sit
beginner student brings her flowers
Roberta kisses her, then approaches the mike
(to the audience) The beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program
The Board of Education and the District Superintendent don't think that music is important for our children
But they're wrong -- and they're in for a fight
The parents stand and applaud
We see the  writing quickly
Dorothea snaps more pictures
Roberta extends an arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them
Ramon gives her a thumbs up
'  -   - is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts
Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting
The doorbell
Someone's early
to the
She opens it, revealing , who's carrying two bags of groceries
Assunta's demeanor instantly cools when she sees her
In the b
g
Roberta sees Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner
Hello, Assunta
How are you
'd be a lot better if my daughter had a job next year
Ma
(to Assunta) would too
Janet briskly walks into   , puts the grocery bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them
Roberta watches her, mystified
(to Roberta) Sorry 'm early, but  figured we'd need time to set up
Roberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta
Mama, why don't you take Allegra out for a walk
Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits
Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing unusual about her being there
Cheeses, crackers, bread, salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc
She sees Roberta's confused expression
You are having a meeting here tonight, right
Parents and teachers
Well, yes, but
Take it from me
If you want to get parents to help you with something, you have to feed them
She holds up two wedges of cheese
You have a cutting board for these
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife
(as she continues to unpack) And if you think parents are bad, teachers are even worse, no offense
If you don't feed them, you never get anything extra out of them
That's why  got this
She pulls out an Entenmann's blackout cake
Entenmann's gets them every time
Roberta continues to stare in amazement at Janet
What
Don't tell me you expected me to bring something homemade
(as she takes the cake from her) Well, no
-- Good
Because take it from me -- my own family begs me to stay out of the kitchen
What  didn't expect was for you to be here
Why not
We've gotta figure out a way to fight this
(as she arranges crackers on a plate) After ten years, Roberta,  can't imagine walking through those hallways and not hearing that off-key, screechy, scratchy, nails-on-the- blackboard violin music
Roberta smiles
Janet holds up a baguette
What do you think
Cut it into slices now, or leave it whole
Let's cut it now
It'll be less messy
Janet hands her the bread
beat as the two women exchange a private smile, then return to their respective tasks
'  - There's a crowd of  assembled in Roberta's front room, talking at once, yelling out ideas, including , (Shandra's mom),
(Black) and
(Puerto Rican), the parents of James (from Roberta's first year) and Simon
, ,  are also there; is keeping tabs on the refreshments
Don't they realize how much this program helps the kids
Simon's our third child to study with Roberta
James is pre-med, April's valedictorian -- now that says something
think we should inundate the Board and the District with letters
You're wasting your time
The Board and the District are not gonna pay for this program, no matter how many letters they get
Disappointed grumblings
What if we raise the money ourselves
can't see how they'd object to that
beat as people take this in
Well once that newspaper article comes out, that should help bring in money
Yeah, but what if it doesn't
For all we know, it's gonna be buried on the back page
Besides, who says anyone's gonna give a damn about our kids
(to Roberta) What if you do a benefit concert
We can raise a batch of money from ticket sales, and then the concert itself could be great publicity
There's word of mouth
you could get reviewed
It better be a good concert
Some people laugh but we see the anxiety on Roberta's face
We have to offer something more than me and the kids
(to Dorothea) Do you think maybe your husband would perform with us
(slyly) 'm sure  could persuade him with a little pillow talk
And maybe he can get another violinist too -- Itzhak Perlman, perhaps
This gets people's attention
That would be fantastic
We could rent a place like the 92nd Street  -- it's perfect for this
It seats about nine hundred people and if we charge between fifty and a hundred a ticket -- (to Roberta) We could probably raise enough to reinstate your program for a year
Sounds like a plan
(half to herself) It better be a good concert
The   and Roberta crosses to get it
enters, holding copies of the  , the  , and a couple of other papers
Each paper has been opened to a specific page
Take your pick
Roberta grabs the top one -- the  -- opened to page 5
The page has a photo of Roberta at the Spring Concert, and a large article headlined
- Lots of chaos as a    sets up
Roberta tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her
Kids, listen to me -- it's really important that you don't look at the camera and you try to act as natural as possible
Dennis storms in
Who authorized this
Janet
Well Janet's not here today and want these people out of here
The kids quiet down and watch them argue
starts shooting the argument and Dennis sees him
Turn that off, you hear me
Why are you doing this
We're not bothering anyone
You're disrupting school and  want them out of here -- now
You still don't get it, do you don't care if you hate me, Dennis -- that's your business
But think about the students for once
Every time you interfere, you're not hurting me -- you're hurting them
She points to the kids
They're silent, waiting to see if Roberta got through to him
beat
Get these people out of here or 'm calling the police
Go right ahead, call them
That'll look real good on the eleven o'clock news
beat and he exits
Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns back to the kids who are watching her, impressed
don't hear no sirens
'  -   - is the news segment:  speaks to an unseen interviewer
'm from a blue collar family, and if it weren't for the lessons  got in public school,  never would have learned the violin
It   Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer
(
) How does it make you feel to lose your violin program
It makes us sad
Yeah, like we're never gonna have no more violin lessons -- And it's bad because
because we love violin class
-  Roberta, Lexi and Nick watching the
'  - -    , Yes, 've gotten offers from two private schools, but this is where want to be
(
) Arnold, these kids need help
-  a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and watching
while  practices violin
There's on the walls, signed by Dorothea
Didn't we send them a donation
They need something bigger
And you can't just write a check -- you have to get involved
Involved how
The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained for
Uh-oh
- 1
Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone
His Roladex is open to the name
In the b
g
, Dorothea tensely waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes

Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang " " posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at 92ND   with  ,   and 3
Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr
Adams and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with to "" and accompanying  and Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out and
They stack the checks in a pile, address return envelopes and place inside them
- Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows
The students include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra
Roberta enters the room, full of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front
Listen up, everyone
Quiet down
The students give her their attention
You are my very best beginner and advanced violin students and 've chosen you to play in Fiddlefest because  trust that you can handle the pressure
It's gonna be a lot of work -- a lot
Right now, we've sold some tickets, but 'm not gonna be back here in the fall if the audience storms out of their seats, demanding a refund
She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music
Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and expect you to listen to her
Ramon looks through his music sheets
Bach's "Minuet One"
People are gonna be paying good money for this concert -- we're not just gonna play "Twinkle
" (handing out papers) 'm passing out a contract that you and your parents need to sign
The kids read the contracts
Carlos' eyes widen
Every Saturday and Sunday
Plus night time rehearsals during the week
There's only six weeks till the concert, so classes in school won't be enough
The kids look sobered by this
Come to think of it, we'll probably also need to meet before school
Lots of grumbling: "Say what
" "No way
" "Before school
" 'ma be sleepwalking
" You've heard of Navy Seal Training
Well, this is gonna be Roberta String Training
- Two young men and two young women walk in, carrying violins
We realize from the scar that one is (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall
With him is   (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking more like a rapper than a violinist
(19), walking with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid pinned up
The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20)
Oh my god
Naeem
De Sean
(hugs them) Guadalupe
She hugs her, then looks closely at the other woman
Lucy
Is that you
The woman snaps her fingers and smiles
Roberta laughs and embraces her, then turns to the students
Kids, these are four of my very first violin students and 've asked them to play in the concert with us
(to the alumni) was just telling them how hard they're gonna have to work
(to class) Take it from me -- this lady don't lie
'all are gonna work your butts off
'  - Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch
He stops to look up a word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him
Ramon and his mom are squirming
Manuelo nods as he finishes reading, then  the contract
Ramon breaks into a smile, throws his little arms around his Papa and kisses him
- School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos' violin
few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking his watch
He sees his   teammates standing in a group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but they spot him
#1 Hey Carlos
Where ya goin'
We got a game, remember
Yeah,  know, but
can't make it
#1 What you talkin' about
just can't make it
#2 You got a date with the violin teacher
beat
Yeah
do
He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him He takes the violin from her and carries it himself
- The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra, Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and Guadalupe practice Bach's "Minuet One," Roberta leading them and giving direction
They're playing badly
Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making corrections
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep
Frog
Frog
need more accents on the down beat
More bow
More
They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad
Stop
Stop
(they do so) You sound horrible
Isn't anyone practicing
How can we practice
We're rehearsing all the time
Some kids laugh, including Stephanie
(to Stephanie) You think this is funny, Stephanie
(to all of them) You think the four hundred people who've bought tickets so far will think it's funny too
You think Itzhak Perlman will think it's funny that he's donating his time and you're all gonna stink
Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her
Uh-oh
Am  boring you, Vanessa
No
It's 7:30 in the morning
'm just tired
There's no time to be tired
(to all, getting her violin in position) Let's try it again
'  - Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in, agitated, without even saying hello
We sense that Dorothea too, is troubled by something
must have been crazy to agree to this
They're never gonna be ready
And you should hear the Bach Double
disaster
So the good news is tickets are selling like hot cakes, but the bad news is that the kids sound like shit
There's more bad news
We've lost the
Roberta looks at her, aghast
What
They had a flood -- a water heater burst
The concert hall was damaged and they've cancelled all events
Until when
"Until further notice
" This can't happen
We've sold tickets
We've done publicity
The concert's in three weeks
've been on the phone all morning calling other theaters
Nothing's available
They both sink into the couch, completely undone by this
Just keep looking
'  - The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), rehearsing "Orange Blossom Special
" They play badly
Rachel helps Roberta correct students
Stop
Someone's playing the wrong notes
And you shouldn't need your music anymore
Except for the Bach Double, everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal
The kids look at each other, daunted
And you sound like you're sleepwalking
Your heart's not even in it
Maybe 'cause we don't have a place for the concert
Roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids' faces
Well, you're right
This might all be for nothing
So we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place -- or we can just
give up
Am  hearing right
Did you use the words "give up"
(to the students) Let's take a vote
How many of you want to give up
No one raises a hand
Roberta takes this in
See
You taught us well
'  -  - It's early morning
Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists
What about in the Bronx
There's nothing
(beat) Why don't you just do it in one of the schools
It'll be a lot smaller but -- We won't make enough money
What about postponing it
Itzhak and Arnold are booked all summer
They all look depressed
Lexi places an equally depressing- looking stack of pancakes on the table
There's a  on the door, startling everyone
(
) It's Dorothea
Nick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath, talking a mile a minute
have good news -- really good news
Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing the  and wanted to see how he could help -- and then Wally had this brilliant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it's all arranged
We have a new place for Fiddlefest
Where
Carnegie Hall
Dorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy -- but she looks stricken
(panicked) Carnegie Hall
- , revolving slowly
' She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around
She's holding her violin case
She looks at the   --    -- Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage, then stops
We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert
She can't believe her eyes
beat, and she looks around to make sure she's alone
She takes out her violin, takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience," then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double Concerto
Suddenly, there's the  of a stage door opening
Roberta stops
(
) Incredible sound in this room, no
Roberta turns to see   approaching her
She's completely flustered
Oh my god -- Isaac Stern
You must be Roberta
Thank you so much for helping us
(looking out at the hall) Would you believe in 1960, they tried to tear this place down
They wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper -- we called it "the red terror
" You're kidding
We had to fight like hell, but with a lot of help, we saved Carnegie Hall
Roberta takes this in, relating it to her own struggle
If it's all right with you, 'd like to play in your concert
Maybe bring a couple of friends
Yes, of course
That would be great
Isaac nods, then touches her shoulder
Don't give up
,    - Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly
Dan sits across from her, observing
just don't see how 'm gonna do this
It's huge
It's gigantic
It's Carnegie Hall
And listen to this: now Isaac Stern wants to play with us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree -- there's other people calling -- That's fantastic
Fantastic
'll never get the kids up to speed in time, 'll never get myself up to speed
'm gonna be playing side by side with the world's greatest violinists
And "the world's greatest violinists" are playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this fight
He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate cake, but she shakes her head
Yes, but
you don't understand
Maybe there's a good reason why never made it as a violinist -- maybe just can't cut it
keep blaming it on not having enough early training, but if  were talented, if had a gift -- But you do have a gift
You're gonna put thirty East Harlem kids on stage at Carnegie Hall not because they're prodigies, but because you got them to stick with something that's hard as hell and to strive for excellence -- which, by the way,  certainly wasn't striving for when  was their age
Not to mention the other ten years' worth of students whose lives were changed because of you
That's your talent, Roberta
She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand over his
He strokes her hand
'm scared
know
(beat) And by the way,  happen to think you're a pretty good violinist too
You've barely heard me play
've heard enough to know you're gonna do just fine
Roberta looks at him with trepidation
Dan takes another forkful of his cake
Besides, no one's gonna be paying attention to your playing anyway
Roberta laughs
Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up
1 -  ( ) The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and Kenny -- but  is absent) stand outside the locked school gate, waiting for Roberta
Some of the kids have their violins out of the cases, tuning them
Teacher's late
think she should be dropped, don't you
Kids laugh
Yeah
don't think we should let her play in Fiddlefest
few kids start playing "-
" It catches on, and more of them join in
stop to listen, and some drop change into the open cases
and a couple of other kids grin at this
steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an uncanny imitation of Roberta: More bow
To the frog
You sound terrible
can't believe how terrible you sound
The kids crack up, but a few spot  heading quickly up the street
Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals him that Roberta's watching
You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs
That's right, they're gonna pay a thousand dollars a ticket and you're gonna make them throw up on their gowns and tuxedos
Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta
tense beat as he awaits her reaction
(in all seriousness) If you're gonna imitate me, do it right
(corrects his posture) Shoulders back
Violin higher
Check your feet
There
(beat) 'head, Carlos
Continue
Carlos freezes
No, that's
You can take it from here
Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate
He's right, by the way
You do sound terrible, and you are gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs
The kids start filing in
Rachel comes up the street and catches up to Roberta
need to talk to you
Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks
(to kids) 'll be right in
Start on Minuet One
(to Rachel) What's wrong
We're moving away
What
Where are you moving
(looking downward) It's a secret
My father
he's been hurting my mom
We have to leave
(gently) Has he been hurting you too
Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little
'm sorry about Julliard
and the concert
She hands Roberta her violin
Keep it
Take it with you
No
don't want to play anymore
What
You can't give up violin, Rachel -- it's a part of you
very important part
Rachel looks anguished
Roberta moves closer and touches her arm
Please honey
Just take it
don't want to
Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her
Rachel quickly kisses Roberta goodbye and exits
Roberta watches her
1 -   - Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie, Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double Concerto
The other kids watch
Roberta's on the edge of hysteria
She signals the players to stop
No, no, no
Accent the up bow after the slurred notes and then it'll get you off of those slurred notes
You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder
This is the grand finale of the concert
You're each gonna be sharing a music stand with one of the world's greatest violinists
The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot
Roberta glares at them
think we should forget the Bach Double
(to the other kids) And you guys are never gonna get Minuet One
think we should drop that too
No
We can do it, Roberta
And we'll get the Bach Double
We will
She stops, takes a breath
It's gonna be
, Roberta
(vulnerable) You think
All the kids nod
few beats
(not believing it) It's gonna be
She crosses to take a look at her music, and the kids exchange looks that say, "Oh shit
What did we just promise

'  -  ( ) Pandemonium
Nick and Lexi, both in tuxes, are doing several tasks at once while Roberta, in a simple black velvet dress and stockinged feet, tries to put on her makeup but keeps poking her head out of the bathroom, giving orders
Allegra outside the back door
Nick -- did you feed Allegra
(fixing Lexi's tie) Yes, Mom
Lexi, can you make sure the charts are still in my bag
already checked, Mom
(
) Check again, please
And look for my repair kit too
descends the staircase, dressed in a formal dress
She holds a small jewelry box and heads for the bathroom
Bert, which earrings you want
Roberta sticks her head out and picks the earrings
Assunta enters the small bathroom to work on her own makeup
Nick
Get two more violins
You've already got two -- how many emergencies can there be
beat
Get three more
And make sure a couple of them are half-size
Nick rolls his eyes and runs upstairs while Lexi organizes things by the door: Nick's cello, Roberta's papers, extra violins
Roberta rushes out of the bathroom, adjusting the earrings
She starts compulsively straightening the house
Lexi -- can you call about the car again
Mom, they're not gonna forget to send a car
Nick comes running down the stairs with the violins and stares in disbelief at Roberta fluffing a couch pillow
What are you doing
Just straightening a little
You're insane, you know that
(grabs the pillow) Finish getting dressed
He throws the pillow onto the couch
Roberta heads upstairs

We see the reflection of his baseball bat, glove and trophies in the room behind him

Her mom starts to cry

Roberta comes running down
Can you believe this
She turns around, revealing a  on the back of the dress, next to the zipper
The
It can't be time
Is it time
'll sew it in the car
'  - Roberta, Assunta and the boys step outside, amazed to see a double-parked in front, a  waiting
See
told you they'd send a car
Roberta's open-mouthed
She leads her entourage towards the limo
come out of their houses to watch
Some lean out windows, gawking
Ad libs
"Who's that
" "It's the Violin Lady
" , dressed in a tux, gives Lexi a high sign
The chauffeur helps Roberta and Assunta into the limo while Nick and Lexi start to load the instruments into the trunk
- Roberta sits down beside Assunta and turns around so Assunta can mend the tear in her dress
Assunta partially unzips the dress and starts stitching it from the inside
Thank you, Mama
Don't worry about it
You rip -- sew
Not just for that
(beat) Thank you for getting me out of bed
Assunta stitches, remembering, and smiles
Don't thank me -- thank Charles
Charles
If that jerk hadn't of left you, none of this would've happened
Roberta contemplates this
beat
Thank you, Charles
Her last stitch finished, Assunta rips the needle from the thread
-  - -   - The kids and their parents are practically boiling over with excitement
Last minute kisses, violin tunings, and clothing adjustments take place throughout the room
The boys are in suits or tuxes, the girls in velvet or flowered dresses, some with bows in their hair, some with their hair up in buns
Roberta tries to take a head count, Dorothea confers with a stage manager, Assunta fixes a boy's tie, and Janet helps one girl with her hair, stopping in the middle to button the back of another girl's dress
Where's Vanessa
Has anyone seen Vanessa
Janet looks at her, concerned
'll call her house
- Roberta sees
enter the room with Naeem
The two women walk towards each other and embrace
As they start to chat, Roberta suddenly sees someone and excuses herself:  is walking towards her, wearing a tux
They smile at each other, but Roberta's clearly a bit shaken to see him
They're not quite sure how to greet each other -- he takes her hand, and then kisses her on the cheek
Congratulations
Thank you
knew you'd get here sooner or later
'm glad 'm here to see it

am too

Excuse me, Mr
Perlman
He turns around

He smiles at her and they shake hands
pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe
As Guadalupe introduces him to her mother,  approaches
You nervous, Mr
Perlman

How much did you practice
Itzhak Perlman laughs

You called Vanessa's father and mother
No answer at either
Carnegie Hall staff person in a suit enters
Half hour call
It's now half hour call
So pace yourself accordingly
Don't get more than thirty minutes worth of nervous
The room electrifies with nerves
rushes into the room with her father
She's out of breath, her stocking has a big run in it, and she's in tears
They stole the car

Roberta comforts her and Janet moves in
'mon honey -- let's get you cleaned up

He's in a tux and looks very handsome
He crosses to Roberta, hands her the flowers, and they hug
You're glowing
It's terror
- The hall is filling to capacity as people take their seats, the room buzzing with voices
-  - The   staff person enters
The tension in the room shoots sky high
-  -  - Janet stands onstage and addresses the audience
When  became the principal of Central Park East Elementary,  envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism
Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin
We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what's possible in their lives
When a program like this is cut, our children's future is compromised want to thank you for your support
Enjoy the concert
-  - In the b
g
we hear the audience  Janet
Roberta holds up her hands to quiet down the anxious students
Everyone -- attention please
They become quiet
want you all to take a second just to breathe,
Deep breath
The kids breathe
would like you all to play with your heart, all right
Play like know you can play
You'll be wonderful
Watch me, don't look out in the audience -- you don't need to be afraid
It's gonna be really wonderful
So play -- play from here
She pats her heart
-   - The kids head out towards the stage, the  getting louder as they get closer
-  - of the children on stage, in their positions
- Some of the kids look awestruck by the audience; one subtly waves hi to her family
Roberta walks out to
She bows to the audience, turns to the kids, signals them with a slight nod and the    begins
We've heard it in all phases, and now it is flawless
the  watching her: , wearing a corsage; in his red bow tie;  in black velvet with pearls; standing proud and tall,   in dreadlocks and a tux;  playing from his heart
-   - Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Michael Tree, Arnold Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Karen Briggs and Mark 'Connor wait back stage, chatting and listening to the kids
-   - The students finish
There's an exquisite moment of silence, then
-   - Country fiddler  ' plays with the kids
He improvises, surprising them as his violin makes the sound of a  moving through a tunnel
smiles, awed by this -- but he remains calm and professional
-    - As the guest violinists head for the stage, we hear their names over a mike, mixed with : (
) Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Michael Tree, Mark 'Connor and Karen Briggs
-  - of the six guest violinists on stage for the Grand Finale, each one sharing a music stand with a student
Roberta nods, and they begin
She turns to face the audience as she joins them
the performers and students:  shares a stand with  ;   stands and plays with , sitting beside him;   sits and plays next to , standing beside him;   plays beside  ;   plays beside ; plays beside , and  ' plays beside
plays cello;  plays the piano behind them; and, playing with her own solo music stand,
Their expressions are serious and passionate, broken by occasional smiles lighting on faces: Isaac Stern
Lucy
Carlos
Itzhak Perlman
Diane Monroe
De Sean
The song finishes and the  begins
The come out from back stage,  in front, and join the rest
More applause
The the audience facing the stage, then  to show the audience standing in the orchestra and balconies
We see the students' ; ,  and their families; ,  and ; ; , and their sons; ; and  -- even he can't stop himself from applauding
to the stage where the students and guest violinists bow
and    on  in her moment of triumph
-  -  - Roberta addresses the audience
Her voice is strong but softer around the edges; she is a woman in a state of grace
We're all here tonight because we have a bigger mission: to take the magical spirit of tonight's concert with us out into the world, and to fight for music and art to be a part of every child's education
Thank you
The  is , then slowly diminishes as we: : 1 -   - Roberta addresses ten first-graders sitting in a circle on the floor
She points to the horsehair on her bow
And this
What's this
The frog hair
Roberta and the kids laugh
Did you ever see a frog with hair
The boy smiles and shakes his head
It's horsehair
That's right
(to the boy) But you're right, there is a frog
Can you show me where it is
One girl raises her hand with urgency
Ooh
know
Sssh -- let him answer
The boy points to the frog of the bow and Roberta smiles
