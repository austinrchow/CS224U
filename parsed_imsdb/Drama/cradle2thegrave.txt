Written by John 'Brien and Channing Gibson Story by John 'Brien May 2002 Draft 2
: ( ) - End of the day
An armored truck moves through the city of Los Angeles
- The armored truck pulls up
An    emerges from the back with a satchel and heads inside
-  - large foyer
Security station and elevators can be heard from a second floor balcony
is the security guard manning the station
Seeing the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and dials
Beat
Into phone -- Last delivery's finally here
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station
As he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard references the sounds from upstairs -- Party
Introducing a new line of jewelry
Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring
Told her to spend a little time with the family jewels first
An  opens
second security guard's inside
Handing over the satchel and heading out -- Keep it real
- We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to gain elevator access to the lower floors
As the elevator doors slide closed
3
- An exclusive showroom
Display tables empty
At one end of the room, the elevator
At the other end, the open door to a walk-in vault
The  , and the doors open
The guard emerges with the cart
Pushes it across the room to the outside of the vault
man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading the cart into the vault
- train arrives
People jostle on and off
One man remains on the platform
Crisp dresser
Carrying a large leather bag
cylinder hanging by a strap over his shoulder
The train doors begin to close
When
fist inserts itself between the doors
They re-open, and a man steps onto the platform
Well-dressed
Intense
Fait joins Miles
They watch the train pull out
They check to make sure the station's empty
Then jump off the platform into the tunnel and disappear
- The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart
He closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the door, securing the vault
- Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to the wall
Miles stumbles
Falls toward the deadly, high- voltage third rail
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket
Stops him
Just before he hits
Inches from the rail
Fait pulls him back up and away from the danger
Watch yourself
Miles nods
4
Keep it tight
Miles nods again, and they set off
-  - Sounds of the  continue from upstairs
At the security station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and scans the security monitors
- depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man in the suit riding up
Douglas settles back in with his magazine
- Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint
Fait starts to open it
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the  of an Fait and Miles leap to the wall
Press their backs against it as tightly as they can
The  whooms past, inches from their faces
When it's gone, Miles sighs with relief
Fait cracks the access door
- Fait moves quickly, Miles following
Fait makes fast lefts and rights, following more spray paint
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the sub-foundation of a building
Fait stops
Overhead is a flat ceiling
On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray- painted circle
Bull's-eye
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment
Fait pulls out a cell phone
- ( )  - 5
man,  , sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird
'  - - Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy  through We hear what he hears
Only there's no music, just
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a
Su grows even more alert
We hear a man with a French accent answer the phone
(
) Yes
(
) We're in position
(
) Delivery confirmed
The stones are there
(
) Not for long
Su didn't like what he just heard
Curses in Chinese
And takes off
'   - Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to the park
The top floor is at street level
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building
He moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge
It's an eight-story drop
Su faces in
And then
Hops backward off the roof
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then lets go
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go
Grabs a sixth-floor rail
Hangs on this time
Vaults lightly onto the balcony
'  -   - 6
large, free-standing    away
Nearby, is packing to leave town
When
(0
) Where are the stones
Christophe turns
Sees Su standing behind him
(French accent) Who the fuck are you
Wham
The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap
Who's getting them for you
Fuck off
Wham
Wham
Wham
Wham
Much more violent than a bitch- slap
'll tell you
know
- - plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab overhead
Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch
Fait hammers at the last layer
And
- hole appears under the private display table, where it can't be seen by the room's security camera
- - Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving earwig
Daria
-  - Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security monitors again
Everything a-okay
7
- limo pulls up outside
- uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the back and opens the door
very attractive woman in a short, tight dress emerges
-  - Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, , enters
She approaches the security station
Up close, in the light, Daria's even more alluring
And knows how to wield it
'm here for the reception
Name, please
Angie Rawlins
Douglas scans a list of names
Checks off hers
Thank you
You can go on up
Front elevator, to the mezzanine
Daria turns toward the elevator
Then doesn't go
Just glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic
hate these things
Don't you hate these things
'm just here to do my job
Daria looks back at Douglas
Studies him a moment
Liking what she sees
Then again, you never know who you're going to meet
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage
Then leans over the desk
Giving Douglas an eyeful
8
'll bet you're a lot more fun than any of those boring people upstairs
Douglas is unaffected
Just looks at her blankly
Really, ma'am
have a job to do
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk
' The magazine is Genre
Males for males
Buff boys
Big pecs, big penises
Daria steps back
Well,  suppose  should go up and see what they're selling
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur,
Tommy
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as Daria walks toward Tommy: She whispers into a hidden mike -- Change of plans
He's gay
Tommy hears it over his earwig
No way
Yeah way
: - - Fait and Miles have heard it, too
Into his mike -- Tommy
Your turn
9
look of alarm on Tommy's face
Into his mike -- Uh-uh
This isn't a conversation
Do it
It's an order
Tommy knows he has to
Shit
Shit
Key-card
Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume -- Why don't you keep my purse shouldn't be too long
Daria hands Tommy her purse
Palms the key-card from him
Then heads toward the elevator, as
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face
Does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station
Leans over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face
Aloha
(: The following scene is  with Scenes 20 thru 28
) Douglas looks up from his magazine
Hi
hope you don't take offense at this
but  just have such a weakness for a man in uniform
If that's your thing
Uniform's definitely my thing mean,  see a sailor, 'm thinking, mmm, seafood
'know
'm not actually supposed to be 10
talking on duty
Who's talking
Honey, this is a flirting
But you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women
World's full of fools
Beat
Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine
Yahtzee
Okay, Mr
-Always-Have- -Hard-Nightstick
Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons
(') like sunsets and puppy dogs, and 'm big in the pants
Just hope 'm not too cute for you
And don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or 'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks
'm hooked up
Another big, hot, cuddly, black love- Jesus got there first
That bitch
Taking you
From me
Sorry
Hey
This day and age, sweetie, can appreciate the monogamy
Saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me
Even if you are just breaking my heart
Guess 'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me
can be pretty rough
Don't you get me all excited now was just learning to accept my disappointment
11
Tommy sticks out his hand
Tommy
But you can call me Rachel
Shaking hands -- Douglas
And, man,  really gotta get back to what 'm supposed to be doing, okay
He looks away
Scans the monitors
- Everything looks normal
Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault, Tommy relaxes
'll leave you alone
But is it okay if  just stand here and stare at the muscles 'll be missing for the rest of my life
which
- Daria gets in
Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's attention
He does
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the controls to go down
As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at
who furtively flips her the bird
Never missing a beat with Douglas
12
- Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table
-   - On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's attention diverted
- Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's security camera
Mimicking the security camera's slow pan, Fait films the room
When he's done
- ' We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor
Fait pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat
" Whereupon the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop
- As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera, Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to work
-   - On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy continues diverting Douglas's attention
- Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in the floor
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three steel cables and a long, rectangular box
Miles grabs a high-tech
Begins  a hole high up on the vault door
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside
surface-to-air missile
Fait sets it on the tripod
13
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had slung over his shoulder
Pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole
sound as the super-low-temp  spreads out inside the vault door
The outside frosts over
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the
Final checks of the rig
Out
'  - - Speeding through
Calling 911 on a cell phone
want to report a crime in progress
- - Fait is the last one down through the hole
Beat
He looks at the others
Faith
Faith
Faith
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device
He pushes the button
And
- The   with a blinding flash and streaks across the room
The steel cables instantly snap taut and
the vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck out of the door
-   - They felt a rumble
Tommy covers -- Earthquake
14
Douglas checks the monitors
Everything looks okay
Bet you know how to hit a ten on the Richter scale
- The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the augured into the opposite wall
Holy shit
Fait's already swinging open the vault
This will trigger the silent alarm
Let's go
We got eleven minutes
Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop all the locks
Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags
Fait empties drawer after drawer
All white diamonds
When
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds
And stops, admiring them
love colored stones
Look at this
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond
Two-point-seven million
Into the bag
Whose shit we stealing, anyway
Drug dealers and money launderers
Works for me
Then something else catches his eye
He holds up a small, pink diamond on a chain
Admires it
This  can use
15
And pockets it
Fait moves to her
Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she found in a drawer
Pulls out a handful of
Large black diamonds
Many more in the bag
Pow
He takes the bag
Stows it in his jacket
When
Suddenly, Fait's
Surprising them
Beat
Fait answers
Go
: '  - - Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets
Your employer betrayed you
The police are on the way
Leave the black stones
Who is this
You know the ones  mean
Don't think 'll do that
Fait just hangs up
-   - Tommy and Douglas hear
The outside
, cops, the works
All heading for the front door
Tommy whispers urgently into his mike
Shit
Five-0 at the do'
(then, aloud to Douglas) Better move my car
16
- Fait grabs a bag of jewels
Go time
Leave the rest
-   - swarms in
Tommy exits behind them
/
- Tommy gets in
signals him
Move it out
- Fait, Miles, and Daria run
- Slam
Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door
Fait kneels, feels the track
Stopped the trains
(then) We're in the rabbit hole, they're sending down the snakes
(then) Daria comes with me
(to Miles) got no idea where you should go, but you know where to end up
Miles nods
Faith
Faith
'  - - 17
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives
-  - running like hell
Rounds a curve
Ahead are the rear lights of a stopped train
-    - Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a station
Fait signals Daria to stay put
Then pokes his head around the corner of the train
'  - cops hustle passengers off the train
One helps another up to check the top of the train
The jumps back down
#2 All clear
Fait turns back to Daria
Signals her to climb up onto the top of the train
Then begins climbing after her
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees approaching the train's , checking under seats, etc
Fait has to climb fast
The  Guy and the Driver getting closer
Looking up
Just as
-   - Fait's leg just clears the window
They don't see it
But
- As Fait rolls onto the top of the train
- The  causes the  Cop to react
To the Driver -- #3 Hold it
18
moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around
The Cop checks the Driver's compartment
Nothing
#3 (radios) Train's clear
The Cop exits
The Driver enters his compartment
- stands outside the Driver's window
Okay to go
#4 Just hang tight
During which, just above them
Fait and Daria lie very still
Daria's tense
Fait winks at her, trying to relax her
Daria's still tense
He raises his eyebrows slightly
Shifts his gaze down
She doesn't get it
Finally follows his gaze
Sees her position is giving him a full view of her cleavage
She looks back at him in disbelief
Nice
That does it
She relaxes and smiles back
Under which a voice crackles over the  Cop's radio
(
) All clear
#4 (to Driver) Okay
Get this train outta here
Whereupon the train jerks to a start
-  - running toward the rear of the stopped train
Leaping onto the rear steps
When
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him flying back down onto the rails
And
There is Su in front of him
19
The stones
You'll have to come and get 'em
Su moves on Miles
Miles throws a solid punch at him
Su and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train
The deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous
Miles is a street boxer
He's good
He's ferocious
But he's no match for Su
When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then goes
-    - Rocketing underground
The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above Fait and Daria
Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches from their heads
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward the edge
Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's
The car takes a wide curve
Daria's body flips to the side
She loses her grip
Screams as she starts to fall off the train
Fait reaches for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off the train
Fait can't grab her
The train jerks again
He starts sliding away from her, off the opposite side
Fait thrusts out both hands as far as he can
And
Just snags her at the last second
Grips Daria's wrists with all he's got
They're now draped across the curved roof of the train
Hands in the middle
If Daria slips, or Fait lets her go, they both die
- (  ) - Su gets in
Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap fortune in gems and jewelry pours out
Su sifts through it, increasingly agitated
What he wants isn't there
He throws the bag down, cursing in Chinese
-    - Fait is at his limit
His grip starts to loosen
When the train begins to slow
They pull into a station and stop
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform
20
Fait jumps down on the other side
He's lost the bag of jewels
Knows they're gone for good
He feels for the bag of black diamonds
Still has them
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand, they melt into the crowd of commuters
-    - stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard
The man, , is Asian, about forty
Emanates grace and power
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the  go to retrieve baggage
woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling
She's also Asian
Dressed in American casual
Beautiful
She's not smiling
As Ling approaches her -- Enjoying California
, the bodyguard, answers for himself
Hope we're not here long
hate sunshine
Ling kisses Sona on the lips
Then -- We may have a problem
Ling's mood quickly darkens
The stones
The exchange was just robbed
Let's hope that was part of the plan
-   - Swarming with police
When
Su steps off the elevator
He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles
To a -- 21
Who's in charge
Who wants to know
Su flashes
We don't see it
The Cop scopes it a moment
He's clearly impressed
Follow me
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault
'  - , eight, is in her pajamas, playing  Coaster on her computer
The door opens
Fait enters
His daughter
You know it's past your bedtime
Just a little longer
(imitating sweetly) 'Just a little longer'
School tomorrow, baby
Let's go
Vanessa sighs
Fait stands over her as she shuts down the computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she doesn't dawdle
'Exit
' 'Quit
' 'Do not save
' 'Special
' 'Shut down
' Sleepy- time
Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once around the room and tucks her into bed
You bag some 's now, you hear
Okay
Wait a second
What
think there's something behind your 22
ear
Oh, please, that is so lame
It's in your hand
She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over
Nothing
Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over
More nothing
She's stumped
Fait smiles
Puts his hands together
When he opens them, there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain
How'd you do that
Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her
Good night
Then Fait looks up
Addresses the air above her
Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best
Guard her, watch her, while she rests
bedtime ritual
Fait goes
When she's alone, Vanessa holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available light and shines in the dark
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes
'  -  - Fait enters
Vanessa's nanny, , is there
To Tonita -- She'll stay down now
She won't listen to me lately
Only you
'll have a talk with her about it tomorrow
Still to the nanny -- got some work to do in the office
You can go on to bed
23
'm watching , if you need me
Fait exits
' /  - Fait enters
Tommy and Daria are there
What the hell happened
Fait puts a finger to his lips
Leads them across the room to another door
'  - They enter
Fait shuts the door
Should we be considering a long vacation in a warm, foreign climate where there's no extradition
Fait's thinking it through
The guy who called was only interested in the black stones
Christophe sold us out
Or something
Just then, Miles enters
You made it
By the skin of my ass
Some Chinese dude kicked me around the motherfuckin' block
Busted my ear piece
He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and tosses it on the table
Snagged my loot, too
Maybe time to 24
rethink the no-gun policy
Little ass-whuppin's nothing
'Least you didn't have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop
Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds
Means this is all we got
So what do we do
You all wait to hear from me
Where're you going
To get some answers
Miles moves to go with him
got your back
No
got us into this
'll call you if  need you
Daria moves to him
Their eyes meet
Be careful
Fait gives her a kiss
Then goes
'   - Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank, one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the stand
His hands are    bound
He can't move
His beaten face is pressed to the   glass
Large, weird fish swim past in front of him
The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side of the tank
Ling
Looking through at Christophe
Ling straightens and walks around the tank
Sona is with him
So is Charles, the bodyguard
In b
g
, the two thugs stand sentry near the front door
Christophe's eyes follow them
25
So this is Mr
Christophe
Yes
Only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look
Apparently we're not his first visitors today
Please, Monsieur Ling -- Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder
Whatever you're going to say
Make it the truth
'   - M1A1  - Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot goods and military surplus equipment
The tank's turret is spinning around
The cannon elevating and depressing seemingly at random
When
The cannon stops
Having locked on
Fait, standing in front of the tank
From inside the tank, a muffled voice
(
) Bang
hatch opens
, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man, pops his head up out of the tank
Like it
It's cool
As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait -- Want it
Give you a good deal
Ammo included
Reactive armor, twin M240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon
Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line
Pass
26
How about a Marine Corps assault hovercraft
got other business
Fait and Archie walk to a work table
Nearby, two from a truck
One Man calls to Archie
We're outta room over here, Arch
Stack 'em in the office, if you have to
Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait
You weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, Tony
Don't know what you're talking about
Me either
Ever see black diamonds before
White, blue, yellow, pink
Neil Diamond
Lou Diamond Phillips
Black diamonds
Solid rocks
No
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table
Archie pulls out a loup
Studies them a moment
Shrugs
You got me
Find out how much they're worth
There a timetable on this, or -- Yesterday
That's what  figured
27
Fait's heading out
'll be back
gotta go fuck over a guy who fucked me over
'   -  - Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick
'  -   - Fait enters
Stops a moment, his back against the closed door, while his eyes adjust to the dark
Then moves quietly out into the room
Looking for Christophe
Fait continues moving around through the room
When he steps in something wet
He bends down and checks it out
Water
The carpet's soaked
His eyes go to something
Fait finds a cord and turns on a switch
The light in the fish tank snaps on
Christophe
Stuffed inside the tank
Sleeping with the fishes
(
) Looks dead to me
Behind him
Fait turns around
Sees Su
Sitting on a sofa
Guess you got to him first
Not me
Someone else
Fait does the math
You're the one who called me
The one who took on my guy
Who the fuck are you, man
My name is Su
Cool
'm Sally
want the black stones
28
Yeah
Make me an offer
Su stands
You can walk out of here
No deal
Fait launches   himself at Su
Gonna fight     his way    out the door
much    better fighter than Miles
And
He's saved by the bell:    the
The fight     stops
The phone's near   Fait
Beat
The answering      machine    picks up
(
) Christophe here
Leave a message
(
) know you're there, Mr
Fait
Beat
Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone
Who's this
: - Overlooking
Ling and Sona
Enjoying hotel room service
Ling's on a cell phone
The man for   whom Mr
Christophe arranged to   have the black stones brought into   the country and deposited at   the jewelry exchange
The man who   wants them back
Now
Fine
How much
Maybe you didn't understand me
The stones are already mine
got 'em, 'm selling 'em
So get your bid in or go fuck yourself
29
don't have time for this
That your final offer
can be a very dangerous man, Mr
Fait
Fait just hangs up
Everybody think 'm the fucking Goodwill or something
Look, 've had a shitty night, and so far,  got zip for all my troubles
So  don't know who the fuck you are, and don't care
But hear this: you can beat my ass around the block all night -- Brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones
long beat
The two men facing off
Then
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out
' - Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off
/
'  - Fait's checking his rearview mirror
Sees a black Cadillac Escalade pull away from the curb and follow
Fait doesn't need it
Oh, man
He's about    to punch it
When
cop car turns a corner and falls    in beside him
Fait throttles back
Keeps driving
Until, finally
The cops turn off
And now
Fait hits    it
Until
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi- industrial area
Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow, but is cut off by the on-coming cars
We   Fait
He  down the alley
Reaches an intersecting alley
Turns
it out of sight
30
/
- Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and speeding down the alley after Fait
The  reaches the intersection
Turns
And
into a  rolled into its path
The dumpster forces the Escalade into a wall
(- ) - Two men start to get out of the Escalade
We recognize them: Ling's two thugs
We barely have time to realize that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction equipment down the alley
He's had no choice but to turn and fight
Which is what he does, rushing the passenger
The battle's ferocious and fast
Ultimately, Fait's out- muscled and out-gunned
He's forced back against the open door of the Escalade, guns to his head
#1 Give us the stones
Man, how many times  gotta tell people: 'm a business man
Make me a motherfucking offer
#2 Here's your offer
He cocks his pistol
Beat
That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie
'Cause  ain't scared of guns, and ain't got the stones
#1 Then you're gonna tell us where they are
Whereupon a
Spins through the air
The bottle knocks the gun from one Killer's hand
The gun skids under a nearby chain-link fence
the person who threw the bar
Su
The fight's on
Two on 31
two
Using all means available
During the battle, a killer tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence
Almost gets it
When
Two vicious , guard dogs for the junkyard behind the fence, leap out of nowhere,  and  and smash into the fence
The killer jumps back, barely escaping with his arm
The fight continues
Fait and Su wear them down
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh
Every time someone crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a piece
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see a series of chain-link connections loosen and break
Until it happens one too many times
The entire fence goes down
The dogs are out
The nearest targets: Su and Fait
Su and Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and evading the ferocious attack dogs
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying
Whip-kicks the other off Fait
The two men run for the Escalade
The dogs are up in a flash
Su spots an abandoned car
rear door is open
Over here
Fait follows, right on his heels
The dogs close in
Su reaches the car
Dives through the open door
Somersaults over the rear seat
Kicks open the far door and rolls out
Fait dives in right behind him
The Dobies leap in after Fait
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the other side of the car
Clears the door
And
Su slams the door shut
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that door, too
Trapping the , foaming  inside
The bad guys are gone
And Fait's   is
As Fait digs out the phone, to Su -- Man, what the hell's up with these fucking stones
(into phone) Go
32
: '   -  - Archie's had the shit beat out of him
It's Archie
Bad news
We got a problem
- Surveillance camera footage of Archie's
Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and start to beat something out of him
(
) did what you said, right
Put it out on the street, trying to get info on the stones
Next thing know, the Jackson Five here show up
Now, there are three significant elements to notice here
One, 'm outnumbered
Two, they're heavily armed
Three, they're gonna beat me like a bongo drum
'   -  - Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor
On screen, Archie surrenders immediately
mean, hey,  coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, 'm thinking: How would  be able to tell Tony what happened to the stones
Right
What good am  dead or on life-support
So  threw in the towel
Reluctantly, of course
For your sake
Okay
You saved yourself to tell me
So tell me
What
33
Who are they
Uh
Don't know
What'd they say
Well
'Give us the stones, motherfucker
' You know
That kinda thing
That's it
Pretty much
Yeah
Thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information
Did you call the police
Look around
Are you crazy
Then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause have no idea who you are
Big question is, who's behind the boost
(re: footage) don't know that, but  know they got great guns
can't even get those
Special Forces only
Chambers
What
He's wired into everything going down in this city, and he can get that kind of firepower
Gotta be him
Who's Chambers
34
Runs the biggest outfit in town
What warlords are to Afghanistan, Chambers is to
And you want to take him on, you're on your own
Game over for me
(beat; then) And now that 'm truly fucked -- what the hell are you, anyway
You got some
Beat
Su takes out his wallet and shows him
-
In Chinese
Clearly official
Doesn't mean shit to me
Let me see that
Archie takes it, reads
Taiwan
Central Security Bureau
Taiwanese intelligence
You read Chinese
No
But  know 'cop' in every language
What, you some kinda Asian James Bond
The stones belong to my government
Yeah, well, they're Chambers' now
And even governments don't go to war with him
which, Fait's   starts
'm starting to hate this phone
(answers) What now
35
: -      - Ling's on his cell phone
hope you've reconsidered
Hey, it's Mr
Dangerous
'Sup, 'homie'
You've made this difficult, Mr
Fait
Let me make it easy
Can't wait to hear
have your daughter
Fait freezes
She's very pretty in her pink pajamas
Aren't you, Vanessa
Vanessa, in the limo, held by Charles
On Ling's signal, Charles uncovers her mouth
Daddy
Vanessa
want my stones, Mr
Fait
Motherfucker
You think about it a moment
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman who's with you
Don't you hurt her
That's up to you
The Chinese 36
gentleman, please
Beat
Fait hands the phone to Su
He has my daughter
Oh, Jesus
He wants to talk to you
Su takes the phone
In  with   -- Hello
thought  killed you
have the stones
No negotiations
Let the girl go
Do you really want one more person to die
We see this resonates with Su
No negotiations
And then, he simply hangs up
What'd you just do
What happened
said  have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter
You what
Oh, Jesus
It will confuse him
Buy us time and keep her alive
37
What the fuck're you talking about
That asshole has my daughter
Look --  know him
(then) want the stones, you want your daughter
We'll get them both back
We'll work together
gotta work with you
You have no choice
Beat
Fait realizes what this means
Shit
We gotta go see Chambers
(beat, then) Oh, god
Vanessa
- Large, empty, brightly-lit
The door opens, and the limo pulls in
/
- The limo stops inside the hangar
To Charles, re:   Vanessa -- Find a place to put her
Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out -- My daddy's gonna come and kick your butts
Sona just reaches out and slaps her
It hurts and surprises Vanessa
Tears come to her eyes
But she's Fait's daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry
Charles takes Vanessa out
Ling's mind is still on the phone call
Su says he has the stones
But why cut me off
Why not negotiate for the girl
It doesn't make sense
38
The buyers fly in tomorrow
Should we stop them
We'll never regain their confidence
(beat) We need information
Find the right people
Pay whatever it costs
Something's not right
Something's happening with the stones
What about the girl
We'll need her
She stays alive
For now
'  - In motion
Fait and Su
Fait on the cell to Tommy
'm on the way to Chambers
Yeah, know, but  got no other choice
Just get the word into his pipeline that 'm coming and want permission to visit
'll get back to you
Faith
(hangs up) Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and give the stones back
(then) Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join the Peace Corps
Su looks over
Beat
'm sorry about your daughter
How old is she
This ain't the Biography Channel
Let's just get there
long beat
moving by outside
Eight
She'll be nine in September
Beat
39
Mine is fifteen
Boyfriends
Never happen
'll just kill 'em
wish it were that easy
Another beat
Then -- About time  got the 4-1-1
4-1-1
What's this all about
The stones aren't what you think they are
No shit
(then) How about the guy who has Vanessa
He's exactly what you think he is -- a thief and a killer
Great
- battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar
We see Vanessa inside the camper
She's screaming
Loudly
Not scared
Pissed
As
Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint
- Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles
Where'd you get that piece of shit
#1 Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa have a long walk back from the 40
campground
You're sure you cleaned it out
#1 Everything except the denture cream and adult diapers
Vanessa's still screaming
It's getting on Charles' nerves
'm sick of her already
He marches toward the van
Unlocks the rear door and slides it open
/
- Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling
Shut up
You shut up
Go to sleep
Vanessa reaches over and flicks  the camper's
Turns it
Giving him stink-eye defiance as
Charles slams the door shut
Locks it
And
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her anymore, her boldness begins to subside
She lies down on the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark camper
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it
talisman
Connecting her to her father
Not making the fear go away, but giving her strength
- As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him -- Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best
Guard her, watch her, while she rests
41
which, as Su regards him
-  - prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as dreary, spare and institutional as the next
That is, until they reach the last cell
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries
Hanging blankets cloak the cell entirely from view
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell
One sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets covering the open cell doorway,
/
'  - After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz
The last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as Joel's office
, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the terms of his incarceration
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee,  , sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed ; eggs benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries; French-press coffee;  ,  , , Maxim, Hustler and the daily mail
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go
Metz
The guard, , stops and looks back
's broke
Get you a new one straight away, Mr
Chambers
Metz goes
Beat
Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke
Thanks for your patience
Man needs his nightly rest
(then) Who's the gook
42
Chinese guy
No shoes in my crib
Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes -- In
The sentries move aside
Fait and Su enter
Chambers ash- trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast
How you doing, Jump
Don't waste my precious time
got a problem
How's Daria
Good
Always was good
From the moment found her till the moment you took her away from me
Problem, you say
The black stones
Bitch brought it in
Made me a lotta money
But that all stopped
You stopped that
You decided it was okay to put an end to that
Black stones
Go on
need 'em back
Only smart thing was not pimping her yourself, 'cause then 'da been real sore-angry, and you'da both been real cold-dead
(') But you don't pimp, do you
Just a 43
thief in the night
Stealing what don't belong to you
Chambers turns to Su
In   -- You like tall white women
Su doesn't say anything
Back to English -- He can't talk
don't speak Korean
Chambers carves up a sausage
Bought myself this Korean club downtown
Packing in the Seoul brothers 24-7-365
Black man gouging Koreans, ain't that a switch
Motherfuckers got faces like walls, but they love to drink liquor and look at naked girls
Place is no shitbox, either
Got me an office looks like a kabuki love palace
My own little sanctuary -- Fait, taking this in
-- just waiting for when  parole out
Stop by sometime, eyeball the poon
Jump, my daughter's mixed up in this
gotta have the stones, or she's dead
No response
Chambers just keeps eating
If you need something more than that, here it is
(this is hard) 'm begging you, Jump
Still no response
Chambers finishes eating
Wipes his face
Finally -- Big heist
Risky heist
Breaking news
'm watching it wondering why
44
What's worth that kind of trouble, that kind of heat
Gotta be something good
Gotta be something expensive
Beat
He meets Fait's eyes
Holds them
She's my little girl
Make another one
Lotta offspring running around
Big scores're rare in a lifetime
Another beat
That's it
No deal
Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers
Su stops him
Slope's no dope
He indicates behind them
They turn
The two cell sentries are wielding prison shanks
So is Willy Chickens
Let me cut one of these motherfuckers
Your choice
Chickens is happy
Thrusts the knife at Fait
When
Su reaches out and catches the   blade
Catches it with just the thumb and forefinger of one   hand
And holds it like that
Holds it hard
Chickens     can't push and can't pull
Doesn't know what to do next
Finally yanks really hard
And
Su lets go
Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle beat
Then, to Fait -- Say hey to Daria
And don't forget your shoes
- Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche
used to look up to that guy
All wanted was to be like him
45
In Taiwan,  could force him to talk
This ain't Taiwan
(then) Only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take 'em
You make it sound easy
It won't be
They're about to get in the car
Fait stops
Looks back at the prison
Suddenly realizing something
They're at his club
How do you know
know
can feel it
That ever happen to you
No
thought Chinese people were all mystical and shit
We like to gamble
Not guess
It's no guess
But  could be wrong
We'll hit the club
You gotta see Archie
Archie
He's gotta remember something about the guys who took down his place
What if he can't
Pretend it's Taiwan
Make him remember
46
- , the science and technology end of Ling's operation, carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is looking in the back of the truck
Hey
Get away from there
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic
What are you doing
Whoa
Take it easy
Just seeing if could help with something
You can't
It's very delicate equipment
Stay away
Just stay away from my truck
What
Stay away from my truck
What
Stay away from my truck
What
Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby
Stop it
Charles does
And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun screaming inside the camper
(
) want my daddy
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell -- 47
'm backing away
'm backing away
(
) want my daddy
want my daddy
Charles joins Sona
Re:   Russell -- Someone give the geek his Ritalin
At least he's doing his job
Which is more than  can say for some people
(
) want my daddy
want my daddy
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape
Tape her up and gag her
As Vanessa continues to , Charles moves to the van, unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it
Then opens the door
And
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his waist
want my daddy
want my daddy want my daddy
Get the hell off me
He pries loose her arms from around him
Keeping a grip on her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face away from him
He's about to start duct-taping her wrists
Waste of time
can think of a better way of shutting you up -- Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads
Charles howls in pain and lets her go
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper
- 48
Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut
And now
We suddenly realize she has the key and remote
The crying just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles
Vanessa pushes the remote
And
- go the
Charles, still in pain, is surprised to hear this
Feels his pocket
Realizes the key and remote are gone
Shit
(yells to Sona) She got the key
- Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat
Puts the key into the ignition and  the
Puts it in "
" - To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal
An extension for her short legs
As her foot tromps down on the can
- takes off
The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't see where she's going
But she's going
- The camper careens around the large space
Charles scrambles after
- Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal
- The  veers toward the rear wall
And
into a support post
As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt
49
- hostess bar, but very high-end
Beautiful women
Elegant decor
Pumping
No strip-club cheese
For extra money, private rooms for private pleasures
It's day, but the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc
, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door
Delicious Daria
'Sup, Odion
Long time no see
Then, checking her out -- Like cognac
Just getting better
(then) So what brings you around
Sometimes you need an old friend, y'know
Got trouble
With a capital '
' Tony Fait
Thought you and him were tight
Bonnie and Clyde
Used to be that way
Not treating me right these days
The kid's all he cares about
What do you want me to do
Man,  don't know
Probably nothing you can do
just 50
thought
(then) Hey, y'know, this is crazy
don't know what  was thinking shouldn't even be here like this
Sorry, Odion
Daria starts to go
Odion stops her
Nah, hey, hold up
It's okay
Back in the day
Just always seemed like you and  had something special between us
Didn't know you thought so
always cared for you, Odion
That's why 'm here
You looking for a job
need something
So maybe you could work here
Here
Oh, man,  don't know
You were the best
Not many girls pulling in two g's a night
Yeah, but it's been a while for that
Might not remember how
Just like a bicycle, baby
You don't forget that stuff
Daria considers it a moment
Don't know how Jump'd feel about it
Having me back
Hey, you let me worry about Jump, 51
okay
(then) Meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it
Beat
Daria knows the look in his eyes
Gets the subtext
Just talk
Odion's drinking her in
No
beat
Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into Odion's, smiling at him -- ' - - Su and Archie
They have boxing matches in the day
Not exactly boxing
More dangerous
No gloves
No rules
Big money
Very illegal
Started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops
The man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here
don't
But Chambers owns the operation, so  figure it's a good place to start
(then) This is it
They turn into
- cavernous industrial building
Cars parked on the perimeter
/
' - - As they park -- 52
How will you recognize him
didn't see his face
But 'll know his pinkie ring when   see it
Ten carats
Round cut with   square mount
Good color and clarity
remember thinking what it would  do to my face if he hit me
Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself
- Archie and Su exit the car and approach a  manning a gate to the fight arena beyond
How do we get in
Leave that to me
Then, to the Guard -- Hey, man, how you doing
Got a fighter here  want to enter
Su shoots him a surprised look
My man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye
He'll go in there and get all Chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run
Gonna be fun
Whatever
You're number twelve, Bruce
He hands a card reading "12" to Su
As Archie and Su make their way toward the arena -- didn't come here to fight
You won't have to
That was just to get us in
53
They reach the arena
It's also huge
Packed with men
Hazy with smoke
Loud with betting, cheers and boos
large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the shit out of each other
Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of plastic    over their laps
Whenever a hard kick or punch lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to shield    themselves from flying blood
Good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here
Find the ring
Yeah
Okay
He looks around
Lotta African-American males
Could take a little while
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands, and Su follows
- Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door
He starts to take her in his arms
Daria slows him up
Guides him back toward a sofa
Sit down
Odion sits
Put on some music
Odion puts a  in the
Cranks up some -
Nah
Something slower
Odion
fills the room
That's good
Now just relax
And watch
54
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the music
Then starts dancing for him
Slow and sexy
And Odion's eating it up
- Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags
Via earwig mike -- Tommy
/
- Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform
Here come da bug man
-    - The  watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door
Hey
Howzit
What the hell you doing
Pest control
Don't tell me you didn't get your notice
What notice
See, that burns my ass right to the bone
mean, hey, 'm here doing my job
Anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed
Yeah
How come
'Cause foreign people're bringing all 55
their scary-assed foreign bugs over here
'know, in their luggage and shit
And then the bugs're getting loose and fucking everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick
Anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread
We're doing business inside
Can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray
Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it
Manager's busy
Okay
Your call
Just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow
Quarantine people
They'll be shutting you down for non- compliance
Peace out
Tommy starts to go
Wait, wait, wait
Tommy stops
City's really gonna come and close us up
Quicker'n a Zip-loc
You sure you're not fucking with me
'm a licensed exterminator
Why would  be fucking with you
The Doorman considers it another moment
Then -- 56
Look
Let's do this
You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers
Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody
'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later
How's that
The Doorman considers a moment
Then -- Yeah, okay
Get the bombs, and come on
- Daria keeps dancing
Peeling off layers now
Showing skin
Odion's starting to salivate
'  - What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a normal office
No expense spared
(Think Joel again
) large, "Zen"   meditatively in the center of the room
The door opens
The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around in amazement
Look
At
This
Just do your thing and go, bro
Roger that
He positions the
Then
He sets off one
The other
As he goes -- Just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in

Clip onto ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story window
window into

Fait tries the
Locked shut
He quickly tapes it
it
He and Miles climbs inside
Grab the bug bombs and toss them out
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out a folding metal detector
Uses it to scan the entire room quickly: floor, walls, ceiling
Gets - - from various hidden metal
But he's looking for something bigger
He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk
Safe
He kneels
Removes a desk panel
And
There it is
The safe is small but highly secure
Take it down
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett
50 caliber rifle big gun
Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium
50 cal
" - Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and sexy for Odion
'  - Miles loads one of the massive
cartridges into the Barrett
Even with the music, they're gonna hear it when  fire this tank buster
Daria
Get ready to move
(then) 58
Do it
Miles aims the  directly at the safe lock
Miles - Odion starts
What was that
'  - Basically, the lock's just gone
Melted
Burned through by the  slug
Fait swings the safe door open
- Odion's heading out the door
When he stops
Looks back at Daria
realization dawning
'Sometimes you need an old friend'
He steps toward Daria
Backhands her
Hard
Then opens the door
outside the door addresses Odion
It came from the office
Watch her
Don't let her leave
Odion goes
The Man enters
Shuts the door, leering at Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off
'  - Fait's tossed the safe
No stones
Not here
They're here
Somewhere else
What're you talking about
59
'm telling you, they're here
What're we gonna do
Everyone out
Fait's started searching the room
Tearing it apart
What about you
gotta save Vanessa
gotta find 'em
'm not leaving you
Yes, you are
Go
Now
Someone starts  the
Fait doesn't stop
Come on, man
They're outside
Give it up
Shut up and get the fuck outta here
That's an order
Miles hesitates
Fait's unreachable
Chambers' men are trying to break down the door
Miles goes
Out the window
Onto the ascender-descender
And gone
- Daria finishes dressing
When
'know,  got the big one
Her response is a front kick to the head
Followed by a spin kick, knocking him out
Then, stepping past him -- Keep it in your pants
'  - Odion and his men break down the door
60
Fait's still searching
Desperate to find the stones
Desperate to save his daughter
He fights off the first men to reach him
wild animal
Fights off another
And then
The guns are out
All pointed at Fait
No stones
No exit
- Daria walks out the front door
'  - Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he eats another meal
Lobster
At first, we don't realize who Chambers is addressing
If you're willing to pay five, you're willing to pay ten
(') You're    willing to pay ten, you're willing    to pay twenty
Twenty, forty
Forty, eighty
'm not selling    till  know exactly where the ceiling    is
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling
You like foreplay
How much money do you want for the stones
hate foreplay
Fuck the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points
Bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop
You understand
(beat) So, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number
very high number
very final number number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when  hear it
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time
Still isn't looking
Forks up some lobster meat
When
61
Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him
And
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck
Chambers doesn't wait for whatever's next
Jumps back
Fast for a big man
But Ling is much faster
Stronger
Deadlier
Quickly, and quietly beats Chambers like a drum
Chambers knows when it's finally tent-folding time
Croaks surrender through the blood and swelling -- Okay, okay
Ling stops
Ain't worth my life
'll take the five and call it a game
-  '  - Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets
Closing the blankets behind him
To the sentries, who've heard nothing -- Mr
Chambers is resting
He says not to bother him
which, as Ling walks away
'  - Chambers
No one will bother him
Ever
The lobster fork driven deep into the base of his skull
- Archie still looking for the man with the diamond pinkie-ring
Su still following
By the way, when we do find him, what then
'll handle it
In the cage, a fight has just ended
The loser's unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning airplane propeller
The winner doesn't look much better
62
The midget   steps in with a mike
Seven advances, eleven's out
Next up, eight versus twelve
Eight versus twelve
Fighters report to the cage
As Archie and Su continue the search -- You're after the stones, too, huh
No response from Su
Beat
did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em
Guess who get back to me
My Defense Department connection
Now,  think he's calling me about this surplus - 14 Tomcat 'm trying to get my hands on
But no
Turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones -- In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the midget calls out -- Number twelve
(to Su) -- only they're not jewels -- Number twelve
They're -- Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a grabs his arm and raises it
Yells out -- Twelve's right here
Su pulls his arm back
'd be scared of him, too
Su glances into the ring, seeing the  for the first time
The Bruiser's beckoning
63
Let's go, chickenshit
Su waves them off
Not today
The catcalls start
Archie leans into Su
know it    wasn't the plan
But if you don't    fight, they're gonna toss us out on    our asses
We might never find the    guy
long beat
Su hates this place
Su hates Archie
- Fait's in handcuffs
big cut on his head
Being escorted by two  to the stairs leading out of the club
To Odion, as they pass him -- #1 He's pretty beat up
Yeah
Fell down the stairs
Enjoy the jail sex, Fait
As they continue up the stairs -- #2 Better have the

Daria, Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance
Via earwigs -- We're still here to help you,
Anything you want us to do
- Fait's heard
64
Not yet
The  treating him doesn't understand
What
Nothing
-  ' His cuffed hands
Fingers feeling the inside of his belt
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the leather
Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out recess in the belt
Where
Fait has a hidden handcuff key
- struggling against their duct-tape bonds
- Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back
There's tape around her feet
Tape over her mouth
The  is nearby, but she's not watching
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape
Finally gives up trying
Just lies there
Tired and scared
- The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight leaves his corner and advances on Su
Su has nothing against number eight
He's just trying to buy time
So he dodges his opponent
Not exactly running
Fighting by not fighting
target one moment, gone the next
Again and again, number eight swings and misses
Until
Number eight delivers a knockout blow
Unfortunately it's against himself
The momentum of a missed punch carries him headfirst into a metal post
Number eight drops
As the referee counts over number eight, Su uses the chance to find
65
still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd
Not making any friends as he does it
Number eight's on his feet
Moving in again
When
Suddenly, he sees it
The ring
dodges number eight again
Then
Sees Archie signaling he's found the guy
And
Gets nailed by number eight solid hit
Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight
Whereupon
Su turns to him and bows
You win
Su turns, heads out of the cage
The crowd roaring its disapproval
As
The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's path
No quitting
Get back in there
Su moves him aside
The midget resists
Five other waiting fighters come to the midget's aid
Forcing Su back into the cage
Where
It's now Su against them all
- Daria, Tommy and Miles wait
Two     extreme - dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out to eat
In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a four-wheel
The two men Ogle     Daria
To her -- - #1 Looking good
She ignores them
To each other, so she can hear -- - #2 Nice rack
- #1 Like the upstairs, like the basement, 66
too
Shut up, assholes
- Fait's heard
Looks past the Paramedic
Past the Cops talking outside
Sees the hot dog stand in b
g
Sees the truck with the motorcycle and  parked near the stand
The Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait
To the cops outside -- He's all patched up
Cop calls inside to Fait
#1 Let's go
Fait stands
Starts out
Into his mike -- Get ready to move
And we see
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore
- Fait reaches the rear doorway
When
He jumps
Knocks one Cop down
Shoves another aside
And takes off running
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise
It takes a few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others by car
Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand
To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on -- Get the car
Stay close
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into the bed of the truck
Jumps on the
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening
67
- #1 Hey
Too late
Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck
Right through the nylon mesh tailgate
Fait flies from the truck bed
Lands on the hood of a police car
Gets big air off the windshield
Clears the rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto- Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the remaining motorcycle
His friend calls to him -- - #1 Don't let that fucker get away
The Moto-Rider   the
Drops it into first
Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and  off in pursuit
- Vanessa still taped up
still
When
(
) We go now to this breaking story
Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the
(
) You're watching a man on an all- terrain vehicle leading police in a high-speed chase through downtown Los Angeles
An
spokesman says the man, Anthony Fait -- Vanessa looks over in surprise
(
) -- commandeered the
after escaping from police officers while being treated at a local hospital for injuries resulting from his earlier arrest for robbery
And this is certainly one of the wildest chases we've witnessed here in
-   - 68
Fait's flying
Seventy-plus
Down streets, sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter
The 's fast, strong and maneuverable
One problem: so is the moto-cross bike
The guy's right on Fait's ass
Matching move with move
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move
While on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an escape
At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator
At another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure
This'll be a news highlight for days to come
- The place is bedlam
In the crowd, bets are going down on the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage
Su versus the five fighters
And the midget
The different fighters use different fighting styles against Su
Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street fighting
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand
At one point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another opponent
At another point, Su wields the midget like a fighting staff
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition
-   - Fait's everywhere
And so is the moto-bike
Still on his tail
Fait veers inside a building
The bike follows
-   - Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs
One floor
Two floors
Up and up
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway
Nowhere left to go except
Out the window at the end
And
That's just where he goes
69
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes
-  - The  and the moto-bike make the first leap
Onto the roof of a next-door building
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop
Jump after jump
Longer and longer
Until
The - eats it in a spectacular
The moto- rider walks away, but his chase is over
-   - Fait's   down another street, still chased by cops
Into his mike -- Yo
,   '  -  - Here
Above ground parking garage in Chinatown
Know it
Get there
- It's down to Su and the kick boxer
The kick boxer spins and kicks and punches, and
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes
Ties him into a pretzel
Cinches him tight
Then
Looks for Archie
Can't find him
Can't find the guy wearing the ring
And hurries out of the cage
- Fait jukes the  in the entrance
Up the spiral ramp
70
Moments later, police   up and seal the entrance
- On , a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police
(
) And it looks like this chase will end here, as police seal off the building
Vanessa, watching
- Su runs into the parking area
Archie's in the -bird
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front
Where is he
Decided to leave early
Where'd he go
Right here
Su looks inside the car
- Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring
Holding a   to the guy's cheek
Good thing  brought my stunner
He  the air
Then puts it back to the guy's cheek
Okay, bud, wanna start the  and
- On , the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls down the exit ramp toward the police barricade
71
(
) Here's a car coming down the exit ramp
We see the police approach the car
(
) The police apparently talking to the driver
The police let the car pass
(
) Now letting this car drive on as the search inside continues
Vanessa notices something about the car
Looks carefully
When
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle of the people inside, and
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy
Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe
And soon he'll be coming to get her
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape, Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct- tape bonds
When, just as it's about to seem hopeless again, her eyes go to
Her necklace
The chain and pink diamond pendant
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace slides off onto the    bed
Then turns around and  picks up the necklace behind her    back
Holding it as taut as  she can between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around her wrists
-    - The gang's all here
All eyes on the club
knew the stones were in there
Question is, how do we get 'em out
Place is slamming nonstop
long beat
Fait doesn't answer
Something isn't right
72
Yeah
That's what 'm getting
The doorman
Where the hell is he
(then) Everyone stay put
which, as he and Su go -- -   - pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down the hall toward Chambers' office
No Chambers' guys
don't get it
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and listen
Hear nothing
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look
Then Su opens the door
'  - Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find
Odion and the other Chambers' men
Dead
Skull shot
get it now
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain, where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom
Beat
Then -- Are they there
Su doesn't answer, still searching
No
This can't fucking happen
They gotta be there
Another beat
Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one black stone
It takes Fait a moment to understand
73
What
That's it
The rest are gone
Fait can't believe it
What the hell happened
Who got 'em
Ling
How do you know
know
How'd he get here before us
He's good
Beat
Failure
Summed up in one word: Vanessa
(then, trying) He has the stones
There's      no reason to keep her
Hell, she's a      little girl, she's eight years old     -- she can't hurt him
He can let      her go
He can just fucking let her     go
Su just looks at him
Not a chance
And he knows Fait knows it, too
It's over
For Fait, it's as if his life just ended
What the hell am  gonna do
We need to go
Fait doesn't move
Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage, and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of exotica, destroying it
Beat
Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes
Then -- 74
Come on
which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go
- Ling pours the black stones out on a table
To Sona and Charles -- We're back in business
Good
don't have to baby-sit much longer
hate kids
Is everything else ready
We just have to test the device
Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption nearby, speaks up
Dye master oscillator
And not test, calibrate
Which 'm now ready to do
Goggles
When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch
And
Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser  begin bombarding a sensor
which
- Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her wrists from the duct-tape
She quickly    rips the tape from her mouth
Untapes her ankles
Then tries     to figure out what to do next
Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help her escape or fight
When
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone
An old model
So old, it takes her a moment to figure out exactly what it is
Then she pushes "Power," and
The phone turns on
Sort of
- 75
"Low Batt" flashes on the screen
'   - Rock bottom
Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off
Daria tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent
Even Archie's quiet for once
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese to someone who is obviously his superior
lost the stones
Ling has them
don't know where he is have no way to find him
What do you want me to do
Under which, the  begins to
And
Fait's too upset to care about answering
- Vanessa's on the old cell phone
We hear  on the other end
Answer, Daddy, answer
- "Low Batt"
"Low Batt"
'   - The ' still
After another moment
Want me to get that
Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer
Hello
: 76
- Vanessa whispers urgently
Daddy
Vanessa
Which gets everyone's attention
Come get me
Please
want to go home
Okay, baby, okay
Just calm down
Under which, in b
g
, Su quickly ends the phone call to his superior
Still in Chinese -- 'll call you back
(continuing, to Vanessa) Where are you
don't know
'm in a van inside a big building
They painted the windows
can't look out
Try
Try to see something
Vanessa puts her eye to the window
Finally finds a small gap in the paint
' Few details
Just some chairs and bright green light from Russell's contraption
- ' "Low Batt"
"Low Batt"
77
see chairs
And there's green light
Fait repeats for the others' benefit
You see chairs and green light
Where's the light coming from
can't tell
Is it bright
The green light, baby -- is it bright
Yeah
Really, really bright
(to Su) It's real bright
Daddy, hurry
'm scared
know, baby
Just hang in there - ' Fait's voice drops out as the battery dies
Daddy
Daddy
Vanessa
Vanessa
Shit
Fait slams the phone down in frustration
But Su's mind is on what she told them
He's doing it here
Tonight
78
What
Selling the stones
dye laser emits green light
He needs it to activate them
What the hell you talking about
What are these stones
Archie answers it
Doomsday in disguise
All eyes go to him
They're some kinda new synthetic plutonium
Small and portable, but mega-powerful
This fucker's making bombs
Not making them
Yeah, he'd need a big operation for that
Why bother
Just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid
He makes millions, they make the bombs, then
'look out, world
' Okay, so we know what he's up to
How's it get us to Vanessa
Su considers it a moment
The buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly
Somewhere private
Accessible by aircraft
Vanessa said she's inside a big building
Could be a hangar
79
Man, there's dozens of little airports around here
We'd never get to 'em all
Flight plans
Hey, yeah
Flight plans show destinations
All aircraft file 'em with the Aviation Administration
If we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down
Daria, call the aviation people
Use our
credentials
We need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight
Everyone else get ready to move
Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked
You break out the heat
Tommy, you gotta get us a diversion
can help with that
Do it all fast
- Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell
Russell finishes testing his contraption
Switches it
Then, removing his goggles -- We're operational
The others remove their goggles
Sona checks her watch
The buyers arrive in less then an hour
Beat
Ling holds up a black stone and examines it
So small
So deadly
We're selling conscience for money
look at the others
Serious
Then a broad smile of 80
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face
But it's a lot of money
Beat
He puts down the stone
glance at the camper
Be ready to kill the girl and go as soon as the sale's over
- Fait's finger indicates a spot
(
) Wick Airfield
'  - Fait, Su, Daria and Miles
Five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other
Sounds like our best shot
It better be, or my baby's dead
He and Su exchange a look
Then -- Let's go
- Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard
- Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the windows
'  - 81
An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly muscle
Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new arrivals
In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale
There are five buyers -- one , one , one , one , one
The French Buyer is in a wheelchair
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one to three bodyguards
Vanessa  her ,
Charles standing nearby
Too close for her to escape
Charles turns, and
Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the window
There's no way out
'  - Driving
Daria and Miles following in their car
(
) So tell me
How the hell's Taiwan fit into all this
(
) One of our scientists made the stones
Tried to go into business for himself
We stopped him
Recovered the stones
Ling betrayed us
He took them
(
) Ling
He was one of you
(
) We were partners
Six of us
He killed the others
He thought he killed me, too
(
) (beat) So what're you really after -- the stones or the payback
82
Both
(
) Yeah
Let's get it all
- You're the world's foremost arms dealers
You all know that weaponry equals power
And in the world of weaponry, nukes rule
() (') But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle
But what if it weren't
That's the question that brought you here tonight
And here's the answer
Ling holds up a single stone
In its present state, it's completely inert
Zero radiation, zero volatility
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table
Folds the velvet over
Then, whack, hits it hard with a mallet
He unfolds the velvet
The stone's smashed to pieces
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then inserts the capsule into his contraption
Goggles on
Everyone puts on goggles
Then Russell hits the switch, and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone, which begins to glow
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale -- Firecracker
44 magnum
Sidewinder
Tomahawk
Daisy Cutter
Hiroshima
two Hiroshimas
And it just keeps going
Until, finally -- 83
New World Order
As the buyers absorb this
Russell shuts off the beams
Goggles off
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who holds it up
One small    fragment
Transformed into a source    of immense energy
More powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium a hundred    times its size
beat as this sinks in
The purpose of today's sale is to begin trading a new commodity on the black market and establish its value
There are fifty stones available in the first sale
The opening price is one million per stone
Bids, please
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit
At the same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market- analysis for Sona to consult
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation
Five at one million
Sona is silent
Silence means "No
" Five at one-point-two
Silence
Three at two million
84
We'll take that
Six at one-five
Silence
Ten at two million
Silence
-    - Near their cars
(: From now until the battle's over, it's night
At the airport, Fait, Su and Fait's team will all communicate via earwigs
) Miles, what do you see
- Atop the building next to Ling's hangar
The five choppers rest on the wide tarmac below, between the two buildings
Miles scans Ling's hangar through the scope of a silenced sniper rifle
-  - the Ling killers outside the hangar
(
) Two sentries my side
Then, scanning inside Ling's hangar  windows -- (
) Sale's at this end
There's a camper with painted windows
Middle of the hangar
- Vanessa said she was in a van
That's gotta be it
(to Daria) When we get her, you move her outta 85
there fast
'll keep her safe
Su's reached the top of outside stairs
Opens a door and enters
- High above the floor, Su steps onto a catwalk
The sale continuing below
More heated now
Eight at three
Silence
Nine at three
Silence
Ten at three-one
We'll take that
There are now thirty-seven stones available
And now, in more and more rapid-fire succession -- Five at three-five
Eight at three-five

One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down
Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a in the shoulder

Tommy and Archie
Watch out for the camper
Punch it
The sale's now a frenzy
Five at five million
Six at five
Seven at five
Ten at five
Ten at five-one
Five-two
When suddenly
-
Archie's Abrams   through a wall and into the hangar
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole
At the same time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted machine gun on the stunned group
Freeze, motherfuckers
87
Russell watches the advancing tank
knew it
knew it
- Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the Abrams for shelter
- Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's happening
' Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank
She looks back into the camper
Finds a heavy iron skillet amid the stove utensils
Swings it
And
She  a side
' -  (  ) We  Vanessa, jumping out of the camper
(
) Vanessa's out of the camper
Running this way
- To Daria -- Stay
And he's gone, sprinting after her just as
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar doors
She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to motor open
88
hears the
Turns
Sees Vanessa and goes after her
-  (  ) Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs
(
) She's out
Then,  Charles coming after her -- (
) There's a guy after her
- rips through the collar of his leather coat
Just behind his neck
Just missing him
But he keeps coming
-  (  ) Charles rolling out under the door
again
The   off the  right next to him
In a flash, he's up and running
Heading out into the darkness of the airfield after Vanessa
Meanwhile, back inside
In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes its slow approach
Archie's not a great driver
Tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group
Just be cool
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck
89
said don't move, motherfucker
Russell just keeps going
Slides open the side door in the back of the five-ton, revealing
twin-fifty machine gun
Two barrels,
50 caliber
Dangerous even for a tank
Russell vaults in and takes aim
Fucking amateurs
He starts
People start running

take big  out of whatever they hit
Shit
What do we do
Shoot back
How
The question's answered for him
He somehow does the right thing
And
Tommy's   begins   out of the - and  near it
Tommy's a horrible shot; the gun's more in control of him
But
Russell finally dies under a  of
Twin
50's some major firepower
How'd that little shit get one
Motherfucker
Couldn't fucking listen
which
Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo
Ling has the stones
When
Su is there
Blocking the way
Sona attacks
Su easily blocks the counters
Knocking Sona back
Never taking his eyes off Ling
When
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto  and turns the gun on Su
Su dives for cover as the   the  where he'd just been standing
As Sona continues hunting Su
Su sees 90
Ling getting into the limo
To Archie and   Tommy, as he signals -- Don't let him get away
As a result of which
Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo
Tommy's
50 is out of ammo
He switches to the
30 cal
tank's machine gun
As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins away
Ling's trying to drive out, when the
30 in the
The tank keeps coming
Ling bails out as the   the
which
Play cat and mouse
Su rapidly runs out of room to hide
He can't get away
Su stands
Faces her
Faces the inevitable
When
Daria appears from nowhere
Kicks the gun from Sona's hand
To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed limo Get him
Su goes after Ling
And now it's Daria vs
Sona
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her side
It's a good fight
Until, at last, Sona finds the Scorpion
She swings it up
And
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the at herself, just as she
The burst rips through her chest and kills her
And now, here's what's been going on outside
91
As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the tarmac into the darkness of the airfield
flips to   on the sniper-scope
And
-  - Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible
Charles is closing in on her
Cross-hairs  him
The  knocks his gun from his hands
Charles is slowed but keeps going
-  - Charles reaches the flight line
Parked planes, a gas truck, a shed, etc
He disappears behind the equipment
sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa
He comms Fait
Lost 'em behind the gas truck
stops behind the gas truck
Looks around for Vanessa
No sign of her
Until
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all the way
He whips it open
And
There's Vanessa, hiding inside
Charles grabs her
Yanks her out struggling and kicking
Time to end this my way
And then
(
) Drop the girl
92
Charles looks over
Fait is there, holding a gun on him
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father
Put her down
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground
He releases her
Daddy
Vanessa runs to her father
Dives into his arms
It's a little more energetic than Fait was expecting
And
Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind her
He hits Fait hard
kick sends the gun flying
Charles keeps coming
Charles keeps pounding
Fait's hampered by Vanessa
She won't let him go
Fait stays between Charles and Vanessa
Guarding his little girl
Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly unstoppable force
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through struts
-  - Fait, Charles and Vanessa
No clear shot
comms Fait
No shot
, The fight continues
Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal attack
When
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane
They fall
Charles moves in
And
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's wheel
The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by a length of nylon rope
Fait turns to Vanessa
93
Don't move
Fait jumps to his feet
Swinging the chocks
Not quite like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace
And now, all of Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat the living shit out of Charles
Charles tries to fight back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer
Until
mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off
Charles is unconscious before he hits the ground
Fait stands over Charles
Tosses the chocks down
Wrong kid
Wrong dad
Fait turns
He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding
He scoops her up
And
Father and daughter hold each other tight
Forever
During all of which, also
Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs out just as
Four helicopters take off, one after the other, carrying the buyers away
The fifth chopper, an  A109, is  , waiting for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a bodyguard
Ling intercepts them
Knocks out the bodyguard and tips over the Frenchman's chair
Then jumps into the Agusta
- Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head
Go
Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out
The Agusta begins to lift off
Su starts running toward the helicopter
Runs under the rising aircraft
Jumps
Just in time to
Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels
94
As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to get a foot hooked on something, anything
In the process, he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly
Ling hears the
Looks out
'  - ' swinging beneath the Agusta
To the pilot -- Retract the gear
- The pilot hits the wheels-up switch
And
The gear begins to retract
Disappearing into the bottom of the chopper
In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold
Shoot it down
Now
And then
Su lets go
Drops fifteen feet to the ground
As
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams tank is stopped
The turret swivels toward the Agusta
Archie aims the cannon
Can you hit it
No problem
Absolutely
Load
Tommy slides a shell into the breech
95
Archie's locked on
He hits the trigger
And
The big
And
The Agusta's tail is   by the
Archie and Tommy exult
Shot him right in the ass
did it
can't believe it
Thought you said it was no problem
What do  know
- The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from crashing
The out-of-control  swings back toward Su and the hangar, losing altitude
Then  into the tarmac, ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle around Su before  into another  and The spilled fuel ignites
circle of intense fire
With Su in the middle
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the circle
But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside
Into the circle
He emerges with the bag of stones
Su is waiting
96
You were lucky last time
You Won't be lucky again
The final fight begins
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire, using everything they can lay their hands on
Each the equal of the other
Each knowing it's a fight to the death
For a long time, the fight could go either way
Until
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck
Like Charles, Su thrashes and flails
Like Charles, he can't get away
'll kill you fast
You won't Feel a thing
won't
You will What happens next happens in an instant: Su breaks the hold
Hooks one of Ling's arms
Wrenches it
direction it can't go
Ling's   ,
Ling screams in pain
Just as
Su pulls the ceramic Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from Ling's pocket
And
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth
Ling gags, choking on the capsule lodged in his throat
His horror- stricken eyes meet Su's
Su lets him suffer another moment
Then, in  Chinese -- This is for our friends
And Su strikes him in the throat
spearing, open-hand blow with his fingertips
Hard
Hard enough that
' The
Releasing the hot, glowing white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe
The fragment's super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook Ling's body from within
The power of a few thousand microwave ovens turned on all at once
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as
97
As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks from the inside out
Not simply burned
Horribly desiccated
His seared and darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his skeleton
Human jerky
In a moment, it's finished
Ling's dry-roasted remains topple over
Su has closed a chapter
- Su and Fait meet on the tarmac
Su has the stones
Fait's holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms

g
The two men regard each other a moment
We got it all
(then) What happens to the stones
They'll be destroyed
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive in b
g
Looks like 'll be doing some jail time
Jail
Man, you just helped save the planet
Law's gotta allow for that
look between Fait and Su
Su nods
'll do what  can
That's good, 'cause  mean, we make a helluva team, y'know
(to Su) Well, not you, 'cause you're law enforcement
But the rest of us -- look, a white guy comes in handy now and then
'know, if you're pulling a job in Beverly Hills or ripping off a country club or whatever
What kind of percentage are we talking
98
We're not
Fait looks at Vanessa again
Finding a new purpose in her eyes
Beat
Time  got real
He regards the others
Time we all did
Get real
What's that mean
Means we're through with that life
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's
Beat
Tommy nods
Fait looks to Daria for her answer
'm with you,
He looks to Miles
Whatever you say, man
Fait looks back to Su
They hold the look
Good luck
Faith
Another beat
Then they turn and start walking toward the arriving cop cars
Daria and Miles follow
Archie and Tommy lag behind
As they all walk away from us -- What, you're all gonna go straight, just like that
Maybe oughta try it yourself
Me
Are you kidding
've had straight jobs
You ever had a 99
straight job
had plenty of straight jobs
Name one

You were an Avon lady

You got a problem with that
No, it's just, well, uh
Nah, 'm just fucking with you
(then) But my momma did it, and don't you dare start disrespecting my momma
And so on
