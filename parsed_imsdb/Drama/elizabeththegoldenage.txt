: Written by William Nicholson & Michael Hirst 5th July 2006 (Dialogue printed in brackets to be translated and spoken in Spanish or German as appropriate, and sub-titled
) 1 Painted images of the Elizabethan age - world divided by religious hatred
The new Protestant faith is spreading
Bodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring - The most powerful ruler in Christendom, Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic faith
Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court paintings: stiff, formal, imperious
Only England stands in his way: a weak impoverished nation ruled by a woman
Finally images of God in judgement, as if speaking to his chosen servant
Philip prepares to obey the will 2             of his God

, King of Spain bows his head low, abasing himself before his God
/ : scorial Palace, Spain, 1585
Now, slowly, he raises his head
His eyes open, and we see there the glow of a new certainty
God has spoken to him

obey
My Lord and my God

On his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission
Silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by
Through the hallway to a grand salon fall silent and bow as he passes
So into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12-year-old daughter, the
As he enters, all kneel
His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him
His gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage
He speaks to all
(God has made his will known to me
The time for our great enterprise has come
) The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but disciplined satisfaction
He murmurs softly to himself
At last
Cathedral bells ring out
The cheers of a crowd are heard through the open windows
The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony

Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and the  in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer
The Infanta is by his side
His  cluster behind him
Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of  : a formidable reminder of the king's power
Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd
As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration

eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling, cheering
They see the Queen now
They call out
Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave
There's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the Queen
They are  and
Over this an insistent voice: (
) Why do you go among the people, majesty
tell you plainly, you will be murdered
Every Catholic in England is a potential assassin

We catch glimpses of the Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation: , 30s, an ambitious courtier; , 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back from the rest, watching from the side lines, , the Queen's veteran friend and adviser
Be warned by the atrocities in France
God-fearing Christians murdered by Papist cut-throats inflamed by hatred of the truth
We know the Catholics take their orders from Spain
The Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart as Queen of England in waiting
(sharply) Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out by her own ungrateful nation
With respect, majesty - a Catholic Queen
Your loyal Protestant supporters don't understand why Mary Stuart lives under our protection, at our expense - very considerable expense - Mary Stuart is my cousin
She is our guest
And she is under our control
But while she lives, majesty, she is a beacon that draws our enemies' eyes and hopes
While she lives
She is the poison at the heart of England
The poison must be cut out
4A You'd have me make a martyr of her
What is her crime
- 7                                                                 7 The Londoners on the river bank cheer and wave as the royal barge goes by
(
) Treachery, ma'am
All Catholics are traitors
Their loyalty is to the Pope of Rome
(
) How many Catholics are there in England, sir
(
) Immense numbers, majesty
(
) We believe half the nation clings to the old superstitions
,   - 8                                                                 8 What would you have me do
`Cut out' half the people of England
We must act, majesty
Our inaction is taken to be weakness
If any of my people break the law, they will be punished
Until that day,  wish them to be let them alone
Until the day they rise in rebellion
Majesty, we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the land - Fear creates fear, sir
will not punish my people for their beliefs
Only for their deeds
am assured that the people of England love their Queen
My constant endeavour is to earn that love

Elizabeth, seated on the royal barge, sees them with satisfaction
She gives an occasional slight inclination of her head in acknowledgement
Elizabeth sits with her favourite seated beside her, her youngest and prettiest maid of honour,
Walsingham sits facing them, looking sourly at the cheering spectators
The people are agitated
What people
5A Your bishops are preaching that God is showing his displeasure- the Queen being still unmarried - some are saying infertile - What nonsense
Dangerous nonsense
Mary Stuart has a son - Why does everyone torment me with Mary Stuart

Produce an heir and there'll be no more talk of Mary Stuart
Isn't it customary to obtain a husband before producing an heir

As she kneels she holds out one hand behind her, not looking round
Bess steps forward, and taking her hand, kneels and prays with her

That is true mercy
England is lost to darkness, Father

- We see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see
Great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape
Everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees
Wagon teams haul immense trunks away
Fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky
- On Reston's face as he stares at the fires
He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty
The light of purifying fire
He turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze

She is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties
Round her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a chaplain

But even Elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment
Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding out the letter
My Queen
Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her and reads it for herself
Our friends write to give us hope

That's enough, Annette
(But she loves it

Please
And when the bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be queen
The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning
The Warden of Chartley Hall,   , enters the room
He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward
Mary turns to him at once with a teasing smile
Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand
She holds out one hand to be smacked
The other hand holds the letter out of sight
Have  sinned again, sir
No, no, my lady
Unless beauty is counted a sin

(
) So what's it for, my young friend
Not for shooting rabbits, 'm guessing
We live in dangerous times
We do indeed
Savage moves close as if to study the loading process
We see the two of them talking from outside the window
(very low) The conspiracy gains strength
Tell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court
The Armourer nods
He hands the pistol to Savage
Savage takes it and leaves
Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now seated Armourer
The Armourer turns round
ask for your forgiveness
Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it to one side, and snaps his neck
Reston walks quietly out of the store

Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham
The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch her, fall to their knees
God bless your majesty - God love you
- See her sweet face
Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments
Hang the Papists
- Look out for traitors, Elizabeth
Mary Stuart is the whore of Rome
Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the crowd
Nearby there stands another young man who is watching, not cheering:
pushes her way almost to the Queen, holding her baby before her
Your blessing, majesty
My little one, your blessing

The mother bobs a curtsey
The Queen moves on, with her entourage

Babington turns to look

She tries not to smile
Courtesy of a Spanish ship, that found itself unable to complete its journey
Elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket

He holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself
But he can't do it (singing) Salve regina, mater misericordiae, vita dulcedo et spes nostra salve
In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire
They are young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and fourth man stands before them, his back to us, watching Savage
At first we don't see who he is

) His weakness endangers us all
He can't go on with us
And we can't leave him behind
Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a priest
Who will help him
Babington rises
Reston nods his approval
Babington goes off through the trees
Reston and the others follow a little behind
singing) Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle - He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer to know what's happening
Babington takes the pistol from his hand
Make your peace with God
Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means to do
Terror overwhelms him
No, Tom
Don't kill me
don't want to die
Now he's blubbering with fear
Babington is shaken by this, and can't shoot
Reston begins to pray aloud
Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala - The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm
Babington too joins in, now weeping
Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine
Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt - Savage falls dead

Walsingham frowns
He climbs the stairs to the door of his study
There, pacing nervously, is his younger brother , a middle-aged student
Walsingham's scowl disappears
He opens his arms wide
William
Hello, Francis
They embrace
Then Walsingham pushes him back to take a good look at him
You look terrible
Don't they feed you in Paris

Learned the secrets of the universe yet

Walsingham and Ursula are by the dinner table

They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech of love

Your majesty's beauty is dazzling to my eyes
Your learning is famed throughout Europe

Oh, Elizabeth
How blessed am  to stand in your fabled presence, warmed by your greatness as by the rays of the sun
Oh Elizabeth
To speak your name is to hear celestial music
May that sweet sound guide me through my life to come - Elizabeth
Elizabeth

But now that am bathed in the radiance of your glory,  am overwhelmed
am conquered

Only your love, great Elizabeth, can restore me to life

The Spaniards sneer openly
But Elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity
Your highness does me great honour
Shall we eat our dinner
It should prove almost as restorative as my love
Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the dinner gets under way
They join the much larger group who simply stand and watch
Royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court

29A Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show
He catches Bess's eye and they share a smile
So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship
You shoot holes in its sides,  suppose
May 1 Blue Draft - p
30 No, ma'am
sunk ship is of no value
The object is to capture and command
And how do you do that
Surprise
Speed
Irresistible violence
Calley, listening, rolls his eyes
Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side, glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies

he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass
As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh
They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me
You should try it
She beckons to Bess

Bess comes forward

Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies

31 Elizabeth turns back to her guest
His highness is tired after his journey
The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply
No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen
lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German
(You play the game very well, my young friend
But don't you sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking
) The Archduke's eyes open very wide
He glances at Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile
( daren't even think what 'm really thinking
) (You're thinking, perhaps, that you would far rather be home
) (You're very wise, madame
) He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it
Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies

don't suppose you could get one for me
They're not dangerous, are they
That depends what you propose to do with them

Bess draws him away from the court ladies
If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment - May 1 Blue Draft - p
32 rawn away by the brightest light of all
That can only mean the Queen

They both look at the Queen
She's watching Raleigh
He bows
It seems you've presumed after all
It seems you're determined to think the worst of me
Tell me what it is you really want
What every man wants
Money
Fame
Love
In that order
Each leads to the next
The money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World
The success of my infant colony there will make me famous
The fame will bring me love
It seems rather a long way round
There are benefits along the way
It is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city
Which you will no doubt name after yourself
May 1 Blue Draft - p
33 (smiling) No doubt Well, then
am answered
May  ask a question in return
Of course
How am  to win the Queen's favour
Why should  tell you that, sir
've little enough to offer, know
But whatever  have to give - ask, and it's yours
Bess thinks for a moment
My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible
All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement
Pay her the compliment of truth
She gives him her hand
He kisses it

Elizabeth watching her, her mind elsewhere

There are duller professions

She looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and snuffling, with a guard by her side
Do stop snivelling
The Warden, my lady
The Warden
My Warden
As she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters
Mary's voice becomes seductive
What have you done now, you bad man
Sent away my laundress
How am  to have clean clothes
Or do you want me to go about naked
Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked
That was not my motive, ma'am
Much though - (Thinking better of it) Your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing
Not her job,  think
How am  to send my intimate letters

As she grieved when your second husband died
And the third
If there is a possibility of a fourth - Tormentor

That you torment and mock me
She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back
They say she's a beautiful woman
Is she so very beautiful
don't presume to comment on the Queen's person
She's called the virgin queen
Why is that, sir
Can it be that no man will have her
Mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep the Warden under her spell
She waves Annette and the laundress away

The same door keeper
Raleigh enters, and this time the door keeper bows, and ushers him through the open doors
Over this we hear Raleigh's voice telling of his adventures: (
) It begins with a journey
You must cross an ocean

Can you imagine - can you feel - what it is to cross an ocean
For weeks you see nothing but the horizon
All round you
Perfect, and empty
Your ship is small - tiny - a speck in such immensity
,   - 33                                                                 33 Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state
We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing of what he tells her
Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice
(
) You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity
What if you never escape
How can you escape
There's nowhere to go
So you must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts, and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope
,   - 33A                                                               33A Now Elizabeth is with Raleigh again, listening as he goes on speaking to her, now directly

Majesty, the Archduke and the court are waiting
(sharply) Let them wait
(to Raleigh) Go on, Mr Raleigh
You were hoping
Hatton bows and leaves, frowning
At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted
But clouds do that, and storms
So you watch, you watch

As they dance, his voice continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him
(
) Then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water
For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself believe
You dare to whisper the word - land
The music ends, and the dance finishes
Elizabeth is seated now - it's later in time
Raleigh is speaking intently to her, and she is captivated
Land
Life
Resurrection
The true adventure
Coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into safe harbour at last
That - that - is the New World

The Archduke Charles and his entourage face her
The court fills the room
Elizabeth makes her formal response to the young Archduke
The Queen lives for her people
You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer  decline your offer of marriage
The Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to the Austrian ambassador
(Can  go home now
) Elizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile
(Go home, my friend
Don't be in a hurry to grow old
Youth is so very precious
) Elizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start to leave the chamber
Bess, in her wake, finds an opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh
Well
Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour
She listened as if she understood me
Then  shall expect some gratitude What do you want

like your immensities
Your ocean is an image of eternity, think
Such great spaces make us small
Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us
You speak like a true explorer
like you, Mr Raleigh
And  like you
She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes
She's not used to such direct replies
Bess is watching them
You know, of course, that when like a man,  reward him
have heard that
And what have you to say about it Reward my mission, majesty, not me
Is the mission not the man
Leave me free to like you in return
That can be my reward
41-43 Go on

Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length
At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk
Mine
Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak
(out of breath) You have - the stronger horse
ours carries the lighter load
The Queen does not give way to others
Raleigh stops his horse
Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him

And can sailors not be lovers

Ah,  see
You like love better than marriage
That  understand
Your majesty is not eager to be married
When  marry,  marry for my country

You've yet to meet your equal
Raleigh hesitates
She understands him

Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates
He understands her as well
You want a friend, not just an equal
You want someone to share your joy when you're happy
Double Blue - july 8 - p

Someone to talk to when there's nothing to say
Someone to find by your side when you wake in the night

(') Ah yes

There

She turns her horse around in the direction from which they came
Raleigh follows

Raleigh
She spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers and Queen's ladies, including Bess
Raleigh spurs his horse to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a distance behind
As they near the courtiers, Raleigh splits off

(indicating on the map) The Duke of Parma has fifteen thousand men on the French coast
They plan to cross the Channel in barges, under the protection of the Spanish fleet, and sail up the Thames
But they don't yet have enough barges at Calais
We have a little time
(surprised) That is so
Our forces defend the Thames entrance at Tilbury
How many men
We have three, possibly four thousand, majesty
If the Spanish fleet reaches Calais in strength, the combined armies will be beyond our power to resist
Therefore, the Spanish fleet must not reach Calais
Majesty, this vast Armada will surely smash through our naval defences
We must be prepared for the worst

91 How did you know about the numbers of the Dutch barges, majesty
don't recall supplying you with that information
You may observe, Walsingham, that don't see my way with only one eye
Nor do  hop along on only one leg
Why then would  rely on only one source of information
She sweeps into her quarters
Her ladies, waiting there, jump up in haste

Her eyes coem to rest on Margaret
She sees that Margaret knows something

watch-tower has been built, and next to it a large beacon of wood
is minding the watch
He stares out to sea, catching sight of something
Over the rim of the world has appeared the long line of the Spanish fleet, like a floating wall, black and menacing
e runs down the steps from the tower
He lights a bundle of sticks and thrusts them again and again into the beacon
The beacon catches fire
As the flames rise into the sky, so a second beacon erupts into flame on the next headland
And then a third on the next, a fourth on the next, a fifth, disappearing around the coastline

92 Here, my lady
Tell me
Is it true
Are you married
Are you with child
Are you
Bess stands before her with her head bowed
Yes, my lady
Elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage, striking out at her, beating her about the head, shrieking out the words that so inflame and wound her
Bess takes the blows in silence
You traitress
You dare to have secrets from me

You ask my permission before you rut - before you marry - before you breed
My bitches wear my collars
Do you hear me
How dare you be with child
Walsingham comes hobbling up
Majesty, please
Dignity - mercy - But Elizabeth is too far gone
She turns on him, eyes blazing
This is no time for mercy
That's what you said to me
don't forget
But you showed mercy, Walsingham
Go to your traitor brother, and leave me to my business
alsingham turns white
Elizabeth is back berating Bess
Is it his child
Tell me

Tell me

He has seen and heard all
He speaks to Elizabeth quietly, sadly
This is not the Queen  love and serve
Elizabeth stares at him
He meets her eyes
His gaze is so unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her
When she speaks next, she is her proud self again

This lady has married without my consent
These are offences punishable by law

The fall of an empire, you told me
Did you mean the English empire
Because by God, England will not fall while  am Queen

You want me to tell your majesty only what your majesty chooses to hear

She turns to Dr Dee and sees his quizzical gaze on her, and she lets her rage pass
Just tell me there's no certainty
The shadows of ghosts, you said
Any outcome is possible
Give me hope
The forces that shape the world are greater than all of us, majesty
How can  promise you that they'll conspire in your favour, even though you are the Queen
But this much  know
When the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature
Some are dumb with terror
Some flee
Some hide
And some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind
Elizabeth understands
She draws herself up, finding now the self-belief she needs for the battle to come
You're a wise man, Dr Dee
And you, madam, are a very great lady

The room is furnished for a gentleman, but the walls are thick and the windows barred

Release Raleigh

Philip reaches the steps at the foot of the altar
He goes down on his knees
Then he drops further down, to abase himself on the hard stone floor
The cardinals turn their backs to him
he Infanta remains standing beside him, impassive, staring at nothing
She throws down her Elizabeth doll

Dead Spanish sailors have been washed up amongst planks, barrels and a torn Spanish ensign
long scream of pain - 155                                                                155 '  - 156                                                                156 - Screaming in pain
final spasm passes through her
She sinks back
The cry of a new-born child
She hears, and her exhausted face lights up with a radiant smile

His wife Ursula and daughter Mary in the background
He's dying
lizabeth has come to him
She looks down on him with deep concern
Francis
My old friend

Stops before a small anonymous house

He looks round the room
fire burning in the grate
English books on the table
half-eaten meal
3 come from your brother
Now we see who he speaks to: William
May 1 Blue Draft - p
106 What does he want
3 He asks your forgiveness
My forgiveness
On William: he stares
Then he understands
Fear brings sudden tears to his eyes
gasp
Walsingham's man has plunged a knife into his heart

have served your majesty - in all things
know it, old friend
Don't leave me now
Walsingham's eyes open
weak smile
ou don't need me any more
Permission - to go - Elizabeth looks tenderly down on him, shaking her head
You always did do as you pleased, whether  wanted it or not
've no doubt you'll do as you please now
He lets his eyes close
She stoops down and kisses his cheek
'  - 161                                                              161 We see Raleigh from behind
He's holding something, and dancing slowly about, and crooning a low song, in the oddest way
Beyond him, half-glimpsed, an inner room, where Bess is resting on a bed
107 Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns, and we see he's holding a new-born
He kisses the baby's little bald head, and sings his wordless song
Footsteps outside
The door opens, and a royal servant enters, followed by other servants and guards
Her majesty the Queen
Elizabeth enters, in formal style
She stands and takes in the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond - Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to the Queen
Elizabeth seems not to see her
regal wave at the servants and guards
They withdraw
Elizabeth stalks round the room
No reason to suppose her displeasure has passed
When was the birth
our nights ago
The mother is well
Thank God
Now Elizabeth turns to Bess, and their eyes meet
The Queen puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek silent forgiveness
And the child
My son is well
Now for the first time she looks at the baby
Your Elizabeth has a child
You must be proud
Yes
Elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby
108 And fulfilled
As any man can be
Elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment
And do you still dream of your shining city, your New World
More than ever
She turns to go
But before she reaches the door, she stops
'd like to give your son my blessing
would be honoured
Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms
She holds him carefully
She finds herself more moved than she had expected
She bends her head over him, and turns her back on Raleigh
Raleigh watches and waits
And waits
: her cheek pressed to the baby's head
Her eyes closed
(
) am called the Virgin Queen
And yet  have many children
You are all my children
There is no jewel, be it never so rich a prize, which  put before this jewel:  mean, your love
want no more wars
England is enough for me
want no lordship over your souls
Only a free people can love
(Beat) And in your love - is my life
