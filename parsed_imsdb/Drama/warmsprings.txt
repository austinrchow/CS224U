, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean
, through shafts of light, white limbs are The  struggles, alone
Bubbles stream upward
He breaks the surface and gasps for air
He begins to swim
His massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large, hard strokes
His legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water

The net is  as he lays, motionless, within its grip

He is  out onto the deck like a fish
on the rotting wooden planks he  himself over on his stomach
Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster-walk
He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat
They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid
towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a
He pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking

He is dancing, holding on tightly to a

Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven, with his hair neatly trimmed
Their connection is powerful and alive
They stop dancing, overwhelmed with mutual desire
He holds the 's face in his hands and  it all over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him
He kisses her passionately on the mouth
Oh, my dear
His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts
She begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around her ankles
Wearing only her tight corset she brings his hands to the laces and together they undo it
(whispering softly) It's all right, darling
It's all right

(
) Oscar
Where the devil are you
Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom
My apologies, Mr
Roosevelt

He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man who can have anything he wants
Right now
he wants his pants
've been standing here for five minutes
Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs
3
Did you sleep well, sir
Don't remember
That's good, isn't it
Yes, sir
Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them, pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders
7                                                                   7 - Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid off a breakfast plate
He dismisses it and instead pours himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard
He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room
(
) could not be more delighted to have received your most charming letter
It has been far too long since we last corresponded
However, it is with great reluctance  must decline your kind speaking invitation
- , 34, is dictating a letter
Her enormous eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary intelligence and depth
Unfortunately,  would be of little assistance to the Junior Assistance League
Particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking
She is dictating to  , 27, deeply feminine with a head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature
She is Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend
She is also the  dancing with Franklin the night before
And what do you really want me to say
Thank you and if you ask again shall scream
4
They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner
Why don't you ask your husband for some pointers
He's a pretty gifted public speaker, don't you think
, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and unlimited soul
Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire -- part consiglieri and part priest
He is the mastermind behind what he believes will be the greatest political career of the twentieth century
He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor
cigarette dangles off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face
You should get out once in a while
Accepting that invitation would be good for Franklin's career
Mr
Howe, wouldn't you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside
In the street, Mrs
Roosevelt
If you like
Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters from the dining room
see it's not even eight a
m
and already the gloves are off
(kissing Eleanor on the cheek) Good morning, Babs
Hello, Miss Mercer Good morning, sir
Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work
(annoyed) You're late
Honestly, why do you enjoy keeping people waiting
5
Because they always seem more grateful to see me when  arrive
He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek
Have a lovely day, Babs
Should  expect you for dinner
have the Navy reception this evening
'll be home quite late
Unless you've changed your mind about coming
Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing furiously
Do you wish me to come
Well
whatever you'd like
(a beat) Thank you, no
Very well then
(tipping his hat) Good day, Miss Mercer
Lucy nods and Franklin exits
Then Louis tips his hat to the ladies and follows him out

Louis struggles to keep up while consulting a small appointment book
At ten you've got a meeting with representatives from Pittsburgh Steel
Their bid on the ship building contract has already been turned in and is on your desk for approval
6
What did  think of it
An - man steps off the curb, letting Franklin and Louis pass
You had some problems with it
better read it
Steel workers tend to vote democratic
Next
Lunch with Secretary Daniels
Must
He's your boss
Anything else
(a beat) What if she'd said yes
Who
Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who
" People know
It's time to stop
can handle my own affairs, Louis
Not this one
This is Washington, , not the Harvard Club
(off-put by Franklin's arrogance) How can you be so cavalier
You say that like it's a bad thing
Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows him inside a building

The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin quietly enters
His hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew
As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness
They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs
11                                                                11 - Franklin goes into his bedroom
Eleanor quietly comes up the stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her
'  - 12                                                                12 Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him
Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag
Tentatively she reaches for them
She brings the packet, tied with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose
She is shocked by their familiar scent
With trembling hands she unties the ribbon
Tears flood down her cheeks as she reads
Franklin opens his eyes
: - 13                                                                13 Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion
It is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River
are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet
-   - 14                                                                14 , 65, sits at the head of the table
She is one for whom the expression "Grande Dame" was coined
8
Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale
Louis, as always, is by his side
Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits across from them, calm and composed
have offered Franklin his freedom
And  have accepted
(to Eleanor) His freedom is not yours to offer
am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama
Lord save us from fools in love
Falling in love is out of the question
Why do you think men have mistresses
Duty
Duty to their families and their careers
Eleanor rises from the table
Where do you think you're going
It's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance
She begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot
Babs
Come back here
Both of you
- 15                                                                15 Franklin chases Eleanor
Midway up the stairs, she turns
don't know whether to hate you or thank you
9
For what
For forcing me to face my life honestly for the first time
didn't mean to hurt you, Babs
You never do
You live your life skimming the surface
never aware of the attachments beneath
(finding her anger) It must be a luxury
She goes up the stairs without looking back
16                                                                16 - Franklin slowly walks back into the room
Divorce will finish your career in politics
How do you intend to support yourself
My trust fund
Divorce Eleanor and there is no trust fund
Franklin turns away
He looks out the large picture window and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake
We've come so far, boss
State Assembly, Assistant Secretary of the Navy -- all pages right out of Cousin Teddy's play book
We're on the road to the White House
Don't do this
Franklin sees his son, , 10, playing separately from the rest of his siblings
Elliot looks up at his father as Franklin bares his best politician's smile at him
begins to fill his ears
It becomes clearer that it is the sound of a

The  goes wild over this unconventional entrance
hen he reaches the edge of the stage he  onto it
This final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy

For everyone
(breathless) humbly accept your nomination for Vice-President
The  roars back in reaction to his less-than-humble stance
They say the best way to get   rid of a man is to have him run for   Vice- President
(he holds for the laugh) You might well have asked my   cousin Teddy if that's how they got   rid of him
Franklin stands on the stage, the music rising, the crowd cheering
Slowly, the sound of the convention fades to something far more delicate

The hushed tones of polite conversation wafts through the air
Franklin sits with his cousin,  , 36, daughter of Teddy
Brilliant and acerbic, she would have had a career in politics had she been born a man
11
Of course you lost
Roosevelt on the democratic ticket
Our ancestors are turning in their graves
Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive he'd be a democrat -- and you know it
Rubbish
But  do know one thing: You're exactly like him
My father was born wanting only one thing: to be President
And what's wrong with that
They both share a laugh
Do you know what they're saying about you
Franklin's smile fades
No, but 'm sure you'll tell me
They say
stands for "featherduster
" That you're a lightweight
dilettante with no substance; no point of view
Is that what you think
You lead with your vanity
You talk when you should listen
Unless these are the qualities of a democrat
The democratic party is the party of the people
am a man of the people
Darling, you're a Roosevelt
What do you know about people
12
She leans in conspiratorially
Of course,  can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in
Miss Mercer,  believe
Alice, stop
Don't misunderstand me, Franklin
Being married to Eleanor  think you deserved some fun
But you made the right decision
Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life
What are you talking about
Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her
(stunned) She's married
Last week
small event, of course
When  last heard she was governess to his children
(with a smile) And then love bloomed
As a "man of the people,"  wouldn't be too hard on her, Franklin
We can't all have trust funds you know

We're not taking this defeat lying down, boss
We'll run you for Governor -- 13
(kidding) Really
Of which state
Louis shoots him a look
Very funny
No, this buys you time
It buys you experience
What about Al Smith
He's vulnerable
You're still a fresh face, boss
We'll use that to our advantage
They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the follows them
Boy Scouts, Louis
Hardly my political base
They've got parents
Besides they're photogenic
Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly underprivileged children
Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you
Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an artificial good cheer
Meanwhile, Louis, in full political mode, makes sure the Photographer gets everything
Over here
Franklin poses with two Scouts
The picture is taken
Okay, boys, lunch
Line up to wash
(to Franklin) Will you be joining us
Of course
14
Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water barrel and glances sideways at , 9, an immigrant child of the city streets
He wears his uniform proudly and smiles at Franklin
What's your name, son
Guiseppe
Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment between them
He waits patiently as the cameras click away
Guiseppe
Come sta, ragazzo
(puzzled) Okay,  guess
The  begin washing their hands together in the water barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly
As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin, not to be outdone, does so as well
It's all for the cameras

few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis, overdressed for summer in a three piece suit
An overflowing ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his feet
He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and the Boy Scouts
He's a natural
Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn
15
Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing up the lawn
Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses
He doubles over, trying to catch his breath
Vae victis
("Woe to the conquered
") aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground
Festina lente
("Not so fast
") One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and Elliot
Dinner is in one half-hour
Come in and change, children
Up
Up, chicks
You heard your mother
Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except Franklin
Go wash up
Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving
Hey, boss
Are you all right
Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the porch stairs
'm fine
(re: her knitting) Oh, that's pretty, Babs
He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands
must check on dinner
There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth
16
Very well
She goes into the house
Louis then hands Franklin letters
Tired
Of you
Never
Wearily, he sorts through the envelopes
Why don't you nap before dinner
Yes, dear
Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the screen door struggling for control
: - 23                                                                 23 Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a , who leans over him holding out his hand
Can you take my hand
Franklin tries, but can't
Almost his entire body is paralyzed
He can only breathe and blink
The Doctor glances at Eleanor, Louis and Sara indicating they should follow him out
- 24                                                                 24 As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, Elliot is there waiting
Seeing them coming, he dashes off into the yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor, Louis, Sara and the Doctor enter
He has Infantile Paralysis
Polio
Sara sinks into a chair
knew it
knew it
17
thought it only struck children
Not necessarily
How did he get it
Some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water
But that theory is speculative at best
It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout Camp
In all honesty you need to be looking forward, not back
What is the prognosis
The damage to his leg muscles is extensive
suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down
Dear God
beat) And the children
If they don't have any symptoms by now then they have been spared
Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud
Then we must count our blessings
You will need to prepare yourselves
There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude
'm afraid life as he knew it is over
Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying
Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes

She leans down and wraps her arms around him
- 26                                                                26 - - pink background covered in small white flowers with red centers and green leaves
There is a seam in the paper tiny white spot where glue has soaked through
- Franklin in bed
This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour
His lips are dry
glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand
He reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach
Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth
-  - 27                                                                27 Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation
Now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me
But what kind of life is that
've rented him an office downtown
He can still practice law
Why would you want to do that
Because he needs it
He can pursue a career, Mama
man as proud and vital as Franklin
you're inviting him to be hurt
() 19
And you, Mr
(cont'd) Howe, engaged in the fantasy of a political future for my son
is there nothing you won't do to keep your job
Sara leaves as Eleanor goes after her
Mama
That's not fair
- 28                                                               28 Franklin, still rocking his torso, has now gained some momentum, managing to have moved just a few inches
- 29                                                               29 Sara busies herself arranging flowers
What kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at
What kind of life is it to be hidden away
know you believe that what you are suggesting for Franklin is best
But  think you are making it harder for him
think  know what's best for Franklin
am his mother
And  am his wife
Sara stares at Eleanor in disbelief
Eleanor stares back -- unflinching
- 30                                                               30 Franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from the bed to the floor with a thud
Frustrated beyond words, Franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the floor letting out an anguished cry
In agony, from both the pain and the humiliation, he stares up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead
Then, closing his eyes, a  in his head starts to get louder and louder -- : 20

He awakens to the sound of the
Voices are calling him accompanied by smashing at the door
He opens his eyes and is disoriented
He tries to sit up -- momentarily forgetting that he can't

covered by  with barely an ounce of muscle
Finally the door  open
Two young crewman,  and enter
Mr
Roosevelt, we got a storm comin'
He lifts Franklin over his shoulder
Stanley grabs clothes and pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall
Eugene grabs a bucket and holds Franklin up to urinate
(while peeing) Leave me here
Let the ocean swallow me up
Burial at sea
Perfect for a navy man
Stripped to his underwear Franklin is laid across the bunk
Eugene kneels and puts on Franklin's socks and shoes
Then he and Stanley slide on his braces and pants
Their hands zipper, clasp, buckle and tie
Each hand works in synchronicity with the other
Clumsily they lift Franklin up, struggling under his weight
- 32                                                                32 Eugene and Stanley carry Franklin off in the driving rain
- 33                                                                33 Kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people, mostly fishermen, seeking refuge from the coming storm
Franklin, soaked-to-the-skin and wrapped in a blanket, is being pushed through the door by Eugene in a wheelchair
The restaurant collectively pauses to take them
21
Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant
He shrinks from the stares of the patrons
eating with her parents gets excited when she sees Franklin's braces and points
Franklin gives her a hard look and she is hurt
What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of braces like his
Franklin is wheeled up to his table and  and  sit down with him
Louis enters resembling a drowned rat
He rips off his hat and raincoat and puts down his suitcase
(genuinely surprised) Louis
never miss Florida in the rainy season
No letter
No wire
Why
Would you have answered it
What the hell are you doing here
Good to see you too
Nice whiskers
You look like Chester Arthur
Stanley, this is Mr
Howe
He gets sea-sick at the mere sight of a boat so he's probably happy that it's being Ldestroyed right now
Boys,  need to talk to Mr
Roosevelt alone
Find your own breakfast
Here's a five spot
Make it a feast
They look at the money and take their leave
You're always so generous with my money
22
You mean your mother's, don't you
The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee
Franklin pulls out a flask and pours some into his cup
He then lights a cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis
Without asking, Louis helps himself
So Mama financed this fool's errand, has she
Well, it's a waste of a trip
It was Eleanor's idea
Franklin's face is immobile
What can  get you
'd like some ham and eggs, sunny side up, please
(to Franklin) What's your fancy, boss
Nothing
fancy nothing
He'll have the same
The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away
Louis opens his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail
Franklin glances it, but doesn't open any
There are a few from your children
can still read
Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him, opening it
Your wife wants you to come home
(choosing his words) She's concerned
'm concerned
This life on a boat
where is it getting you
23
Getting me
For one thing, no one gets to see me and  don't get to see them
Don't say that
Everyone's waiting for you to come home
The kids
they're aching to see you
(reading) Really
Louis looks sadly at his friend
What's that
skimming the letter) From George Foster Peabody
He owns a resort in rural Georgia for investment purposes
Hot springs or something
He claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again
Oh, for Chrissake
(reading) The high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up
Although it is not a resort for infirm types  am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off- season
" (putting the letter aside) 'm only welcome in the "off- season
" Eugene and Stanley approach the table
Mr
Roosevelt, we got bad news
What
24
It's the boat
it got banged up real bad tied to the dock
How bad
don't think you can stay there anymore
ranklin absorbs this
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise, Mr
Roosevelt
don't know about you, but 'm homesick
And 'm sick of home
(to Louis) Where's the letter from Peabody
You can't be serious
He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it
Why not miracle waters
've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses
After all that, this sounds downright peaceful
can't quite picture you in the back woods of Georgia
Where do you picture me, Louis
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
President, Louis
can't visit the bathroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down
25
Give it a little time
There's a reason they say a man runs for office
(a beat) 'm going to Georgia
: - 34                                                               34 Franklin and Eleanor sit next to one another
Franklin is now shaved and cleaned up considerably
However, the tension between them is palpable
Eleanor knits furiously while talking
Franklin looks out the window at African-American   hard at work in the red clay hills of Georgia
James has been doing so much better now that Elliot has joined him at Groton
They've put their differences behind them and have become a real team
Franklin observes two  , African-American, running alongside the slow-moving train
Two peas in a pod
Last week they were both in the infirmary with the same cold
ranklin eyes a wagon pulled by a mule
The driver, a , takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun
Meanwhile, any suggestion  make to Anna for her future -- she dismisses me
am going to have to enlist your support in this, Franklin
She listens to you
She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the window, deep in thought -- not having heard a word she's said
26
-  - 35                                                              35 , 39, stands waiting by a car dressed in a white suit
Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few words whose poker face hides a true desperation
He holds a telegram from Franklin in his hand
As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the passengers making their exit
There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked and
Whites exit from the front of the train and Blacks from the rear
, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform, approaches Tom
Of indeterminate age and dubious intellect, his mail bag is almost as big as he is
Someone important
You might say so, Lionel
Who
Mr
Roosevelt
Teddy
(patiently) No, he's dead
Oh
The  approaches
Tom, your guest needs some assistance
We're gonna need some able-bodied men to move him
(to Lionel) Go over to the livery stable
and get the Collier boys
27
- 36                                                                36 Franklin exits the train slung in a fireman's carry over the shoulder of  , African-American, 29
His brother , 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at around 6' 4"
Tom approaches
Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment with good cheer
Hello
Hello
Mr
Loyless
Tom, Mr
Roosevelt
Then you'd better call me Franklin
Still in the fireman's carry, Franklin extends his hand for Tom to shake
Franklin
And this is the Misses
Call me Eleanor
Pleased to make your acquaintance
Roy then carries him over to Tom's car and gingerly places him inside
Pete follows
(to Tom) There's a trunk and a chair with the wheels, too
'll send a wagon right over
We got a wagon, sir
- 37                                                                37 Tom drives Franklin in front, Eleanor sits in the back
28
Pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road
In occasional clearings, Franklin spies barefoot children playing out in front of broken-down shacks
They stop their play to look at the car
(covering his discomfort) Beautiful country
How long have you been manager of the Inn
Not long
They  over a large pothole
They all fly up and land hard
Got any paved roads
No we don't
- 38                                                               38 Tom's car turns into a driveway
Franklin has a brochure for "The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap
He tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot
He looks back at the brochure
The picture is of a lavish Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you
" Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side
Paint is peeling everywhere
What once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds
The car pulls to a stop
You'll have a great deal of privacy
There are only a few guests right now as it's the off- season
'm hoping to make some improvements by next Spring -- Franklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of the car
29
(panicked) can't stay here
This place is a wreck
Franklin
Look on the bright side
Most of your time will be spent in the water
(a beat) It's true, we've fallen on some hard times
Hard times
This is a disaster
It should be condemned
Tom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he stays remarkably calm
Yes, we've seen better days
(a beat) But then  imagine so have you
Franklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just said
'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want
They lock eyes
Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he can't tell
(in a low voice) Fire
'm frightened of fire can't get out if 'm upstairs
We've got options
- 39                                                                39 Tom's car is now parked in front of a group of small cottages
Roy and Pete's horse drawn wagon is behind it
30
- 40                                                               40 Tom and Pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a tiny cottage
Franklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching
- 41                                                               41 Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust particles fill the air
As Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door, Franklin notices a broken window
(caustic) Well ventilated, at least
Roy enters with a suitcase
Where do you want this, Mr
Roosevelt
The bedroom, Roy, thank you
He looks after Roy as he exits
Tom, this young man appears quite competent
Would you ask him if he'd like to stay on as my valet
(politely) Why don't you ask him yourself
He tips his hat and goes outside
- 42                                                               42 Pete, alone, drives the wagon past the Inn and out onto the road
- 43                                                               43 Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned by the squalor
She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the other room
31
This is madness
(
) No doubt
Tell me again, Franklin, why are we here
Franklin is wheeled out by Roy, now changed into a bathing suit
For the waters
Are you coming
- 44                                                                44 Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading the way
Mrs
Roosevelt want to swim
Mrs
Roosevelt doesn't know how
Franklin takes in the surroundings
Deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape
45                                                                45 - An immense, -shaped pool rimmed in concrete
The bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth
, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair, comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her  out of the water
, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands guard by the edge of the water
Mr
Roosevelt, 'd like you to meet Aunt Sally
Aunt Sally
Good day, sir
have towels for you
32
Roy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible
Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting his feet dangle in the warm water
Twisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously
Now give it a minute
You'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant
The crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water
Franklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom
Crushed, all hope drains from his face
can't even stand
Well, not yet
- 46                                                                46 Roy sleeps on a couch on the front porch
Crickets hum
- 47                                                                47 Eleanor tosses and turns on a roll away bed
48                                                                48 - Franklin lies in bed staring up at the ceiling
-   - 49                                                                49 handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room
Franklin and Eleanor sit together
He is eating heartily, but Eleanor merely moves her food around
This is simply revolting
It's not very good, but it is mysterious
(holding out his plate) What in the world do you think they've poured over this chicken
Or is it possum
Eleanor sizes Franklin up
She knows this is a preamble
33
You want to stay
Yes
New York has the best doctors and hospitals in the country
need something new
This isn't about getting better is it
You don't want to come home
You don't want to live with us
refuse to be a burden to anyone
You're not a burden, you're my husband
e reaches out and takes her hand in his
want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me
(she pulls it away) All you've ever known is duty
To me and to a political career that unless  can walk no longer exists
You've been exemplary
Now 'm telling you you're free to go
(her voice rising) No
(a beat) don't want freedom
want a marriage
want a life with you
Franklin won't let himself believe it
can't imagine what you think that life is going to be
This takes the wind out of Eleanor
34
Oh Franklin
it's not up to me to imagine, it's up to you
Eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table
- 50                                                               50 Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon
Franklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away
Her suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road
Looking out -- straight ahead
Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight
51                                                               51 - Eleanor is pouring tea for Louis, who is seated
Thank you for stopping by, Mr
Howe
thought you might want to see a friendly face
(off the silence) So how's our boy doing
Well, he's enjoying the waters very much
He
(suddenly overwhelmed) think we've lost him
Her pent-up tears burst in a free-flow
Louis leads her to a nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief
Please excuse me, Mr
Howe
Don't you think it's time you called me Louis
Louis
35
Maybe we've been going about this all wrong
He's down there to be alone so let's give him what he wants
We change our focus
To what
Louis smiles, knowingly
To you
- 52                                                             52 The row of abandoned cottages look strangely pretty, aglow in the setting sun
53                                                             53 - Franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair
His cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass milk bottle
He pours one for Tom, then himself
To your mineral pool, or whatever you call it
Warm Springs
They clink their glasses
Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes back the bad taste
Too strong
Haven't been in a drinking mood lately
have
Actually, its the most god-awful martini 've ever tasted
Are you always this direct, Tom
36
Well,  never tasted a martini this bad before
Franklin takes another sip, checking
It tastes fine to him
(hurt) Everyone likes my martinis
So they say
- 54                                                              54 Franklin's bed is already empty
- 55                                                              55 Aunt Sally is seated, talking with Roy while Franklin lies on his back in the water, swimming
All his movement comes from his shoulders and arms
The morning sun streams down on him
Tom sits off to one side reading the newspaper
Tell me more about what that boy did, Aunt Sally
Well, first he'd always swim over to the side of the pool and hold himself there -- make sure he righted himself
Then
before he knew it
he'd be standing
If it was only that easy
Well, you make it hard
Get over to the side of that pool and grab it
humoring her) Yes, ma'am
Now you got to remember how you did it
Franklin holds the edge of the pool, closing his eyes
37
For a long moment there is silence
Almost without realizing it, Franklin lets go of the edge of the pool
When he opens his eyes -- he is standing -- all by himself in the water
(a nervous laugh) 'm standing
His laughter gets stronger
Tom, Aunt Sally and Roy look on
'm standing
The release is powerful as Franklin dissolves into tears
- 56                                                               56 Tom, who's been mixing cocktails, hands Franklin a drink and lifts his glass
To standing on your own two feet
They clink and drink
This water could be the cure -- the cure
In six months  could be up and walking
Lionel, the mailman, comes down the path carrying a flashlight, reading an open letter
Evening folks
Cocktail, Lionel
can't
'm working for the federal government
All the more reason
(shoving a drink at him) Sort of late for the mail, isn't it
38
Not for me it isn't
Got a whole packet of clippings for you, Mr
Roosevelt
From a Mr
Howe
New York Times, Journal-American
don't know what else
He hands an already opened letter to Franklin
Your mother wants to know when you're coming home
She says they got swimming pools in Hyde Park
She's mad as all hell
Reading other people's mail is not only impolite, it's illegal
Sheriff don't mind
He likes  read his mail
Saves him the time
Plus a lot of folks around here can't read, so it's more a public service, really
Astonishing
Thank you, Lionel
He hands Lionel a letter
(reading) "Miss Missy LeHand
" Who's she
If you must know, she's my social secretary
(to Tom) 'm having her come down
Lionel reaches into his bag
Almost forgot
your wife wrote the nicest letter
She's gonna make a speech at the League of Women Voters
Give me that
39
He hands the letter to Franklin who immediately begins reading
(to Tom) Says she's gonna keep the Roosevelt name alive
Least till he starts walkin' and all
Lionel takes the letter Franklin just handed him, opens it, flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way
(studying the letter) This is so unlike Eleanor
She's terrified of crowds
: 57                                                                 57 - Louis and Eleanor approach a set of double doors
We are facing imminent disaster
take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or faint
They enter the room
- 58                                                                 58 At a lectern, behind which a banner reads " ," the  sees them and waves them forward
Ah, here she is now
Ladies, Mrs
Franklin Roosevelt
small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but scant applause for Eleanor
Good afternoon
am so pleased to be invited here today
looking down at her cards) Too often
snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off
40
Too often
She stops
The pause is deadly
Louis looks ready to jump out a window
Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high
Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men
Slowly, she begins to find her voice
So that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside
without expression
his is a mistake
She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience
and for the first time speaks spontaneously
think this might be the reason am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today
The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room
'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant
That it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it
If our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them
To see the entire elephant
And for that
they need our help
The ladies applaud her, much to her relief
Louis beams
At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the Chairwoman are drinking tea
41
That was so moving, Mrs
Roosevelt
The Child Welfare Amendment could use someone with your passion
You must consider being our spokesperson
Eleanor looks to Louis who nods
Oh
It would be an honor
Wonderful
59                                                             59 - Franklin is attempting to walk in the water, working diligently
Tom watches him from a few paces back
Morning
walked five steps today
Congratulations
Listen, Franklin, got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you
'm hardly newsworthy these days
(a beat) How did he find out 'm here
Small town -- word gets out
It probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn
Franklin looks at Tom knowing full well he's arranged this
All right,  know the gentleman
'm doing him a favor
You know, used to be a journalist
Do you mean all this time 've been talking to a newspaper man
42
Not anymore
got in a bit of trouble in Atlanta
Seems some of the editorial pieces  wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group
So  needed to lay low for a while
(a beat) You mean the Klan
Good God, Tom
Thankfully, Mr
George Foster Peabody gave me this job
Well, that explains a few things
For the life of me,  couldn't figure out why someone like you was running this -- Rat-trap

He wears long pants even though it's blisteringly hot
, 28, sits across from Franklin -- a second string reporter in a three-piece suit
Now in 1920 when you were running for Vice-President

Roy unlaces his shoes and slips them off his feet
e is about to put them under the bed when Franklin motions for Roy to hand them to him
Still flat on his back, Franklin luxuriates in the rich leather cobbled by hand
He examines their smooth, immaculate soles

We hear the sound of an Underwood typewriter clacking away and Franklin's voice, dictating

Therefore, a formal questionnaire should be composed in order so we may hear from all recent delegates as to how we can do better in '28 to present a more united front

Alright
Thank you, Missy, and c

that to Louis
Missy rises with a stack of envelopes and heads out
Roy enters with a plate of pancakes in front of Franklin
Hungry, Mr
Roosevelt
Not really
Who do you write to every morning
Different people  knew in politics
Just in case they ever want me back
So you'll be ready when you get your legs workin' again
Exactly
45
There is a knock at the screen door
An earnest young man, , 18, is peering in
He has a newspaper
Excuse me, are you Mr
Roosevelt
Yes
Who are you
Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters
My name is Benjamin Prendergast
've come to see if you could speak at this year's graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse
You being so famous and all
Prendergast unfolds the newspaper
There is a picture of Franklin under the heading " " 'll be damned
Would you be available
(looking up) When
Next spring
Next week
We only have a four month school year
How is that possible
Tax dollars only cover that much
Are you graduating
No, sir

But Franklin doesn't see

few  and their  sit with large groups of filthy children
They look at Franklin askance
Prendergast stands proudly beside three --
Tom stands in the back observing
Franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the gathering
He notices a  staring at his legs
Now that we're all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today, Mr
Franklin Roosevelt
Good afternoon
fly begins buzzing around his head
He laughs derisively, almost to himself
At Groton, where  graduated from high school, our beloved Headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life
He looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him
chose to attend Harvard for my undergraduate work and then Columbia for my law degree
e takes in their uncomprehending expressions
followed my Headmaster's advice and sought a career in public life
But circumstances beyond my control have made that
very difficult
47
He stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control
've given many speeches in my life
don't know why 'm having such a hard time making this one
Horrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice
They just see Franklin
5                                                                65 '  - My God did you see how they were looking at me
They welcomed your company, Franklin
Don't patronize me
Tom is losing his patience
Don't patronize them
These people go to bed night after night with half-empty stomachs -- your legs are the least of their worries
They continue to drive in silence
66                                                                66 - It's a cold day and Franklin is swimming in the pool
Roy is wearing a sweater
Aunt Sally is there, too, wearing a patched up coat with a scarf around her neck
Tom is nearby raking leaves
Mr
Roosevelt, aren't you cold
Mr
Roosevelt, you're gonna catch the chill if you don't get out of the water
Franklin ignores them and dips under the water as Tom comes over
48
You got to tell him, Mr
Loyless
He won't listen to us
Franklin comes up from under
Franklin, we need to talk
Normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays
Franklin looks at Tom, then at Roy and Aunt Sally, acknowledging
The sound of a   is heard
: 67                                                                67 ,  -   - The  is coming from a   as it zooms around a track set up on a table in the Roosevelt living room

They are finishing a rousing rendition of "Angels We Have Heard on High" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated
, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, , 19, decorates from the lowest rung
Eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna
Grandmother Delano brought this from China
Franklin, working from his wheelchair is filling out the lower branches of the tree, his lap filled with ornaments
Have you ever been to China, Father
No, Elliot
Just your grandmama
adored China
It smelled of ginger cookies
49
,
et's go in the backyard and dig our way there
That sounds like an adventure
Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her eye
She quickly looks away
From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and places it on his father's knee
Put it on top
Silence descends over the room
No one dares to breathe
Give it to James
He's the tallest
No
John, give it to him
Papa always does it
can do it
Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top
It almost catches, but it falls to the floor
Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James climbs back up and puts the star on top
Sara sensing the awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly cheery rendition of "Hark
The Herald Angels Sing
" - 68                                                                68 Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of parallel bars
Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to drag his legs behind him
It was an extraordinary turnout this afternoon
Louis says there were over two hundred people in the audience
50
That's marvelous, Babs
Eleanor is flushed with pride
Franklin, catching her look, slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him
've got you, sir
Franklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned to one of pure heartbreak
You wonder why  want to go back to Georgia
it's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did
You truly believe the waters
(with difficulty) that they are helping
Don't talk to me as if  were a child
Choosing your words so carefully
How am  supposed to talk to you
Like  was
Talk to me like  was
Roy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking away from Eleanor
don't know how anymore
: - 69                                                                  69 Franklin is being lifted out of Pete's wagon by Roy and placed into his wheelchair
He sees Tom approaching
You're a sight for sore eyes
We missed you at the station
51
The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he takes in Tom's changed appearance
His face is sallow and his trademark white suit is hanging on him
(concerned) Tom, are you all right
It's just an ulcer
can't eat anything  like anymore
Roy carries the luggage into the cottage
(covering) My father had ulcers
Damn irritating
Yes, they are
silence hangs in the air
Ready to swim
- 70                                                                70 Franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by Roy
Tom follows
We've got some new guests
Some paying, some non-paying
As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees -- -- all in different groupings -- some on crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the pool
What in blazes
The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday papers all over the country
Franklin looks up at Tom, dumbfounded
They're here to see you
52
This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer
, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge cigar between his fat lips
is eyebrows have a life of their own
He wheels himself to Franklin
Mr
Roosevelt, Pat Doyle
've come all the way from Minneapolis to shake your hand, sir
He reaches out his hand to Franklin
Stuck in this chair  do nothing but read
Newspapers, mostly
Usually 'm just looking for something -- anything -- that'll tell me there's even the slightest chance 'll walk again
Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of his hand
really don't know what to say
Well, you're here
And we're here
Together
we'll think of something
Franklin looks to Tom and gestures for him to come closer
(whispering) Get me out of here
-  - 71                                                                71 Franklin is pushing the chair himself along the dirt path, his anger propelling him away from Tom
want no part of this
come here for privacy
This isn't your personal spa
have a business to run
53
Exactly
You have a business to run, not
No one's asking anything of you
Of course they are
Do you know what it took for most of them to get here
It's not my concern
want to be left alone
My God, you're afraid of these people
Afraid
What you're talking about
You look at them with the same repulsion and pity as everyone else
Don't be ridiculous
resent your trying to -- You don't want to be around them because then that would make you one of them, wouldn't it
Franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage, getting stuck on the dirt path along the way
God damn it
Tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by Franklin
Out of my way
Get out of my goddamn way
Franklin wheels himself off
54
- 72                                                             72 Franklin, in his wheelchair, smokes a cigarette
His bags are next to him, as is Roy
train's whistle  and pulls in
Right on time
Franklin sees someone else on the platform
He squints in the distance
It's Tom
He walks closer towards Franklin and Roy
Good evening
Franklin nods in Tom's general direction
Tom has a telegram in his hand which peaks Franklin's curiosity
Expecting someone
Yes
The train comes to a complete stop
steps out onto the platform
single   gets off the train
(to the Conductor) 'm looking for a young gentleman by the name of Botts
Fred Botts
Don't know anything about that
expect he would be in a wheelchair
You mean the cripple
He's in the baggage car
- 73                                                             73 Tom, Franklin and Roy are in front of the large door as the Conductor pushes it back slowly

- 74                                                                74 Amongst crates and luggage is  , a young man of fifteen lying on the floor, unconscious
wheelchair is next to him, turned over on its side
Mother of God
Tom leaps up and into the car as does Roy leaving Franklin below
Tom takes his wrist
His pulse is slow
75                                                                75 - Roy lays Fred on a bench
Franklin wheels himself over
Son, can you hear me
Tom brings a cup of water
Franklin puts it to Fred's lips
Fred
Fred opens his eyes
They are large and brown with a sweetness to them
His face comes alive when he recognizes Franklin
Mr
Roosevelt
It's going to be all right, son
e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket
The headline reads: "
" The conductor wouldn't let me ride in the passenger car with my chair
Franklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred
When did you last eat
Knoxville
56
Knoxville had to be three days ago
Roy, take him to the car
As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the engine car
Tom follows as they approach the
Who in their right mind let's a child ride in the baggage car
You could have killed that boy
He had polio
Probably still contagious
The Conductor walks away, dismissively
Franklin pushes his chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks
Don't dismiss me because  sit in this chair
Get away from me
Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he knocks the Conductor over
You ignorant son of a bitch
If could, 'd get up right now and lock you in that box car
See how you like it
Franklin
The Conductor struggles to get up
Get this lunatic off me
Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now lying across the back seat
The sight of Fred drains all anger from Franklin's face
Where's the nearest hospital
57
Atlanta
What about a doctor
Closer, but not by much
The train whistle
Train's ready
Franklin looks at Fred, then at Roy and Tom
(quietly) Let's go home
- 76                                                               76 Fred lays in Franklin's bed while Franklin sits by the bedside
Roy lays a cold compress on Fred's forehead
ranklin is using his watch to take Fred's pulse
Roy pulls back the sheet to give Fred air revealing his withered legs
Alabaster skin stretched over bones
Franklin looks away
- 77                                                               77 Franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of him
Tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably
How many can pay
Fewer than half
Franklin opens the check book and begins writing
want these people in the cottages, not in the inn
It's safer
Well, it's the way it has to be
58
What do you mean
've already had some complaints
(awkwardly) This is the start of the season, Franklin
've got regulars who have come for years
Healthy folks over all
They're threatening to check out, afraid they might catch polio
Such ignorance
Don't they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious
'm going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours
'll put time aside for you late in the day
and it won't be possible for you to eat in the dining room either
But  promise 'll find someplace suitable
They don't want us to eat in their presence
Of course for you  can make other accommodations
(a beat) That won't be necessary
Franklin goes back to writing out the check
Tom stands waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly interminable
Their mutual discomfort is obvious
Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom
Thank you
We still need a doctor here
For Fred
59
(pointedly) For everyone
- 78                                                          78 Franklin is in his wheelchair, writing
(
) "Dear Babs, Things are very different upon my return
" 9                                                          79 - Eleanor sits in a chair reading Franklin's letter

) am taking on responsibilities which none of my schooling in the spheres of higher learning or politics could have prepared me for

But  have never seen this, a suffering so insidious, so silent, that it rattles my soul

When can  swim
Soon
When you're a little stronger
When 'm asleep, in my dreams, can still walk
Me too
(a beat) How long has it been
since you walked
Nine years
'd just learned to ride a bike
After  got sick my mom was sure that the bike had caused it
60
Did she sell it
No
She took it out back and shot it
Franklin howls with laughter, joined by Fred
- 81                                                                81 Franklin is in the pool with the new guests
They are all nervously waiting to test the water
From the looks on their faces it's clear they only want to take their cues from Franklin

And who is this delightful child

All right Daisy, try and kick your legs
Daisy wiggles back and forth in her 's arms giving it her very best effort
Excellent, Daisy
, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair
Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York
Roy, sir
How you doin'
Jake reaches out his hand to shake
Roy is unsure what to do
'mon --  won't bite
61
(shaking his hand) Mighty fine, sir
Mighty fine
Hey, would you mind pulling me outta this trap, Roy
wanna get airborne
Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms like a child
Do me one more favor
Throw me in
Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he  through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before down hard in the water
e bobs up to the surface
There is applause
Now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me
Some laugh, some are confused
This is new territory for everyone
My hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water 'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage
He swims to the edge of the pool
So everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can
hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them
Go ahead now, do your best
Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface
Undeterred, Franklin leads them on, spiritedly
In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching everything

Roy carries  in and places her in the chair next to Franklin
Do you have a reservation
She begins to giggle
It's infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the situation
Whether in here or our there, guarantee you the food will taste the same
terrible
Shouldn't we pray first
By all means
Would you do us the honor
Franklin bows his head for grace
Bless the food on our table
Keep us healthy, strong and able
Amen
Amen

Fred is sitting nearby eating a piece of pie
Helena approaches
Roy pulls off a triple jump
64
Damn
King me
Franklin reluctantly tops Roy's checker
You're losing, Doc
Doc
'm sorry, you're Franklin Roosevelt, aren't you
Depends
(suspiciously) Are you a lawyer
No
Then Roosevelt it is
Wait
He jumps one of Roy's checkers
'm Helena Mahoney
'm a physical therapist
(off their blank looks) You have no idea who  am, do you
Should
wrote you a letter right after saw the article in the paper
Didn't you read it
It got read,  assure you
But probably not by me
Helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it
(to Roy) He's open right there
65
He sure is
Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves
Thank you, ma'am
Helena sits at the table with them
've been studying the effects of moist heat on polio patients and think with repeated exercise in warm water
It can help them regain lost strength
Yes
Incredibly 've come to the same conclusion myself
(a half-smile) Well, you're the doctor

No ramps, no running water, no doctors
from the article in the newspaper  assumed this was a rehabilitation center
Don't believe everything you read
feel like  was brought here under false pretenses
Join the club

Helena's examination is in progress
She is completely absorbed -- all business -- pouring over his muscles inch by inch
She kneads, bends and stretches them with a laser-like focus, finally picking up Franklin's leg and rotating it out and around
Push against my hand
Franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so
Give me the good news first
Your gluteus maximus is better than hoped
It will serve you well
Must be all that sitting
'm serious
Your right leg has some movement along the thigh
That's good because we can use it to help extend your hip, flex your knee and rotate your tibia
'm supposed to walk on one side
The water may help build some strength 'm not able to see yet
But to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day
Not the limited hours you have now

There's a need for a place like this, Tom
() 67
Are you aware (cont'd) that in the last epidemic over 16,000 people got polio in the New York area alone
Sounds like you've been reading up
wish there was more to read
Damn few things being written about any of this
To think of someone like Fred
locked away
his mind and heart so vibrant
It's a waste
An awful waste
Franklin takes a beat -- the weight of this sinking in
What's the acreage here
Roughly twelve hundred or so
Why
want to buy it
think it would make one hell of an investment
Investment
Twelve hundred acres
Enough for two resorts, don't you think
It would take money
There's a lot of land, rebuilding the inn, adding ramps and so many people can't pay

He picks Eloise up effortlessly, then sets her back down
Very good
Watch her braces
Woodhall kneels before Eloise like Prince Charming, carefully straightening out her legs
You're light as a
He notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists
Eloise, sensing his eyes, self-consciously pulls down her sleeves
He stares at her questioningly

Tom and Franklin come out
Franklin gives a questioning look to Helena, pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared
69
Good news
raided the pool hall
call them my Push Boys
Welcome Push Boys
Good day, Eloise
Hello, Mr
Roosevelt
Want to tell them your good news
Franklin is smiling like the cat that ate the canary
It's hardly a done deal, but for better or worse, you may be looking at the new owner of this God- forsaken place
- 95                                                             95 free wheeling game of poker
Heavy with cigarette and cigar smoke, Franklin, Tom, Fred, Jake and Pat are playing
Polio's always going to be a losing financial proposition, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy the place
am buying it
Make no mistake about that
Good for you, Doc
If you don't mind my asking, how will people pay for the services you are going to offer here
Most people with polio have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is
(gently) The boy makes a good point, Franklin
Not everything in this world has to be about profits
70
'll see your twenty-five and raise you twenty-five
'mon will ya
The night's still young
It's twenty-five cents not twenty- five dollars
Don't mind him, Tom
He's a cheap bastard
Fred and Pat fold immediately as does Franklin
Too rich for my blood
(to Tom) Fine
Here's your twenty-five
You better have something
They eyeball each other
Gunfight at the
Corral
Take it
was bluffing
Gleefully, Jake slaps his hands together and rakes in the pot

Very well

Tom's car is parked in front of the Inn, pulled up very close to the main entrance
The trunk is open
71
Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp
He deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline
He goes back into the house for one last bag
When he comes out, he's surprised by what he sees -- (
) Where do you think you're going
Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair
They are both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning chill
Tom is caught
This is everything he wanted to avoid
Going to Asheville to see my parents
From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear he is not coming back
can't do this without you
we're only just beginning
You
(You're beginning, not me
a beat) 've got cancer, Franklin
It's spread everywhere
Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown
'll take you to the best doctors
We'll go to Atlanta right now -- 've seen the best doctors
When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time
Now  just want to die in the bed  was born
Franklin is struggling with this
You're going to do great things
This place has an identity now -- a purpose
It has you
72
Any guard Franklin had is gone
He reaches out and takes Tom by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly
Take care of yourself, Roy
God be with you, Mr
Loyless
Tom takes one last look at Franklin
You never pitied me
Thank you for that
On the contrary,  envy you
will miss you all the days of my life
Tom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile
Good luck, Franklin
With a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and turns onto the main road
Franklin watches the car until it is out of sight

He wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that
leper colony
Franklin has invited Louis and me to see the work he's been doing
(derisively) Work
Playing in a pool all day long
Squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers consider this your fault, Eleanor
beg your pardon, Mama
73
You have indulged him and this is the result
(challenging her) Indulged him
have indulged him
Sara looks away
He's a grown man who makes his own decisions
But he does not need to buy it
If it's of any comfort to you, agree
'm against it as well
It will consume too much of his time and energy
Then it is settled
We tell him no
No, it is not settled
We must hear him out
Louis and  must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further
(a beat) nd tell him no
They all look at each other for a moment
For once they agree
Perhaps  have underestimated you
Perhaps you have
But that has been my fault, not yours

74
Excellent, Fred
Keep going
They are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise, Woodhall, Pat and Jake
The  of a car horn gets their immediate attention
Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother Pete drives up in Tom's car
He parks it and steps out
Morning, Mr
Roosevelt
Peter, what are you doing with Tom's car
was as sorry as anyone to hear about Mr
Loyless's passing
Wished he coulda' lived to see this
What are you talking about
Mr
Loyless had me come up and fetch this right after he brung it to Asheville
"Pete, he said, "Take this home and fix it up for Mr
Roosevelt
" Pete
can't drive a car
You can now
Roy opens the passenger door and lifts Franklin into the driver's seat
Get on in and 'll teach ya'
He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that have been attached to both pedals
They thread through holes in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs
It's a hand-controlled automobile
That one there is your brake
75
Got it
And this here's the gas
Hot damn
You got hand controls
That is a thing of beauty
Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs
Now you got to push it real smooth or it goes all herky-jerky
Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up
Wait, Mr
Roosevelt, you're not ready to drive yet
Oh, yes  am
Franklin hits the gas as the car begins  and the whole way down the driveway
Pete is yelling out instructions but Franklin ignores him
They all watch as he pulls away
As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out
Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin

No one is pushing him
He's free
The car covers miles of farmland, passing pine forests, peach orchards and cotton fields
: - 100                                                               100 spent and anxious Eleanor, with Louis in tow, stands on the station platform, suitcase in hand
76
It's a far cry from Grand Central Station
They are both silent for a moment
The wire said someone would be here to pick us up
The sounds of tires screeching and a car horn cause them to turn around
It is Franklin, sitting in the driver's seat of his car
Your chariot awaits, Madame
Louis promptly drops the luggage
Then he and Eleanor walk over to the car, taking in the hand-controls
When did you learn to drive this thing
Tuesday
101                                                               101 - Franklin drives wild and fast
Louis hat flies right off his head
Eleanor just holds on
- 102                                                               102 Franklin, Eleanor and Louis pull up to the Inn
Though the brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed, it's still a wreck
Franklin is too proud to concede Louis and Eleanor's disappointment
Can't wait to give you the tour
- 103                                                               103 Franklin wheels himself along the circular driveway, pointing things out, almost manic in his energy
small schoolhouse will go there
We need it badly as many of the children are barred from the local schools due to their infirmities
77
He points to a dilapidated gardener's shed
We also require a blacksmith's shop so we can craft braces here on the premises
've found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes
His work is outstanding
Of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital
That's going to put my fund raising abilities to the test
Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and Louis follow
- 104                                                               104 Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture Eleanor and Louis exchange glances
What exactly are you proposing, Franklin
That this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world
My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land
There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while  seek out investors
Franklin, you're risking everything you have
And there are other costs to consider
Mama will see that the children are provided for
'm not speaking of money
78
have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there
Franklin,  need for you to be practical and realistic
(furious) Practical
am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition
am trying to be practical
Now either you're with me or against me
In or out
don't care for ultimatums disguised as debate
Eleanor starts to leave
Where are you going
Eleanor
Get back here
will see you gentlemen tonight
She leaves
You can't talk to her like that
Oh really
Are you an expert on this now
How should  speak to my wife, Louis
With the respect she deserves
(a beat) Look,  don't deny the work you're doing here could be important -- Could be
79
The issue is whether you want to run a rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again
When  can walk, 'll run
- 105                                                            105 Eleanor approaches the pool
It is as quiet as a church
She is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the water
On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their bathing suit
Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in bathing attire conducting therapy
In hushed tones the Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the work being done
Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated
- 106                                                            106 The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces, legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's legs
some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs
Jake and a new physical therapist,  , are particularly cozy
(
) This is a very special night we're celebrating
At last we are together eating in this dining room
The hands come up and out from under the table, applauding
He is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie
Now please join me in welcoming Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival along with her father, Samuel, all the way from Oakland, California
80
- Eight years old with black hair
Her legs are in braces and she grips her father's hand tightly
Let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able-bodied guests, Mr
Louis Howe and my better half, Mrs
Franklin Roosevelt
Waving politely from their seats
Now for the musical portion of our program
Wait a minute
can't let this opportunity pass without saying out loud what a lot of us feel in our hearts right now
(a beat) You're a man among men, Franklin
' And women
And children
(laughing) It's a real democracy at Warm Springs -- everybody gets heard
(to Franklin) You listening
Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words
All right then, if  may do the honors of presenting to you the lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of Cottage
Eloise wheels herself out
In a sweet, but untrained voice, she begins the introduction to her song: 81
(singing) "Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me
Aou'd be the idol of France with me
nd yet you stand there And shake your foolish head dramatically, hile  sit here so ecstatically
You just look and say emphatically: Not this season
There's a reason
" Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's coming
Various  step out from the kitchen to watch
Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs
& (singing) " won't dance
Don't ask me
won't dance
Don't ask me; won't dance, monsieur, with you
" Simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs, has the audience cheering
& "My heart won't let my feet do things they should do
" "You know what
You're lovely
" "And so what
'm lovely
" "But oh
What you do to me
'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore; feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
" This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor and Louis
They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight of Eloise and her Chorus
The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd
82
Before we say good night, understand our Royal-Taskmaster- in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists on having the last word
Helena rises from her seat
don't think words describe adequately what Daisy and  would like to show all of you
(calling out) Are you ready, Daisy
Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the room where Helena meets them
Helena bends down and removes Daisy's braces
The room is hushed
Daisy then begins to  tentatively towards her mother
Overwhelmed by what is taking place
He looks around and takes in the sight of so many different faces
Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look away
the sight of it almost too painful
a reminder of their own private battles
Only a step or two away from her mother she  the short distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms
go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with pride
She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with his own -- genuine and beatific
-  - 107                                                               107 Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed
Eleanor enters holding a lit candle
Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor gently reaches out and touches him on the arm
Let me
83
Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits
Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau
fter a beat, Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants
He then lies back on the bed
What is your most pressing concern
Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so as not to catch on the braces
Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the back of a chair
Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time
Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress
Make us legitimate
She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of intricate buckles
Eleanor slides the braces off his legs
His legs, though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly
He is still wearing his shoes
And that costs more money
Yes
Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces
But the real problem is no one is interested
The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta this weekend and  offered to speak
(his anger surfacing) They turned me down flat
Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs
84
few weeks ago, the conditions at a garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention
The owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection
She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated position
They are now face to face
It took awhile, but we finally got in
We
He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become
He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top
Eleanor sits in a chair across from him
showed up with someone from the Labor Board and we refused to leave until they let us in
What are you suggesting
At the risk of my good standing with the Junior Assistance League, suggest we crash the party
She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand through his hair Good night, Franklin
She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle-lit room
Good night, Babs
She blows the candle out and closes the door

Franklin looks intimidated -- there are two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance
- 109                                                            109 Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung over his shoulder
Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up the stairs
- 110                                                            110 The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large projections on a screen of spinal discs while a , in a dull litany, intones a prepared speech
clinical situation where the radicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is referred to as a radiculopathy
Double doors fly open with a  as all heads turn to see Franklin and Eleanor
So sorry we're late
Good afternoon
Eleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle
(introducing herself) Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the late President Theodore Roosevelt and this is my husband, Franklin, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy
(sotto to Eleanor) Are you sure this worked on 27th Street
(under her breath) It seemed to at the time
86
They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag reads, "Dr
Bissell
" Thank you, Dr
Bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today
It was so generous of you
Dr
Bissell smiles limply, saving face
The audience vaguely applauds
Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage
My husband, as many of you may have read, is a victim of polio
However, victim is only a definition, not a state of mind
Franklin
He looks at her completely amazed
Eleanor gives him an encouraging nod to take over
We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio
've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold
But there's a place, gentlemen
a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees
That place, gentlemen, is called Warm Springs
- One  in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair, listening with great interest
Patients can stay in these waters for up to an hour
This is essential in allowing them the time to work on strengthening their muscles
We have come to the shared conclusion that research for the cause and the cure for infantile paralysis is paramount
() 87
However, until (cont'd) that day arrives more emphasis has be placed on rehabilitation
We personally invite you to Warm Springs to come and take a look
Thank you
These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style, both warm and immediate
She has disarmed them with her lack of pretension
and Their two separate journeys intersecting -- lightning in a bottle
- 111                                                            111 There is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an autograph with Franklin and Eleanor
, bespectacled, speaks with them
saw you speak at the Legion Hall in Cleveland last Spring
For the League of Women Voters
You created quite a stir
Not sure you'll be asked back
Franklin is ready to intervene but Eleanor puts her hand on his shoulder stopping him
(all smiles) Well,  believe you must say what you feel in your heart -- what you feel is right, for you'll be criticized anyway
Damned if you do -- damned if you don't
, military in bearing -- the doctor who listened so intensely -- steps up in line and shakes hands with Eleanor and then Franklin
Dr
Peter Hebert
've been doing my own studies in this area
() 88
(cont'd) If it is possible 'd like to come and make an evaluation for the Journal of Orthopedic Medicine
Franklin looks to Eleanor, elated
The sooner the better
'  - 112                                                               112 Roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back seat
Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction
She looks back at him shyly and smiles in return
But her expression changes when she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen for a long time
What is it
(a beat) Who are you
Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close
He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers
don't know how to drive
'll teach you
They operate the car together -- their connection complete
- 113                                                               113 Franklin and Eleanor are sitting in the front seat of the car
Louis is already up on the train platform
'll break the news to Mama
Franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty children
think it's going to be fun
Eleanor bursts out laughing, Franklin joins in
89
Babs
words fail me
You
Franklin Roosevelt
She leans in and kisses Franklin on the mouth
do so love you
She slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and boards the train while Franklin watches her
Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation approach Franklin
Mr
Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit
' Fine day, isn't it
It is
How's the Boll Weevil situation
' expect the Boll Weevil is always gonna be a situation, Mr
Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'
Franklin's energy and vitality are infectious
The politician within him is being reborn

He too is looking very pleased
Eleanor takes notice
Why do  get the feeling we're not smiling about the same thing
The train begins pulling out
They both look out at Franklin
Locals are coming up to his car surrounding him -- he is a magnet
He's ready

Also seated are two politicos,   and You can't kiss babies from a wheelchair
It'll scare their mothers half to death
Al Smith's got a lock on the presidential nomination
Correct me if 'm wrong, but don't you think even after all these years that old Al's still a little rough around the edges
They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement
Franklin can help soften his image
How
Let him put Smith's name in nomination
Teller and Hastings are none to sure
Well, he is a helluva speech maker
Yeah, but is your man up to it
It's in the bag, guys
Count on it
Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like they're buying it
Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor
91
Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the Misses

Roy stands by his side
Hello, Souders
How are you
Couldn't be better
was wondering if you'd found a buyer for my naval prints

Well, they're in marvelous condition
All right, Souders
Oh one more thing
have some beautiful pieces of my Grandfather's -- 'ang Dynasty
Really
An auction in the Fall
That sounds promising
'll be in touch
Franklin hangs up and sits deep in thought
He rubs his perspiring forehead with the back of his hand
He looks down at his hand and sees that it is shaking

Nearby, a group of children practice on parallel bars with Helena
What am  going to tell these people if  have to close things down
That you did the best you could
Franklin gives Roy a look of gratitude, then notices Lionel approaching with his mail bag
Lionel hands Franklin a fistful of open envelopes
Any good news
Creditors are gettin' cranky
The operative word was good
Oh, yah, almost forgot
The doctor that came and studied ya'll sent his report
93
Lionel offers up the envelope, but then pulls it back before handing it over
Save me the stamps
Franklin nods then grabs it from Lionel
He rips it open and begins devouring the report

therefore, in conclusion, my research has shown that the overwhelming majority of patients here have shown some improvement
Enough for me to recommend warm water therapy as the standard post polio treatment to the Orthopedics Society of America

It's not as bad as you think
Franklin slams the door behind her and wheels over to the table
He throws back a drink -- clearly not his first
Read it
Out loud

"Of the twenty three patients examined only one, a forty-four year old male, showed little visible signs of improvement
" This is one doctor's opinion, Franklin

His lower extremities present a most depressing picture

Fred and Helena are silent for a moment

Good afternoon, Mr
Howe
Hello, Roy
Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom
can't believe you've made me come all the way back to this hell hole
've done no such thing

'm here to take you to Houston
You started your speech yet

Shaking his head, he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself
You know what this is, don't you
It's a golden opportunity springboard for you to run for Governor
ranklin is silent
Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in Franklin's empty wheelchair
Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls
No
Well,  never heard of him either
But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch
Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another
Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice
He was a war hero
(with emphasis) Twice

Very good to see you, Mrs
Roosevelt
She approaches a surprised Franklin
Leaning in, she runs a hand across his stubbly beard
He looks up at her
You're a mess
The report
'll never
She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry
His sobs grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him
It unleashes an avalanche of grief
Oh my darling
'm useless, Eleanor
feel so useless
That's not true
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
Finally, his sobs subside
99
You have done a brilliant thing here -- a magnificent thing
Eleanor picks up the doctor's report and puts it in the fire
Let's get you in the water
- 128                                                               128 Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor
When they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming
Hi, Pop
(squinting) Who's that
is now 17 years old
He has his mother's enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma
Elliot
Come on
You getting in
Louis and Helena approach the pool
sense a conspiracy
You ain't seen nothin' yet
ranklin smiles, warily
- 129                                                               129 Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as Franklin and Eleanor look up at him
Franklin is standing on crutches
Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin with a single cane
Franklin, let go of your crutches
You're not going to need them
100
What
We're going to make your arms function as your legs
How is that possible
Elliot, go to your father and stand on his left side
Think this may work, Pop
Eleanor, take the crutch
Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing it in Franklin's hand with a cane
Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks Franklin's left arm around his
Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand
(to Franklin) Now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward
He does so
Good
Now with the muscles in your left shoulder, pull your right leg
One small bump and 'll land right on my keister
That's what Elliot is for
He's going to hold you up
Hitch your leg
Come on
Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk
It requires immense strength and effort on both their parts
101
(ever the taskmaster) Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up straight
Pull against him
He needs you
After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin
can't
'm strong, pop
You can't hurt me
You can do this, Franklin
Keep going
They start the walk again
It's awkward
difficult
but it's working
(under his breath) 'll be damned
Franklin stops, exhausted
Franklin, are you all right
'm fine
'm just
Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him, concerned
This isn't a replacement for the real work we're doing to get you on your feet again, understand
No one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report
know,  know
know it's not practical -- 102
No, it's not
(a beat) It's political
Franklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that this could be it
- 30                                                               130 Franklin and Elliot are walking
Helena is close behind, coaching
Use Elliot, not the cane
Switch your weight to Elliot
good
Keep your head up
Off to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are having an informal picnic, observing Franklin
Why is he working so hard to hide it
He doesn't have a choice
Oh,  disagree
How can you disagree
"There but for the grace of God goes us," that's what they're saying
As if our bodies is who we are, but it's not
It's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that
wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody
He can't do that Eloise, it's politics
It's not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he don't hide what he knows
And what he knows is what it's like to be one of us
ranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting
103
Good afternoon, everyone
Off-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with him
Eleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is there first
Take a moment to catch your breath
Damn
You okay son
'm fine, Pop
You fell down
Yes,  did, Daisy
Twelfth time today
Must be a new record
Daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their concern
Franklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his feet
131                                                               131 - Eleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin, sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech
(reading aloud) And so America must find
reconsidering) No, America needs a pathfinder
Louis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly
That's good
To emblaze the trail along a high road that will avoid
avoid the bottomless morass
Discouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages
104
What is it
What's wrong
What if  fall
trying to get to the podium
If you fall, you show them how to get up
No, if  fall in front of thousands of people  lose everything but their pity
(a beat) They'll be writing my obituary before  get up off the floor
Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be there
All the arrangements have been made, boss
It'll be fine
Who are we fooling
This will never work
They'll never let me back into politics
They'll never see past my legs
My darling, they'll never see past your legs unless you do
132                                                               132 - Franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided by Roy
Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in back
Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees straight ahead
It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway in chairs and on crutches
All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists, Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel
Don't worry, Doc -- we're not coming with you
105
Oh, you'll be with me
No question of that
(a beat) am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community
(his voice growing stronger) community based not on birthright or privilege, but on compassion and courage
The true power of these waters is that they brought us all together
Our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure
Our ability to survive
despite the odds
ranklin looks out at the sea of faces
What we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together -- like a family -- and do what we do best
(his voice breaking) Lift each other up
Franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse
Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her
Miss Mahoney  need to speak with you, please
Sure, Doc
Off her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws a small box
Thank you
He hands it to Helena
She just stares at it, at a loss for words
Open it
She does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch
106
It's beautiful
Don't wear it in the pool
'll try not to
Good luck, Franklin
'm throwing myself to the wolves
You've faced worse
And if they bite, you can come back here
'll always come back here
Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the driveway
: 133                                                             133 - Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of stairs
Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder
If possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis
You're being superstitious, Louis
There aren't any reporters here
Suddenly out of the darkness a   revealing a dozen or more  staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot, 200 lb
man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man
No one does or says a thing
The  who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another
But  , a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens
Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down
quietly) No
107
Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the scene unfold Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak
Elliot brings the chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it
It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned
But the Photographer raises his camera again
Only now Reed isn't as kind
He grabs the camera from him and opens the back, pulling out the film and exposing it
Hey
(tipping his hat) Good to see you, Mr
Roosevelt
Thank you

Louis enters and makes his way to the stage
He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out
the podium hard he  it back and forth
Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket
Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium
The sound of  fills the hall as Louis, on his knees, the podium to the floor
: - 135                                                               135 Twenty thousand  are roasting in the hall
It is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot
sea of hand- held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once -- most bearing the words "
" Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of are seated, each in front of a primitive looking microphone
108
Hovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the from the previous night
- 136                                                               136 Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's arm
He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit
As everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is perspiring more than most
Where is she seated
Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop Franklin's brow with a handkerchief
In a box stage left
Give me your hand
Franklin takes his hand off his cane
It's soaking wet
Louis wipes it, gently
Louis, what the hell am  doing
Putting your big toe in the water
Just then, a  booms out from the loudspeakers: (
) Ladies and gentlemen,  would like to introduce to you a man who as Assistant Secretary of the Navy served our country with distinction
member of an illustrious family of long-standing political commitment to our great nation
Ladies and gentlemen: Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths
(to Elliot) Let's go
The curtains part and they begin moving forward
109
-  137 137 picks up Franklin and Elliot
The follows them as they make their way to the podium
Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly
The tip of his cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and support
He leans heavily on Elliot's arm
The walk appears effortless
He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash the  his million dollar smile
But the walk is slow and the ovation is beginning to fade
138                                                           138 - ouis stands in the wings clutching the curtain with one hand and covering his eyes with the other

- 140                                                            140 Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium
Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot
Laugh as if 'm making a joke
Elliot throws back his head and laughs
The crowd, wanting to be in on it, rise as one in a sustained
But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip
Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and finally they reach the podium
Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a sleight of hand Houdini would admire,  his father's braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium
displays how Franklin's legs are spread wide for stability as he clutches the podium
He holds on tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip
the crowd sees only a powerful man standing tall amidst the flashbulbs
110
Franklin has made it
He is home

(
) Here on the stage is Franklin Roosevelt
a figure tall and proud even in suffering; a face of classic profile; a frame nervous and yet self-controlled
man softened, cleansed and illumined with pain

,  - '  -  142 , 51, is seated by a radio, surrounded by An overblown Irishman with gold capped teeth and heavy New York accent
He chomps on a lit cigar that never leaves the side of his mouth
#1 Hell of an ovation, Al
Couldn't have asked for anything more
Smith sits silently puffing on his cigar
#2 You may have to be careful though
Looks like you're raising up a rival
(after a beat) Mark my words
He'll be dead in a year
- 143                                                            143 Eleanor applauds Franklin as a  leans in
Mrs
Roosevelt, one last question
Yes
Do you think polio has affected your husband's mind
(smiling) Yes,  do
certainly do

His magnetism is incontestable
He radiates infinite possibility
He looks up to Eleanor's box and they smile at one another as the crowd continues to applaud

As the following words appear on the screen, Franklin slowly and confidently swims out of frame
Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President of the United States
He was elected three more times -- unprecedented in
History
During his years as President, he saw the country through the Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents
On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency, at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his cottage at Warm Springs
The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was Warm Springs
which continues to flourish as a rehabilitation center to this day
