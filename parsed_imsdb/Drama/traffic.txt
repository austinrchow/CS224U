It's an impressive building for a city this size
: ,  - - In chambers striving for august,  listen to a lawyer , argue his case before the highest court in Ohio
Mr
Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice
This informant, paid by the police, using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm
working farm
farm where honest Americans make their living
One particular justice,  , younger than the others, is clearly bemused by this performance
The government, in its haste, has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best, questionable -- Judge Wakefield interrupts -- Mr
Rodman
it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney
polite chuckle from the justices -- Lately the only variation 'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client
And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v
Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants
(beat) Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates
When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold
'm sorry the court finds my argument repetitious
Mr
Rodman, may  offer a piece of advice
The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm
'  - The office is marble and dark wood
young , black, 29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift
They both look at it
What do you think it is
Depends who it's from
(reading the card) Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff
Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me
(re: the elaborate box) Definitely third category
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar
Depends on the state
(checks) Arizona
Medicinal marijuana initiative
(beat) Or am  being cynical
They both laugh
Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of Scotch from a shelf
He pours a couple of fingers in two glasses
Maybe there's a book in it
The clerk takes one of the glasses
Not by me
They toast and drink
- Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters
He gets into a car being driven by two security
- Robert sits in a business class window seat
- An expensive hotel
Robert Wakefield stands at the window, looking at the view of our nation's capital
:
The remnants of a meal
It was a steak and a small caesar salad
The wine glass is half-empty
In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket
On Robert in the same position, only now we are in
It's daytime, and his wife  is helping him into this same jacket
As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders : In the hotel rooms, making the same motions
Satisfied, he straightens, then turns to look at himself
Back at the hotel room window now
Reaches to the table and lifts the wine glass
: - This is the middle of nowhere
Scrub cactus and dust and a heartless sun
:  -
broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of the road
It seems abandoned except there are   inside
- Two Mexican men, State Police officers,  , 30's, and  "" , 20's, wearing jeans, knock- off Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the car
had that dream again
long pause
Which one
Another long pause
Where my mother's suffocating
They continue to wait until there is the sound of a It grows  as it approaches
- The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor
Then, an old -3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan
- They watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the desert
They look at each other and wait some more
- From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers down the road, two  in the cab
- Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach
Javi reaches under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher
He rolls down the window and plants it on the roof
He flips the switch
Nothing happens
He jiggles the wire and the siren and the light flashes
Manolo and Javi step from the car, smiling
- The moving van slows to a stop
Javi approaches
The unhurriedly rolls down the window
Is there a problem
No
There's no problem
The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his wallet
Okay
see
How much do you want
The driver pulls a wad of bills
Javi shakes his head
You want more than this
Javi shakes his head
The driver exchanges a look with his partner
You want something else
Javi smiles
The driver gets out and walks to the back of the truck
He opens the rear door
There are neatly-stacked crates marked with a  logo and "911
"  He reaches into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also with the scorpion stamped on it
He turns to see Javi with his gun drawn
Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck
Drop the package
Put your hands behind your head
You're under arrest
The driver hesitates
He starts to comply then looks at Javi and Manolo
don't understand
think there must be some mistake
No, there's no mistake
Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers
The driver begins spewing  under his breath
Javi puts the driver in the front of the Shadow
Manolo follows in the moving van
-  - The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road
Suddenly, from behind, four armored 's with tinted windows appear, closing fast
The 's force both vehicles off the road where they pull to a stop
long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus past the truck
Finally, the  doors open and surround them like a  team
The passenger door of the lead  opens and , 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi
(to Javier) What's your name
Javier Rodriguez
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here
Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his sunglasses
In the distance, the -3 takes off and over their heads
We've been following these Narco- trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to justice
(to his men) Put the prisoners in the car
Impound the truck
The men follow Salazar's orders
(to Javi) One question
How did you find about this
An informant
What is the name of your informant
(beat) It was an anonymous tip
Salazar looks at Javi a beat
(to his men) For a State Police officer, you're very well informed
Let's go
Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of vehicles drive away
Javier lights a cigarette
Wasn't that General Salazar
Yeah
What's he doing up here
don't know
Something
They start for their car
- - : Two men,  , 30's, proud, ambitious, and , 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office
Castro is talking under his breath -- No telltales
Nothing to read
Not touching my face
Not even blinking
No giveaways
(beat) How're you feeling
(keyed up) feel good
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh
Nope
Castro stretches his arms, swings them around
Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep it all together
Take this motherfucker down
They reach the door to the office
Gordon looks at Castro, then turns the handle
Showtime
,   - - It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the extent of its ordinariness
goes about her business like a somnambulist
shuffle and file
Castro switches into Spanish -- (in Spanish) Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen
We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz
We have a two o'clock appointment
,   - - In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table from  , 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive suit and bad hairpiece
They are waiting
You ever buy a quarter ton
Not many people have
Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again
So, it's worth the wait, right
What can  do
Rent a Huey
Have an airlift
It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right
How many peasants would that take
line stretching from here to Mexico City -- Nobody said shit, Eduardo -- One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun is holstered on the underside
Relax
We're waiting, that's it
Hey, you want to hear a joke
got a joke
Why do women wear makeup and perfume
Chill out -- It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick
Why do women wear makeup and perfume
don't know
'Cause they're ugly and they stink
Castro laughs uproariously
- : Castro laughing
Ruiz politely smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table
Man, you never been close enough to a woman to know how she smells
(
) What's his hand doing
Watch his hand
Anybody
don't like the hand
The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment , in  logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and Ruiz around the cheap table
This is ridiculous this fucking thing
(taps monitor) Look at this shit -- the first television transmission
had better shit when  was the  guy at junior high, swear-to-God
Come on, Castro, pay attention
Watch his damn hands
Another "businessman" enters the office and whispers in Ruiz's ear
( ) Soon
Another  peers out a window through binoculars
:       , , -,   - makes a slow turn into the parking lot
- , in jackets reading "," hide on an opposing roof
They look through high-powered binoculars
Binocular :
#2 All right, here we go
The blue van
#2 Three unmarked vehicles
(picks up walkie) Three unmarked vehicles accompanying
The unmarked cars split up and one turns into the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant
The other circles around the back of a building
#2 It's local
Local or Customs
Oh, man,  don't know
Looks like the cavalry
This is our show
Ah, man
don't want to share this one
,   - - Through the window Ruiz, Gordon and Castro watch the van disappear into the bay of a storage unit
man is pulling down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars into the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars with their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief
Ruiz  the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in the chest, knocking him backwards
Ruiz's men run into the room pulling guns
Castro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men, hitting both of them
Ruiz bolts through another door
Castro pursues, talking into his shirt collar -- Agent down
Repeat, agent down
Gordon gets slowly to his feet, shaking off the blast to his Kevlar, and runs after them
- - The  are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who are shooting back
From all over the stake-out location,   emerge firing their weapons
An equal number of   emerge firing in return
Nobody was aware of the other's presence
It's , a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three competing sets of good guys shouting through -, and
Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between two buildings
Castro emerges and chases him
- Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company
He cuts between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie restaurant
- Castro enters The Fun Zone
There's a cardboard cutout of , a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit version of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition" glass: "Collect All Four
"  There's an enclosure filled with colored plastic balls
The restaurant is empty except for a  filling out a time card
The clown stands
Hey dudes, we're not open yet
Castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving toward the room of colored balls
Gordon enters the restaurant and follows him
An starts to play a
Gordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic balls at the far end of the room
He takes careful aim and
Ruiz  and sits up
Castro pounces on him, disarming him, and roughing him up
- Castro and Gordon shove Ruiz into the sunlight
They wait while their eyes adjust
Take me to the hospital
'm bleeding to death
Castro shoves him forward
has opened the back of the van where a quarter-ton of cocaine is spilling out onto the pavement
: - bong hit is expelled into the air
In the living room of a comfortable, preppy guest house, private school party and hang-out: cigarettes in ashtrays, beer and bong on the coffee table, loud
: , The  is on with the sound off
The curtains are closed
The four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled askew, the three girls' clothing are also identical
Some sit on couches, some on the floor
They are stoned
One intense-looking boy,  , 17, wild curly hair and the attitude of a young Coleridge, and a girl, , 16, really sixteen which means she looks about 12, pretty and flirtatiously irreverent, sit at a desk in front of a Powerbook -3 playing an on-line trivia game
Seth speaks rapidly and precisely
Father of Greek tragedy
Anyone
Okay, Aeschylus it is
(hits keys) His trilogy
The Oresteia
mean this is beautiful, can anyone stop the Seth Machine
(hits keys) Score
Thank you
Madmax from Omaha we own you
And Tragedy is closed out
Seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror
He hands it to Caroline who effortlessly does one
Entertainment
The Susan Lucci section or Banal Love Songs of the Nineties
Seth looks at her
He has a crush
Banal Love Songs it is
(hits keys) Hey, you wanna try something
She nods
They both take a swig of beer
He takes her hand pulling her past the stoned people on the couch -- Seth takes out a box of baking soda
He tears off a square of aluminum foil
He takes out a spoon
Caroline watches as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon
He adds a pinch of baking soda
He puts in a few drops of water
Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter
Then holds the flame under the spoon
What are you doing
(concentrating) Just watch
He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and bubbles, then separates
He pours the most viscous part onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles
He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw
He hands it to Caroline
Inhale the smoke and hold it
What is this, like freebase
Not like
It is
He lights the flame under the aluminum foil
The puddle crackles and pops, then starts to smoke -- Go
Go
There's a rush of thick grey smoke
Caroline catches most of it
Hold it
She pulls it in deeper and holds
Suddenly her expression changes
Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an almost sexual response
Seth is watching her intensely
See
Now, you see
Caroline slumps back against the counter
Seth moves against her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and body
She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as she can
Finally she exhales -- More
The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room
: - The White House    meets with Robert Wakefield
The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor
This is a man you do not want to disappoint
Until you officially take over the office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or having someone in the room
There are a lot of interests in this town and, right now, they're all scared of you
The reason they're scared of you
technically, you have veto power over their budgets
So think about that: , , , , , , , , Radio Shack and the , they're all gonna want to speak to you
And that's the good news
You'll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a specially prepared question
Their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart
If you lecture them, they won't think you respect them
If you respond with utter humility, they will
Remember, this is about your respect for them, and the President's respect for them
Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up
(beat) It'd probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor
'll have Jeff Sheridan take you over
Also, four weeks from today you will give your first official press conference
In it you will outline the President's strategy for winning the war on drugs
(beat) Okay, anything else
'll be sure to let you know
, ,
- Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside , 35, an enthusiastic government employee who has found his place
just want to be clear about one thing
used to work for him, but now  work for you
'm not a partisan person, 'm an issue person
In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues
The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico
know everybody that you're gonna meet
It's important that they like you
It's not important that they like me
That's why  can help protect you
Like you protected Landry
see where you're going with that, but if  could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally  think it very self-defeating
Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for
- Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, , 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier with a sense of humor
Landry is putting some personal items in a box
Jeff, you want to excuse us for a minute
Sheridan nods and leaves
(bemused, off Sheridan's exit) Functionaries
Nice people, the Schedule 's
About twelve graduate degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes all they do is start rumors
Robert and Landry shake hands
You've done a fine job here, Sir
The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it
Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this
He looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere
'm not sure  made the slightest difference
(wistful) tried
really did
There are a lot of encouraging statistics
The work's just started, but  intend to see it through
You've got my word on that
You're here for two years, three maximum
What'd they promise you
Court appointment
What
District
Appeals
(checks Robert's reaction) Not Supreme
Supreme
've come in to do a tough job and that's what 'm going to focus on
General Landry
When Kruschev was forced out, he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor
He said "When you get into a situation you can't get out of, open the first letter and you'll be saved
And when you get into another situation you can't get out of, open the second
"  Soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place
So he opened the first letter
It said, "Blame everything on me
"  So he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm
(beat) He got into another situation he couldn't get out of, so he opened the second letter, which read, "Sit down and write two letters
" They stare at each other a beat
Then Landry smiles
: ' ,  - cinderblock house
Kids and dogs in the street
face we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the street
'  - The ceiling is stained, the floor sags
cheap radio plays
Manolo is at the door
Javi sits at a dinette table
He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, , 20's, a nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves around the kitchen
Relax
If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people
They'd send someone later, when we're alone
Manolo tenses, and throws open the window
(yelling out the window) Away from the car
Now
'  out the window as  play in the car, sitting behind the wheel
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them
He's right
They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime
Shut your fucking mouth
Nobody's talking to you
Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at him
- Javi and Manolo cruise through the streets of Tijuana
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything
You should learn how to keep a secret
She's nosy
She hears me on the telephone
Anyway,  don't think we'll ever see them again
Everything's back to normal
- Tourist hell
cacophony of street venders, panhandlers, and vehicular traffic
Javier and Manolo are speaking with a flustered young American
You're a police officer
Aren't you going to take a report or something
Don't you want to know what kind of car it is
It's a Brown Ford Explorer -- It was right here
It's been stolen
want to file a report
Please
Filing a report will not help you find your car
The police won't find your car
But you're the police
Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number
Call this man, he'll find your car for you
don't get it -- How will this guy know who has our car
The police will tell him
There's a beat of confusion
Why will they tell him but they won't tell us
(getting it) Because we pay him, stupid
(to Javier) Right
And he pays the police
And then our car appears
Yes
Better than filling out forms, right
The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty
Javi waves him off
Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two 's come to a stop in front of them
Javier and Manolo exchange a look
The doors  and approach

The bejewelled  of successful men yammer at one another around tables with rich flower centerpieces
:  , , One wife,  , 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out the window at a small , 5, using a putter as tall as he is
Helena is six months pregnant and radiant
waiter brings Helena's starter course
Her friends, , early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy, and , same League, watch her -- Duck salad
Mmm
Nan can't believe it
Helena, you never order duck salad
Well, that's true
don't
(re: her belly) think someone else is asking for it
Well, he's got good taste
Isn't it the most wonderful thing you ever tasted
mean ever
It's delicious -- They're the most marvelous little creatures
Canard
They fly, swim, walk
And so cute with their babies marching along behind
Looking for a nice sauce ala orange
Everyone laughs
Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd
It's a very fatty bird
All that winter insulation
Just like me
You mean all breast, just like you
You're bad -- (singsong) Jealous, that's all -- 've heard
can't remember where
That it's full of that good kind of fat, the kind you're supposed to eat -- Unsaturated fat -- Polyunsaturated
And now there's a good cholesterol and bad cholesterol
Everything they tell you completely changes every other week
don't know why they think we should listen at all
What  know is ducks, as cute as they are, were designed by God to be eaten
Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad
- Helena buckles her little boy, , 5, into the front seat of her Mercedes
He won't let go of his putter
'll put this in the back
No -- All the professionals keep them in the trunk
Not Tiger Woods
Especially Tiger Woods
(sharing a secret) Actually, he keeps his on the back seat
She pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it on the back seat

Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos

Why
Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses
Your competitor, your ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, they're at the local electronics store right now, and they're gonna be intruding on you not only through your telephone, but your fax, cell phone, pager, cable , Musak, windows, walls, air conditioning ventilation, modem, and internet connection

- The house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks enter and party  drift out
: , ,
- power cocktail party in full swing
This is where most of the business in Washington gets done
Robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug explain the world
We in the legal drug business, and mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my very powerful clients, realize this isn't a war with a traditional winner and loser, but an organism at war with itself, whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants
And if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year
Cocaine manages a measly 2,000
Same for Heroin
But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco which kills 380,000 each year, which, by the way, is more people than have been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century
(faking it) That's very interesting
The lobbyist smiles
Robert sips his drink
In another room
Listening to , overweight advocate for the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce
It's time, Robert, to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators; get'em to fess up that it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth
listening to , earnest advocate of harm reduction
What's the difference between Prozac and Ecstacy, you ask
One's a mattress and the other's a trampoline
Molecules don't have morality
Really, think about it: some molecule changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a bad molecule; it's just a molecule
My theory: America has a real fear of short, intense experiences
Robert turns away -- (under his breath) Like you
Robert at the bar getting another scotch
secretive man, , 40's, nerdy, sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear
(whispering) Chemicals
Some say problems, others say solution
Imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the  out of marijuana
Imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving, from Dilaudid to Dove Bars
Law enforcement hasn't let science sit on the sidelines
Addiction is no more relevant than polio or the Black Plague
Tim slips away into the crowd
Robert moves away from the bar
An argument is breaking out between an  and an with Robert as the audience
(to the undersecretary) You're not battling traffickers or dealers, but a market, and the market contains a paradox: if you arrest traffickers, you raise prices, and you also raise profits, which brings more traffickers into the business
(to the Economist) Back in the real world, we're talking about Mexico and not John Maynard Keynes
We will spend 18 billion dollars this year on this "war," and the question on the table every year is do we certify Mexico as an ally or not
Another man,  , a middle-aged powerbroker, overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled
You want to make a difference, hit the users
You don't jeopardize our financial markets by some hypocritical stance on drug consumption
We're snorting it, why penalize Mexico for supplying it
Mexico, don't talk to me about Mexico -- It's the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profits
That's economic truth -- Addicts don't vote; they don't have PACs; they don't spend soft money, that's political truth -- We're locking them up and consumption is falling -- The price of coke and heroin has dropped and purity has increased
All this law enforcement has achieved is kids can get better stuff, cheaper
In economic terms, you can forget it; this is not a winnable war
Christ, you want to decertify somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia
We don't need them for anything
If you manage to seize an inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs coming into this country, you'll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which won't affect drug use at all
Why are we calling this a war at all
You don't declare war on your own people
Addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside
, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through the arguing demagogues
We need Mexico for these reasons: number one -- Defense; two -- Trade; three -- Tourism; then, way on down the line, comes Drugs
The President knows this
Why's he holding everybody's feet to the fire
(solemn) Mr
Wakefield, there's a situation that needs your attention right away
Robert looks at Michael, squints, looks closer, then follows
(oblivious) One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican descent
Mexico our third largest trading partner
You're looking pretty good for an old guy
My work keeps me young
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities
The worst serial killer in history - who
Gacy - right
Killed forty two people
Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama
Is that covered in your Constitution
Because it isn't in mine
Noriega is a criminal
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the
Government
So, no, don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest
(amused) Last  read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country
hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion
If  ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler,  hope  have the pleasure of hearing your arguments

Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up
We got you on tape making the deal
We got you bragging about the quality
We got you bragging about your business
We got you

Gordon goes to the door and shuts it in her face
One chance here, Eduardo
Make us believe you got a boss
No boss, it's all on you
It's a death sentence
'll never make it to the trial
We can protect you
Ruiz looks at them in disbelief
Who do you work for
This is coercion
That's a big word for a fisherman
Who do you work for
Gordon and Ruiz stare at each other
know another word

Joggers jog to the  of tennis and Jacuzzis gurgling, and lawn care equipment operated by Mexicans
Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf club on the lush lawn
Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional party planner
740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway
Daddy
The window lowers and we see  , 40's, handsome, charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets his kids
Hello
Hello
He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage
David goes back to his game
- There are  in the house and a  in the kitchen
The large rooms are filled with fine art
Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills and receipts spread before her
Carl enters and paces around the room, continuing his cell phone conversation
(into phone) 'm sorry, Jonas
don't care if that is the price you have gotten in order countries
Helena watches her husband pace as he talks
He can't help it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his wife
Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into love
This is America, a different country
am Carl, a different man
So you see, everything about our situation is different and  believe the pricing will be different, too
(beat, listens) You're a reasonable man
So take the weekend to think about it
Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena
Every day with this guy is like starting all over again
Carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with his wife
He looks at her
She looks back
Hi
Hi
What's up
Just watching you
got that
How was your day
She pushes the topiary away from her
Suddenly, she seems tired
Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant belly
You all right
keep feeling like 'm forgetting something
Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her
- Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home and watch David play with his golf putter
An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall
Another arrives and another and another
in jackets exit the cars
There is , then
Helena slowly turns to look at her husband
He doesn't look at her
David, come inside -- Suddenly,  and  enter the front yard
Gordon and Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl
What is this
What is going on
Mr
Ayala
That's right
You're under arrest for violation of Federal Narcotics laws
Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion begin pulling him from his yard
David is trying to get to his father
In a kind of shock
Helena trails after him
Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of the cruiser
He pushes him down into the backseat
We have a warrant to search your home, Mrs
Ayala
Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away
Carl looks at his wife through the window
Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house
Helena is left standing in the street
, who have appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare at her with suspicion
David approaches and holds onto her leg
: '  -  - Javi and Manolo wait in Salazar's anteroom
ceiling fan swirls the air
After a moment the door opens and an motions to them
They stand
(to Manolo) Not you
You
Javi goes into the room

Salazar and Javi sit facing each other
Salazar looks at a piece of paper
Javier Rodriguez
Twenty-nine years- old
Graduated from Montessori school
Five years as a beat cop in Three years with the State Police
Parents died four years ago in their apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford to fix their gas heater
Your sister works in a Maquiladora in Juarez, making designer blue-jeans
On the police force three years, you currently make 316 dollars a month
Salazar crumples the piece of paper and tosses it in the trash
That's your past
want to talk about your future
Would you be willing to do something for me
If  can
'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel
What is it you want me to do
small thing
Nothing really
Javier thinks about this
Does this offer include my partner
Only if he can be trusted
He'll do what  say
Salazar slides a folder across the desk
Javier opens it and sees a black and white surveillance photo of the informant
His name is Francisco Flores
He is a killer and gun smuggler for the Tijuana cartel
need to speak with him
need you to find him and bring him to me so that  can speak with him
- Manolo faces Javier
This is fucking crazy
Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission
Do you know who Frankie Flowers is
He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman
faggot
He's killed fucking who knows how many people
You'd need half the force to get close to him
And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego
Then  guess 'm going by myself
: - Robert Wakefield sits in business class
He twists the cap off a mini-bottle of bourbon and pours it over a cup of ice
He empties a second bottle into the cup, then swirls it around on the ice
He takes a sip
- Robert exits with his briefcase and hanging bag, two trailing him
He sees Barbara and Caroline, his wife and daughter, waiting by the their station wagon
They wave
- On the way home from the airport
Caroline drives carefully with Barbara in the front seat and Robert in back
What's it like
(thinks) Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you
" What about legalizing everything
Has anybody talked about that
Fine -- legalization
Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today
The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions
The becomes a giant pharmacy
Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion
(lightly) Like a Grateful Dead Concert
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world
Canada is completely overwhelmed
What if every country legalized at the same time
(smiles) Somehow,  don't see that happening
- From the hallway we see Robert and Barbara and Caroline having dinner
family tableau
We hear Barbara talking, the murmur of the days events
In the room, Barbara continues her dinner table thoughts
Robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the table
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise
Superfund is just one of those words
People stop paying attention
That's frustrating
It's so frustrating
There is wine on the table and Caroline is allowed a glass
Her parents watch her take a responsible sip
(to Robert) Did you meet the President
Honey, your father knows the President
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time"
Will we get invited to the White House
don't know
How long's the job
It's a presidential appointment so
until  quit or get fired
Czar for life, just like a real czar
That makes mom the Czarina
'm a Czarette
Like Anastasia
Caroline thinks about this
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar
Caroline -- Sorry, but  mean, come on
Robert doesn't know if she's putting him down
It's great, daddy
It's just amazing, that's all
They all look at each other
Caroline sips her wine
: - In the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits on a bench and regroups
Detectives move past her
Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged

Helena, 'm so sorry -- Arnie, thank God
Metzger sits, giving her a hug
Can you please tell me what on earth is going on
Arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know
" Then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth
understand
You're upset
You want to know what's going on
That's good
Why are you talking like that
Listen to me carefully
First of all, Carl isn't here
's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow
So here you're wasting your time
Are you with me
He checks to see if this is registering
Good
From now on  want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read
Got it
Arnie, this is crazy
He makes eye contact with her
Got it
(she slowly nods) Good
Do not discuss anything over the telephone
Do not talk to the neighbors
Stay out of your yard
What is he being charged with
don't know, but under no circumstances would  talk about it here
want you to go home and relax the best you can
Continue your life as if nothing has happened
That is very important
Arnie,  feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass
That's a very apt analogy, Helena
Now, go home and be with your children
- Helena exits
Her expression is set as she drives
She turns a corner in the shopping district, passing who are walking down the street
Tourists, drunk Marines and the homeless piss away another day
We follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a discrete sign
- This is a place where men come to meet men
And it's already lively even at this early hour
Javier and Manolo find a seat and wait
Javi is working on his second beer when he seems to recognize somebody
Francisco "Frankie" Flowers has entered the bar
Javi watches him circulate through the room then settle at the bar
Javier finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to Francisco
Manolo watches
Very quickly Javi strikes up a conversation
We don't hear what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco clearly likes Javi
Off Francisco's anticipatory smile -- -  - The back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded Francisco falls onto the ground
Surrounding him are Javi and Salazar, who watch as two of Salazar's  drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission- style building
(clearly pleased with Javi) 'm curious how you did this with such economy
Everybody has a weakness
: ' ' ,  - With its old-growth trees and manipulated shrubbery, the large house is shrouded in the mystery of well-heeled suburbia
It is very late
' '  - Somebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty
Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on
Faint  echoes through the house
- High ceilings of a 1930's kitchen
Vodka bottles and cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a counter
Maybe ten  are partying hard in this kitchen
It's weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up
There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table
Caroline and Seth and two friends sit around this table
, 16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the hit
- , 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby Huey face, takes a slug of vodka
They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up -- All 'm saying, what 'm saying, is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like we all look at each other and nod with responses we've been trained to make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles, surface bullshit
mean, we're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like, really like
Do  know what Seth's afraid of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman
Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively -- Probably, but do  ever say this stuff, just say, "hey, 'm uncomfortable in this crowd,  don't know what the fuck 'm doing, either
know you're afraid and it's okay-- Seth's words come quickly, they're riffing, totally in sync, totally wired -- We act like we have all the answers and we're totally invincible like our parents seem and their parents before them and it's fucking bullshit -- Fucked-up Bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes
- For instance -- For instance  know you jack-off thinking about Caroline even though you're supposedly "in love" with Vanessa
Whatever the fuck that means
(a digression) mean, what is that convention, anyway
We're all these random collections of self-interest, and then we just decide that now we're two people walking along -- Caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine -- And Vanessa doesn't think she's pretty so she does all these weird fucking diets which is totally about self- esteem
And she's beautiful
(beat) And that's not even fair
Because listen to me
'm fucking lying right now
This is exactly what 'm talking about
'm supposedly talking about you, making some big point about you, and it's really about me
So  should talk about me, not you, not even the universal "you
" (takes a beat) Okay
Okay, 'm worried 'm not really smart or that 'm not nearly as smart as people think  am, or that my parents' expectations have been way too high since  was five, mean who knows they're going to Harvard when they're five, not that 'm blaming them for anything because everything's great, and  may not even get in, but we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we can't acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we ever say it too and what kind of life will that be
They all look at each other with love
This is an adventure and they're having a connection -- - jack-off thinking about Seth
Everybody  know does
Bowman does another huge hit of freebase
(disgusted) Ach, that's what 'm talking about
Sarcasm
Always fucking sarcasm
You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you -- We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us
They all look at each other, vibrating with the moment -- Let's be different -- - can't feel my hands
Bowman looks around, squinting, confused
He's chalk white
- 'm serious -- Suddenly, he clutches his chest and begins to twitch
Puke and foam come from his mouth
He seizes and falls from the chair
Vanessa
Seth and Caroline push the table aside to get a better look
Other people in the kitchen slowly take notice
He's blue
He isn't breathing -- Is he breathing
Bowman's eyes have rolled back in his head
What do we do
Okay
Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue
Doctor
We need a doctor
Your dad's a doctor
Call him -- He's a research doctor
You're dad's a doctor, too -- What kind of research
Mapping the fucking pig genome
We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon -- It's three a

'm not supposed to be here
snuck out -- Are you kidding
'm staying with you -- He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor -- He can't
My parents are in Barbados -- - The Taurus wagon races up to the emergency room of Suburban Hospital
The back door opens and Bowman tumbles out onto the wheelchair ramp under the fluorescent lights
The car screeches around the circle -- in a police car see the body tumble out of the car
The cop car wheels around and cuts off the egress of the Taurus wagon -- - Seth is behind the wheel
Caroline and Vanessa are in the back
They stare out at the cops getting out of the cruiser
Nobody has anything on them, right
: -  - Francisco is strapped naked into a chair
Duct tape covers his mouth
His face is bruised and swollen
cruel talks to him calmly while dumping chili powder into a container of soda water
We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed our chief of intelligence, Francisco
We know you killed police commanders in Tijuana and Mexico City
Why do you resist
He approaches Francisco and begins shaking up the soda water
He rips the tape off his mouth
My father is rich
He'll pay you
Not the correct answer, my friend
The torturer puts another strip of duct tape across Francisco's mouth
We know that you went after the neighbor of General Salazar, a simple alfalfa farmer
His grand-daughter was shot
This is stupid behavior, Francisco
Francisco starts to squirm and whimper
The torturer closes one of Francisco's nostrils and sprays the pepper-laced water into the other nostril
It's like a bomb went off in Francisco's brain
He and passes out
Blood and mucous oozes out of his nose
-    - Javier stands guard outside a door, listening  to the strangulated  of Francisco
He's sickened
Manolo ignores Francisco's , while shooting the shit with several of Salazar's , who laugh appreciatively at something he's said
: ,   - Valet parkers in uniform work the driveway
The party is ablaze and there are lights in the trees
Lester Lanin- like band plays a  that drifts across the grounds
- conservative monied crowd mingles
Helena is talking with a  of rich people who include her friends, Nan, Stewie and Alex, from the country-club, and their
This is fabulous, Helena
What a turnout
Thank you so much, but  had a lot of help
Helena circles away
As Helena leaves, the women speak their minds -- It's a turnout because it's a spectacle
Can you imagine
've met her husband, as nice as they come
It teaches me a valuable lesson
(re: the nice house) Apparently crime pays
Silly, you knew that already
The band stops playing and steps aside as a man in a tuxedo takes the microphone
Behind the band is a huge "

Hello
Thank you
Thank you all have the results of the silent auction

She wears paper slippers and her belt has been removed
Even youth can't disguise her hangover

Across the desk from her is a tired  , 40's, who has been assigned Caroline's case and is giving her the "exit" interview

Yes
Parents still together
Yes

- cold institutional lobby with hard plastic chairs and bad lighting
Government workers move behind thick glass windows with tiny mesh screens cut into them for talking
Barbara Wakefield sits on one of the uncomfortable chairs
She's alone and has been crying
There's the sound of heavily locked doors  and Caroline appears
Barbara stands and wraps Caroline in her arms
Oh, honey
Are you all right
Caroline begins to cry into her mother's chest
- It's an early morning as Barbara Wakefield escorts her daughter from the bland government building
Did you tell Dad
Not yet
Are you going to
don't know
Is this bad for him
What do you think
The streets are deserted
Their Saab wagon sits forlornly under grey skies in an uncovered public parking lot
: '  - Helena slips into David's room and quietly watches him sleep
- Still wearing her evening gown, Helena collapses into a chair, exhausted
at the door startles her
It's Arnie Metzger, who goes to the bar and pours himself a strong one
They sit opposite each other and neither speaks for a while
(quietly) am on the board of my son's school
had a fundraiser for
in my front yard
have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman
Of course he is
've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk
Helena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive, "No
" Arnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows and shuts the blinds one by one
Carl is a very important member of this community and when we're through suing the police and the district attorney and the , they'll have to rename the public parks for your husband
The blinds are closed
Arnie crosses to Helena and talks very softly in her ear
She's a beautiful woman and Arnie manages to make this act seem both practical and inappropriate
(whispering) Your husband is very good at his job
Helena leans back and looks at Arnie
He whispers more -- Which is smuggling illegal drugs into this country
- Workers break down the party under the watchful eye of the party planner
The neighborhood is quiet
There is a telephone repair van parked up the street
- Castro and Gordon have visual and audio equipment trained on the Ayala home
They both wear headsets
' : the blinds covering Helena's study glowing peacefully
They're whispering
can't hear them, but  know it
smell conspiracy
feel the lie vibrating out of the home
She ain't in on it
have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people
'm telling you, she doesn't know shit
She knows Arnie Metzger
So does half of San Diego
You want to make a wager on this
- The music is still playing
Helena looks numb
She motions Arnie to her
He leans in
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered
How am  supposed to survive
'm giving birth in three months
How do  get through this
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl
We get Adler and we beat this thing
How much do  pay him
suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity

Leaves fall on the Saab wagon in the driveway
'  - Robert is looking at Caroline and he's not happy
Barbara is there, at a neutral distance from both of them
Caroline
How well did you know this boy who overdosed
She looks up beseechingly
He didn't hang around us
He's like one of those hippie kids
'm not part of that group
It was a party in all these rooms
His girlfriend who  barely know was completely hysterical
He's blue, he's puking
We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do
(beat) mean, what would you have done if you had been us
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving
You know the police have charged him with a  and possession of marijuana
He's a friend
He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation
He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive
We didn't know what else to do
(beat) It wasn't my pot
She searches her parents' faces
It has been a convincing performance and she expects victory
Okay, honey
We understand
You're mother and  have to talk
Caroline is confused by this reaction
Honey, we'd like to talk alone
Caroline stands abruptly -- Like always
Caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than necessary
Robert and Barbara look at each other, raising their eyebrows and breathing deeply -- think she's lying
Me, too
(reaching a decision) We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit
School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice
This has to be handled delicately
Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly
Christ, this could be embarrassing
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments
tried -- Stop
You experimented in college
don't want to hear about that
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is
This is different
Why
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old
think she has to find out for herself, on her own
We have to allow her space -- Space for what
To
like that other kid
will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents
Because it isn't
Correct
We don't want to push her away
These are growing experiences
Robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him
How long have you known about this
No response
(yelling) How long have you known
Six months
found some marijuana, that's all
And a little pipe about two inches long
talked with her
She said her friends smoked pot and drank -- Explain to me how you could think that  shouldn't know about this
Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me
As a parent
She asked me not to

- Robert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door
He opens it and we get
Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on
She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth
Robert calls her name, but the  is drowning him out
He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to hear
She takes the headphones off - the  stops - and turns to look at him
Or rather, she looks right through him, as though he didn't exist
Robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak
She turns away from him and puts the headphones back on
: -  - Javier and Salazar walk across the base
Salazar is feeling ebullient and it shows
You watch and learn
earn his trust
Then more pain
Then  appear with kindness
Within a week he will follow me around like a dog
But will he be house-trained
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here
He will freely give the names of his superiors
Then we get them and they too will give us names
And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall
They enter the barracks
-    - It's pitch black in the cell
There's a human in here, but we can't see him
Suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in, illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores
The figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway
This is shameful
disgrace
Francisco Flores -- Francisco cowers in the corners -- It's all right, son
It's all right
Salazar is here
You're among gentlemen, now
This shameful treatment will stop immediately
(calling out) Guard
appears in the doorway
Francisco is spooked
want to know who is responsible for this treatment
Yes, sir
We aren't barbarians
Yes, sir
Bring this man a change of good clothes
Has he eaten
don't know, sir
(to Francisco) You will dine with me from now on
Francisco moves closer to Salazar already feeling safe in his presence
: ,   - packed courthouse
Carl is at the defense table
He doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie Metzger
The  is finishing his argument -- This is a man who heads a large criminal organization with international contacts we can only begin to understand
Our case against him is very strong
He is not a flight risk
His flight is assured
The people ask that your honor denies bail
The prosecutor sits
Carl's defense lawyer,  , from the Georgetown party, stands and speaks
My client is no more a flight risk than your Honor or the able prosecutor
He is a pillar of his community, a family man with a wife and child in La Jolla, the community where he has made his home for over twenty years
As our defense will quickly show, my client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an admitted criminal
Therefore we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his own recognizance
Adler sits
The  makes a quick decision
'm gonna deny bail
The judge  his gavel
The crowd is on its feet
Carl tries to get a glimpse of Helena
They make eye contact
Reporters from the press gallery are yelling for Helena
Arnie ushers her away
- Adler, Arnie, and Helena push through a crowd toward her car
There are several reporters there who ask questions -- Mrs
Ayala, were you aware your husband is the largest cocaine smuggler in America
Alleged, people, alleged
Helena gets into her car and slams the door
Adler faces the reporters
#2 Mrs
Ayala is it true your husband has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz
Adler is in a role he relishes
Helena drives away
We move up to Gordon, who is watching from the hotel window across the street
He speaks into a walkie-talkie, and a car down below pulls out to follow Helena
Carl Ayala sits on the board of the Children's Hospital
He is heavily involved with Adult Literacy
He has a small boy and another child on the way
If you spread this kind of innuendo, you can expect legal recourse
Are we clear on this point
: - The marble government corridors are empty
No one is in yet
One office has lights on
'  - Robert Wakefield talks with an Assistant District Attorney, , 40's
appreciate you coming in so early
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you
Consider it gone away
She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and  wanted to thank you personally
Like  said, open container,
, Misdemeanor possession
Easy to make it disappear
For you, poof, it's gone
Kelly thinks a moment, then tries for tact
One thing bothers me
That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him
Serious amounts
He's lucky he lived
So  gotta ask: what's your daughter on
don't know what you mean
mean, did you ask her
What kind of drugs has she tried
Robert is silent for a beat
don't really know
Is she in any kind of therapy
professional help
No, of course not
She's one of the top students at her school
Well,  hope it stays that way
'  - Robert in his car, thinking
The streets are empty
He picks up the cell phone
(into phone) It's Robert
Wipe your schedule clean for the next three days

It's time to see the front lines
'  - Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom
She's not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her pajamas
She's reading a magazine
The exhaust fan is on
There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with cutouts from magazine pictures and copy
On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred aluminum foil; she's done many hits
She leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish
She drops it on a clean place on the foil
She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's turned into a straw
She heats the bottom of the foil
The crack "crackles
" She chases the smoke across the foil
huge hit
She leans her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling
She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan
Caroline looks at her watch
It's 7:20
She stands suddenly, unsteadily
She looks at herself in the mirror
She's really high and indecisive
She looks around wildly
She sees the shower
She turns it on
She drops her pajamas
She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, taking another really big hit
She crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet
She hops in the shower
The water streams over her face
After a long beat she finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and steam
She's in ecstacy
It's almost time to leave for school
: - Helena reads a book, Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, and keeps an eye on David, who is playing on the monkey bars
at a careful distance is the ubiquitous telephone repair van
On the roof a parabolic mike swivels around
- Castro and Gordon watch Helena via a small surveillance monitor
You should see little Montel play
Little Montel is the next Maradona
Maradona is a cokehead
Hand of God, my ass
We're wasting our time here
He won
He was a winner
That bothers you
Winners don't do coke
Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers
Gordon looks at the monitor -- What do we have here
: David kicking a soccer ball with an older strange man, , Latino, 40's, fit and tough looking
The man is very good
He juggles the ball and bounces it off his head and David follows him away from the center of the playground
- Helena notices David moving away while playing with the man
She follows, then begins to jog after them
David, come back here this minute
David
As she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by his arms
David is having fun as Helena approaches
David -- We're playing
The strange man swings David up so that he's under his arm
Yeah, this is fun
Please put down my son
The man holds David
Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers
Thank you
That's a valuable lesson
David, come on
The strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer having fun
He begins to wriggle -- Mrs
Ayala -- This gets her attention -- Your husband owes a lot of money
Enough that snapping this kid's neck wouldn't nearly cover it
David begins to cry
Helena looks around wildly for help
You better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is going to disappear, and he won't turn up until the evening news
He drops David who runs to his mother
You get exactly one warning
The strange man moves away across the field
The first payment is three million dollars
He continues walking away
- Gordon and Castro stare with rapt attention
Are you getting this on tape
love my job
love it
The next time 'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and 'll get over it
: - Javier and Manolo stand guard outside the front door of the dining hall
Javi smokes a cigarette
group of us are going out tonight
Who
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban -- Your new friends
Yeah
It should be fun
You wanna come
Not this time
-  - Francisco and Salazar eat at a beautifully set table
They are waited on by military officers who serve perfect flan at the end of the meal
In my home  have & speakers recently purchased a compact disc burner
can make my own cd's, with whatever music  like, as if bought them at the store, only don't have to pay these crazy prices
We have much in common
We both attended school in the United States, and both of our fathers are engineers
got into stereo equipment when was a kid
Some people don't notice the difference but it is very important to me
Of course it is
Have some more wine
soldier pours another glass of red for Francisco
Now, Francisco, my friend
must know where these men are who killed my captains
Not where they were last week, but where they are today, and better still, tomorrow
You are clever
You can predict where they will be, can't you
Francisco begins to weep
Salazar slides a pad of paper toward Francisco who slowly begins writing
- Manolo and Javier pound on the front door of an apartment
opens the door and they grab him
- walks down the street
Two 's pull up in front of him
He starts to run
Salazar's men jump out and chase him
Francisco is in the backseat of one of the 's, watching
- An  pulls up to a curb
- Javier and Manolo and Francisco sit in the
Francisco is weeping
can't go home
don't want to go
Please don't make me
He looks beseechingly at them
It's not our decision
'll be killed
Stop complaining
Nobody knows what you've been up to
They push him out of the
: - Castro and Gordon sit with Eduardo Ruiz in a conference room
They are recording his statements
Carlos,  mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries
He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats
So you pay off our customs officials
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the
(condescending) Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search
The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds
We hire drivers with nothing to lose
Then we throw a lot of product at the problem
Some get stopped
Enough get through
It's not difficult
You'd think he wasn't sitting here facing life in prison
This has worked for years and it will continue to work for years
makes everything more difficult for you
The border is disappearing
(pointing at them) You people are like those Japanese soldiers left behind on deserted islands who think that World War is still going on
(with total disdain) Let me be the first to  tell you, your government surrendered this war a long time ago
(to Castro) This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it
got greedy
decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off
That was my mistake
Carl would never be so stupid
He hired you
That was a mistake
Carl and  were friends from childhood
He was loyal, that's not a mistake
-     - Car after car, an unending multi-lane stream of vehicles moving into the
Any of these cars could be carrying drugs
- On an elevated walkway, this booth commands a view of everything
Robert and Sheridan listen to an  give the spiel
The busiest land border crossing in the world
Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot
think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through
Any idea how much
've read official estimates but wouldn't bet my house on them
've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers
(gestures to the traffic) At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not
What do you look for
We ask questions and measure the answers
When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look
Before  we had about 1
9 million trucks a year
Now it's almost double
Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies
Any way we can do it better
Sure
More money in intelligence on their side of the border
So we have a better idea who we're looking for
More dogs
More people
Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through
Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do
(beat) But,  should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now
(beat) In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars
What does that tell you
That triple the amount of stuff is going through
Right
But, that's not the biggest problem
One of our Intel officers picked up information from  that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else
It doesn't smell like coke
It doesn't look like coke
And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test
It could be anything
Maybe it's already happening
mean, how would we know
Robert looks out at the border activity
It's anarchy
: - Helena is on the floor surrounded by papers
She's made piles of certain things: articles of incorporation, shipping/transfer documentation, bank statements, credit card statements
She holds a telephone to her ear -- (to phone) Yes, hi Jenny, account number 4168 2245 3173
need a cash advance
Helena walks into her kitchen
It's serene in the afternoon light
She fixes ice-cold lemonade and fills two plastic cups
What's the largest amount  can get
(listens) Okay,  guess that'll have to do
Helena hangs up the phone
She takes the two cups of lemonade to the front door and steps outside
- Helena carries the cups down the driveway
She presses a button and the gates swing open
- Gordon and Castro listen to their headsets
Suddenly -- (
) (over their headsets) Okay
She's coming out
She's leaving her property
Okay, she seems to be heading for the van
She is approaching the van
Castro and Gordon looks at each other
What do we do
don't know
There's a  at the door of the van
What do you think she wants
She's your girlfriend
Open it, talk about your kids
Gordon opens the door
Helena is standing there with the lemonade
so hope  didn't startle you thought you might like some cold lemonade
Uh
Thank you
She hands the cups to him
Helena gathers herself
know this is a difficult situation and you're only doing your jobs don't bear you any ill-will, but do have a small favor to ask
You want to ask us a favor
man threatened my children
These charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar
(beat) Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary
don't know what else to do
Of course, we will
Thank you
They shut the door to the van and sit for a moment
It's probably poisoned
Gordon takes a big sip of his
It's good
Not too sweet
: - This is a questionable neighborhood pushed up against the edge of poverty
Anna hurries across the street
'   - Anna walks up the stairs of a rundown building
She passes two  loitering in the stairwell
She knocks on a door and Javi, half-dressed for work, answers
He's surprised to see her
Anna
What's wrong
What do you want
can't find Manolo
He's not here
He never came home last night
Was he with you
No
He lets her into the apartment
'  - small, clean room with a partition for the sleeping area
'm worried
Last time he was out late,  went through his clothes while he was asleep
She pulls out a plastic packet with the scorpion insignia and 911 stamped on it
Javier thinks a beat
'll find him
-  - Javi slams Manolo against the side of building
What the fuck are you doing
You're supposed to be at work
Look at you
Manolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed
It's no problem
was just with everybody we work with
Oh, really
General Salazar was there
No, but a lot of other people
You should come
You should come out with us
Go home
Get cleaned up
Get to work
Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and 'm not getting left behind
Don't fuck this up
: -  - Javi buys a cup of coffee
He turns
Two men, who will come to be known as   and  , are standing close
Agent Hughes speaks without looking at him
The word going around is you're not that happy in your work
(beat) Maybe we can help
Hughes sticks a business card in Javi's pocket
Javi watches them walk away
It's all done so smoothly and quickly, it's over before Javi even knows what happened
-  - It's the bad part of urban Cincinnati in the daylight: projects and blighted row houses
Seth and Caroline walk with a slouched, alert air
In their mind's eye they are prep-school gangsters following a familiar route
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day
He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons -- Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day
Have you done your homework, honey
Yes, mom -- Then here's a little bump
They turn down a street with a lot of activity on it
Drugs weren't even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem
Opiates
But, who was using 'em
Chinese immigrants
Slave labor
And the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music
People on the fringe
Artists
Decadent rich people
And who got scared
White men in power
Who's scared today
White men in power
If
Morgan and John
Rockefeller ever admitted using, it'd be a whole different story
fall in step with them
One talks without moving his lips -- What you want
911, and the come down
One dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling- down building
How much
Two hundred of , hundred of the other
The dealer looks them over
He looks behind them down the street
Come on
We've been here before
Then, let's see your money
Seth and Caroline are suspicious
They carefully show money they both have in their front right pockets
The dealer feints like he might grab it
Up the steps
You the experts
You know what to do
They hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone
- They step into the narrow foyer between the outer door and the inner door
There are three other  waiting nervously
An older  shoots them a crazy look -- What are you two, about twelve
Fuck off
They wait
Finally, the first dealer appears in the inner door and lets them through
- They wait in a line in the narrow, poorly lit corridor
At the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the drugstore is open
People buy and leave
Seth and Caroline approach
In the hatch is a hardened dealer, 20's, named , which is tattooed on his forearm
He checks out Caroline's body
Caroline, give me your money
She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911
" Caroline has been watching the transaction
Sketch makes slow eye contact with Caroline
After a beat -- Goodbye
Caroline
Seth and Caroline make their way out of the building
(under his breath) Yeah, right
- Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps
The lookout speaks without moving his lips
Now, get the fuck out of here
Caroline stops suddenly
She pulls Seth to her and kisses him hard
There's no better moment than the one right after scoring before you start using
- flophouse of the seediest variety: wino in the doorway, prostitute taking care of business, everyone fresh out of institutions and graveyards
- They approach the front desk which is behind six inches of glass
We'd like room 205
Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars
205 -   - They enter and the light bulb goes out
Seth fumbles his way to the mini-fridge, which he opens, throwing feeble light across the floor
They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the black and white television bolted to the bureau
The mini- fridge
Caroline bounces on the bed
They are teenagers
Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge
love this place
Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table
From other pockets he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube
She trails away watching him fix the first hit
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy
think so
If she didn't she should have
(checks her watch) 've only got maybe an hour
Then volleyball practice is over and have to be home
Why
Nobody's there
He prepares the first hit
She does it and lies back
He does one
(blowing out the hit) The maid
They ask her what time get back
She spies for them
Seth starts kissing her
They try to get into it, but both of them are thinking about the drugs
wish we could stay here
Just be here forever and ever
Make it a little home
She leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin
want to have sex and do a hit right as we're coming
Caroline's distracted by the line she's snorting
After a while
Okay
Seth begins undoing her jeans
: - :  , Robert and Sheridan listen to the official tour of the center delivered by the ---, 40, a sincere weight-lifter with a sincere crew-cut
--- Over 200  field agents, a budget of almost 100 million dollars and state of the art communications equipment make the El Paso Information Center the Drug Enforcement Administration's flagship for the 21st century
- huge lunchroom
Long plastic institutional tables and agents minding their own business, Robert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through
They pass a wall of black and white head shots -- Who are these guys
--- Agents who died in the field
- of large mansion with manicured grounds
The back lawn is filled with children, balloons, a merry-go-round, and pony rides
It's a sumptuous children's birthday party
--- That house, that you see from the headquarters, belonged to Porfirio Madrigal -- the Lord of the Skies, largest trafficker in Mexico
looking through the binoculars
He died in a liposuction surgery, right
--- Right
Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants
Who knows
(beat) Every damn day there's birthday party
At first  thought they must have three hundred children, then realized they're taunting us
Three miles away and we can't touch them
Ha, ha, ha
: a child running in circles holding a clutch of colored balloons
Who do we interface with on their side
--- What do you mean
mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side
--- don't know
don't think there's any one person
(thinks) See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides
Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels
It's very organized
- Robert, walking with purpose, leads his group to their plane
- Robert and Sheridan and several , Law Enforcement, and Military Officials
It's a nice plane, used for important people and Robert has the best seat
want everyone thinking out the box for a second
What are we gonna do about Mexico
(silence) Come on, guys
Out of the box
The men on the plane just stare at him
Finally the leans forward
Unlimited funds
Unlimited
From a  standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds
And cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training
Robert turns to the others
Come on
want to hear from everyone:
Customs
Treatment
Is there anyone from treatment on this plane
(no one answers) Then  want an answer for why there isn't anyone from treatment
(beat) Look, we know we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there's nothing wrong with sending a message
That's why when Carlos Ayala hired Michael Adler lead defense,  flew Ben Williams to San Diego to prosecute
Because he's the best we have, he's our symbol that we're serious about putting the top people away
(beat) So, as of right now, this flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open
Still, no one else says anything
They watch Robert impassively
If 'm not mistaken, we got , Pentagon,
Attorneys office, about a billion dollars of budget right here
So what are you people waiting for
: - Establishing shot of a tall glass building in the downtown skyline of San Diego
'  - Helena and Arnie enter his office
The furniture is sleek mid-century modern, and the view of the harbor is extraordinary
On a clear day you can see Mexico City
Arnie stands very close to Helena and looks at her profile
This place is swept twice a day learned that in Miami in '85
Then the
shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole
Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here
And San Diego is so much more relaxing
Arnie,  need money
Somebody threatened my children
They want a first payment of three million dollars
Helena, if  had it  would give it to you, but  don't have that kind of money
Arnie, help me
Doesn't anyone owe us money
Yes,  told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying
There's too much heat on Carl
Please
Tell me who Carl sells to
Arnie thinks
Even if  knew  wouldn't tell you
You do not want to come into contact with these people
Only Carl knows who they are
That's his real asset
Ruiz doesn't know them
They don't know Ruiz
Church and State
What about legitimate businesses
We own a construction concern, real estate -- Laundromats for the washing of money
Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business
Don't you have some good news
Isn't there something positive you could say
There isn't
Helena looks Arnie in the eyes
(vulnerable) Sometimes  wonder what 'll do if Carl doesn't get out
'm not very adept at being on my own
've always had a man in my life
Always
remember when  first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere
had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed
'm glad you think so, but 'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar
(beat) And 'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that
It takes a great effort for Arnie not to answer
: -  - Javier and Manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in Mexico City
Javi isn't familiar with the roads and drives cautiously
young lady, , early 20's, sexy and vulnerable, rides in the back of the
You two don't like me, do you
Manolo laughs and looks her up and down
Javi watches her in the rearview mirror
We don't have an opinion on you
(to Javi) Maybe it's because 'm getting an apartment nicer than anything you'll ever see in your life
Javi says nothing
(re: the neighborhood) can't believe the old man kept his promise
The General is a man of his word
They will say anything to get what they want, but then you remind them, it's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
(beat) Occupational hazard,  guess
Javi just looks at her in the rearview mirror
His friend is giving us the apartment so it's not like he paid
It's more like a favor
Javier pulls the  to the curb in front of a beautiful colonial-style apartment complex in the verdant neighborhood
- Birds are chirping
Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up the walkway to the arched doorway
He knocks on the heavy wooden door
You don't have the keys
Oh that's perfect
Are you an idiot
Manolo knocks again
They wait a long beat
There's supposed to be someone here to let you in
Finally, the door swings open and a  is standing there
Rosario  and sweeps past him into the vast space
The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags inside the door
Manolo sets the bags down and sees another  standing a few feet away
The man wears sunglasses
His complexion is strange and his neck is bandaged
The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears Rosario's happy  drifting down from an upstairs window
- Manolo gets into the truck
He's shaken by what he's just seen
Madrigal's alive
What
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead just saw him
long beat as Javier considers this
This is why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana
Madrigal, who's supposed to be dead, owns him
And Madrigal is making a move on Juan Obregon
Javier calmly drives away
Javi
Come on
Don't pull this you don't care bullshit
This is incredible information
It must be
Javi -- We keep our mouths shut
: '  - Barbara drives Robert home from the airport
There's a sense they've been silent for a while
think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar
It's this General, Salazar
At least 'll have somebody on the other side  can talk to
Does this mean you're going to be gone more
long silence
Possibly
Another silence
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter
Barbara -- Because 'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front
If you start in on the war metaphors 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole
Look, 'm as worried as you are -- No,  don't think so
Leave me alone, give me money
That's what  get from our daughter
She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too
She looks at him, stung
'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello
have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day
That's different
Oh, it is
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death
- He car pulls into the driveway
Robert gets out
Barbara doesn't
He looks back at her
Why don't you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are
She puts the car in reverse and drives away
He stands for a moment, steaming
- Robert Wakefield steps inside his home
It's very
He checks the mail on the hall table
- Robert walks down the hallway
He steps into Caroline's bedroom
'  - Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door
There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter
and , then a '  - Caroline sits on the toilet
Glamour Magazine on her lap
She's wild-eyed and paranoid
The exhaust fan is running
The aluminum foil is on the sink
The last little bit of heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it
She's listening hard for any  in the house
What she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening
She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it
She does the hit
And seems to feel better
Suddenly there's a  on the door
The  of her father muffled through the solid wood
(
) (muffled by the door) Caroline
Open this door immediately
Caroline is up like a shot
She looks around
The on the door gets stronger
She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet
The bathroom door  like it's about to cave inward
(faking the best she can) Who is it
'm going to the bathroom
She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air
One minute
She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet
She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes
Excuse me -- Robert grabs her by the arms
He pushes her against the wall and looks at her pupils
He looks at her fingernails
The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and irritated
You're not going anywhere, young lady
She stands there; she's very high
Robert sniffs the air
He throws open cabinets, searching for drugs
He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by the charred aluminum foil
Where is it
Where are the drugs
(yelling) Where are they
Fuck you
wasn't doing anything
You're like the Gestapo
Robert  the cabinets
Fuck me
Oh, okay
Fuck me
Fuck you
Robert is losing it
He throws stuff around the bathroom and then, for the first time, looks up
He sees the long light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on him
'm going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that  can help you
She just stares
Okay, young lady, that's it
Like  give a fuck
Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a charred spoon
It confuses him
He throws it into the sink
He pulls out another spoon
He pulls out crumpled bindles, rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka
The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up the sink
Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity has him momentarily baffled
What is wrong with you
What
(beat) You're going away
You're getting help somewhere
You can't make me
Oh, yes  can
: -   - Javier drinks toward downtown
He's sipping a Burger King soft-drink
On the seat next to him is a shopping bag from Target
He takes an exit
Javier pulls into the underground parking lot of a fancy office tower
- Javi drives down to the third floor underground
He pulls into a parking spot next to a white sedan
He slides open the cargo door of his van
The cargo door of the sedan opens
Javi quickly gets into the sedan
- Special Agents Hughes and Johnson welcome Javi
Where are we going
Hughes sticks out his hand
Special Agent Hughes, Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States
(ignoring the niceties) Where are you taking me
The agents exchange a look
Somewhere safe
Where
place we have, that we know is protected
No
It's really safe
Not for me
Okay
Where would you like to go
-  - Javi and Agents Johnson and Hughes stand in the middle of the shallow end of a large swimming pool
in waterwings splash nearby
It's important that we work together
Mexico
America
One hand washing the other
We agree
So
maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations
(confused by this) We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us
(feigning surprise) This is a very different proposition
Johnson and Hughes exchange a glance
We pay for that kind of information
fat kid in an inner-tube floats behind them
Is that what you're talking about, Javier
Javi makes eye contact with one agent, then the other
Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem
Now it is epidemic
(beat) Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to move to my country
You dumped the problem at our feet
Now, drug use is epidemic
Now, the treatment centers are full and get no state money
They survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the (beat) We need lights for the parks so kids can play at night
So they can play baseball
So it's safe
Everybody likes parks
Everybody likes baseball
(beat) What 'm talking about is  would like to see somebody take an interest in Tijuana
That's what 'm talking about
Javi starts to get out of the pool
Javi, You want to come see us again, you're going on the box
No more of this water-wing bullshit
- Javier gets out of the  sedan and back into his
He drives away
- Agents Hughes turns to Agent Johnson
You wanna tell me what the hell that was all about
He's got something
We just have to be patient
: - Helena and Carl each hold a telephone receiver as they stare at each other through a thick pane of meshed glass
Helena is barely holding it together
It's hard for Carl to see her like this
After a beat -- How's David
How's David
How's David
He's terrific, Carl
Helena -- We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents
don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back
Or if you're coming back
She can't even look at him
(beat) We'll get through this,  promise
'll make it up to you -- (snapping) How
Supportive letters from prison while 'm being kicked out of our home
(beat) Do you have any idea what is happening out here
Our credit cards are maxed
The people at the bank, you should see their faces when  walk in there
have a letter from the government telling me that anything  sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien
Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging
Nobody will help us
Nobody will take us in
Nobody wants anything to do with us
So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me
(losing it) Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection
Helena -- Tell me what to do, Carl
need guidance, not a fucking platitude
(beat) 'm not bringing a child into the kind of life  grew up with
won't do it
want our life back
Carl looks at his wife as if he is trying to weigh her
He thinks, then leans forward -- built our house and  don't want to lose it
Every stone, every brick, every board
(carefully) My business
That would take a lot of private study
(he blinks) That you don't have time for suggest you look into the Coronel
(he blinks again) Into selling it
If you can stomach it, you should look into it
That painting is very valuable
don't understand
Look into the Coronel; otherwise, there is nothing to do

Lonely
Tired
" Caroline, wearing a thick, woolly sweater, and the other sit around on beat-up couches and chairs in a loose circle
It's a mixed : trucker meth-head, rocker dope- fiend, yuppie crack-head, fat, thin, rich, middle-class, and all white
Caroline is the youngest
, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his "share
" So it was my birthday an my ex-wife was getting remarried and  was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day because  didn't have to eat out of a dumpster
That was enough to send me out on big one
(beat) 've been thinking a lot about the first step: that  came to believe was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable
(beat) See my disease tells me  don't have a disease
That 'm fine
That it's my birthday and  can have one little drink, then one little line, then one little Valium, then two more fat lines, then two more 10 mil Valium
Six months later  wake up in a sober living house in Philly
And 'm from Dallas, people
(beat) It's a disease -- an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind
know that now
So my name's Marty and today 'm a grateful recovering alcoholic who didn't eat out of a dumpster
Thanks
And Marty looks to Caroline who didn't relate to one word he said
(slowly, very nervous) Hi
'm Caroline
'm not sure 'm an alcoholic
(beat) mean  don't really like to drink
For someone my age it's so much easier to get drugs than beer
don't know, this is really weird and 'm really nervous
People in the room nod encouragingly
guess 'm angry
mean  think 'm really angry about a lot of stuff, but  don't know what exactly
She blushes, and stares out the window
: - Helena follows an   through her formal living room as he inspects paintings and makes notations
He is very excited and moves quickly from one to the next
Tamayo
Carrington
simply wonderful collection of Mexican Modern
Give me three months know several collectors in South America, very discreet
don't have three months
It takes time to find the proper collection
How much will you give me in cash
Today
The appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows the figure to Helena
You must be joking
That's a fraction of their value
'm sorry, but that is the figure can get today
Helena turns her back
She walks to a window and looks out, then surveys the contents of her beautiful home
(snapping) Get out
Get out of my house
Helena turns and sees David in the doorway
She goes to him
It's all right
We're have a disagreement, that's all
The art appraiser passes them on his way out
- Helena wakes up in the middle of the night with a start
Her eyes are wide open
She has had a thought -- She climbs out of bed and quickly puts on a robe
- Helena walks quickly and quietly down the hallway
She passes David's room
She opens a door at the end of the hall -- '   - Helena enters the room
She hits a desk lamp and we're in a very comfortable and masculine upstairs study: bookshelves holding hundreds of art books; comfortable chairs; MacIntosh stereo; discreet flatscreen
Helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves
It is "Boy with a Hoop," a small portrait by Rafael Colonel
She goes to it and looks from different angles
She reaches out and jiggles the oil
Nothing happens
She looks behind the painting at the backing
She notices that one corner is not glued down
She picks up a letter opener and pries the paper back
An envelope slips out
Inside the envelope: neat, thin strips of paper dense with information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card
: - Robert and Sheridan ride in the back of the chopper
Each looks out his own window
newspaper on the seat between them shows a front page photo of General Salazar, exultant, and the headline reads in Spanish, "Salazar Named Chief of Anti-Narcotics Operations
" - Establishing shot of a military helicopter landing on the roof of an office building in downtown Mexico City
, , -   - Robert Wakefield and General Salazar stroll through the new headquarters where boxes are still being unpacked
Javier and Sheridan trail along behind them
recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process
Not only physical, but also psychological
'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels
That would be very helpful to me
(beat) Also,  received the offer from and the  to train some of my men at Quantico
think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods
'
- The office hasn't been decorated yet
've been too busy to completely settle in
Salazar proffers a chair and they sit next to each other like Brezhnev and Nixon
begin pictures
After a few moments, Salazar waves them away, and they lower their cameras and leave
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel
Yes,  am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year
But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force
We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem
Yes,  hope so as well
Let me ask you a related question
We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand
What is your policy for treating addiction
Addicts treat themselves
they overdose and then there's one less to worry about
Robert cannot respond
: -  - Caroline ambles alone down a walkway at the treatment facility
She looks through the trees that surround facility and notices cars going by
: -  - Gordon and another   escort Ruiz up the stairs of a large, older hotel
This is ridiculous
Why is there no elevator
When the  gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons
They walk down a hotel hallway
Two more  stand outside Room 407
Gordon opens the door and they enter
- There are more  inside and old food and coffee containers
Gordon gives Ruiz a tour
There are several rooms
bored Castro sits at a table staring at a Scrabble board
Eddie, how you like your new home
hope you hate it as much as  do
Ruiz looks around with disgust
He's accustomed to finer places
He goes to a window and looks out
' : of the Federal Court building not far away
This is not what my lawyers negotiated
Gordon pours himself a cup of coffee
Fuck your lawyers
You aren't getting any cappuccino or Biscotti either
- packed, tense courtroom listens to testimony from a government witness, , 50's, very matter-of-fact and truthful
He first came to me in January
That would've been nineteen eighty- seven
He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor
didn't ask too many questions; 'm a businessman also
- Another witness,
, 40's, pedantic on the stand -- told Mr
Ayala there were irregularities in his tax return
And  couldn't represent him unless we could explain this
- , 38, a mousy secretary, is on the stand
Carlos sits at the defendant's table listening raptly
Gordon and Castro sit in the back watching Helena who pays close attention to the witness -- was the company secretary from 1991 to 1994
supposedly worked for all six companies
But
they weren't
mean, it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone
We never sold anything the whole time  was there
Sometimes people came and got paid
don't really know what we did
Did Mr
Ayala say where the money came from
No, and  didn't ask
Where do you think it came from
Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet -- This speculation -- 'll rephrase
Did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise
Sheila is reluctant to answer
No, not really
Helena catches Carl's eye and they share a grim moment
: '   - Helena sits at Carl's office desk
On the desk in front of her are the lists she found and an encrypted cell phone
Helena picks up the phone
Her hands are shaking
She is crying as she dials
voice on the other end answers
(
) Who is this
Helena gathers her courage, then
friend
of Carlos Ayala
There is a long pause
(
) Yes
'm on a special phone, may  speak freely
(
) You may speak
have a job for you and  don't have much time
- Helena watches David look at the wide variety of plants and flowers
All around them a  of 3rd graders, in identical -shirts, enjoy a field trip
(
) love this place
Don't turn around
Behind her Francisco Flores takes a photo with an instant camera
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children
want to use a bomb
You're kidding
Can't you shoot him or something
don't really like guns
You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive
When will you do it
don't know
Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl
The security is very tight
There may not be a way
There's always a way
If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him
Francisco laughs
Careful
You're sounding like your husband, Mrs
Ayala
: '  - Anna sits in the living room, staring
She appears too upset to speak
The apartment is cleaner
There have been other changes
There's a new rug
What
What is it
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this
Javier just watches her
It's Manolo
He's going to do something stupid
'm worried that he'll get himself killed
He keeps watching
He's saying he's going to talk to the Americans
Become an informer
He says they pay a lot of money
Why does he need money
He has debts
He has gambling debts
He owes a lot of money
How much
Nine thousand dollars
long beat
What is he planning on telling them
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal
and Salazar
Javier just looks at her
: '    - Robert is on the telephone, listening
He is not happy
Sheridan watches him
(into phone) Nobody saw her leave
(beat) Yes
understand
He hangs up
He stands and reaches for his jacket
have to go
have to go home
- Robert and Barbara sit at the kitchen table
Should we bring the police into this
No, not yet
- Robert drives through the streets in his Cadillac DeVille
- Robert rides in glum silence
He looks at passersby who are almost all black and almost all stare back at the white man in his Cadillac
group of young men stare threateningly as he rolls past
On the street, in the lee of a Brownstone staircase, a deal is going down
- sit in a coffee shop
(genuinely surprised) She's not at that place you sent her
She snuck away
And we haven't seen her
She hasn't come home
Oh, man -- She hasn't called you
tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through
(beat) 'm surprised she hasn't called
- He turns a corner and is suddenly in a drive-thru drug market
Dealers, , run at the windows from both sides, signaling
What you want
Rock
Rock
Hey, what you want
- in the coffee shop
Can you tell me anything
Do you have any ideas
don't know what to say
'm not the police
don't care about experimentation
She's a kid
'm worried to death
You won't say anything to my parents
don't give a fuck about your parents -- We sometimes went downtown to score
What
The West End
We buy it off the streets
(beat) can stop, you know, and she can't
Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then  get my shit together, and for her it's different -- You don't know what the hell you're talking about
You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are
You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away
And neither does she
- It is surrounded
Robert stares
face presses up against the window
(through the window) What do you want
(through the window) What do you mean, what do  want
Rock or dope, man
don't want anything
Hey man, 'm sorry
'm just trying to help
You want to help
Stay the fuck away from her
'm looking for my daughter
The dealer looks at him with disgust, turns his back, and waves everyone else away
Robert slams his fist against the steering wheel
He slams it again and again
He stops and pulls away, just as behind Robert's car, Caroline crosses the street toward Sketch's house
'  - single candle lights the room
Caroline is underneath Sketch the drug dealer
He is pounding away
As she clutches his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and druggy, and  escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe she could make
There's a  on the door
Sketch continues his business
The  is more insistent
Finally, he stops and gets up and goes to the door
Caroline lies back
She's in a bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but a dresser and some duffle bags
Sketch opens the door -- What the fuck do you want
outside says something
Sketch walks over to a duffle bag and extracts some product
Caroline's eyes are glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door
Sketch sees her staring at the drugs
He comes back to bed
You want some of that
Caroline nods
What you gonna do to get some of that
Please -- What you gonna do
She turns her back to him, pouting
He laughs
Maybe a taste
He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray
On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye dropper
He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a speedball
He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe and holds it up the light
It has Caroline transfixed
Feed this to you like a little bird
He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air
It arcs in the candlelight
Don't -- You want this
She nods
This is the Express train
Baby turnin' pro and getting down in a big, big hole
Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the syringe
Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips
Kiss it
Kiss your new mommy hello
Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her lips part
Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs
He grips one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes
Veins stand out on her foot
He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly depresses the plunger
Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, she , sexually and slumps against the pillows, her eyes half-open, her lips twitching
Sketch puts the rig back on the tray, then admires Caroline's beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again
: - Gordon and Castro and two other  escort Ruiz out of the hotel and usher him into a waiting cruiser
They pull out in a caravan and move through the streets toward the courthouse
- The cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot
Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the building entrance
As they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative grey suit passes them going outside
The parking lot is empty of people
The guards at the gate talk about something distracting
Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys
Kneeling down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his jacket
He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle, stands and walks toward the guard gate
- The court is filled to capacity
Helena and Metzger watch from the gallery
The  bangs his gavel
Adler is on his feet
Your honor, it has come to our attention that your honor, while in private practice, previously represented the town of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the Police Department of Seal Beach
We believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated
The judge is surprised to hear this
Mr
Adler, this is a most unusual motion
Nonetheless, your honor, we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law
If this is in any way designed to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz
The judge considers
We'll recess until 9:00 am Monday morning
And 'll see counsel in chambers
He slams the gavel down again
- Gordon, Castro, other  and Ruiz come down the rear steps of the courthouse and walk across the street toward the parking lot
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months
Oh, man, 've never eaten so good in my life
(to Ruiz) Why don't you develop a useful skill
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman
They reach the car
Would you mind if today we walked
It's one block
could use the fresh air
'  - Across the street, Francisco, encrypted cell phone to his ear, watches from his own car as Gordon, Castro, and Ruiz stand by their car without getting in, then walk away from the car
(into phone) They're not getting into the car
What are they doing
They're walking right at me
The men start across the street toward Francisco
'  - Helena drives her car through downtown San Diego
(into phone) You've got a gun
Get out of the car and shoot him in the head
'  - Francisco watches Ruiz and the agents walk up the street toward him
(into phone) They're going to walk right past me
(
) What are you
mouse
Get out of the car and do it
This is your chance
Francisco watches the three men walk past his car
He makes a decision and opens his door
- Francisco steps from the car and mingles in with walking along the sidewalk
He follows them for few yards, picking his moment
He closes the distance to Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, pulling a pistol from inside his jacket
He takes careful aim from twelve feet away and is about to shoot Ruiz when a bullet hole appears in his chest
He staggers, trying to squeeze the trigger, Francisco fires the gun once, wildly -- tourist screams -- Gordon and Castro and Ruiz turn -- Francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the center of his shirt, uncertain of what has happened -- Gordon shoves Ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick shots -- Francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street
Citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an card coming off a bad week of day-trading -- Gordon and Castro with Ruiz beneath them scan the streets
Stay here
'll get the car
Castro runs down the street for the court parking lot
Other are running toward Gordon and Ruiz
- The   who threatened Helena's children packs a high-caliber rifle and scope into a briefcase
He snaps the case shut and quickly exits the room
We notice a man on the floor with a bullet hole in his head next to the open door
- Agents surround Ruiz
Gordon walks to the body of Francisco lying face down in the gutter
He turns him over with his shoe and sees his face
(to the other agents) saw this guy at the courthouse
(beat) The car -- Gordon takes off running, yelling for Castro
- Castro has reached the car and gets in
Gordon appears at the gate of the lot -- (yelling) No -- - Castro turns the ignition exactly at the moment he sees Gordon yelling and waving his arms -- - The cruiser
Gordon hits the pavement
Parts of the car begin raining down around him
: -   - fire truck and paramedic unit  by
Manolo sits at an outdoor cafe table, waiting
He can't help looking around at the attractive people, but he's also nervous
Suddenly two , recognizable as Salazar's  from the desert drug bust, sitting at a nearby table, rise and move to Manolo's table
#1 Manolo, how are you
They take seats uncomfortably close to Manolo
#2 Manolo, have we interrupted
You're looking around like you're expecting someone
No
'm looking for the waiter want to order
#1 What are you gonna have
steak
#1 Well, if you like steak, we know a much better place
We'll take you there
That's okay, really
They each take Manolo by an arm
#2 Manolo, we should really be going now, before it gets too crowded
- We're looking through the windshield as we approach the Mexican border
As the car slows, we pan to follow the border official as he looks in briefly and waves us through
We continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting beside Man #2
- We're in the desert
There's nothing in any directions
Javi is implacable
Manolo understands what is happening
was going to feed them wrong information
Feed them lies to
it was for
The men say nothing
After a beat -- Don't tell Anna  died like this
Tell her it was something else
Tell her it was official business
Tell her that  died doing something honorable
Please, tell her that for me
- Javi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves
#1 Turn around
Javi hesitates before turning
We're on Javi as we hear the Javi doesn't flinch
Manolo's body falls into the grave
Javi stands there, waiting
#1 You got anything you want to say
Javi shakes his head
Finally, another
After a beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder
#1 Sorry about that
we had to be sure
They walk back to the
Are you sure you don't have anything to tell us
Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them
We hear a : - Arnie Metzger is in Helena's living room
The stereo is loudly playing
That was a stupid thing you did
Incredibly stupid
tried, Arnie
And,  will continue to try
Have you gone crazy
You are not Carl
You aren't as good as Carl
(beat) They are moving the trial to a high security location
The press has gone berserk
The jury will be influenced
Stay out of things
Let us try to win the case
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us
Helena steps closer to Arnie, close enough that her breasts are almost touching his chest
Helena, please
This is out of your hands
(softly) know  made things worse
know that and 'm sorry, but Arnie  need something from you
Something only you can help me with
Helena looks searchingly into his eyes
Helena -- need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers
can't do that
Helena leans closer to him
figured out what Carl was up to and  need your help
Will you help me
: - An establishing shot of a hi-tech company within shooting distance of the Salk Institute
- This is a professional chemical lab that can be rented by the month
Long tables of lab and computer equipment
Nobody has been here in a while
There are toys - plastic dolls, frisbees, hula hoops - on many of the tables
Helena lets herself into the room
She scans ledgers
She looks over the equipment
She picks up a twelve-inch high plastic Spastic Jack action figure and a can labeled "solvent" and hurries from the lab
: -  - Robert drives through the streets, searching for Caroline
He doesn't find her
- Barbara is waiting in the living room
Robert enters
He shakes his head then stands silently for a beat
About the other night, 'm sorry
Me, too
God,  don't get it
Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child
(beat) Why does this happen to someone
How does it happen
don't know
'  - Robert is standing in the middle of her room
He's not sure what he's looking for
Everywhere he looks: her personal things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures
Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his daughter has escalated into a search for clues
He opens her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves
He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her room
He tosses a stack of magazines
fashion magazine, airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the ground
Robert stares at the foil on the carpet
It's charred on the outside
He picks it up
And unfolds it
There's a dried milky white substance
He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them
Then, somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth
He holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud of smoke
Robert sucks all of it in
He waits a long time then exhales
His eyes shut
The tube drops from his mouth
He staggers and, overwhelmed by the sensations, sits on the bed
The lighter and foil fall from his hands
moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know where he is
He looks at the room, confused
He stumbles to the door and shuts it firmly behind him
: '  - Anna is weeping
Javier sits next to her
He puts his arm around her and she leans her head against his shoulder
'  - Javi drives through the streets of Tijuana
He brakes for a stop sign and watches, trance-like, the pedestrians crossing in front of him
As the intersection clears he remains still
from behind brings him back and he pulls forward passing Helena Ayala who crosses going the opposite direction
We stay with her
- Helena walks down a nightlife street that is tawdry and stale in the midday sun
- shrewd Obregon Lieutenant,  , 40, sits at a table opposite Helena
The Strange Man who both threatened Helena's child and executed Francisco sits in another chair
Mrs
Ayala
Thank you for coming
am Juan Marquez,  work for Mr
Obregon
believe you know my associate, "Tigrillo," the Little Tiger
Helena nods to Tigrillo -- Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son
(beat) was under the impression  would be meeting Juan Obregon
No, this is not possible
And thank you for coming down here, though suspect it's been a pointless journey
Why do you say that, Mr
Marquez
hear these stories
Your husband in jail
His business in chaos
Various people fighting over the scraps
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours
That is not true, Mrs
Ayala
Your route is compromised
Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California
don't think you're going to do that
You don't
Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt
Helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the Spastic Jack action figure
She puts it on the desk
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children
Are you aware of this
don't know
Perhaps  remember something
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr
Espastico Jacobo
That's nothing new
Not in
Juan Marquez is confused
This doll is cocaine
Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him
He bangs it on the desk
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine
Odorless
Undetectable by dogs
Undetectable by anyone
don't believe you
She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk
Get a bowl
-  - Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent
Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above the quicksand of milky glop
Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp
She is drying the paste
She puts the mirror on the desk
white substance has coagulated there
Try it
Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance into two white powder lines
He hands a silver straw to Helena
You first
'm six months pregnant
won't do it
Fine, then we don't have deal
Fine, then we don't have a deal
She stands
He watches her a beat, then smiles
Okay, okay
He leans down and quickly snorts a line
After a beat
That's good coke
It should be
It's yours
(beat) want our debt forgiven
want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States
And  want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed
Perhaps
Perhaps
'm afraid must first ask you to pass a test
asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors
Helena waits
Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls out a quarter kilo of cocaine
He pushes it across the desk
Take this back with you
Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal
That's crazy
My husband is on trial for smuggling
Exactly, and this is how  know 'm not getting into business with the Government
She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands
You will help me with my other problem
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego
And we have a deal
Tigrillo escorts her out of the room
- Helena follows Tigrillo
As they pass the restrooms she signals that she has to stop
- '  - Helena goes into a stall
She extracts the cocaine from her handbag
She looks at it, trying to figure out where it goes
She hikes up her skirt
: - Javier is hooked up to a polygraph machine watched closely by a
Hughes and Johnson watch as Javi talks into a tape recorder on the table
And  have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones
They change them every twenty-four hours but  have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within twelve
Javi finishes talking and sits back
Agent Hughes shuts off the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who nods approval
Hughes and Johnson exchange a look
They are dumbstruck
That's good shit
Now that you have what you want, let's talk about how  get what want
Oh, don't worry, Javier, you're not gonna have any problems there
want to take a minute and talk about what type of precautions you're taking to protect yourself
When Salazar and Madrigal go down, they might send someone to see you
You worry about getting me the things that  want
'll worry about myself
There's a beat
Javier seems discomfited
The two agents notice this and exchange looks
You should feel good about this
feel like a traitor
: - Javi goes into Mexico
Pan over to Helena's Mercedes
'  - She inches the car forward towards the officer who selects vehicles for inspection
The car ahead of her passes through and speeds away
The  flags Helena and directs her into the search facility
- Helena pulls into a search bay
watches Helena lower her window
Please step from the car, Ma'am
'm in a hurry -- Step from the car, Ma'am
This won't take long from your day
Helena gets out of her car
-   - There is a bank of video monitors showing the scenes all over the facility
: Helena's car is on a lift three feet off the ground
Officers pour over the inside and undercarriage of the Mercedes
Nearby,    sniffs at the items that have been removed from the car: bags, spare tire, cd boxes
- Customs  approach Helena -- Ma'am, we have to ask you to come with us
She follows them toward the Customs building
- accompanied by a female leads Helena into a sterile room where there is no place to hide anything
Ma'am, we have reason to believe you may have illegal drugs hidden beneath your clothing
need to conduct a pat down search
Supervisory Inspector Haig will witness the search
You've got to be kidding me
'm pregnant
What if  refuse
This pamphlet explains the law and your rights under it
You're welcome to read it first
It says we have the authority to conduct this search
Would you like to read it first or shall we proceed
- Hundreds of  , spouses, others stand around a grave in a leafy cemetery in working class San Diego
- The funeral is over and people are filing back to the cars
Gordon walks away from the service when he is approached by a mourning  , the mother of the deceased
Montel
Oh, Montel
Gordon hugs her
You know how much he cared about you
You do, don't you
Yes
know if he could have it back somehow, he wouldn't do it differently or have it any other way
He wouldn't
He loved his job
Another  hustles toward him from the other direction, the direction of the cars
Excuse me, Agent Gordon
Mrs
Castro
(to Gordon) Helena Ayala left Club Platinum in Tijuana
The Obregon Brothers' place
They stopped her at the border but she was clean
She's in San Diego now
Gordon runs for his car
: '  - Arnie sits in his office, spacing out, admiring his view when an  shows Helena in
As soon as the door shuts -- Did you get it
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that
You've compromised me and our relationship -- Helena sits confidently on his couch
(making fun of Arnie) The place is swept twice a day learned that down in Miami in '85
(hard) Arnie
'm the housewife
belong to the most exclusive country club in La Jolla that accepts Latinos
Until recently,  believed my husband imported hydroponic strawberries, which  donated at the school fair
Arnie reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a quarter- kilo baggy identical to the one Juan Obregon gave her in Tijuana
It's the same stuff
From the rainy day stash
It's the same
What happened to what they gave you
Helena puts the bag in her purse
'm desperate, but 'm not stupid
flushed it in the bathroom of their godawful nightclub
: '  - Robert sleeps in his clothes on top of the covers
Barbara is asleep beside him
The phone rings
Robert answers
Barbara watches
Hello
(
) 'm sorry
Did  wake you
Robert looks at Barbara and shakes his head
She gets up
No, it's all right
There's a beat
(
) Salazar's been taken down
He was working for Porfirio Madrigal
What
thought Madrigal was dead
thought it was verified
(
) Apparently not
Look, it's a shit storm here right now
When are you coming back
(beat) don't know what to tell people any more
'll get there as soon as  can
(
) If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now
(beat) Are you all right
(
) Robert
The tone in Barbara's voice causes him to look up
She holds an empty jewelry box
(to Sheridan) have to call you back
- The drawers and cabinets are open
Barbara and Robert assess what is missing
The silver wedding cup
- Robert looks at their home entertainment center
Barbara enters this room
My Leica's gone
So's the video camera
At least she's alive
Robert turns for the door
Where are you going
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour
Ten minutes after that she'll be at her dealer's
If  find him, maybe  find her
-    - The bored children of privilege, wearing their blazers or uniform grey skirts, stare at a  behind a desk
The door opens and Robert enters
He finds Seth Abrahms in the back of the class and walks straight to him
Robert grabs a fistful of shirt and tie
Hey man, what are you doing
(
) Excuse me
Excuse me
Robert yanks Seth out of his seat
The teacher is approaching
Seth has to be excused
He's going on a field trip
- Helena watches David play a video game
They have finished their lunch, a mess of pizza rinds
Come on
Time to go
The  tries to catch their attention with some mime, but they ignore him
- Helena and David are pushing out the door
The man walking the other way past them is Tigrillo from the Tijuana cartel
As they pass -- (under her breath) Women's room, stall two
(loud) Should we stop for ice-cream
Yeah
Tigrillo disappears into the restaurant
As Helena pulls out of the Fun Zone parking lot, an unmarked cruiser falls in behind her
: '  - Robert and Seth are parked across the street from Sketch's building
They watch people, mostly white people, get what they need
don't know, maybe we missed her
can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place
Hey man, back the fuck up
To this place
What's that shit
Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs
You know where  can get drugs
What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities
If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs
, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling
It's market forces, man
The product's marked up three hundred percent
You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day
You think white people would still be going to law school
There's a beat
You're starting to piss me off
Get out of the car
Robert and Seth get our of the car and walk across the street
- Robert and Seth stand in the dim, dingy hallway leaves
You're gonna get me killed
Robert shoves Seth toward the door
Seth knocks
The door opens a crack and Sketch's face appears
What do you want
Robert moves around Seth
'm looking for my daughter, Caroline
She comes here
This is a business
Get the fuck outta here
need to find my daughter
'll pay you
Sketch pulls a gun and shoves it against Robert's cheek
Who the fuck do you think you are
Where the fuck do you think you are
Why the fuck do you think  shouldn't just put you in a dumpster
have money -- got money
'll pay you a thousand dollars have it in my wallet
want your money, 'll take your money
Just tell me where she is
Sketch pushes Robert back into the hall
Sketch sees Seth lurking there
(to Seth) Don't do that shit again
Sketch slams the door in their face
Great
What a good idea
- Seth and Robert walk to the car
Man, 'm telling you
Don't do this vigilante thing
Either the cops find her or she'll call you promise
Robert looks at him, carefully
: '  - Javier  on the front door
There is no answer
The shades are drawn
The house is darkened
(calling out) Anna
Anna, please
Let me in
He  again
Come on
You can't stay locked in your house all day
Finally, the door cracks open
Anna has clearly not been out of the house since the last time we saw her
'  - Javier sits opposite Anna
know this is a tragedy, but you have to realize that good has come out of it
She looks at him
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice
He did a great thing for Tijuana
He did a great thing for Mexico
want to believe you
really do
You will believe me, because it's true
'  - Seth walks up the steps and into the building
beat later he reappears and continues down the street
Robert emerges from across the street and follows at a guarded distance
- Seth walks along the seedy neighborhood street
He approaches the Villa Elaine
He turns up the steps and disappears inside
Robert follows him
- Robert ascends the stairs
As he enters the hallway he sees Seth pounding on one of the doors
Open the door
Open the fucking door, man
'  comes from the other side of the door
Go away
Robert closes the distance
Seth pounds harder
know she's in there
Let me talk to her
don't know what you're talking about
Go away
Robert reaches the door
Seth sees him
know she's in there
Robert kicks the door in
- Robert sees a middle-aged  in his underwear and a dress shirt
Hey,  haven't touched her -- Caroline is passed out on the bed
Robert goes to her as the John scrambles for his clothes
She stirs and sees him -- (really out of it) Hi, Daddy
'  - Caroline rides in the passenger seat
She's come out of her stupor and is now filled with ebullience
It's gonna be great
mean, 'm okay and all, because, see,  met a guy, he's in this pretty famous band and
(gets up confessional courage) They've invited me to write lyrics for them, 'm gonna be able to do that and maybe sing, too
not at first, but later
Caroline gets lost in her grandiose vision
Robert looks over at her as she drifts off into a nod
moment later she's awake and rambling again
(sounding completely crazy) 've been doing research for the school paper, that's what 've been doing, like on assignment kind-of, 've seen some stuff you wouldn't believe, but 'm gonna write it all down into lyrics
They think 'm really good, everybody says so, what do you think
Robert fights back tears
He reaches over and takes his daughter's hand
: - Juan Marquez sits across the desk from Javi
Tigrillo and , 30's, are also in the meeting
Salazar and Madrigal are no longer with us
(beat) feat none of these people could get accomplished
Juan nods toward Pablo and Tigrillo
You're going to be made the Special Assistant to the new drug Czar, which makes you a very valuable law enforcement officer
(beat) hope you like to travel because we have plans for Juarez and El Paso, Nogales, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Michoacan
Javi just stares at him for a long moment, then looks off
: '    - Robert on the telephone
(into phone) How was she
'  - cramped, messy office at the Environmental Protection Agency
Barbara is on the phone
(into phone) 'm really not sure
She seemed to recognize it wasn't Serenity Oaks
It's a pretty hard-core facility, but at least we know where she is
(beat) Maybe it's what she needs now
He holds the phone and doesn't say anything
: - The court is searched carefully by a phalanx of
Metal Detectors are checked
Bomb sniffing German Shepherds are led through the space
- The agents are unkempt and everyone is tired
Ruiz moves through a cluttered room in a bathrobe with a cup of coffee
An agent shows him a morning paper -- Big day
(shows picture in paper) You're a star
Ruiz walks over and sits across from Gordon, switching off the radio show he's listening to
Gordon looks up from his paper
Go shower
You smell
There is a  on the front door
An  goes to answer -- Who is it
(
) (through the door) The Mafia
've got his breakfast
The agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray
He puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and eggs
An agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage
Ruiz stabs it with a fork -- Fuck off
Gordon watches the interchange -- Where's the love gone, Eddie
You'll be testifying for at least ten days
What if we stop feeding you
Ruiz begins to eat hungrily
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder
That thought makes me feel awful
Ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened
That my drugs had gone through
What would have been the harm
few people get high who are getting high anyway
Your partner is still alive
We avoid having breakfast together
Don't you see this means nothing
That your whole life is pointless
You're breaking my heart
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway
wish you could see how transparent you are
(disgusted) This food tastes like shit
So go shower already
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana
You're helping them
(beat) You work for a drug dealer too, Monty
Ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom
(yelling after him) And shave
You better look nice and believable for the jury
Ruiz disappears into the bathroom and slams the door behind him
(to another agent) It's like having another wife
The agent laughs
There's another  on the door
Who is it
(
) (though the door) Breakfast
Gordon and the agent look at each other
Hurry up
It's getting cold
Gordon moves to the side of the door and pulls his gun
The other agent opens the door
with a breakfast tray enters
Gordon puts the gun to the side of his head
'm on your side
God, you're jumpy
Gordon is momentarily confused, then goes for the bathroom door
Call an ambulance
Hurry
Gordon tries the bathroom door
It's stuck
He gets it open a crack
There's a body against the other side
He shoves
- Ruiz is on the floor in convulsions
(yelling) Call the ambulance
(to Ruiz) Don't die on me
You will not die on me
Do you hear me
Don't you die on me
Ruiz's convulsions get worse, his claw-like fingers scratch across the tile
: -   - The court is packed
Helena and Arnie watch from the gallery
The judge is at the bench
The prosecutor rises -- Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury
Because of the sudden death of Eduardo Ruiz, the people have decided that at this point we cannot continue our case against Carl Ayala
The court
Reporters scatter
Helena cheers
: - Robert Wakefield enters the office of the Chief of Staff, who looks up from what he's doing, which is reading Robert's report, and is already mid-sentence
Yeah, hi -- (waves Robert to a chair) So 've got a copy of your speech here
(glances down, still reading) It's fantastic
So, Robert, my genuine thanks
You're my choice and you're gonna be great
The President is sorry he hasn't been able to spend more time with you
After the press conference he wants to really sit down
(an afterthought) Oh,  got to the Post, too
Don't worry about that thing with your daughter, it's not news; they're willing to treat it as a family matter, a personal matter
(off Robert's stare) Look, even if it came out, we'd turn it into a qualification, 've been in the trenches of this Drug War, have seen the face of the enemy, etcetera
Robert just stares at him
: - General Salazar sits in the same grimy cell that housed Francisco Flores
He is sweating and his breathing is labored
enters and gives him an injection, explaining that it will calm him down
- It's a reprise of the earlier desert bust
a landing strip in the middle of nowhere, a plane landing, 's approaching
This time Javi is at the wheel of one of them
News crews are trailing behind him
- Javi and Special Agent Hughes stand next to a giant mound of seized cocaine, the same cocaine, in fact, Javi held briefly at the beginning
The same teenagers from the pickup truck have been arrested
The news crews get everything
(to the press) This seizure is one of the largest seizures in Mexican history
It represents the first bilateral effort of the American  and the Mexican - General Salazar lies on his side, eyes and mouth open
He is dead
Javier looks at him through the doorway
(
') Today 'm very proud to announce that Mexico, with the help of our American partners, is finally winning the war against narcotics trafficking
The  begins shouting questions -- : ,
-  - Robert and Javi walk through the headquarters, a nondescript government building
Robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila envelope
The crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911
" The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso
'm aware of that
So what's it doing in Tijuana
Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye
He shrugs
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence
It could mean that, yes
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power
It's possible
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels
Javi thinks along time before answering
Yeah, it's possible
if you're prepared to die
: - An outdoor party is going on
Children and adults arrive and mingle
Caterers work the barbecue grill
Waiters serve food and drink on the rolling lawn
Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends
She looks past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair van is parked
She turns back toward her guests
Somebody has raised a cup and everyone is
Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house
Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive
He grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter
He appears drunk
Montel follows Helena into the house
'   - Carl hears the  outside and the sound of
He makes a cellular telephone call
'  - Arnie is in his office and answers the cell phone -- (
) It's Saturday, Arnie
You work too hard
Carl, 'm running late
'm coming right now -- Behind Arnie in the office there is a movement of
'   - Carl stands at the window looking at his guests while he talks on the phone -- Don't bother
(
) What
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after  got arrested
(
) was just waiting for the right time
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news
(
) just didn't want to take a chance
didn't want to risk it
It could have been frozen along with everything else
You had it all figured out
You move into my house
You raise my kids
You sleep with my wife
It was a good plan, Arnie
(
) Carl, that's insane
So my wife is lying
(
) Carl, think about it, if  was trying to rip you off,  would have left town after Ruiz was killed wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal
On the front lawn  are lined up for the ice-cream sundae bar that is being tended by a
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because  don't think there is
(
) Carl -- Goodbye Arnie
'  - Arnie turns around and there are   in his office
'   - Carl hears   over the phone
He hangs up and turns from the window
Helena is standing there
Who was that
Arnie
He's not going to be able to make the barbecue
Carl and Helena share an embrace and a kiss
Come downstairs
Everyone is waiting
Carl and Helena turn to leave the room and Montel Gordon is standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne
Hello, Helena
What a great party
Who are you
Nobody
'm a nobody who arrested you, but your wife is a murderer
Gordon takes a sip of his drink
Two   appear in the doorway behind him
Hey, you can't be in here
'm a cop
don't care
(to the guards) Throw him out of here
The security officers grab Gordon
There is a scuffle
Gordon falls to the floor by the window
They are wrestling
As they wrestle, Gordon reaches out and, unnoticed, affixes underneath the desk
He continues to struggle with the guards
Helena and Carlos start from the room
(calling out) You didn't win, Helena
You lost everything
Tell your children a nice bedtime story
How you killed my partner
- The guests watch as the guards eject Gordon from the premises
Near the gate David has stopped playing to watch the action
Then he goes back to playing with his toy: a Spastic Jack figure
: -   - Javi and his convoy of armored 's pull up in front of the beautiful house where earlier he deposited Rosario, Salazar's former mistress
Javier opens the front door and Rosario greets him by throwing her arms around his neck
They disappear inside
: - The   stands at the familiar podium addressing the White House Press Corps
Robert Wakefield stands to one side with Chief of Staff, his lawyers, Sheridan and General Landry
a sterling reputation and close friend of the President, recently confirmed into The Office of National Drug Control Policy
our new Drug Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield
Applause from the assembled
The Press Secretary signals and Robert walks to the podium
He looks back to the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and television lights and camera flashes
(reading his prepared speech) The War on Drugs is a war on our nation's most precious resource
our children
Sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority number one
(beat) There has been progress and there have been failures, but where we have fallen short  see not a problem but an opportunity
Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy
He glances at the Chief of Staff who bores into him
He looks again at his speech
With great effort he continues
An opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future
(a long, uncomfortable beat) This takes not only new ideas, but perseverance
This takes not only resources, but courage
This takes not only government, but families
Robert stops again as though the words are choking him
've
've outlined a ten-point plan, representing a new bilateral effort
He can't finish
Everyone stares at Robert
The crowd of reporters senses something is wrong
can't do this
(beat) If there is a War on Drugs then our own families have become the enemy
How can you wage war on your own family
He walks out of the room
The crowd waits, expecting him to return
Robert walks down a corridor and out of the White House
- beautiful spring morning
He walks down to Pennsylvania Avenue
He hails a cab and gets in
The cab pulls away
- twelve step meeting is in progress
Caroline shares from her seat
On the good days  feel like  get it, like it all makes sense
can stay in the moment
don't have to control everything in the future
And  believe everything is going to work out fine
(beat) On the bad days,  just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers
want to pull my hair and run through the streets screaming
(beat) But, thanks to the people 've met in these rooms, people like Margaret and Jim and Sarah, people who've taught me how to listen, 'm pretty sure 'll make it through today
Caroline is finished sharing
(
) Would you like to share
We pan over to reveal Robert and Barbara sitting next to Caroline
My name is Robert
This is my wife, Barbara
We're Caroline's parents
We're just hear to listen
: - The house is dark and silent
The van is parked up the street
- Gordon listens through a headset, his expression set
(
) (over a listening device) We're back up and running
Completely untouchable
Completely
: -  - bank of lights  on
Then  and
In a wider shot we see an illuminated baseball field where a children's pickup game is in progress
In the crowd, Javi serenely watches the game
