) My missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the Hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in Christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing
They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land
Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing
Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction

Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves
Are they nuts
How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating

Paradise
Paradise can go fuck itself
Matt looks up at the  we saw in the speedboat, now lying stiffly on an upright  , her head cocked to one side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her trachea, IVs in her arm
(
) (') This is Elizabeth King, my wife
Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned
Now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma
Liz is very competitive
Whatever she does, she does to the fullest

She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent
Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented

Then  have a decision to make

Hayashi and school counselor
We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates
Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents
Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but  had no idea -- can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself
Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time

And her sister's away at school on the Big Island
don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children
Mr
King, we see this every day -- children acting out at school when something's wrong at home
And your family is facing a devastating crisis
Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on
Encouraging her to express her feelings
That's crucial
(No) Oh, yeah
Yeah
Absolutely

The ladies glance between Scottie and Matt, wondering when, or whether, he'll intervene

What's the matter with you
Showing those pictures of Mom for your art project
'm a photographer, Dad, a real photographer
No, you're not
You're overdoing it is what you're doing
saw it in a book
Some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying, and they're considered art
That's what 'm doing
First of all, your mother's very sick, but she's not dying
Second, you don't share personal stuff like that with strangers
What's going on with Mom is private
'm hungry
Can we get burgers
No
Can we get smoothies
No
As Scottie continues -- (
) (') The last time  took care of Scottie by myself was when she was one
Now she's ten, and  have no idea what goes on inside her head
She's insane
And with Elizabeth in the hospital,  think she's testing me

wish you'd stop doing that
And rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her
'm tired of asking you
You heard Dr
Johnston -- people in a coma can hear you -- you know, well, some of them can
It lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner
And it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through -- you know, make you feel better
don't know what to say
Tell her a story
don't have a story
Tell her anything
Tell her what's been going on in school
She never cares about that
don't believe that
What about after school
She's always driving you around the island
You know, gymnastics

Nope
If you're not going to say anything to your mother, we might as well leave

How about this
Write her a letter
What would  write
don't know
"Get well
Wake up love you

She's in a coma
Goddammit, Scottie, stop fighting me on everything
But it doesn't make any sense
You know what your mother is hearing right now
You refusing to talk to her
Is that what you want

And 'm thirsty

For instance

"We all know you grew pubes over the summer

And you're really, really sorry, right
Scottie makes a big exaggerated nod

She's going to keep doing it

No, she won't
It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself
It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right

Hard to say
Could be a few days

Last time  was at your house, must have been 200 people
If you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now
By the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel
'm so sorry, Matt

They're playing  for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is - to Liz's face
After cheery greetings -- What're you doing
Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush
know she'll grill me
Matt and Mark exchange a look -- "Girls
" And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip

Oh, and Matt, on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge, all ready to nuke
Matt smiles -- he'd been expecting a grim moment alone with Elizabeth, but instead he finds a room full of warmth and life
Even if it's a little creepy
So what's the latest anyway, Matt
Any updates
No, no
Just more of the same -- monitoring the swelling, keeping her                        * kidneys and other vitals working, you                       * know, hoping for the best

Why is it called a jellyfish
It's not a fish, and it's not jelly
No idea
You ask good questions
You're getting too smart for me, Scottie
'm going to find out
Then 'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows
Do you think she's going to know everything she used to know
Matt notices a   and some  headed to a nearby table, and his mood sours
Scottie follows his gaze
The guy notices the Kings and feels obliged to mosey over
This is   -- athletic and rich
Hi, Matt
Hi, Scottie
Troy
(to his friends) 'll catch up to you guys in a second
Matt stares so intensely that Troy averts his gaze

'm praying for her every day, you guys
Really hard
Seriously
So what  was saying was, when  was there,  talked to her, and her hand moved, so  was pretty encouraged thought that was an encouraging sign
Scottie looks up hopefully
Matt notices
That's enough
really think she heard me
Look, Troy, go to your friends
No hard feelings
Let's just leave it alone
Troy walks away, stops, turns back
told you, Matt, there were lots of chops and holes that day
told you a hundred times
Ask anybody
What happened to her could have happened to me
It was a super-hard day on the water
You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy
She was supposed to be driving
She wanted me to drive
And she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn
And just your whole attitude toward me, Matt -- mean,  feel terrible
wish it were me and not her
Plus  almost drowned myself when we capsized
And my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and 'm going to miss Moloka'i
Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy
Mom twitches at weird times

Matt follows, not even gracing Troy with a final look

Hey, sport, don't pay any attention to that guy
That guy's a dope
hate him
Yeah
didn't mean to say dead chicken
don't want Mom to die
know,  know
Hey, let's get out of here
Let's go do something crazy
Like let's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister
What do you say
Right now
It'll be fun
She's not expecting us or anything

Which door
Which door is it
Scottie, keep it down
Will you both keep it down
It's around the corner
They turn down another corridor, and Scottie knocks on a door

The door opens, and a girl pokes her head out

Hi, Alex
It's me, Scottie

You know,  pay $25,000 year for this crap not to happen
Alex
Dad
(laughing, to Emily) My fucking dad is here
This cracks her up even more
Scottie laughs too, though she's unsure why
You don't talk like that here
This is unacceptable behavior

You come out to play a few holes with us
We came to get you so you can come home

You need to come home and see Mom

Good morning

Now that we get a closer look, we might recognize Alexandra from the postcards at the hospital
We also see a resemblance to her mother
How are you feeling
Shrugging, she plops down near Scottie

Why am  not surprised
don't know where to start, and we probably shouldn't in front of Scottie
don't mind

That's part of why  brought you here
You have to help me

Alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side and props herself on the edge, floating her lower body
Matt lowers himself into the water too
Maybe if you spent more time with her, she wouldn't act like such a complete spaz
Get her out of town -- go camp on Kaua'i
That's what mom did with me whenever  was losing it
Listen, Alex, your mother isn't well
Obviously
They just told me she isn't going to wake up

just found out yesterday
We have to go through this thing together, you and Scottie and
And  need to go around and tell people what's happening -- our family and close friends
Sometimes 'll want you to come with me
Other times  need you to watch Scottie
You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom's going to die

Breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions
How depressing is that going to be
Just call them
Alex, nobody wants to do any of this
But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu, a few friends

But then the accident happened, and  was waiting until she woke up,  guess
And you, you didn't even suspect
Right

Caught her with some guy
What does that mean
Brandy and  were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house

Me
It's work that's totally unnecessary
You don't have to do anything
Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail
We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out
It's more fun that way, anyway
As they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life

Matt sits on the sand, glancing occasionally back toward the cottage
Next to him lie his daughters and Sid
Suddenly   -- Brian's kids -- come running through the hedge and past Matt on their way into the water
Matt turns around to see Brian's wife   dutifully trailing behind
Stay in the zone, please

No such luck

Matt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casually toward Mrs
Speer, maintaining a comfortable distance
Alexandra watches

Speer and pretends to look out at the water, just hanging out
Mrs
Speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys

Yeah
Must keep you pretty busy
They're pretty non-stop, but they're at a really fun age

Their, uh, their mother is in the hospital, so thought 'd give them a little break
Oh, no
She'll be fine
What's wrong
If you don't mind my asking
Just a little boating accident
Hit her head a little too hard
Does Julie recognize any of this, or even recognize him
Doesn't seem like it

Or one with a motor
(laughs, then --) One with a motor
She's actually sort of charming, this Julie Speer
Well, good luck with that

Barney, an old-fashioned for my cousin here
Nice to see you, Matt
How you been otherwise
Not much otherwise
Between our business and the hospital, you know, 've just trying to keep my head above water
So listen,  see you have some people staying in the cottage
Oh, hey, Mattie, if 'd known you were coming,  coulda -- No, no, no, 'm just wondering about the guy you're renting to

Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a- bitch
He's Lou's sister's
No, wait
Lou has a sister, and the sister's husband
Lou's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy

Determined son-of- a-bitch
Anyway, the point is the guy we're doing business with is that guy's brother-in-law
Works for him
Brian Speer
That's the guy
What do you mean, the guy we're doing business with
Who do you think
Don Holitzer
Holitzer
That's what 'm saying
That's Don's brother-in-law in the cottage
You don't know him
would have thought you'd know him
He's a realtor over by you
So if we sell to Don -- and that's what we're going to do, right
That's what you want too
Nice guy, Don
He'll do right by us
Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that -- Yeah, yeah -- He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions

Big score for that guy

Not much
He's lucky
The bugga's lucky
His sister is married to the guy
Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions

Cousin Hugh's eyes emerge momentarily from their drunken fog to give Matt a firm, steely warning

No,  know

Okay

Good to see you, Hugh
You too
See you at the meeting

The music grows more frenetic
Matt looks around the room, alienated from everything -- from the fried food and the tourists, from the umbrellas in the drinks, from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin called Sid
Why can't a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now

Alex walks with her father
So, guess what
Turns out Brian Speer is connected to Don Holitzer
Who's Don Holitzer
The guy we're going to sell to
And that woman today at the beach
That was his wife
Whose wife
(then --) The hottie with the hat
You sure
(off his nod) So he's married
Nice
Why didn't you say anything

Why would she go for him

You understand
Julie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex
Here we go

Please don't tell me you're talking about business
We're talking about love
That's nice
Brian, call the boys in for dinner
They're fine
Let them play a while longer
They all stand there a moment
Matt's unsure how to play this out
He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling
Awesome cottage you're renting
Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental
Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s
Haven't been inside in years
Come on

Here it is

For a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did just want a tour of the house
can't do this
Neither can
How did you meet

Matt leans in, but instead of going for her cheek, he kisses her

It's an octopus
Such a funny creature with its eight legs
But did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats
They have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms
'm sure you know about the ink sac
She uses ink to confuse her predators
She can camouflage herself
She can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt
The reason Dr
Johnston invited me here today is to meet you, Scottie
've heard a lot about you

Dad, is that true
Yes, Scottie
It's true
You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you

Dr
Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving
Scottie is left holding the octopus
She drops it, and it squeaks a little
What the fuck was that
Yes, well, they say she's very good one- on-one
So Mom's going to die for sure
Yes
We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and  agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma
Do you know what that means
It means she doesn't have a brain anymore
Not exactly, but
yes, that's the general idea
So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened
That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore
It's for the best, Scottie
Look at her
She's not happy like this
The purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now

Scottie is in a sort of trance
Come here, Scottie
Scottie goes to her sister, who takes her in her arms
Do eyeballs burn
Hey, Scottie
Don't think about stuff like that

-                                      115 Matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil

Checking the caller  --   -- he opts not to answer
The door opens, and Elizabeth's brother accompanies his parents Scott and Alice into the room
Here we are
(to Scottie) Hi, Bingo
Alex
Cheerful Alice doesn't really get what's going on
An emotional Barry hugs Matt and the girls
(') (eyeing Sid) There you are again
Matt and Alex maneuver seats for the Thorsons to sit near the bed
Barry gets his mother situated, then takes a seat himself
Remaining on his feet, old Scott surveys his daughter from a distance
(') So what did you decide
There's not much left to decide
We're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she's comfortable
mean what did you decide about the buyer
Who's your buyer
Even Sid and his daughters perk up at this question
Matt is taken aback
(') How much are you getting
Dad, 'm sure you'll be able to read about it in the paper
don't need to read about it
can hear about it right now

It's not the time for that
All the same to you,  guess million here, a million there
Just ironic, that's all -- Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune
She gave you everything, Matt
good, happy home, two beautiful daughters
Matt looks to Barry for help, but Barry's silence and sheepish look imply he buys into his father's propaganda
Scott, what's your point
She wanted her own boat
She should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with
She wasn't even driving
Her boat, someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have made any difference
You're not going to blame me for this
Sure, sure, quibble about the details
She was a faithful, devoted wife
She deserved more
Why fight it
You're right
She deserved more
For Christ's sake, take it easy on the man
Scott turns to Sid like he's about to pop him again
My father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances
His point made, Scott looks at Matt and the girls and shuffles to Elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on Alice's shoulder

No, Mom
Not yet
(gesturing toward the door) Girls, Sid
Matt, Sid and the girls quietly go into -- 116
-                                   116 -- where they take a few steps away
Man, that guy's a prick
Was he always like that
Yep
Scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the door
Noticing, the others join her
-- As Barry and Alice remain seated, their backs to us, Scott stands above his daughter, touching her arm, eyes closed
Is he praying
No
(opening his eyes) Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice
Oh
Goodbye, Elizabeth
The old man puts his hand over his mouth and squeezes his eyes shut
Then he opens his eyes and places a hand on her forehead, smooths her hair back
-- Matt and his daughters watch without moving

The only sound is the tick-tock of an old clock reading 3:20
Then he gets up and starts pacing, shooting occasional glances at the and  atop his desk

He notices old

Like everywhere in Hawai'i, the nature here is powerful -- , ,

-- Matt alone

We recognize some faces
-- Amid drinks held aloft, a  is passed among the cousins into which the each places a folded
Matt sits watching the proceedings with Cousin Hugh, Cousin Six and another   at a table piled with papers and contracts
Elizabeth's not doing well
She'll be okay
She's a fighter

She's dying
We took her off the machines
-- Matt, Hugh and Six    while others mill about, mingle, drink -- an early celebration for all except for a group of  off to one side
Well, no surprise
Other than the holdouts who don't want to sell at all, it's Don Holitzer
Chicago group a distant second
Feels good
We're doing the right thing, Mattie
At least there ain't going to be any Wal-Mart
Now it's your call, and we're all behind you, most of us anyway
(handing him a pen) Go ahead, Captain
Make it official
It's strange, that's all
What's strange
We didn't do anything to own that land
It was entrusted to us
And now we're just
Hugh and Six exchange a concerned look
For a moment we go on Matt's eyes
Then -- (') can't do it
won't do it
'm not going to sign
What're you doing, Matt
mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us
It's over
If we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves
Just sign, go to your wife, done

want to keep it
For Christ's sake
We can't move without your approval
And we don't want to
Hugh tries forcing Matt's hand
Matt resists
Your head's not right, Mattie
Your head's not right
You want a couple days to think it over
Take a couple days
don't need a couple days
have the authority, and this is what  want haven't wanted something in a long time
We have other businesses we're converting to corporations
We can figure it out
But it's utterly unproductive land
It doesn't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes
You're the trustee
You know better than anyone we only have seven years left
Then  have seven years to figure out how to keep it
Cousin Hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then back at Matt
We'll come after you
Just because you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you
But nobody wants to do that
We're family

sign that document, it's over
End of the line
Something that was ours to protect will be gone
Even though we're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and can't even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian, we still carry Hawaiian blood, and we're still tied to this land
And our children are tied to this land
It's a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason 150 years ago, we own this much of
paradise, but we do
And for whatever bullshit reason now, 'm the trustee
And 'm not signing
And if you sue me, it'll only make us closer
Cousin Hugh releases a long breath more like a belch, quickly picks his nose, exchanges a look with Cousin Six
Then he brings his fingers to his mouth to
All right, everybody, listen up
Cousin Mattie has an announcement
Get ready
Rising to his feet, Matt scans the faces of his relatives

Scottie snoozes on the little sofa
We may notice that Elizabeth is even more shrunken
is followed by -- appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by thin bronzed arms
It's
Julie
What are you doing here
He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers
She nods to the girls
know we just met, but  was thinking about you guys these past few days, and knew your mom was here
don't know
just felt  should stop by

This is Scottie
Sid
This is Mrs
Speer
Julie
Were you friends with my mom
No, we never met
But  know a lot about her
As they now do often, Matt and Alex exchange a look
Well, we appreciate your coming by
The flowers are lovely
(heading to the door) Scottie, Alex
Let's go to the cafeteria
The girls follow Sid's prompt, leaving Matt alone with Julie, standing, a dying woman between them
, uh, 'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon
Any minute, really
That's sort of why we're all here
know
That's why  came
Because know
came because my husband wouldn't
And that just didn't seem right
thought someone from my family should come
Wow
'm sorry  came to your house like that
Just barged in on you
It's all right
assume you're angry
Of course you are
'm angry too

After you left that night, he was acting really weird
Then  started smelling it all over him
'd already smelled it
You're a woman
finally got it out of him
We've been going crazy ever since
Not easy with the kids around
It's all something  never could have imagined
And then your family's decision about the land
think you're doing the right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's all so complicated and confusing
know
Brian told me everything
Well, how can  ever know it's everything
When did you find out
Have you known for a while
Just a few days ago
'm angry, but 'm just so sorry can't imagine what you're going through
Do you mind if  say something to her
Matt is unsure but what else can he do
Julie approaches the bed
(') Elizabeth, 'm Julie
Brian's wife just want to say  forgive you forgive you for trying to take Brian
forgive you for almost destroying my family
have to forgive you
Even though  want to hate you

All right
That's enough, Julie
think
think that's enough
Matt walks to the door and opens it
Alex and Sid -- who've clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away, unnoticed by Matt and Julie
(') He didn't love her
Just so you know
He didn't really love her
That's why 'm here
Julie heads to the door
At the door, she looks at Matt
Matt looks at her
She leaves
Matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly that this is his moment
He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her hair
He says something to her as though silently praying, then realizes he should say it aloud
He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach
Goodbye, Elizabeth
Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

She walks slowly toward -- -- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid
Matt and Sid rise to comfort her, but she's not in the mood
She allows them each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie
Signaling to Matt to let her do this, Alex escorts a fearful Scottie toward Elizabeth's room, and, reassuring her, guides her little sister inside
Matt and Sid are left alone
