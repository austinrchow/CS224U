strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk
The passenger, ', in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up
The rest of him is covered by a blanket
He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head
(
) Mark 'Brien has been going to Berkeley since 1978
That's 'Brien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week
The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus
Passers-by just go about their normal business
(
) He had polio when he was 6 years old
The disease left his body crippled but his mind remained sharp and alert, and since he wanted to be a writer, Mark 'Brien entered Cal to major in English and learn his trade
We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark in his contraption
(
) Graduation Today  hear the crowd's applause Receive congratulations from my friends Today  ask if 've found a place among the rest hope you see a man upon this stage Who studied
read
wrote, and passed the test In cap and gown, diploma on my chair to the interior of a large auditorium graduation ceremony is in progress
Suddenly, everyone in the hall, , their ,  and , rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles
1A
(
) And so, Mark 'Brien graduates from Cal, one of 250 English majors to receive degrees today
2
The  steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a diploma on his blanket
The gurney makes its way across the rest of the stage to thunderous applause
to the campus exterior
The news reporter talks to camera
If this report tells us anything, it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap
In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered round him in a jubilant mood
(') Mark 'Brien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles

: "   " ' 2                                                                     2 It is about 4
00 a
m
All is quiet
We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment
It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window
' 3                                                                     3 The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially
As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by
In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie
human head protrudes from one end
The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark 'Brien, breathing
Every 4
5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air
He is fast asleep
2A
(
) Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean
Teasing me with its nearness and immensity
And all  get is a thin stream of it
finger's width of the rope that ties me to life
Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung
3
It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length
Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body
Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches
He opens his eyes and grimaces
Shit
His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the terrible itching
He shakes his head violently, then stops suddenly and closes his eyes
We hear his thoughts
(
) (') Okay, just focus
Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind
After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down
It seems to have worked
In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room
The first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains
They illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall
Mark acknowledges it
(') Good morning
Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred
' 4                                                                 4 , a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to Mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets herself in
' 5                                                                 5 She comes in
Good morning
Mark does not immediately acknowledge her
You're late
The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a bed bath
He is frail and helpless
4
There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least temporarily
(
) Joan swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about
You polios are screamers
Always were
" didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge
In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an involuntary erection
Joan gives him a shriveling look
He feels belittled and humiliated
Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning up a bright red shirt
It is an awkward business
They do it in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible
' 6                                                                 6 Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly different from the one in the news clip
There are no mirrors and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece just next to Mark's mouth
Most of him is covered with a colorful blanket
The whole thing is a sports-coupe version of his iron lung
Would you mind if  asked you a favor
You need help moving furniture
She has no apparent sense of humor
need an advance on my pay, like two weeks
That's not a big ask, is it
Mark looks rightfully shocked
What if you don't last another two weeks
4A
He gives her a look, and means it
We hear his thoughts
(
) (') Joan never failed to put me in a crappy mood
It was also a drag that  was no longer allowed to use my other gurney, the self-propelled one
It had caused a couple of spectacular accidents
They turn a corner and approach a church
5
(
) (') Basically, in spite of all the mirrors,  couldn't see where  was going

6A Joan pushes Mark's gurney into the sanctuary
7                                                                 7 is giving a sermon
Mark listens with satisfaction
There are not many others there
The Apostle Luke tells us that when Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby in her womb leapt - "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy"
So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose
Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary
"Blessed art thou among women"
Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St
John, felt the power of this wondrous woman
It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour"
May the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always
Mass is over
come up to Mark and place a hand on his head or chest and say, "God bless you
" In the background we can also hear Father Brendan
(
) (') May the peace of the Lord be with you
And also with you

7A Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church
He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows
The expression on Mark's face is that of a true believer
(
) 'm definitely a true believer
But believe in a God with a sense of humor
wicked sense of humor
One who created me in His own image
Father Brendan enters
There is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands
For no good reason, he nods instead
Hello
'm Father Brendan
don't think we've met
6
No, we haven't
'm Mark 'Brien knew Father Seamus very well
'm sorry that he's not here any more
As are many others
'm going to do my best to fill his shoes understand you'd like me to hear your confession
Yes,  would
By the way,  enjoyed Mass
liked your tone
Father Brendan is not sure how to take this
Thank you
You don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you
No,  do not
believe sincerity is the most essential part
told my attendant to come back in half an hour
Is that okay
Yes, take your time
'm in no rush
Did Father Seamus say anything to you about me
No one said anything to me about you
can be a bit time consuming, but 'm worth the trouble
Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time
'm here for you Mark
7
Look, this is not exactly a confession
haven't yet done the deed
was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance
Father Brendan sits down
Tell me what's on your mind
The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan
'm thinking of getting rid of her
It's an evil thought, but  can't help it
Is she dishonest, or incompetent
No, neither of those
She looks at me the wrong way
It's that you- need-me-more-than--need-you look
'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me
Is that a sin, Father
Well, it obviously troubles you
Yes, it troubles me a lot
Because maybe it's really a power trip
Me against her
Me against the world
really wouldn't worry too much about that
The question is whether you like having her around
can't stand her
Then get rid of her
If  were in a position to choose, 'd get someone nice
Even it was a power trip
Then  have your blessing to fire her
8
Unofficially, yes
That's good enough for me
Please, if ever you feel  can be useful, do let me know
It was a pleasure talking with you
Same here
' 8                                                                     8 We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping the keys on an electric typewriter
At the other end of the stick, which is about a foot long, is Mark, manipulating it adeptly with his mouth
There is a white index card in the typewriter on which he is typing a job notice
We see the first word
"" 9                                                                     9 community notice board
young female hand reaches in and takes an index card off the board
The card reads: / We see Amanda's face as she smiles
She is in her early 20s
(
) Amanda would have been a pretty girl to touch, to hold, to kiss, to take to bed
10                                                         10 ' 11                                                                11 Mark is in his iron lung
Amanda sits in a stiff chair a few feet away, being interviewed
Rod is working in the kitchen
Mark's poem continues
9
(
) Her perfect, pale skin, Her Tudor court face Her strong, fleshy legs Drove me into ecstasies of despair
Mark asks a question
Do you have any experience
No, none at all
That sounds perfect
Mark stares at her lovingly
' 12                                                                 12 From Mark's , Amanda slides him out of the iron lung
It is her first time, and it is an awkward business
How long can you stay out
Three or four hours
Depends whether 'm having fun
12A
'
12A It is some time later
Amanda is giving Mark a massage
With enormous satisfaction, he feels her curvy parts moving around him and sometimes pressing against him
He also gets a bird's eye view of her breasts
(
) She'd count in French before lifting me, un, deux, trois, quatre
'd scream Tugged by her athletic arms From the everlasting gravity
14                                                                 14 Mark, on a blanket, is on an outing with Amanda, Matt and another
They are playing Scrabble
9A
(
) She took me on a picnic once, With her boyfriend and another couple
Lust crackled in the air between those twentyish people
Amanda is clearly paying more attention to Mark than to Matt
(
) What did the boyfriend think
That  was in his way
'm always in somebody's way, thought, the sun in my eyes
10
We sense Mark's deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and the sun warms his face
(
) As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence
13                                                             13 Amanda and her boyfriend , are sharing the tub
Do you touch him
do everything
Any other questions
You don't have to be so defensive
'm not about to get jealous
Why not
He's a much nicer person than you are
She gets out of the bath suddenly
' 15                                                             15 Amanda is shaving Mark
What does your boyfriend think of me
He's an asshole
It doesn't matter what he thinks of you
'm interested in the opinion of an asshole
He thinks you're some kind of Svengali, and that you're going to hypnotise me into your cult
He's right
11
He says he can already see changes
She finishes shaving him and cleans him up
His eyes feast on every detail of her face
Cut to somewhere at night, Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror- ball lighting
(
) So with her gentle fearless heart She took me in
thrived in her garden And wanted more
A16
A16 Amanda wheels Mark towards a clothing store
16                                                                 16 Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store, stopping from time to time to take something down from the shelf
She picks out a shirt
This you must have
As she leans over to show it to him, Mark doesn't seem to be listening
He whispers to her
love you
She says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts the shirt back
They continue round the store in thoughtful silence and avoid eye contact with each other
We sense from the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a beautiful friendship
17                                                          17 18                                                                 18 Mark and Father Brendan are huddled together in the little chapel
Did she reciprocate your feelings
She didn't seem to
11A
Sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions
12
Well, in case she didn't get it the first time,  told her again that was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things
Did it
Yes
She left
They sit in silence for a while
Father Brendan seems to be at something of a loss
wish  knew what to say
mean, welcome to the human race
Every day someone breaks someone else's heart
And as  said, 'm here for you
just wish  had something more useful to offer
All  have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with
Have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist
Not as yet
Father,  think  need a hug
After a moment of surprise, Father Brendan rises to the occasion
He seems to know how to move Mark gently and efficiently
They hug
' 19                                                               19 Rod is in the front yard picking up the newspaper
He sees , Chinese, mid-20s, a sensible type, approaching Mark's front door
Hi
Vera
Yes
He offers his hand
13
'm Rod
do four to twelve

Have you had any experience
Some
She is reserved and unsmiling
Mark seems disinterested in the whole process
The phone rings
They both look at it
Would you get that, please
Vera picks up the phone and answers a little hesitantly
Hullo
After a few moments, she turns to Mark
(') It's Sandy, from Pacific News Service
Could you press that button and put it on the speakerphone
She does as she is asked with perfect efficiency
(') Hi, Sandy
(
) Hi, Mark, how you doing
'm good
have a new attendant
She answered the phone
Her name's Vera
(
) Welcome, Vera
Thank you
14
(
) Mark, we've gotten sponsorships to do a series on sex and the disabled and we'd like you to do some interviews in the Berkeley area
Could you do that
Say in the next week or so
Mark is momentarily taken aback
Why now
(
) No particular reason
If you're working on something else, then we can talk about it later
No, now is fine
' 21                                                                21 Vera wheels Mark towards his first interview
The more we see Vera, the more we like her
(
) There was no denying it
door had opened which  could not close, and in invisible writing it said: "Do not enter"
' 22                                                                22 We see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette recorder
We hear a female voice
(
) Some positions, like that one, are pretty much impossible
Carmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair
She is pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands
don't know if you can quite visualize it
It's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow- girl
It is obvious that Mark cannot visualize it
Although she doesn't give much away, we sense that Vera can
14A
(') Don't worry about it then
It's just a question of depth of penetration
() 15
(') To some people it's really important, like my partner, for example
It's not such a big deal for me
get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it
Mark looks troubled
(') think the tape's about to run out
At that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out
Vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and takes her place again behind Mark's gurney
(') Do you want to keep going
Uh,  think 've actually got enough to work on
Thanks
Get back to me if you need anything else
Oh, and let me give you Greg's phone number
He's full of stuff you wouldn't think was possible
' 23                                                                23 Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter
Mark looks troubled
23A
'
23A We hear voices
(
) Okay, shall we start
(
) Sure
We hear the cassette recorder click on
23B
'
23B Greg is a handsome quadriplegic
Vera is there with Mark
16
Oral sex is a matter of taste
Mark doesn't get it
Vera, as usual, is impassive
(') And one thing that really works in my favor is that  smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded
This gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department, and stamina is key in cunnilingus
' 24                                                               24 The alley cat creeps in through the open window
Mark watches it approach from his iron lung
Who are these people
feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters
The cat seems to understand
25                                                               25 lady with a crisp voice answers the phone
(
) Good morning
On the other end of the line, Mark tries to control the shakiness of his voice
(
) Uh, may  please speak to someone in the Center on Sexuality and Disability, please
pause
(
) 'm sorry sir, the Center on Sexuality and Disability has been shut down
' 26                                                               26 Mark looks immensely relieved
He closes his eyes
17
Thank God
(
) Sir
'm sorry to have bothered you
(
) It's no bother
Sir, before you go,  can give you a phone number for one of the therapists who used to work there
Would you like that
Mark hesitates
He winces under the strain of having to make a decision
(
) Sir, are you there
27                                                        27 28                                                               28 29                                                               29 It is a typical, modern, multi-purpose office building
We hear the sounds of grunting, bumping and clanging
30                                                               30 There is something of a commotion going on at one of the elevators
Vera, and a small, well-meaning , are trying to get Mark and his gurney inside
It will not fit horizontally
As they angle it up, Mark begins to panic
It won't fit
It's not going to fit
Let's go back
muscular  guy reassures him
Hey, it's fine
We got you
This is going to work just fine
Vera guides him
The top has to go over to the left
17A
don't feel so good about this
Let's forget it
The Latino guy takes no notice
Vera is flushed and angry
18
Look, do you want to see this woman or not
No
One more heave and the gurney goes in with a jolt
(') Aah
Well, it's too late
The elevator doors close
' 31                                                             31 Laura, a well-dressed, attractive woman in her late 30s, sits in a chair a few feet from Mark
His gurney takes up most of the available space in the room
Did you ever discuss sex with your parents
No
That would have been unthinkable
Why
That's the way they saw the world
It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex
No-one did
It was never discussed
As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there
Laura listens
She is pretty in a dark, angular way
phone on her desk rings
Sorry about that
She walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back
She has a noticeable limp
What's that from
Cerebral palsy
19
You'd hardly notice
People notice
It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic
find that hard to believe in your case
Well, you better believe it
So, what sort of chance do you give me
Of achieving your romantic fantasy
Very small to minute
Look, there's no need to pull any punches
You can be as direct as you like with me
She smiles
Mark, 'm just a humble sex therapist
try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed
Your problem, understand, is that you have never had sex
That's correct
Would  be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate
Correct
Has anyone done it for you
No
Have you ever asked anyone
20
Not specifically
asked someone to marry me
She declined
Does that come close to masturbation
You know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually
There are people called sex surrogates
Oh
Psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea
Sex surrogates don't have that limitation
Would this be covered by my medical benefits
Unfortunately, no
You'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was
So, basically,  would be paying for sex
Yes Mark, you would be paying for sex
But the person you would be paying is not a hooker
She is a highly trained and sensitive professional, who is not motivated by money
Just as 'm not
In fact, you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me
Do  seem like a hooker to you
Mark thinks
31A                                             31A 21
31B
'
31B Mark comes back to reality
What sort of cost would  be looking at
It depends how many sessions you need
Say, one, just to try it and see if like it
'm sorry, it doesn't work that way
It's a process
You have to be patient with yourself
There can be quite a lot of talking involved
've set aside $500
Do you think that would cover things
Oh yes, that's ample
So, what do you think

33                                                                33 Mark waits in the little side chapel
Father Brendan enters
Hi, good to see you
How are things
Things are sort of confusing at the moment
would appreciate your advice, as a friend, if you know what  mean
Father Brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to Mark
Sure, and  understand what you mean
Do you remember at one point you suggested  might see a therapist
Yes
Well, one way or another, it's a long story,  ended up seeing a therapist, a particular sort of therapist, a sex therapist
Uh-huh
My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan
Sometimes  ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant
() 23
(') All  feel is shame and mortification, while other men, apparently, get pleasure
'm sorry if  sound angry
Don't worry about it
Go on
Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece, then goes on
This therapist suggested  could work with a sexual specialist, have sex with someone known as a sex surrogate, who would be sensitive to my special needs
've been giving it some thought
Father Brendan interrupts him
Hold on
What do you mean "have sex"
Well,  don't really know how to describe
Sorry, that wasn't what
mean, are we talking about sexual intercourse
think so
Outside marriage
did do my best on the question of marriage
Father Brendan shakes his head with concern
What is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute
don't know, but  think there's a difference
23A
How do you know she's not some hooker gussied up as a social worker, who's just going to rob you
trust what my therapist said about her
How old are you
Thirty-eight
Why exactly now
never had any spare cash before
That's a major factor, and 'm probably getting close to my use-by date
And this is what you want my advice about
Fornication
Your advice as a friend
And do  have the casting vote, so to speak
Let's say  value your advice just as much as  do the therapist's
You're serious, aren't you
think sex is a serious matter
It's one of the most persistent themes in the bible
() 24
(') So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do  want to find out
And you want my opinion
Please
Father Brendan contemplates for a few moments
He looks up at the statue of Jesus, then makes a decision
know in my heart that He'll give you a free pass on this one
Go for it
What
said, go for it
Really
If you feel up to it
Do you feel up to it
To tell the truth, 'm scared
Then we should pray
Father Brendan and Mark pray together
(') Sweet Jesus, Mark and  sit at your feet and pray that You bless this little journey, this one small step for a man

Get over it
It's perfectly normal

She pushes a button on a remote control, which opens concertina double-doors, which reveal an adjacent bedroom
Tada
The bed itself is set at a perfect height for someone in a wheelchair or gurney
The room has been decked out with flowers, candles and incense
Wow
Carmen points to the bedside table
There are all sorts of useful things in that drawer there, if you guys feel like exploring
Mark doesn't even begin to get it
No, 'll bring my own sheets, towels and anything else we need
No, no
Everything will be provided
'm honored that you asked me
It'll be great karma for the house
' 40                                                                40 Rod is wheeling Mark back home
Great karma for the house
My God, the pressure, already
can't stand it

phone rings
' 45                                                               45 We hear the sound of sneakers on a wood floor
, an adolescent with a pony tail picks up the phone
Hey, this is Tony
He listens, then looks away from the phone and shouts
(') Cheryl
(
) What is it
Phone
He talks into the mouthpiece
(') She's coming
arrives
She is in her mid-30s
She grabs the phone, puts her hand over the mouthpiece and glares at Tony
'm not your girlfriend
When someone calls, particularly someone you don't know, you can use the word 'Mom'
28
Tony glares back
Cheryl takes off her right earring
(') Hullo, this is Cheryl
(
) Hi, it's Laura
haven't heard from you in a while
How are you
(
) Pretty well
Look,  called to ask how you would feel about working with a severely disabled client
Suddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice bottle
Hold on a moment, please
She covers the mouthpiece of the phone
(') Hey, cut that out
He takes no notice
She puts the phone down and moves towards him
He closes the fridge door and runs
' 46                                                                46 Mark is having a bed bath
His shoulders and neck are covered with soap suds
Rod is washing his back
The phone rings
Would you get it please
Sure
Rod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to answer the phone
(') Hullo, Mark 'Brien's phone
He switches it to speaker so Mark can hear
(
) Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene
May  speak to Mark
29
Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question
Mark's face looks drained of blood
Just one moment, please
Rod switches the phone off speaker
(') What am  doing here
Yes or no
Make up your mind
Mark hesitates, then nods weakly
Rod puts the phone back on speaker
Hullo, this is Mark
(
) Hi, Mark
'm Cheryl
Laura called to introduce you
understand you'd like to meet
Is that right
Mark can hardly speak
He eventually forces the sound from his throat
Uh, yes
(
) could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock
Would that be any good for you
Uh, yes,  think that would be fine for me
Hey, where you from
Boston
You
Salem
Small world
Wouldn't want to paint it
' 47                                                                47 Cheryl is on the phone, holding the receiver with one hand while she puts away groceries with the other
29A
We'll be talking for a while to begin with
Then, if you agree, we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session
' 48                                                               48 The iron lung pumps away
Mark is alone
He stares at the picture of the Virgin Mary
30
Holy Mother of God, what are "body awareness exercises"
' 49                                                                49 Vera lets herself in
' 50                                                                50 Vera holds up two shirts for Mark to see, a dark red and a light blue
Which one
Mark is lying on his side, shirtless
His face is even more grim than when we last saw it
Doesn't matter
Will you stop acting as if you're going to your own execution
'm not acting
' 51                                                                51 Vera wheels Mark to his doom
Try and think of something else
Baseball, for example
That's what they usually tell boys to do
Who are "they"
Vera rings the front doorbell
They wait
(') She's forgotten
Vera says nothing
She rings the bell again
(') My God, she's forgotten, or she's gotten the date wrong
Okay, we might as well turn round and go back
Come on, let's go
30A
She hasn't forgotten
From inside the house, we hear the faint buzz of an electric wheelchair approaching
The door opens
Mark closes his eyes in despair
52                                                      52 31
' 53                                                               53 Vera eases Mark onto the bed, positioning him so that he can see the doorway
As a finishing touch, she dabs a little cologne behind his ears, then puts the mouthpiece of his respirator within easy reach
Carmen picks up her bag and wheels herself to the door
Okay, 'm going
'll be back some time after one
If 'm not here, just let yourselves out
Bye
(weakly) Bye
Have fun
She lets herself out
What's the time
Twelve after eleven
think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts
Mark, please calm down
And if she does arrive, she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run
32
The doorbell rings
They stare at the door
Vera finally goes over and opens it
Silhouetted against the light is Cheryl with a substantial bag
She could be the Avon lady
She has a light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose
Hi, 'm Cheryl
'm sorry 'm late
No, that's fine
Come in
'm Vera, 'm one of Mark's helpers
Cheryl sees Mark
There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile
Hi, Mark 'Brien
Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty
Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene
Vera is already at the front door
'll be back, say, in two hours
Yes, two hours, that would be perfect
She closes the door behind her
Mark feels totally abandoned
(') So
Mark blurts out
Your money's on the dresser
Cheryl walks over to the dresser
When her back is turned, Mark screws up his face in self-disgust
She finds an envelope
Thank you
She puts it in her bag
Mark eyes her carefully
That was the wrong way to start off
33
Yes, it was
Shall we start again
Please, you start
She sits down on the bed and looks at him
It is a very frank stare
She is trying to take a lot in
Although the aim is for us to have sex, 'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front
've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference
We can talk about that later
'm sorry
The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together
Did Laura mention that when you saw her
'm sorry,  don't remember
The limit is six
But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore
Now,  understand you are able to have an erection
Yes, but not out of choice
Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection
She looks around the room
(') Is this your place
No, it's a friend's
The only bedroom furniture  have at my place is an iron lung
've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose
It's worth thinking about
34
've got the space
It can be expensive though, a nice futon mean, how much do you think a good one would cost
Mark, just take a deep breath, then let go
Do  seem anxious
You do a little
Cheryl lies down beside him
(') Laura told me you were a poet
What's it like to be a poet
It's a way of living inside your own head, which is where  spend most of my time
But not today
By the way,  like your shirt
He smiles, genuinely flattered
Thank you
So  need to ask you some basic questions
Okay
Sure
What is the iron lung for
It keeps me breathing
can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how  feel
But  work and sleep in the iron lung
34A
How do you feel right now
35
Out of my league
meant your breathing
Oh
fine
In fact, better than usual
That's great
Do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity
Any parts of your body you don't want me to touch
have normal sensitivity all over
It's just that my muscles don't work
You can touch me anywhere
Shall we get undressed then
Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it
He hesitates momentarily
Sure
Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt
Mark's terror is visible in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating
She starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt- sleeve
Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream
(') Ow
Ow
Stop
It hurts
She recoils, shocked
What's wrong
Holy Mother of God
Tell me what's wrong
My fingers
They're caught
She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward
36
Okay, okay, 've got it
Don't worry
She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off
Be careful, please
Mark, 'm going to be really careful with you
don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me
Okay
won't yell at you any more
But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt
Yes
Now, let's do the other arm
Little by little, she extracts the other arm
He grimaces his way through it, but more in fear than in pain
She finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed
(') Nice shirt
You already said that
Did
guess 'm a little anxious, too
She undoes the top of his pants
(') Okay, 'm going to slide these down
Hold your breath
She pulls
He screams, in fear more than pain
Shit, fuck
No, don't do that
36A
54                                                             54 Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of deep breaths
37
' 55                                                                55 Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the bathroom door
He can hear the sound of water running
He looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time
56                                                                56 Cheryl turns off the tap
She has done a great job of pulling herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has brought herself
' 57                                                                57 Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress
Ready
No
Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away
Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that  don't want your return business
'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner
She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted
She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her
Whenever 'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed
Now that 'm in bed with another naked person, 'm very confused
She strokes his hair
So, why is it confusing
'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening
She slides her hand down
She can feel his heart thumping
37A
Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch
He closes his eyes
(') 'd like you to tell me how it feels each time  touch a different part of your body
If something feels good, tell me
If something feels ticklish or bothers you, let me know
don't want you to tolerate anything
'm going to start with the top of your head
She strokes his hair
(') You have soft hair
It's nice to the touch
So you like it
do
She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of his ear
(') That feels weird
Weird good
Or weird bad
Just weird
She moves her hand down his neck
(') Good
His shoulder
Still good
Everything good so far, except the ear
She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly
For Mark, so far, this is the best
37B
(') Are these the body awareness exercises
38
You're clever to have worked that out
Her hands massage their way down his torso
Mark's reactions are a little like shock waves
People tell me 'm very perceptive
Would you like to see what  feel like
She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around one of her breasts, then puts his hand back
Cheryl's hands move further down his body
(') Are you wearing cologne
Yes
Mmm, my favorite brand
Okay, 'm going to move my hand along your stomach
and down to your pen
The expression on Mark's face changes to one of shock, then agony, then ecstasy
Oh, oh
58                                                      58 ' 59                                                             59 The clock on the mantelpiece says 12:48
Cheryl is now fully dressed
She snaps open her briefcase, takes out a diary with a pen attached, then walks over to the bed, sits down beside Mark and flips through the pages
Next week, Friday the twentieth, same time
That's good for me
39
Next time we'll start to work on intercourse
She gathers her things together and gets up
(') Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me
was terrified
You can be proud of yourself
You did great
We've made real progress
Can  ask you something
Of course
What would you like to ask
Anything, really
Tell me something about yourself
Anything
Sure
'm a very private person have a private life,  do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it
This therapy is about you
There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key turns in the lock
few moments later, Carmen and Vera come in
Welcome back
Perfect timing
hope you guys kept the noise down
' 60                                                             60 Vera wheels Mark back the way they came
She is very discreet and they travel in silence for a while
Finally, curiosity overcomes her
40
How do you feel
Cleansed and victorious
Doesn't get any better than that
Tell me about your first sexual experience
Let me think
It wasn't all that pleasant
mean, it was consensual and everything, and  really was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me,  didn't think it would fit
It was scary
But he was nice
guess he couldn't help it
Was he Chinese
Are you kidding
only hung out with white guys at high school
Why is that
don't know
To stick it to my mum and dad,  suppose
Are they happy now you've got a Chinese boyfriend
They're happy
'm happy
What's his dick like
Perfect size
Why do you call it a dick instead of a penis
41
Penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat
Dick sounds like what it is
They continue in silence for a little while
The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly
Yes, tell me about it
' 61                                                               61 Cheryl's car is parked outside
The house is mostly dark
' 62                                                               62 Cheryl is at a tiny desk, dictating into a recorder
First session
Mark is the oldest of four children and raised Catholic
He was extremely nervous
He yelled a lot when  took off his shirt, but  think more out of fear than pain
He cannot masturbate
Has only had the occasional kissing experience
He is capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse
She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the drawer with a key, which she keeps with her
' 63                                                               63 Cheryl gets into bed beside her husband , who is apparently asleep
This gentleman  just started working with
He spends most of his life trapped in a big metal box
Her husband Josh turns over and mumbles something completely incomprehensible
She nudges him
(') Did you hear what  said
42
Yes,  heard what you said
You're a saint
He kisses her
Don't forget to put the trash out in the morning
She turns around and goes to sleep
64                                                              64 Mark is in the little side chapel with Father Brendan
don't know what  had envisaged it would be like, the first time mean
But that wasn't the image had
thought there would be more to it
Not that it was unpleasant
After all,  was in bed with a naked woman
She complimented me on my shirt and my hair
She held my penis
haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years
Anyway, onward
Am  sharing too much
No, 'm used to it
' 65                                                              65 Mark is in his iron lung
With his mouth stick, he turns the page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex
There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of penises entering vaginas
Ravel's "Bolero" plays quietly in the background as he reads to himself
"Sometimes the head of the penis may be too large to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly, in which case the application of lubricant is recommended to avoid possible
" Oh, my God
' 66                                                              66 This time Rod is wheeling Mark
He seems only slightly less anxious than the first time, but still noticeably anxious
What's on the menu today
43
We're attempting intercourse
Uh-huh
That's a big one
What do you think of it
Intercourse
Overrated, but necessary
There's plenty of other ways of achieving the same result, but somehow you don't feel you've actually done it till you've gone all the way in
This does not help Mark's state of mind
67                                                         67 ' 68                                                                68 Cheryl takes off her clothes
want you to look at me this time
Go on, lift your eyes, look at me
He lifts his eyes
She pauses
(') Do you like watching me undress
do
As she moves towards the bed, almost naked, the last thing she takes off is her bra
From now on
She pulls back the bed covers and gets into bed with Mark
(') You're going to start to understand the signals from your body
Their bodies touch
He looks blissful
(') and learn how to control
Then suddenly
43A
Oh God
Oh God
Mark's expression of bliss turns to one of anger and frustration
44
(') Damn
Shit
69                                                                69 Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan
did it again
This time, ejaculated on her thigh
Father Brendan winces
(') felt cursed, that the whole enterprise was cursed
It seemed like a totally just punishment
God wasn't actually denying my sexuality
He was merely pointing out to me how useless it was
It's amazing to me how often God is brought into the sex act understand that even amongst non- believers, the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is "Oh, God
" 70                                                         70 71                                                         71 ' 72                                                                72 Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed
Okay,  don't want to hear any more about God cursing you
want the credit
It was my overpowering beauty that did it
It took you by surprise
Now, where were we
What do you mean, where were we
'm going to touch you
'm touching you
and when we both feel you're aroused, then 'm going to guide you into my vagina
Is there anything  need to do
45
Close your eyes, feel your body, that's all you need to do
Mark closes his eyes
In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church with the afternoon sun blazing through
An equally saintly, but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning
When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way
It is a struggle for her, but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse
Suddenly, he panics
It won't fit
It's not going to fit
No, Mark, it will fit just fine
No, it's dangerous
It's too big
It's not too big
Relax
It won't fit
It'll hurt
It's too risky
Please, stop this
promise you, nothing bad will happen
Now, let's try again while you're still hard
She attempts to guide him in again
Mark grimaces, makes a strange noise
We realize that he has just ejaculated again involuntarily
Shit
73                                                             73 Cheryl steps out of the shower
' 74                                                             74 Cheryl gets into bed
'm really sorry
46
Stop being sorry
And stop reading those stupid sex manuals
She snuggles up beside Mark
(') We still have some time
We can talk, which you seem to like, or you can suck on my nipples, which you also seem to like
Or, which one would you like to do first
Gradually, Mark is reassured
' 75                                                                75 Cheryl's Volvo is parked in its usual spot out front
There is one light on in the house

She also has a notepad with some jottings
Mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when  sucked his penis
At the moment he is fixated on penis- vagina and his anxiety is focused around that
The root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion
He believes he doesn't deserve sex
He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him
' 77                                                                77 copy of Cheryl's notes comes through on Laura's fax machine
We hear her familiar limp as she comes over to collect them
She reads the notes with interest
(
) We discussed his fantasies
They are mostly masochistic

(
) (') Again,   the idea of being punished
He has   never seen female genitalia before   and seems quite frightened by the   idea

'm sorry to lay all this on you, Father
My worry now is that it's never going to happen
'm never going to have intercourse with Cheryl, or any other woman
Maybe intercourse would prove  was an adult
Maybe  don't want to cross that line
Maybe this was a bad idea
Do you want to know what  think
Please
'd forget the psychobabble
grew up on a farm
It even takes the animals a few times to get it right
Can  suggest you try and enjoy it more
Don't worry about the technical stuff
You're a poet
Be romantic

She takes shirts and models them for Mark
He settles on a daring but beautiful silk shirt

Mark looks thoughtful
You nervous
Only a little
48
Would you like a shpritz
Yes, of course  would
Vera gets a bottle of cologne and gives Mark a couple of bursts behind the ears

Great
had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen, but  think today's the day
Can  make a suggestion
Please
Stop thinking about it

You couldn't have wished for nicer weather
You're not listening, are you said, stop thinking about it
Beautiful weather
She steps up to ring the bell, then hesitates
There is something of a hubbub coming from inside
Both she and Mark can hear it clearly
49
' 84                                                                84 The doorbell rings, amidst a loud background chatter
We reveal a   , gathered for some intense group activity of some kind
Carmen buzzes her way to the front door in her wheelchair
She opens it
She has an expression of horror
Oh, my God,  forgot
Oh, Mark, 'm so sorry
The entire roomful of women stare at Mark and Vera
In the background we see Cheryl's car pull up
' 85                                                                85 Cheryl, Mark and Vera are by the car
Mark looks grim
She was very apologetic
They are all shaking their heads
Cheryl has a thought
Look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind, but  noticed there's quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here
Maybe it's worth checking out
86                                                                86 Mark and Cheryl wait outside while Vera goes in
Have you got anything on the ground floor
The   is also Chinese
He looks at the rack of keys
've got a single
How much
Thirty-five plus tax
My boss is the gentleman in the gurney
() 50
(') He's supposed to be having a therapy session right now, but the facility we normally use had a scheduling mix-up
We only need the room for two hours
Can you do it for twenty cash
87                                                             87 The clerk leads them to the room and opens the door
There's a soda machine around the corner
Thanks
And an ice machine, if you need it
'm sure it'll come in handy
88                                                             88 Cheryl, Vera and the gurney enter the room
The clerk watches in the background
Cheryl and Vera lower Mark onto the bed
Allowing for the gurney, there is not a lot of space left in the room
Okay, 'll see you
've got a book to read
'll just hang around the reception if you need me
Vera leaves
Mark looks around
Very atmospheric
Some people find motels exciting
Do you think  could be one of those people
She sits on the bed and starts to undo his shirt
Another nice shirt
As in racy and sophisticated
51
You took the words right out of my mouth
89                                                             89 Vera is having coffee with the clerk
What's wrong with your boss
Basically, he can only move his head
So what sort of therapy are they doing
They're having sex
You're bullshitting me
Okay, 'm bullshitting you
No, tell me for real, what are they actually doing
Well, today, after some appropriate foreplay, they're going to try to achieve full penetration
The clerk stares at her
90                                                             90 We see Cheryl from the breasts up
We hear violent coughing from down below
(
) 'm   choking Cheryl moves away
We realize she has been perched astride his face, more or less
The coughing continues
Mark looks a bit panicked
The mouth-piece
52
Cheryl locates the mouth-piece to his oxygen supply and puts it between his lips
After a few breaths he is relatively relaxed
She lies down beside him
guess that one's off the menu until further notice
Mark finally lets go of the mouth-piece
He looks melancholy
She does not fail to notice
(') Come on, lighten up, will you
Mark smiles
He seems to be lost in some memory
Pony girl, Pony girl, Won't you be my pony girl
He looks at Cheryl
(') That was what my father used to sing to my little sister, Karin
That was before she died
She was kind of a sad little girl
It didn't do much good
'm really sorry that the last time  saw her, fought with her
made her cry
Mark's eyes begin to look teary
(') My parents could have left me in the nursing home, you know
They found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months
So they took me home
They gave me a life
Cheryl props herself up on one elbow
Mark, 'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee
When come back, we're going to achieve full penetration
But before  go, want you to close your eyes
Is this a game
No, it's not a game
Just do as say
Close your eyes
53
He closes his eyes
(') Picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach
Can you do that
Yes, very easily
91                                                             91 The scene has a hazy, dreamlike reality
We see the six-year old Mark, able-bodied and full of energy, running and playing in the sand with his dog
92                                                             92 Describe some of your feelings
feel very exhilarated, running next to the Atlantic Ocean, feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes
Do you really feel like him
Yes,  really feel like him
But can you really picture him
don't understand what you mean said  can feel like him
Of course can picture him
From the outside,  mean, as an adult, as you are now, looking at him with his crew cut and his little face
Yes
And are you mad at him
Do you blame him for getting polio
Was it his fault
53A
Cheryl gets up and goes to the bathroom
Mark is obviously affected by her question
54
93                                                                93 Mark has a faraway look
She either forgot to close the bathroom door, or didn't bother to close it
Mark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps
Father Brendan looks over his shoulder
They finally pass
Mark continues
(') found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic, and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate
By the time she came back  had a terrific boner
94                                                                94 Cheryl gets herself into position on top of Mark
'm going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva
When it's ready, 'll guide you in
Breathe slowly and think of something delicious
Mark thinks
Through his mind's eye, we see a succession of images
Fingertips stroking a cat's fur
In the background, the sound of tom-toms
tribal initiation rite
Drums, dancing, trances
Then Ravel's "Bolero"
Clint Eastwood saying "make my day"
Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark comes
Aahh
95                                                                95 Vera is still there, reading her book
The clerk looks at his watch
They've been in there a long time
Yes, some people can do that
He does not get it
55
Do you want another coffee
No thanks
Do you live with your parents
No
You at Berkeley
Uh-huh
Doing what
Architecture
You have a boyfriend
Yes
Do you
96                                                             96 Mark and Cheryl are lying together
He has his eyes closed
There is something on her mind
You awake
56
Uh-huh
To answer your earlier question, grew up in Salem, brought up Catholic, like you, but the church didn't appreciate my attitude towards sex
You had an attitude towards sex
Yes,  liked it
They like to think they threw me out, but  threw them out
So for years  didn't believe in anything, and now 'm converting to Judaism
guess it's good to have some kind of insurance
didn't think of that
Then why are you doing it
My husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies
The idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy, then it will do the same for me
Our son is neutral on the subject, but theoretically, if it looks like it makes me happy, it'll make him happy too
That's the way my husband's family talks, and thinks
The fact that 'm happy already, doesn't seem to be relevant
What's your son's name
Tony
He's 14 years-old and very smart
You'd like him
Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a while
Does he know what you do
56A
He knows 'm a sex therapist
There's a certificate on the wall
But he hasn't had sex yet
So
How much can he really know
He's not a boy, he's not a man
How much do you want him to know
Well,  want him to have some idea in his head
hope it's a nice one
57
What does your husband do
He's a philosopher
Wow
You mean, like, at a university
No, in his own mind
He runs the house, plays guitar, thinks a lot
She notices the time
(') It's kind of late
She gets up and starts to get dressed
(') Hey, we did really good stuff today
You were fantastic
You're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record
You should be pleased
Was  really inside you
You were really and truly inside me
For how long
Five or six seconds
Is that all
That's a long time for some people
You were pretty excited
don't know what you were thinking about
'm sorry,  couldn't tell one thing from another
It was all a jumble of sensations
58
Well, you definitely achieved penetration
It was penis-vagina all the way
And you definitely get an  for orgasm
She is ready to go
She comes over to Mark and kisses him on the cheek
Did you come
No, Mark,  didn't
Can we try for that next time
She hesitates for a moment
If that's what you want
Yes, that's what  want
Okay then

He reads too many books
He has it in his head that after meeting three times, we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm
Boom
Just like that

So you're really doing this for the money
Absolutely
Well, that makes me feel much better about the whole thing

She lies there with her eyes wide open, unable to sleep, her mind full of thoughts
Although she has not yet noticed, Josh is also awake
What's on your mind
Oh, nothing
Don't believe you
Okay, 've been thinking about the whole conversion thing

Does that shock you

What's up
The three of them are sitting round the dining table eating dinner in total silence
The hostility between Cheryl and Josh is palpable

Mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour
This is not unusual after first successful intercourse, but  think he is especially susceptible
He cannot help seeing me as the multi- functional, all-purpose woman, mother, sister, schoolmistress, whore, lover and best friend
At the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished

She is still awake
He snuggles up to her
'm sorry
really upset you before
No, you didn't
'm fine
You sure
Yes,  promise
Really
64A
Yes, 've come around to your point of view
You were right
You're generally right about these things
It was quite a nice poem
mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least
Josh,  need to go to sleep
Everything's good
Okay
Good night
They kiss

She finds nothing
She storms off to the laundry, flings open a cupboard, pokes around and comes up with a flashlight
' 119                                                               119 Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard
Holding the flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the outdoor trash bin
Finally, she finds what she is looking for
An envelope
She takes the poem out of the envelope and reads it
Let me touch you with my words
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves
She goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues reading
She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the house
She is visibly affected
120                                                        120 66

The other female figure takes over from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind
Mark remains unaware
He has a new and different-looking shirt, even more out there than the previous one
Do you think she'll like the shirt
like it
Does that count
Mark can barely believe it
Amanda

Vera is hovering in the background, out of earshot
It's been a while

'm sorry
'm going to Germany
wanted to say goodbye to you before  left
Why are you going to Germany
To study German
67
For how long
One or two years maybe
But we should keep in touch
But why go to Germany
It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden
She laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him
You could always make me laugh love you, Mark
really do
Mark's face is a picture of anguish and confusion
Really
124                                                               124 Yes,  love you, but not in that way
love you, but 'm not in love with you
Blah, blah, blah
You know how it goes
Mark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh
For a time, he and Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence
125                                                               125 think it's great what you're doing with this surrogate lady
She leans over and kisses Mark on the lips
It could have been you
It could have been, but it wasn't

It shows you how naive am
() 68
(') The fact that  was no longer a virgin, that  was a `made man', so to speak, made no difference to her at all
127                                                              127 Cheryl's car is in the parking lot
We see her draw the blinds
128                                                              128 Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera
Thanks
You want to go out some time
No,  don't think so
What, your boyfriend
No
Your parents
No, 'm busy, that's all
What's wrong with this, anyway
We're having a nice time, aren't we
It's okay
Or do you have things to do
can go for a walk if you're busy and come back later
No, no, stay
Is this going to be a regular thing
What
The therapy
69
don't know
'm not the therapist
What sort of a therapist is she, really
told you the first time, she's a sex therapist
The clerk looks at her closely
She appears to have a completely straight face
(') Today they're working on simultaneous orgasm
What's that
129                                                            129 Mark and Cheryl are in bed, their faces close
Boy, am  glad to see you
Don't you say that to all the girls
Yes, but  always mean it
They kiss
Then Cheryl's head slides down and disappears from view
(
) Remember about the breathing
Concentrate on breathing out rather than in
Think of anything neutral
Sky, water, trees, ships, music, nothing too dramatic
Mark closes his eyes
130                                                            130 The first time,  really didn't know what was going on
Technically it all happened, but nothing really happened in my head
() 70-71
(') This time it did, and my head has never experienced anything like it before
Of course,  ignored Cheryl's advice about having neutral thoughts
131                                                            131 Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror-ball lighting

She seems divine
His excitement increases
We hear the change in his breathing
Also in her breathing
134                                                            134 The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically into something else
Then afterwards, there was this moment, this glimpse of an awful sadness to come
Father Brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly
135                                                     135 136                                                     136 72

Mark achieved an erection as soon as  started to suck on him
He did the controlled breathing, as  had suggested, and  was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily
139                                                               139 We see Mark's face from Cheryl's
His eyes are still closed
Is it in
Is it really in
Yes, it's really in
We hear Mark's thoughts

) couldn't believe it
We hear the sound of typing
' 140                                                               140 Mark is in his iron lung, typing
At the top of the page, we can see the title of the piece: "On Seeing a Sex Surrogate" Page 8

) was finally there
Too soon, came
But she kept holding me inside her
Then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face
141                                                               141 We see Cheryl's face from Mark's
It is as beatific as we have ever seen it
(
) as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched
Letting me go, she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest
This act of affection moved me deeply
74
Cheryl's actions follow Mark's description
142                                                            142 Mark is with Father Brendan
almost wept
No-one had ever kissed me there before
It was so unexpected and so natural
143                                                            143 Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest
She kisses him on the lips, light and lingering
As soon as there is enough space between them, he whispers to her
love you
She whispers back
love you, too
Did you come
Yes
' 144                                                            144 Cheryl continues dictating
Mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself
There is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities, given the right sort of partner
His deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement
Cheryl pauses, then goes on
(') As anticipated, this was the final session
Tony appears
He seems to have some understanding of what is going on
He and Cheryl hug
145                                                            145 They are still in the same intimate position
75
What happens when
What happens when what
When people become attached to each other
What people
Just people
What's the chemistry of it all
When people are attracted to each other
Are you attracted to me
We're just talking hypothetically
Hypothetically, they write poems, they have sex
And what happens next
After poetry and sex
Nothing or everything
The rest is by negotiation, as it were
What do you mean
mean, you can just leave it at love and attraction, or you can make things complicated
As most people do
Have you
Oh, yes

77
146                                                            146 The clerk looks bored
Vera looks at the time
She seems a little anxious
Can  use that phone to call the room
Sure
78

Cheryl, already dressed, is getting Mark dressed
She does up every button of his shirt lovingly
What shall we do next time
Any requests
Mark doesn't answer
(') Mark
'm thinking
She finishes buttoning him up in silence
strange feeling, a kind of chill that Cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphere
(') We have two sessions left, is that correct
That's right
Or
Or, what
Or, we could stop now
You mean, make this the last session
Yes
79
There is a pregnant pause
What do you think we should do
It's not we, it's you, Mark
It's up to you
want to know how you feel
That doesn't come in to it
Yes, it does
don't just write poems to anyone
Mark, what do you want me to say
How much  was touched by that
How special this has been to me
Is that going to help you
No, it's going to make things worse
You mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it
Yes, that will be it
explained that the first time we met
Mark has a serious and painful moment
(') 'm sorry
If it's any consolation, it's also hard for me to think about it
Then maybe we should pull the plug now
think maybe we should
It's only going to get harder
guess you might as well save the money
Maybe buy yourself a nice futon
80
Cheryl is getting dressed
Mark watches pensively
She pauses and looks at him
He keeps a brave face
There is a knock on the door
(') Just a moment
She and Mark make eye contact for the last time
They manage to smile at each other
(
) desperately wanted to feel that because of Cheryl, my life had changed
But it hadn't
Apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long mirror
Bye, Mark (
) Bye
As Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in
Everything all right
He did great
See you
'm sorry, have to run
See you
Vera walks in and closes the door behind her
150                                                               150 Cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk
As she is putting the mirror inside, the Chinese clerk, who is showing a to their room, gives her an odd look
Cheryl takes no notice, gets in her car and starts the engine
Just then, Vera runs up and taps on her window
The window winds down
Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it
At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is
You forgot this
Cheryl smiles
81
knew there was a reason  came here today
Vera waves goodbye as she goes and Cheryl sits contemplating the envelope in her lap
Then she tosses it onto the dash and drives away
' 151                                                            151 Vera wheels Mark home
They travel in silence
152                                                            152 Father Brendan and Mark are together in the chapel
felt 'd just been through a ceremony that  didn't know the meaning of
kept thinking, is that all there is
Just an empty hole at the end of it
bigger hole than there was before
'm sorry Mark, you can't always trust your feelings
You've achieved a great thing
It may take you a while to realize that
Time passes
' 153                                                            153 It is a moonlit night
On the opposite wall from the Virgin Mary is a picture of Amanda and Mark
Mark lies in his iron lung staring at it
(
) wrote letters to Amanda in Germany
Five, six pages long year passed, Heard nothing
Was it my fault
Of course it was
But the guilt isn't enough to patch over the rage
pound the insides of my mind with words, such puny fists, And nobody hears
82
The poem ends and we hear instead a   of a Giants' game
Mark is engrossed
Suddenly the broadcast stops
The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says 12:57, disappears
street light, visible through the window, goes out
The electric pump under Mark's iron lung whirrs to a halt
We hear the sound of air escaping, then an eerie silence
Even the cat is motionless
For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized
Then, he twists his head and clamps onto his mouth stick
He manoeuvres it over to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in the semi-darkness
We hear a dial tone
' 154                                                            154 There is an answering machine on a bedside table
' Hi, this is Rod
Leave a message, or not
(
) Rod, it's Mark
need help
The power's gone out, including the pump on the iron lung
'd say 've got about three hours before start to turn blue
hope you get this in time
' 155                                                            155 Mark winces in frustration
Okay
nine-one-one
He swings the mouth stick over to the 9 button
As he presses it, he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor
(') Shit
At first, he seems panicky, but after a few moments he begins to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a strange calm
(') So this is how it ends
Time passes
We see Mark from a high angle
More time passes
We see Mark's face as he slips into unconsciousness
83
(  -) 156                                                            156 Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe
The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion pool with a hand rail and steps
The   gets up from her chair and approaches her
Is this your first time
Yes, it is
'm converting
She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who does not fail to notice Cheryl's body
So, what do you do
Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment
don't think you'd understand
You can try me
Okay
'm a housewife
Why shouldn't  understand
guess  was mistaken
Cheryl steps towards the pool
see you're very comfortable with being naked
She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water
That has never been one of my problems
Sometimes new brides come with their mothers
Do  have to take this off
Can  please leave this on
They've never been naked before
No honey, it all has to come off
84
And it does
Cheryl takes another step into the water
And it does
They stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves
Nothing to hide behind
This is your body
This is the body that God crafted for you
Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest
(') Immerse completely
Go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything
She immerses completely
We see her under the water
She hears a voice in the distance, her own voice
At the same time, there is a look of elation in her eyes
(
) Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now
157                                                               157 Mark is on the bed alone
He opens his eyes
(
) This is your body
few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length mirror
The angle is such that he can see all of himself
He is mesmerized by his own image
Flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face
(
) So this is the body that someone was able to love
Not quite as bad as  thought
158                                                               158 Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the ceiling from Mark's point of view
We also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice
Mark, can you hear me
Open your eyes
85
159                                                            159 Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung
There is a volunteer called  in the room with him
They'll be letting you go today
Whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back-up system
How close was
To what
You know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light
Is that what you remember
No
assume  passed out
Before that,  remember feeling sorry for myself
Do you feel relieved now
No
mean, 'm relieved that Rod got to me in time, but  still feel sorry for myself
'm sure there's a cure for that
Would you like to talk to someone
feel comfortable talking to you
'm only a volunteer, not a therapist
can refer you to someone if you like
Mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle
86
'm sorry,  don't mean to be rude
'm just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now
My priest couldn't
Are you religious
Yes
would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this
Are you
No,  don't go to any church and don't think about God very much
But  believe there's a mysterious logic, or poetry to life
guess that makes me a spiritual type
Yes, that would count
Would you like me to visit you
Are you married
No
Do you have a steady boyfriend
No
Then please visit as often as you can
160                                                     160 She smiles
Mark is loaded into an ambulance
Bye
Take care
There's just one more thing  want to tell you
87
She gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him
(') 'm not a virgin
She looks genuinely pleased to hear it
So, are you in a relationship at the moment
No, it was a passing thing
The driver is ready to shut the doors
Thanks for sharing that with me
She gets out of the ambulance and waves
161                                                               161 Mark is accompanied by an
We see clear blue sky through the back windows
The sun shines in and warms Mark's face
He closes his eyes in contentment
Nice day, isn't it
The best
Good to be alive, huh
162                                                               162 We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of view of the departing ambulance
(
) met Susan five years before died
She was the love of my life
We had the same priorities, baseball pretty much came first, and we wrote each other mushy poems
never expected it, nor did she, but that's often the way things turn out

88
Father Brendan sits in a chair next to Mark's iron lung
That was quite something
What do you propose to do for an encore
Yep,  almost found out the big secret
But here  am, back with the living
If there is another place, then  think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back
And welcome back
And thank you for coming to visit
know it's been awhile since we talked about this
About Cheryl
At the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her
or about it
no longer feel like that
Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise
Oh
That's good to hear
In the end, you're glad that you did it
Yes,  am
In fact, at this point in time,  feel very blessed
Blessed
Yes, blessed
They put me on this new anti-depressant and now  can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view
Father Brendan looks truly amazed
89
(') It takes about six weeks to kick in, but when it does, you can really tell the difference
Hey, that's great
Mark grins
'm pulling your leg, Father
'm not on drugs
have a girlfriend
You're kidding me
real girlfriend
very real girlfriend
She adores me
She'll do anything for me
And can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me
Her name is Susan
'm flabbergasted
Is she pretty
She sure is
Has she got a sister
As a matter of fact
'm kidding
No, you're not
Anyway, we're starting a publishing company together
Father Brendan smiles and shakes his head
Here  was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn - that's supposed to be my specialty - and now  can just throw away that little speech
No, no
Please make the little speech
'd love to hear it
89A
Okay, but 'll try and keep it short
Don't make it too short
Okay, fine
Here goes
The meaning of love
Love is a journey

already like it
There is a pause
That's it
That's all of 've got
told you it's short
Love is a journey
Mark laughs

There is definitely a smile on his face

(
) Actually,  was on drugs,  was taking anti-depressants and they were helping a bit
At least  was able to see the cup-of-life metaphor as a useful tool
Of course, the two halves were never even
Not in my case, that's for sure
Look at all the years of unendurable crap 've had to put up with
That fills most of the cup
But in the little bit that's left, what do  have to show for myself
Journalism
Poetry
At the very least, three beautiful women who all loved me and will all show up at my funeral

He retrieves the mail, sifts through it and pauses over a letter
He is tempted to open it, but thinks better of it
' 167                                                                167 Cheryl is planting stuff in the back yard
Josh approaches her with the letter
It's from a Susan Fernbach

She takes it and opens it uncertainly, somehow anticipating its contents

Meaningful hugs are exchanged
Eyes are dabbed
We hear Mark's voice

) Three Reasons to Live The mundane: God, it was boring, but  did it got it out of the way The transcendent: We had this agreement -- God gave me life for a while gave Him gratitude for a while and it worked out The curious: You know how every day is different

We see members of Mark's , all teary-eyed

'm sorry, my friend, but we have to do this
Just bear with me, and think you might like it
(  ) (') 've been branching out lately, reading Native American stories about the character of the trickster
Sometimes he shows up as a coyote, sometimes as a raven, but he always does the unexpected
The trickster breaks the rules
Mark 'Brien, whose life we're celebrating today, was very much the trickster -- anyone who knew him knew that
() 90B
(  ) Besides his irreverent humor and alarming honesty, he always did the unexpected
In nearly every aspect of his life, Mark did the unexpected
His was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body, a full life lived long after he should have been dead
He graduated from college, wrote and published articles and poems, and -- against all odds, by his own admission -- entered into the fully human experience of physical love
In this way, Mark lived from day to day to day, from breath to breath to breath, for 49 years
He loved, and he was loved and in his quiet voice, he spoke loud truths

We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows
Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next to a tall, boring-looking

) (') Susan Fernbach will now read one of Mark's favorite poems
(
) This is called Love Poem for No One in Particular
We see  at the lectern, reading from a book
Let me touch you with my words
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves
Let my words stroke your hair, Slide down your back and tickle your belly
For my hands, light and free-flying as bricks, Ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse to carry out my quietest desires
We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the first time
(
) (') Let my words enter your mind, bearing torches
Admit them willingly into your being So they may caress you gently within

As we move around the eerie capsule, we hear the sound of the French Can- Can slowly fade up
It continues over
