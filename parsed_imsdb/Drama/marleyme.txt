) Okay, here we go
everybody watching
Our screen goes  as a
(
0
) (') 'd like to tell you all a little lov e story
But the images n screen are (
0
) (') Whoops
wrong file
and we begin    : ( ) - The lights are dim
We're looking at a blank, pull-down movie screen in a darkened ballroom
(
) (') Hang on,  got this-- Someone
starts  a fork against a wine glass
Is joined by others, and then we  calls of "Kiss
Kiss
" sitting at the main table, In silhouette, seen from behind, lit only by the votives sprinkled along the table: and his bride of two hours,
In response to the crowd, they kiss
Standing right by them is  -- tall, good looking, rugged type --John's best man
(') Alright, now 'm ready-- And now, on   , Sebastian'  : John with his Mom in front of the college dorm, etc
(
) (') Here's John, first week of college
Nice hair, right
() 2
1 : (
) (') You think that feathering ' easy
true
Takes a very well p wrist action
from the crowd
(
) (') 'm just saying
Throughout college
(
) (') Was John a star athlete
shot of him fumbling a frisbee, (
) (') Umm, no
Was he a ladies man
With mid-eighties hair, bad glasses
(
) (') You tell me
() What he was, was John, and we loved for it
2
-  ( ) Taken r
Sebastian
up l ^a ni12ghte Sebastian turns the camera on himself, holds Sharpie pen, smiles
(
) And he was always looked after by his guardian angel and best friend
3
-  ( ) John walking down the quad, with "" written on his forehead
People passing him are smirking
(to , which is ) People are staring at me - is my fly down
No, no, it's cool
3
3 3 : All right, enough with the - (as he gets another giggle) - all right, what
What are you looking at
Oh, wait, there's something on your forehead
John brushes it
(') You got it
Leaf or something
() leaf
On my forehead
Yeah, it musta had some sap on it
They pass a cluster of   who laugh at John
(
) (') And then there's Jenny
4 Looking, indeed, very cool, very put together
(
) Studious, hard-working, quiet
In short-shorts, wet -shirt, throwing water balloons at a frat house
Standing on an empty keg of beer, rolling it like it's a log
(
) (') Well, okay, sometimes not so quiet
Ordering a bunch of guys around, telling who to go where, as the camera  , we see they're playing touch football - except she tackles
Hard
And then does a little victory dance over the fallen
Jenny's the captain, in charge
4- 4 : (
) (') Okay, maybe a little high-spirited, maybe voted Miss Kegger once or twice too often on Fraternity , but a good girl underneath it all
Now could they not fall in love
One of John "flexing" beside a lake, another of Jenny screaming at a football game with a beer in her hand
(
) (') Now, in any decent love story, you gotta have the great first meeting
5
-  -  ( ) Sebastian is obviously the passenger shooting John, who's driving
( ) All right, 'm zooming in
Whoa
Not a flosser
Turn it off
And as he  for it - '
He hits another car
The camera goes flying
Fumbles
(') Jesus Christ
They're okay
They're getting out
Sebastian manages to right the  and unsteadily films John getting out of the car, heading towards the car he hit
The passenger door opens and Jenny comes out
She's covered in frosting and the remains of a birthday cake which she was carrying in her lap
The damaged car is full of balloons
Are you a complete idiot
(
) And so one of the truly great love affairs of the late eighties began
In the home video, Jenny advances on John, hurls the rest of the cake at him, starts flailing at him with her hands
5
5 : The driver of the car, another co-ed, gets out and yells at (Sebastian)
(
) (') Brought together by their love of fast cars, spirited Baskin- Robbins Dreamy Drizzle Ice Cream cake
6    6 John and Jenny both at typewriters
(
) From there, they went on to work together at the school newspaper
Shot of Jenny standing at the head of a table full of reporters
(
) (') Although, technically, they didn't work together so much as John worked for Jenny who was the editor of said paper
In her office, through the semi-closed Venetian blinds
(
) (') Let's just say there were some flagrant workplace violations
7
-  ( ) 7 John and Jenny, both in cap and gowns, drinking from plastic champagne glasses
John displays the top of his cap to : the words " " are spelled out in white adhesive tape
(
) The point is their love grew, blah blah blah
And that love continues tonight
8
-  8 The wedding  , the lights come up, and Sebastian concludes his toast
6
8 : (
) And now, please join me in raising a glass to my future neighbors down in Florida, and to the dawn of both a marriage end a brilliant journalistic team, the new Woodward and Bernstein, this time with sex
Bad sex, probably, but - anyway: to John and Jenny Grogan
She's had an ffect on He's not so much break applause
e him
They kiss as : 9 we're looking out a window
(
) MmzmII[lm
That feels so good
- The two of them sit on the edge of the bathtub, soaking their sore feet
Jenny's still in her wedding dress, bunched up so as not to get it wet
John has got the pant legs of his tux rolled up
Jenny takes a swig from a bottle of champagne, passes it to John
He looks at her
How do  get vou
What
'm serious
In what world does a guy like me get someone like you
Are you kidding
(leans on him) You're part of the plan
The plan
7- 9 : Step one
Meet an incredibly sweet, smart, sexy guy
Done
Step two
Marry him
Check
Step three
She smiles, puts her face right up to his
Now that one's a surprise
They kiss and as we push past them, into the snowy window, we and
: 10
-  10 battered Toyota Tercel comes over
a rise
We follow the car through town, get : "1990" 11
-  11 Jenny driving
John clutching his portfolio on his lap
She cuts a look at him
You okay
Oh yeah
12
-   -  12 As jenny pulls up out front of the building
- She turns to John
You know you got this
8
12 : 12 know,  got it
Who are you
'm John Grogan
Wrong
You're John Friggin Grogan who's about to get a job
She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss
Um, okay, see now  don't wanna get out of the car
i really just wanna sit here and make out with you
--Get out of the car
He nods, starts to get out, then pauses
Who am i again
() Kidding

) Sebastian says you won some award
14
'  -  (1990) 14 -- fifties, never smiles, flowered shirts -- the editor of the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is flipping through John's portfolio
Yes, sir,  got a Mitchy
(off Arnie's look) () 9
14 14 : (') Like a Pulitzer, but for western Michigan
Mitchy
Min-hmm
So, tell me, why did you want to leave the estimable - (he flips to a story, reads ) - Kalamazoo Gazette
Well, as you know, Sebastian and  were in college together, and he was always talking about South Florida
mostly about the women of South Florida, but anyway, after my wife and  got married we thought it might be nice to come -- For the women
Uh, no-- for the
the
uh
For the work
Yes
That
Your wife's Jenny Havens, right
Well, Jenny Grogan now-- She take the job at the Post
-- tried to get her over her -- Damn fine writer
() () 10
14 : (2) (') What's the matter, the Post didn't want Yo m
Well, she does features
'm more a straight news writer
This is a better paper for that
Straight news writer, huh
Meaning you think you're a reporter
Meaning  know  am
And the six other sweaty-palmed college grads 'm interviewing today, you think you're better than them
No, sir
In fact, 'm pretty sure 'm not
But  do know that  always seem to surprise myself
Ten years ago, was doing bong hits and playing Donkey Kong, never dreamed 'd get into college
But  did, and  graduated with honors
Two years ago, my buddies told me that the most Jenny Havens would ever say to me was, You're sweet, but  don't like you in that way
But she did like me in that way-- and my buddies can suck it because  married her
certainly never thought 'd win some award with a dumbass name-- () The "Mitchy
" ( ) Exactly sir
But i surprised myself and  won it
And if you give me the chance, 'm pretty sure 'll surprise you, too
Arnie considers him a moment
That's quite a speech, son
You rehearse that, or come up with it on the fly
11
14 14 : (3) Elevator, on the way up
() How'd  do
Arnie just looks back at him
15
-  15 Jenny is writing in her  when we see John crossing the street through the passenger window
She looks at him
Afraid to ask
So
He's got me on a little thing they like to call
Desert Storm-- She gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on the street
She takes out her notebook, crosses something off on her "list
" (') okay
"Jobs
" Done
So what's next
Lunch
( ) House
16
345   -  16 as a ca g nos by on the Dixie Highway in the b
g
We tilt down to a very mixed neighborhood, to a modest house,
17
345  -  -  17 News footage of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on television
John and Jenny sit at the table reading a different newspapers
He glances at her
You like the quote about the speed bumps
12
17 17 : () "If they save even one life--" -"it would be worth it
And with that, Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled with tears
" () That one just felt exactly right, y'know
Yeah, no, it's good
What happened to the Desert Storm piece
That's it
The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait
What, that's not in there
(looks at the article) Uhhhh
they must've cut it
And they kinda misspelled your name
John Egan
What-- you're kidding-- He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away
Forget it
It's good, John
It's got facts, some color
It's a solid piece
Thanks
'm almost done with yours
This idea of voting machines sounds -- Well, except on the other page  talk about what could happen-- He goes back to reading
She sips her coffee
Oh, it continues
An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to fold back the paper
No escaping the fact that ie article is longer and more important than his
She finally gets up
13
17 17 : (2) You know what
The rest is just okay, really pretty boring
No, no, 'm enjoying it
He tortures himself and keeps reading
She moves to the sink, starts to rinse out her cup
(') Wow, they really gave you a lot of space, didn't they
She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the   on the sill
Damn
killed another one
How am ever going to take care of a kid, can't even keep a plant alive
John looks up from the paper
"Kid
" She comes gives him a kiss
(') 'll see you later, Mr
Gorgan
She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant
(
0
) kid, huh
18 18
-  - Sebastian and John fill up at the coffee pot, start to move through the office throughout
Well, what'd you expect
You bought a house, man
house with a mare room
What's wrong with a spare room
It's empty, John
That's what's wrong with it
And you know what else is empty
Her womb
14
18 18 : 'm starting to worry that we're already at Step Six
What
You know Jenny, she's got her whole life organized and planned out
Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John
You want my advice
Get her a PuPPYa puppy
Something other than you she has to take care of
(points at him) You have a kid, you're a dad
You're not you anymore
You have a dog, you're a master
You're still a guy
With a life
And a dog
Whatever, man
You're still free
You've stopped the clock
What clock
Okay
you know in movies when there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking down, ten seconds left, and there's some guy with a wire cutter going, "red wire
blue wire
which one do cut
" And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and
Silence
The world is saved
Okay
is the bomb strapped to a dog
because 'm not sure 'm -- 15 18 : (2) 18 John, you buy this dog, you're saving your world
Because that ticking you hear, is not a bomb, it's her biological clock
John looks back at him
Huh
(
) Sebastian
They both turn as Arnie sticks his head out of his office
(') Your travel's approved
Get outta here
In motion
Where you going
Colombia
got a guy down there, says he can put me next to Pablo Escobar-- 'm doing this piece,  follow a single coca leaf from Colombia, to the streets of Miami
Yeah, you and  once talked about doing something like that
We were gonna call it, "From Plant to Pusher
" Remember
Not really
-- -- ( ) --there was another fire at the county dump
Some kinda methane leak
Actually, it's Grogan-- want two paragraphs for the blotter
16
I8 18 : (3) John nods, looks off at Sebastian who now sits down at his cluttered desk, pulls a   from under his desk
John watches with envy as Sebastian starts stuffing cameras, recorders, a bowie knife, into the duffle
So uh, what kind of puppy
Sebastian looks up at him
(') To, y'know, cut the wire
Get her a lab
They're supposed to be just like little kids
But easier to train
19 19
'  - As John and Jenny get out of the car
She looks at the house
This isn't the ihop
little surprise first
20 20
'  - John is leading Jenny, her eyes closed, through a house towards the kitchen
, 55, leathery and smoking, is going in front
Sorry about the smell
When can  look
Just hang on
Lori opens a door to a laundry room
(') Okay
Now
Jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room
Nine yellow yipping Lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard box towards John and Jenny
17
20 20 : (') Happy Birthday
Oh my God
they're adorable
() Wait a minute, my birthday's a month from now
That's okay, they can't leave for another three weeks anyway
John, we never even talked about this
You're right
Let's go
He's kidding
And besides, Jenny's already on the floor, letting the puppies climb all over her
Look at you guys
got papers on the mom and the dad, so you can register these
Is the father here too
( ) Oh, yeah, somewhere
Anyway, girls are $400, boys are $375
Except this little guy here
She points to one male puppy, who is clearly the goofiest most excited
(') You can have him for $325
How sweet
He's on clearance
Well, he's a little too stocky for the breed, so he probably won't show
He's so sweet
Marley & He Shooting Draft  18
20 20 : (2) He likes you
John,  don't know if 'm ready for a -- You have to wait three weeks for the litter to get weaned, before you can bring 'em home anyway
Plenty of time to get ready
won't even be here
'm gonna be with my sister then
No problem
can take him
Be good bonding time
Get him all trained in time for you to come home
chuckle from Lori
(') Let's give 'em all the scare test
( ) The what
hear the best dog in the litter is the one who doesn't spook easily
They turn out to be the most people- centered
( ) Uh, how are you gonna-- John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud step and a ""
All of the puppies scatter
Lily barks
But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail wagging
(') Well, that's your guy
John scoops him up
Clearance Puppy licks his face
John hands him to Jenny
She lets him lick her face
19
20 : (3) 20 would've picked you anyway-- Meant to be
He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right thing
21
'  --  21 Lori waves goodbye, check in her hand, as John and Jenny walk to the car
Jenny carries a Polaroid of Clearance Puppy
You really sure about this
mean, a puppy's a lot of work
How hard could it be
We hear   is coming from the woods, something crashing through the brush, breathing heavily
They both freeze as the sound comes their way
What's that
Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge, rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs
It circles them, barking , a crazed look in its eye
It jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels past Lori into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it goes
beat
think we just met the dad
22
-  22 John kissing Jenny good-bye
They finally part
Call me as soon as you get him home
Oh, hey, we need a name
How 'bout  just call him "Clearance Puppy" until you get back
only hope he doesn't say his first word without you
20
23 23
'  - John steps out of his car and the puppy, now twice the size he was three weeks ago, bounds over to him
harried Lori follows, a rope leash and instruction
sheet in hand
Whoa
He got big
This is the right one, right
You should see him pack away the puppy chow
So, what if  run into any problems
( ) Oh
Sure, call me
All sales are final, though
Not just for him tell that to everyone
() You want help getting him in the car
No, that's okay, 'll just
John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in
Instead, the puppy runs around the car, barking, jumping up on the bumpers
John finally catches him, lifts him up, puts him on the front passenger seat atop some towels
(') There we go
() Well, anyway, thanks for-- But Lori's already inside her house, the door closed
24
'  -  24 John and the puppy on the drive home
The puppy atop a pile of towels
John looks at him
Hey
guy
The dog just stares at him quizzically
Uncomfortable alone with the dog, John turns on the radio
plays and the puppy
21
24 24 : (') You like Bob Marley
The dog
John turns up the music
faster this time
(') -- (trying it out) Bob
(nothing, then) Marley
(') Marley
Okay-- Marley
Cool
But now the pup starts wriggling towards John, John tries to put him back
(') No-- stay boy
stay
(the dog crawls into his lap) Okay, not really safe, bud-- Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console
He remains like this, his tail thumping
John gives up
(') Alright, fine, but just this time
25 25
345   - door
The dog John pulls up in the driveway and opens the jumps out
This is our house
The dog immediately pees on the ground
(') And now it's yours
26 26
- As John crouches down, shows him his bowls
This one's water
This one's food
22
26 : 26 Marley starts pawing the food bag
(') 'mon, man, you've already had kibble and half a seat belt
(moment, relents) All right
Special treat
But just today
He opens the bag and Marley tackles it
Several cupfuls spill onto the floor
John goes to the pantry to get the dustpan and brush
When he returns, he finds Marley has eaten the food in the bowl  every last scrap of spilled food
And now he's squatting to pee again
(') No, no, no
He picks up the puppy and rushes him outside
27
345  -  -  27 As John sets him down on the ground, steps back
Okay, now
Pee
He motions with his zipper
(') 'mon, man, do your thing
(Marley just stares) Alright, 'm gonna show you this one time
From behind, we see John peeing
(') Except you gotta lift your leg
(lifts his leg) See, this is how you guys do it
Marley looks at him, squats and pees
(') Or you could do it like that
Just not in front of other guy dogs
28
' '  -  28 Jenny's on the phone
Her young  and  wait for her, a board game on the floor between them
She motions that she'll just be a second
23
28 28 : Marley
like that
29
345  -  29 John's on the phone, talking to Jenny as he follows Marley around the room, trying to keep shoes and socks and cords out of his mouth
Are you sure
Because it can be temporary
:  & No, it's good
() He must be exhausted
Oh, yeah, he's pooped
Marley lets out a  as he tugs at a couch cushion
( ) Oh, he sounds so sweet
Yeah
(snapping his fingers at the dog, shaking his head "no") He's very cute
Just like a little kid only furrier
Put the phone by his ear
John chases after the dog who burrows under the couch, his tail sticking out so that John can't get him
Uh, okay, he's listening
John just holds the phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk
(into the phone) Hey, Marley
Who's my good boy
Mommy can't wait to meet you
24
29 29 : Anyway, don't worry, he's doing great
Like he's lived here his whole life
All eight weeks of it
And you know what else
think he's going to be pretty easy to train
mean, he's curious which means he's smart, right
Of course he is
can't wait to see him
Just him
Jealous
'm not the one sleeping in a box
love you
'll see you Friday
30
-  30 John, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden box on the garage floor
'll see you in the morning, okay
Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression
John hesitates
(') Aw, come on, don't
You'll be fine, alright
And tomorrow, we're gonna tear it up
'm thinking kibble, park, chew toy, the whole nine yards
Okay
we good
Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad
John turns and gets out of there
31
-  31 John gets into his car
He can hear
Big day tomorrow
Rest up, pal
He listens a beat; Marley quiets down
He gets in his car
25
32
-  32 Journalist hang out
'John and Sebastian at the bar
Many know Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout: So 'm there in this cave, right
Blindfolded
And  can feel the machine guns, there's like nine of 'em around me
and they tie me to a chair and then Escobar comes in and says-- are you ready
( ) read your piece on Kadahfi, And think you captured his narcissism just right
() Can you believe that
Some of it
Man,  wish you could've been there
Yeah, but then  wouldn't have been able to do the piece on the water main break at the library
That would have sucked
(hand on John's shoulder) Your time will come, amigo
'll drink to that-- They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at his watch
You gotta be somewhere
Oh
No, it's the puppy
It's his first -- You got adoc
26
32 32 : Marley
little lab
Like you said
Remember
The bomb
Oh, right
Smart move
You'll see
(slaps him on the back) You've just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two years
33 33
345   -- John pulls up, gets out of his car
Halfway down the block, we see a  , lights flashing, two  talking to a
Another , in his robe, stands in the street watching
Millers got robbed again
(then, turns to John) And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up since you left
John looks towards the garage where we hear
34
345   -  -  34 The door opens and the puppy gets excited-- No no
just wanted you to know 'm back
The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the box and pets him
(') Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay
Yeah,  know, good to see you, too
But 'm just inside the house, 'll see you in the morning
Big day tomorrow
Get some sleep
35
345  -  -  35 John gulps orange juice from the bottle
Leaves a quarter- inch, puts it back in the fridge
And now we hear from the Garage
27
36
345  -  -  36 Water running
John swallows some preventative aspirin, picks some nachos off his shirt
He turns off the water
And we hear  and  coming from the garage
37
345  -  -  37 John has his head buried under the pillows Finally, John can't take it anymore
He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears
38 38
- As the light comes on and Marley's head appears over the top of the box
John sighs, comes over and scoops him up
39
345  -  -  39 John gets Marley settled in the box, now by the side of the bed
Just this one time
John climbs into bed, shuts off the light
Marley whimpers and John rolls onto his stomach, reaches into the box and strokes his back, the puppy lays down, still whimpers
(') Oh, come on
() Hey
Remember this
(half drunk, sings badly) One love, one heart
( ) Let's get together and feel alright
John nods off, one arm hanging over the side of the bed into the box, his hand resting on Marley's back as the puppy now snoozes peacefully and we then

g
, wagging
:  - 28
40 40 : As John opens his eyes to see Marley snuggled up against his face
Marley's eyes looking into his
John reaches over the puppy and shuts off the alarm
She comes home today
Hung over, he sits up, looks around the messy room, half due to John's bachelor housekeeping habits, half due to Marley
Not only has everything has been chewed, but some time during the night Marley discovered how much fun toilet paper is
(') We should probably clean up
41
345  -  41 John vacuums, struggles to empty the bag, puts a broken vase in the trash, does the dishes, etc
Marley follows him, tail wreaking havoc, knocking over everything that isn't nailed down
John picks up the    he'd just bought and examines it as Marley runs into the bathroom
Huh
It's already completely gnawed up
John looks at Marley who emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper, rams right into the screen door, bounces back
(') Marley, it's a screen, you're not gonna -- Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few steps, gets a head of steam, then rams into it again, this time goes right through it
(') --there
42
-  42 John gets drenched as he gives Marley a bath
43
-  43 John drags Marley into the garage
'll be back in an hour
Be good

He gets to the car just as the rain hits
45 45
- As John and Jenny kiss outside the terminal
She holds a stuffed "Pluto
" How's my puppy
'm okay
little tired, but -- She nudges him
He gives her another kiss
(') He's waiting for you
46
345  -  -  46 John and Jenny get out of the car
We hear  in the garage
Marley
She takes off for the side door of the garage
47
345  -  -  47 They open the door and freeze
Oh my God
It's a mess
It's almost incredible that it's all due to a single puppy
The box is in shreds; so are the blankets puddle of urine on the floor
large piece of dry wall has been chewed off near the big garage door
The garbage cans are overturned
Marley is whimpering in the corner
Wow
Okay, this is not how  left it
How long has he been in here
3a/06/07 30
47 : 47 An hour, at the most
(looks around, then) Jeez
he Alg drywall
That's just not right
(she picks him up) Look
He's shaking-- Another bit of  and the puppy whimpers louder
(') Does thunder scare you, Mister
Hm
He licks her face, snuggles into her
She gives him the Pluto stuffed animal
She hugs him
(') Look at us
She looks up at John and smiles
He returns the smile
Mission accomplished
48
345   -  48 As Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's bras in his mouth
Marley, no
Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the newspaper
He gave me an extra paragraph
Marley bursts through the back screen door
49
345   -  -  49 seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now who comes through the screen into the backyard now clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to the rod, and it's now  who stumbles through the broken wire mesh to chase after him
Marley, no
John chases him across the backyard
Marley goes under the fence and John starts to go over into
31
50 50
'  - And now it's a     who comes up from under the fence clutching a   in his mouth
And now it's Jenny  John who go over the fence chasing him
Marley, no
They wave to the  standing on his patio watching
(') Hi, Tom-- Sorry
Happy Thanksgiving
Marley goes through a hedge and out onto
51
-  51 Where Marley emerges into  a   , rapidly pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway
We track with him until a and Marley gets the two women entangled as he starts humping the smaller dog
Marley, no
52 52
- - '  - John sits across from Arnie
He looks thrown: don't understand, why me
'm in a bind, John
But 'm a reporter, not a columnist
It's a step up
Yeah, but it's a step away from what wanna do
It's also better pay, you set your own hours, pick your own topics
() 32
52 52 : (') and it's only temporary, just until find someone permanent
What happened to Jerry
You may have noticed that in every other column, he went on about The Pie Palace
really haven't read his-- Turns out he's been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint
It's also why he became such a fat ass
John nods
Oh
(') Anyway, it's twice a week
And like said, it's only until  can find someone else to replace him
Then you're back on, uh
whatever beat you were on
53
345   -  53 17- John pulls up, gets out of the car
His neighbors, The year-old  -- short blue hair, pierced eyebrow -- and her -- in a nurses uniform -- unload groceries from the car
Your dog's funny
() Uh, thanks
He tried to eat one of our tires
Yeah, well, dogs need rubber
Little known fact, helps the digestive tract
Right
Along with the occasional black Converse high top which 'd still love to get back by the way
33
53 53 : 'll do what  can
'Preciate that
54 54
- John sits at the table scribbling on a legal pad
He tears off the sheet and crumples it up, throws it across the room
Marley bounds into the room, Jenny behind him, sweating
think he dislocated my shoulder
He doesn't heel-- hell, he doesn't even walk, he sprints, and  had to pull him off three dogs
Poodle
Yeah, among others
There was a Yorkie, a Dalmatian and a bichon frise that may never be right again
(sees the legal pad) What're you doing
Arnie gave me a column
You're kidding
Congratulations
Oh, yeah, it's a big honor
get to write about zoning laws and yard sales
bet you make something out of it
It's only temporary until he finds someone else
'm just trying to get something down for Tuesday
She gives him a kiss, starts out of the room You'll think of something
And John, 'm serious abut Marley
He wreaks havoc everywhere he goes
We gotta do something
34
55 55
- , weathered and stern, is studying John
Behind John, eight puppies and their owners are chatting before the class begins
Incorrigible
don't believe in that
All dogs want to learn
But they can't when their owners are weak-willed
'm very strong-willed
And where is your animal
He's over there
With my wife
He was a little excited
He usually needs a little time to calm down
Ms
Kornblut looks at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley
see
He calls the shots
Which of you will be the trainer
we thought we both would, since we want him to listen to both of us at home - dog can only answer to one master
Which one of you has the most natural authority in your own relationship
() 'll watch
thought so
We begin
56
-  56 As Ms
Kornblut gestures, demonstrates the command: Sit
35
56 56 : The students order their dogs to sit, and most of them do
The ones that don't require only a little effort to get the idea
Whereas: Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her and puts his paws on her shoulders
She presses his butt to the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub
She tries to tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth, shaking it playfully
(') That, class, is an example of a dog that has been foolishly allowed to believe he is the alpha male of his pack
And therefore he cannot be a happy animal
(from the sidelines) Yeah, he looks really bummed
Kornblut hears him, death stares John
You
Joker
Rotate in
John looks at Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to take
57  :     57 As Ms
Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist
The choke chain
When your animal walks properly by your side, there'll be slack
If he pulls, it tightens around his neck like a noose and loosens as soon as he stops pulling
Does it hurt them
Well, it's not called a hug chain
But they learn to like it
Go on, collar your dogs
Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around their dogs' necks
Of course
Meanwhile: John kneels down and struggles to put it
around Marley's neck
Marley, liking its shiny jingling, tries to eat it
36
57 : 57 Much tussling, and John finally gets it around Marley's neck - but Marley still manages to grab it in his teeth
He likes it
That's because he's eating it
Get it out of his mouth
Class
Give your dogs the sit command
All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down
(') The leash is held in two places
Loop around your right hand, left hand at waist level
Dog always on your left, of course
That means us, pal
He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left
Now, when you give the heel command, step off with your left foot -  don't want to see any right foot first steppers - and walk
If your dog gets ahead, administer a correction by forcefully bring your left hand down and towards the right, and he'll respond
Shall we
One, two, three - now
Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley lurches ahead of the pack
Marley, heel
Marley takes off like a fighter jet, dragging John behind
Correct him
John gives a mighty yank on the leash
Marley coughs, hesitates
John loosens the leash - and Marley explodes forward again
John yanks, Marley stops, John releases, Marley explodes forward
37
57 : (2) 57 (') Rein in that dog
All right, everyone, line up again
Demonstration
Mr
Grogan
Pay attention
She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into line with the other dogs
(') It's a simple question of confidence in one's own authority
Shall demonstrate a simple walk
Be my guest
Class
Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader
Marley
Heel
And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more confident than she is
He lunges, she pulls, he falls back on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward
Ms
Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park
She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process begins again as they make their way back to the line
Her face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball
It's like a walking tug-of-war
With difficulty, Ms
Kornblut manages to return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping her leg enthusiastically
She struggles, he knocks her down, and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee
John and Jenny rush over
John restrains Marley; Jenny helps up Mrs
Kornblut
She's livid
(') That's it
He's out
He usually just does this with poodles
(looking at her bad perm) Maybe it's the hair
He's a bad influence on the others
Leg-humping is a virus
Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go
38
58 58
345   - As they follow Marley back into the house
Well, that was fun
(to the dog) Congratulations, Marley
You flunked obedience school
You know, John, there is something else we can do-- (looks at her) No, no, 'm not doing that to him
It's painless
And he'll be a lot more comfortable
It'll calm him down
Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer
Because he'll have nothing to look forward to
What're you talking about
There are plenty of other things that'll make him -- That's where you're wrong
Trust me, Jen:  know
'm a guy
And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only thing we really look forward to is sex
Runner up: the possibility of sex
Oh, Please
Every book says he'll live -- It'll just feel longer
John, he's out of control
It's the right thing to do
John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy
39
59 59
'  - Jenny at the wheel
John in the passenger seat
Marley in the back, his front paws balanced on the center console
It won't be so bad, buddy
You'll see
Sex is overrated
Marley looks-at him
(') Okay, 'm lying, and  think you know that
so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it
Jenny cuts him a look
He lowers his voice
(') Poor son-of-a-bitch
guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells
Marley crawls onto John's lap
(') Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here
Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to catch the fresh air (') Least  can do
John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out
(') Here you go
John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like he's drunk
(') He's so happy
He has no idea what's about to happen to him
Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the car
He's making me nervous
40
59 59 : He's fine
He just wants a little -- Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass
John, grab him
Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving car
He's onto our evil plan, and he's making a break for it
But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for a foothold
60 60
- As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his tail
He trots along the pavement with his front paws
61 61
- Jenny gets the car stopped,
Uh, little help here
John's stuck
He can't pull the dog back in the window and he can't open the door
He can't let go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them
John hangs on for dear life
got him
62 62
- As Jenny puts on the flashers and gets out of the car, runs around to the passenger side
a group of cars drive slowly by in the other direction, all watching and laughing
() What are you looking at
He's losing his balls today
Cut the guy some slack
41
63 63
-  - John sits at his desk, tries to write a column
Sebastian, in a flak jacket, pauses at his desk
Strip mall get approved
Riveting planning commission vote
Knuckle-biter
8 to 1
You up for a beer
Can't,  gotta finish the column
Maybe tomorrow
Can't, 'll be in
Part of that drug piece 'm doing-- Right
Another time then
John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big smile as he passes
John sits there another moment, looks at his desk
photo of him and Jenny
One of Marley with a flip flop in his mouth
John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts typing a new one
64
'  -  64 John sits anxiously across from Arnie who sits at his desk reading
The editor's expression is grim as he looks up at John
'm really sorry, 'll go back and do the zoning piece-- The hell you sorry for
It's hilarious
John sits back down, looks at Arnie
See, the thing is, Arnie's face doesn't say "hilarious," but
Shooting Draft  42
&  64 64 : (') loved it
Getting kicked out of obedience school, the humping, the "Great Escape," all of it
Hysterical
Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the paper back to John
(') Run it
As is
Thank you, sir
John starts out of the office
Hey, Gorgan
() Tell him not to feel bad
Sooner or later, we all lose our balls
'll be sure to pass that on
65 65
-  - Live music, a sexy vibe
John and Jenny sit outside in the hot Florida night
Dinner over, John raises his glass
To two years
That was fast
Good, though, right
Really good
He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one
So
What's next
was thinking desert
No,  mean on your list
43
65 65 : My list
ed, Remember, when we first got marri you had this whole checklist, with like the game plan
Right
So what came next
Let's see
a new car maybe
afterthat
We can do that
What was () You sure you wanna know
Yeah
well, it was between a new roof and a baby
He studies her for a long moment, then
can probably live with a few leaks
Really
Because a leak can turn into something bigger
and that can be a big responsibility
know
was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step
Well, we've already fixed Marley
Literally
( ) 44
Marley & He Shooting Draft 65 65 : (2) You're serious about this
think so
t an And you know we're not talking abou actual roof here
Yeah,  got that
She looks back at him, finally nods
They are
Then
Okay
Maybe, instead of tying to have a baby, we should stop trying to not have one
If 'm following you correctly -- and think  am -- this is the part where we go home and get it on, right
Bingo
66 66
- him
As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing Things getting hot and heavy quickly
As they kiss
Honey
Yeah
Did you eat some kibble
What
And now they part and we see ' , watching, panting up a storm
(') Marley-- get out of here
45- &  66 66 : it's fine, he's a dog, he doesn't what he's looking at
Oh, he knows, and trust me, he the hell out of me right now
Go on, Marley
Get out
But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of -- Marley
And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick their faces
67 67
'  - Silence
Arnie reads John's column, his face dead serious
This is even funnier than the last one
Thank you, sir
You're good, Gorgan
And not just the dog stuff
The piece on the women of Boca last week
What'd you call them
Boccahontis
Hilarious
John nods, starts for the door
(') Is it true what you wrote
You and the wife are trying to have a kid
Well, we're not really trying
How's that work
Excuse me
46
&  67 67 : Are you having sex
Yes
ant
With the intention of getting pregn i guess
Congratulations
You're trying
John just stands there
Arnie looks back at him

Just in case you wanted to come home

John stands just behind the father who bounces in place trying unsuccessfully to soothe the baby
' Daddy
And now, another , 4-year-old girl, jumps up in and out of frame
wanna push the button
Daddy can't lift you right now-- (jumps up again) You said  could push the button
Alright, okay, 'll just-- He tries to pick her up without leaning over
Ow
You're hurting me
Okay, you know what
Never mind, no button
very uncomfortable John now steps forward
You want me to give her a hand
Oh-- would you mind
John lifts the girl up to the panel
She runs her hands, from top to button, down the panel, pressing every single button
(') Sarah
Goddammit-- 48
70 70 : And now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the baby, while a trapped John backs up into the corner
71 71
345   - John gets out of the car
The young Girl next door gives him a wave as she starts down the sidewalk with her boyfriend
Hi
Hi
John watches the young couple go, arms around each other
72 72
345   - John enters and is greeted as usual by Marley who jumps on him
Hey, boy
( ) Jenny
Out in a sec
John stands there, Marley looking at him
(to the dog) So
This is us not trying
The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky two-piece thing
Hey, Sailor
She walks into the bedroom
John looks back at Marley as he follows her into the bedroom
Catch you later, buddy
And closes the door on the dog
73
-  73 John and Sebastian sit at the bar
49
73 : 73 So the puppy wasn't enough
Well, technically, we're not trying
But you know Jenny
But things are good right now, just as they are, right
Yeah, things are really good
So why change it up with a kid mean, have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale
The bomb, right
Yes
The bomb
And just so we're clear, the countdown sequence has been reactivated
By you
Well, it's been a few months and nothing's happened
Which actually makes me wonder if-- Mr
Grogan

Really funny stuff

Seriously, man, your stuff is classic
Well, it's just temporary, but thanks

John starts out of the bar
Sebastian calls after him
Tick tick tick
74 74
345  - Romantic Music on the stereo
John comes in, wearily, absently pets Marley
He goes into the bedroom
The bathroom door is open
John sits down on the bed
You know, this baby thing
been thinking maybe we should take a break
You know
Obviously, it's not happening
Maybe that's nature's way of saying it's not good timing
No sound from Jenny
He struggles on
51
74 74 : (') Maybe this is a sign that we're not ready for this
mean, have we really thought this through
Because-- He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door
From her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip
'm pregnant
(, then) Great
Wow, that's
great
But you just said Yeah, no,  mean-- okay, this is definitely awkward now, but
You wanna start over

'  - As John hands Arnie his latest column
That's probably the last one about Marley for a while
But in about nine months, 'm gonna have a new subject, might be just as fun
Jenny's pregnant
() 'm very happy for you
Have you bought her a present
What
gift, John
She's carrying a child
Your child
Don't you think that's worth something
Uhhh
You don't wanna make the mistake  did
Listen to me
There's gonna come a time, she's fat, she's nauseous, her ankles are swollen, and she's gonna look at you, and this is what that look will mean: "You bastard
You did this to me
You dick, you ruined me
" But then
() Shooting Draft  53
& 75 75 : (') she's gonna remember that little ring, bracelet, anklet, whatever, that you bought her, and she's gonna feel better

Jenny and John on the couch
She removes a beautiful gold necklace from a box and holds it up
Oh, John, it's beautiful
She sets it down on the coffee table, then moves close to him
(') Thank you
She kisses him
was just thinking about you when walked by the store and saw it in the window
That is so sweet
Put it on
She turns back to the coffee table and looks around
Where'd it go
It was right here
You just put it down
It can't have -- And then he stops
Looks off
So does Jenny
54
76 76 : Oh God
Marley stands a few feet away, looking strangely gleeful glint of Gold in the moonlight dangles from his mouth
They both get up, start to move towards him
(') Hey, boy
Come here
Look what  got for you
We don't want any trouble
Yeah, here's a little something-- (imaginary) treat
Marley She reaches into her pocket for an moves looks at her
Is this a trick
He considers
Then he closer
John tiptoes up behind him, ever so slowly
(') just want to give you a treat and a big kiss
That's a boy
Inch by inch, Marley approaches her
But then, behind Marley, John knocks against a table
Marley freezes
He made me
Go
Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John leaps at him from behind
Marley skitters away
Ah, a game
He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his puts his head to the ground
John feints, tries to maneuver Marley back into Jenny
Jenny finally grabs him from behind
John pries open his mouth
Nothing
He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny
(') Uh-oh
77
345   -  - John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop
He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into the lawn
Nothing
(
) Dr
Jay's sending over a laxative
Yay
78
345  -  - John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops
Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes
( ) You know, years ago, when  pictured my life, somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride's swallowed and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn't spring to mind
( ) Aha
Jackpot

Amazing

He did us a favor
And  only threw up eight times

Thank you
The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a little train
That's normal

Not that  care
He can be any sex he wants
Male, female, we don't care
Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever
Shhhhh
hang on
She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker
Nothing
(') Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending on how the baby is lying
- You're ten weeks, right
Next Monday, yes
Might be a little early for that
Let's go right to the sonogram
Did you bring your blank tape
(waving it, smiling) Ready to roll
Let's get a good picture first
It'll be on the monitor there
The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's stomach
John and Jenny peer at the computer screen
(') () Hmmm
This one doesn't seem to be picking up anything
Excuse me, 'll be just a minute
She leaves
Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand
We wait for a few moments
pressured silence
And then
smiles down at comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny
Hi, guys
Let's have a look at your baby, shall we
() Shooting Draft  57
& 80 80 : (2) (') (he takes the instrument) All right, there we go
Good
Now, look over there
Much better resolution, right
Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen
They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr
Sherman expands and expands
But it's empty
Jenny tries to smile
Is there anything in there
Not what you'd expect to see at ten weeks
Not quite ten weeks
Dr
Sherman looks at them directly
Kindly: Jenny, 'm sorry, but there's no heartbeat
John and Jenny are still, silent
(') One in six pregnancies ends this way
it just happens sometimes, that's all
'm very sorry
But you're young and healthy and in a couple of months, you can try again
() Why don't you come by my office on your way out and we can talk some more
He exits
John is still holding the blank videotape
He tries to hide it from Jenny
He leaves
Jenny and John look at each other
How could this happen
What'd  do wrong
You didn't do anything-- must have
Otherwise, how could lose it
58
80 80 : (3) Jenny, it's not something you have any control over
It's like the doctor said, it just happens-- Not to me
did something wrong know it
did something wrong
'm sorry, John
Don't say that-- But  am-- 'm sorry-- don't need sorry
You didn't do anything
She turns away and begins to cry
John just sits there, staring at the videotape in his hands
Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly
Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made even worse
81 81
-  () John is driving Jenny home
In a couple of months, we can try again
Okay
Jenny just looks out the window
82 82
345  -  - John helps Jenny through the kitchen door
Marley follows them, circles them wildly, then stops, puzzled, as he looks at them
Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows her
You want some tea
( ) Hey, you know what  was thinking
We still have those tickets from your parents for the honeymoon in Ireland
We can finally do that
() 59
82 : 82 (') Take some time off
It'll be fun, clear our heads, right
( ) Jenny
No answer
He goes into the living room and stops cold: '  -  & Jenny sits on the couch
Marley stands at her feet, with his shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap
His tail hangs flat between his legs
His eyes are turned up at her, and he whimpers softly
Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning, buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins sobbing
They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue- still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll
John stands there, watching Marley take care of her
No words, just being there
lesson here
Her head down, Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the couch and wraps his arms around both of them
We then
(
) Oh
He's

345   -   -  83 With difficulty, John holds back Marley to protect  --- 19, glasses, bookish, the house sitter -- from his affection
Yeah
Close to a hundred pounds
(re: the leash struggle) He just wants to say hi
He won't hurt you
Just stand still and be calm
You're a dog person, right
well, actually - - Ready

John releases Marley who springs on Debby, knocking her back
Shooting Draft 3106/07 60

Shhh
It's not the mattress
It's the shrieks of over-sexed souls in hell

She hobbles to the car, tries to get in with her crutches
They frustrate her and she ends up beating the ground with them until she throws them down
She's losing it

But that's not a dog
That's evil with a dog face
That's also humping your leg

Marley goes through his nighttime : He chews through a sock
He drinks out of the toilet
He works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub
Another night and he'll be in
He chases a fly
Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom
He settles himself down to sleep
He yawns, he scratches, he closes his eyes
He snores
And then - He wakes up, suddenly alert
He looks over at Jenny
He gets up, sits by her side of the bed, and waits
Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her stomach

He takes a step towards John

He starts beating at the Styrofoam
Marley barks excitedly
John gets an idea, hands him one end of the box
Come on, Marley
Help me out here
Do what you do best
Unsure, Marley licks the box
(') No, don't lick it, eat it
Destroy it
You can chew through drywall, man know you can do this
Marley catches on
He starts shredding the box

Hello, Marley
She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back
And that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog freezes
Where'd that come from
We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the car seat that we now see sitting on the bed
You know what  think would be a bummer
If he ate the baby

116 116 : She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we see the baby for the first time
She smiles at Marley
This is Patrick, Marley
Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down beside Marley and lets the dog sniff the baby's toes, then up his legs, finally his diaper which puts Marley into a Pampers stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley's eyes glaze
(') See, he's not gonna hurt him
No, but 'm gonna have to put a lock on the diaper pail

Second of all, you don't have that many friends
Thank you
What  was trying to say, is that our life is here
Baby,  got news for you, our life is wherever we are

Marley runs for him as he builds up speed

John gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up
Hit me, 'm open
Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff- arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off him as he gives the play-by-play
(') My God, look at Grogan-- two three- hundred pound linemen literally hanging off him, but he won't be denied
And now Marley jumps on them
(') Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from the Strong Safety and the unthinkable happens
And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the
steps, Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get
Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the steps
Mommy says dinner and take off your shoes
Alright

They all get up, start up the steps
Marley follows, takes one step when his hind legs buckle
John looks back at him
106
185 185 : (') You okay, boy
'mon
Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out
He looks up at them
What's wrong with him, Daddy
() Nothing's wrong
He's just tired
Right, Dad
John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's protecting his little brother
That's right

got a tube down which let out some of the gas think i untwisted it
So he's okay
For now
But once this happens, it almost always happens again
And if it does, there's not gonna be anything can do
He's too old for that kind of surgery
What if it doesn't happen again
More than likely, it will
But what if it doesn't

204 204 : (') Marley
Hey, boy
Marley looks up briefly as if he heard something, but then returns to eating
John is right behind him
John reaches out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally guilty
Then he turns and greets John
(') What's the matter, boy
You didn't hear me
Huh
He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then
(') Let's go for a walk
205 205
- As John walks Marley off leash up a hill
At one point, John has to stop and wait for Marley to catch up
Come on, boy, just a little further to the top
Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy
John looks at him, can see how tired he is
(') You know what, this is a good spot right here
John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the damp earth beside Marley
(') Let's just sit for a while
The two of them sit there, looking out at the beautiful countryside below
John strokes Marley for a moment
Looks at the grey hair, the tired eyes that now look back at him
(') Hey
So
you're gonna tell me, right
When it's time
Because don't wanna make that decision on my own
So you just let me know when you're ready, okay
Marley rests his chin on John's arm
116
205 205 : (') Okay
206 206
- Jenny is at the top of the stairs
Marley
(turns to John) Have you seen him
He's not up here
207 207
- John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the dying fire
guess  could move his bed down here
John sits down beside Marley
(') Man
He's always slept with us
Now he can't even make it upstairs
He looks pretty comfortable to me
() 'll go get his bed
Hey Jen
why don't you grab a blanket for me, too
She nods, starts back up the stairs
John grabs a pillow from the couch and lays down beside Marley
(') This is a good spot
may never sleep upstairs again
(
) Hey
Scooch over
He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket
She lies down with them
John puts his arm around them both
Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor
117
207 207 : (') Just like old times
208 208
- John sits across from his editor
It'd be twice a week
Six hundred words
And what's the subject
Everyday stuff
The stuff we all go through
But funnier
don't get it
thought you came here to be a reporter
did, but  think we both know that isn't me
'm a columnist
good one
sticks her head in the office
John-- your wife's on the phone
She says it's important
'll be right there
(to the editor) Think about it
209 209
- Jenny on the phone, looking out into the backyard
can't get him back inside
He's lying out there in cold
and he won't move
210 210
- Late afternoon
John's car pulls up
118
211
-   -  211 Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor
Marley is lying on the dining room floor, breathing heavily
Patrick came home and we got him here
Dr
Platt said if he's comfortable, leave him here for a while and see
But he's no better
John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag his tail or lick his hand
He runs his hand over his coat - then over his stomach, the dog flinches
'm taking him in
The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed sheep
Is he sick again
Yeah, he is, honey
But 'm going to take him to the hospital and they'll try to make him better
Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face
Get better, Mar
You can take Lamby, okay
(she puts the stuffed animal next to him) But don't chew her other ear off
Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in : Goodbye
When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's crying, that he knows what the other two don't
212
' -  212 John lifts Marley out of the car
Marley seems a little more alert
119
212 212 : You wanna walk
He sets him down gingerly
Hesitantly, Marley walks over to the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then looks around
John looks around, too
It's a crisp spring night in Pennsylvania
Takes a breath
(') Nice night, huh
Marley looks around, then looks at John
There's something in his expression
John nods, knows what he's saying
(') Okay, boy
(as Marley moves close) Okay
John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the front steps of the clinic
213 213
- John stands as Dr
Platt comes out
did everything that worked before
But no luck
There's still surgery, '-- --not strong enough
There's blood in his stomach
The lining might be compromised
don't know what we'll find if we go in there anyway
Can you give me a minute
need to
need to call my wife
214 214
- John's on his cell phone
( ) It's me
It's the stomach thing again
Nothing's working
They could do surgery, but
120
215 215
-  - Jenny listens to John on the phone
know
Jenny nods as tears come
They stay on the phone, quiet, just being with each other
Finally: (') love you, John
216 216
- ( ) love you
217 217
- John enters
Marley is on the table, zonked out
Dr
Platt has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm
'll give you some time
She goes
John stares down at Marley
Takes the stuffed lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw
When John puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open
His tail  gently
Hey, buddy
He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body
His coat, still shedding
His tail
He takes up each paw, each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time
He leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him in
Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's level
He looks into Marley's eyes
(') Listen, you know all that stuff we always said about you
What a total pain you are
The world's worst dog
Well, don't you believe it
Don't believe it for a minute
You loved us, every day, no matter what
And that's a pretty amazing thing
(he leans in) () 121
217 : 217 (') Look,  don't know where you're going from here, but you remember this: You're a great dog, Marley
You are a great dog
218
-  -  218 In the , Jenny sits on the bed, the phone in her hand, waiting, we
219
-  219 Dr
Platt is in the room now
John, his hand on one of Marley's paws, kneels on the ground, looking at Marley, Marley lays on the table, looking right back at him
He won't feel a thing
He'll just slip away
Are you ready
(looking at Marley) We're ready
Dr
Platt inserts the needle into the
and presses the plunger
220
-  220 As a pajama-clad Patrick slips a tape into the
221
-  221 As we now   ' , slowly beginning to close
222
-  -  222 As Jenny sits vigil by the phone, we
223
-  223 As Patrick sits alone in the dark living room, his face illuminated by the , as he watches   from Grogan family home videos: --  rides on Marley's back through the house at 345 Churchill, young Marley's tail knocking over everything within range, toddler and dog both joyous
122
224 224
- As Marley's eyes finally close
The  drifts to John's hand, stroking Marley's side
Dr
Platt listens to Marley's heart and says: He's gone
, the dog on the table, the doctor discreetly going to the side, and John laying his head next to Marley and putting his arms around him as we now
225 225
- As the five Grogans walk across the-property
Colleen sits on John's shoulders
They reach a clearing where we see a small grave has been dug
John sets Colleen down
He's wrapped in his blanket
So he'll be warm
You guys want to read your letters
Mine is a picture
Of me and Marley
And grasshoppers
And ice cream
Mommy wrote what  said
"Dear Marley
will never forget you, forever
" And those are kisses
It's beautiful, honey
He'll like it
Drop it in
Conor
Conor reads his piece of paper
"Dear Marley
loved you all my life
hope you like heaven and that there's lots to chew on
Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan
" John puts his hand on Conor's shoulder as Conor drops in the letter into the grave
Patrick
Do you want to say anything
225 225 : He knows
'd like to give him something
Jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace John gave Jenny when she first got pregnant
(') This little necklace has been on quite a journey
John smiles at her, remembering
So much shared history
Your dad gave this to me to celebrate the beginning of our family
But you know what
Our family had already begun
She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the blanket, lets her hand rest there a moment, then stands up
Good-bye, Clearance Puppy
: 226
-  226 John puts few big stones on top of the tamped-down earth
He sits on his haunches beside the grave, looks up at the house across the yard
'  - All lit up
We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready
John sits there watching them
watching his family
The family that both he and Marley grew up in
He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and heads for home
