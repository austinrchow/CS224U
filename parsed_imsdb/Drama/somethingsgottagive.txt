' Nancy Meyers June 14, 2002 1
We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"
-     - Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body
Club in
long line waits to get in
couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly" let inside
Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle
(
) Ahhhh
The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of The Younger Woman
That fleeting age when everything just falls right into place
It's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere -- absolutely helpless
Some say 'm an expert on The Younger Woman
Guess that's 'cause 've been dating them for over forty years
What is it about him
Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth
something about this guy is just so damn appealing
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his arm
He's confident, cool, enviable
We're in: - The place is full
Everybody is somebody here
(to Hostess) Langer
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him
' Mr
Langer, got your table waiting
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other Couples
Young Couples
Middle-aged couples
Not talking Couples
(
) So what does a life of bucking the system all add up to
2
(
) (') To never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings
No his and her  accounts, no mini van parked in the garage
think it's made me what  am today
(Harry smiles to someone across the room) The luckiest son of a bitch on earth
Look at me
'm positively debonair should be illegal 'm lookin' so good
Harry passes a table where a     dines with his  , -
, Harry and The Beaten Man catch each other's glance
(
) It isn't as if  haven't wondered what my life would be like if  was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month with a dame my age' for a porterhouse and a side of spinach
've wondered
- ' Harry  all over again
This time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket
With him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about (
) No, come on, let's be honest
a dame really my age
- '  - Again, the identical set up
Harry  again
This time he looks ten years older
The bounce to his step is gone
The twinkle in his eye, long dead
On his arm is a 63 , built just like Harry
The Maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table
(
) There you have it
The story in a nutshell
Not exactly debonair, am
(Harry , his wife looks disgusted) Awww, man, it's down right sad
Look at me
look like 'm about to die
God help me
do not want to die
: 3
-   - Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into
Harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large
Next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl
An "" Girl
Smart, sexy and built for fun
She has perfected flirting to an art
Her hand rests on Harry's neck
There's a good thirty year age difference between them
Her name is
She along with Ja Rule, now coming from a
( singing) To all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what  do
To all my
(stops) Oh
This is it
Make a right
(admiring the neighborhood) So baby, you're rich
Well, my mother is, sort of
Not really
If she lives within a mile of here, she's rich
guess a hit play will buy you a house in The Hamptons
'd like to meet your mother
No you wouldn't
mean, she's great
She's totally brilliant, but she's not your type
You're overlooking one of the great things about me
don't have a type
(very directly) She's over thirty
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt
Oh, what
Like you don't know you have a slight reputation for
4
Just then the
Harry keeps looking at Marin
-- For what
Harry waits
He doesn't look away
For never dating anyone over 30
Don't look at me like that
It's just not true
Okay
Sorry
Over 31
Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The Hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass
(answers phone) Hold on
(then to Marin) It just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me
You ever think of it that way
No, it's always me
You dames are all alike
(then into phone) Hey
(amused, to herself) Dames
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh
(into phone) Vh-huh
'll call back Monday
Who else
Monday
Monday
Say you couldn't find me
Who
(glances at Marin, she's not listening) 'll call her later
No,  have it
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if' she caught that
This brand of cool is about not playing that card
Marin turns toward him, she has been listening
They've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them
5
(all business) Make a right, left at the second fence
Marin turns up the , getting herself out of whatever just came over her, looks out the window
Have  mentioned how gorgeous your breasts look in this sweater
(blushing) Yes you have actually
So it would be too much to mention it again
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway, driving toward a
Wow
It's the perfect beach house
know
My mother doesn't know how to do things that aren't perfect
Which explains you
That got her
Harry parks
She looks over at him but he's grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say such a lovely thought
(trying to keep up with him) Yeah, okay, right
They both grab their overnight bags and step out of the car
So, what are we gonna do out here, just the two of us, for two whole days
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms around his neck
Tell me the truth, are you at all glad we waited
6
'm incredibly glad we're finally going to do it
(she's a bit disappointed) If that's the same as being glad we waited, then baby doll, 'm ecstatic
Marin smiles then kisses him
He's one of those guys that lets you kiss them
(slaps her tush) Let's go for a swim, how long will it take you to change
Two minutes
Marin starts    as she dances seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's cigars
Oh Har
No smoking in the house
My Mom doesn't allow it
But she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men you're dating here to
She doesn't know everything  do
Or when  do it
or where  do it
She   her sweater and    '
It's one of those great Beach Houses
Light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house
Marin, now in a tight tank, tight pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to undress
(  her belt) The fabulous living room, perfect for entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone
( her belt then Harry's shirt) Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck complete with pool and ocean view
7
(') ( Harry's belt) Your pants, please
Ladies first
Marin provocatively  her pants and wriggles out of them
She's now in a
Gourmet kitchen's to your left where tonight  will whip you up a culinary feast of Mac and Cheese
Marin  Harry's
She turns, her as Harry's  land on a chair
Harry is now down to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile
(smiling) -kay, going quickly now
Master bedroom is that away
They arrive in a warmly decorated
And this as they say on 'Cribs', your favorite show, is where the magic happens
Do we like it
Going once, going twice
Sold
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her    and She playfully rolls on top of him
His hands cup her ass
You know when  first started auctioneering someone told me if  was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear
This sort of gives that a whole new meaning
Why
You're not nervous now, are you
'm always a little nervous
(removing his hands) So put on your bathing suit
brought some champagne, 'll put it on ice
8
Me like you, Harry Langer
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom
Harry lies there alone for a second
Catches his breath
He sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest
He waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man
Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the Living , singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself
He reaches into his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal
He sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut
Well stocked, the best of everything
Harry opens the door to the fridge and just as    , the and    from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively conversation
One of them is , Marin's Mother
The other is Erica's Younger Sister,
is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better
And not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right
Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap
She doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is
Her sister,  is in her forties
Zoe's the loose one
She wears draw string pants and a -shirt that says, " "
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the Then they      '  poking out from
They don' t move
Oh God
What is this
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife
Zoe grabs the knife
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused
(in control) Okay, stay right where you are
We have a knife
9
(eyeing the knife) Do you
live here
Okay, Mister, look, 'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move
Zoe, hand me the phone
(reaches out to Zoe without looking at her) You don't understand
'm a friend of your daughter's
With that, Harry  the fridge door
The Women see he's naked except for a Pair of Boxers
They both
Zoe the phone over to Erica who dials quickly
Yeah
don't think so
My daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on Ecstasy
(looks at phone) Shit
dialed 8-1-1
(redials) (calmly starts to move) Honestly, if you just
Back off
She was in the Israeli army
She can break you in half
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it whatsoever
(into phone) Yes
have an intruder in my house
29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack
'm dating your daughter Marin
She invited me here for the weekend
She's in her room right now, changing
( even louder, really scared now) You're dating my daughter
10
(amused) Now who would've thought that would be worse news
With that, Marin , in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the phone
Oh, fuck
Oh, God
(into phone) 'm sorry
False alarm
Yeah, no, 'm sure
No, he's not a burglar (with enormous difficulty) He's dating my daughter
Mom,  had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write
do
thought 'd do it out here
Oh, man, this is really
Awkward
Totally
but
(starts laughing) You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought he was a burglar
In his boxer shorts
Yeah, well, the world's nuts, don't know the man
(still laughing) 'm sorry, it's not really funny
'm an idiot
should've told you was bringing someone out
No, no,  should've told you we were coming
Well
Anyway, here we are
(waves to Harry) Hello
'm the mother
11
All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster shaped oven mitt over his "privates"
Harry Langer
How are ya
Yes
Sorry
Mom, this is my friend, Harry
Harry, my Mom, Erica
my Aunt, Zoe
(they all shake hands) Harry's sort of a new friend
think mentioned him in an e-mail
We just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days
Of course
Right
Great
(can't look at him) Honey, does Harry have a robe
(backing out) You know what
Actually,  think  should just take off
Let you gals enjoy your weekend
Marin shoots her Mom a look
Help
No, no, no
Don't be silly
Uh, look, here's what we'll do
Zoe and  will leave
We took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch
You two stay
Harry, apologize about the near arrest
No, you were impressive
Very strong, very
"macho"
(a little thrown) don't think  was exactly "macho" Trust me, if  ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator hope 'm half the man you were, Mrs uh
12
(already hating him) Yeah
Okay
Whatever
Marin watches
Dying
All righty then
'm definitely gonna hit the road
(salutes Erica and Zoe) Ladies
sensational meeting you
(then to Marin) Doll, call me
Hold on
Hold on
Let's not get so dramatic here
What are we four teenagers
We're all sophisticated people
Why can't we all stay, for the weekend
Your mother's got work to do 've got papers to grade
You'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together
If we don't, we don't
There's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend
Seriously
can handle it
can totally handle it
(on the spot) mean, well,  can "handle" it
The Women all look to Harry
He looks at Marin
She's hard to resist
It can only go up from here
: Walking past  on the
They are both licking ice cream cones
(
) He's obviously a penis substitute
13
Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries
mean a father substitute
Except he's older than her father can't even look at them
What is she doing with a guy that age
Marin was how old when you guys broke up
Five years ago, so
twenty-three
Okay, so she was old enough not to feel Dave was walking out on her
Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out on me
Why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out
Just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved
Easy cowgirl
didn't mean it that way
Just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy
Mme
Barry, que je puis vous obtenir aujourd'hui
The Girl stands     in: Gourmet Market in East Hampton
The clientele in here is as rich looking as the food
Erica stands on the other side of the Cheese Counter
Bonjour je veux une partie de votre pate merveilleux et de votre meilleur fromage absolu de chevre
14
Harry and Marin shop near by
Harry listens to Erica out of one ear
That's impressive
She started French lessons after she and my Dad split up
Part of her "Keep Busy, Don't Look Back" program
She's practically fluent now
(turning back to Marin) Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou devrions jefaire quelgue chose
(with an impeccable accent) Laissons quelque chose d'achat
Et ce grand gateau de chocolat
Hey, not bad
(shrugs) Yeah
well
am fluent
Be right back
Marin crosses to the dessert counter
Erica turns back and catches Harry checking out Marin's ass
He smiles as he licks his ice cream
Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior
It's an epidemic
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in their Eighties with their arms linked
Almost woozy, Erica is snapped out of it when she is handed her package
Merci madame
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to her
Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her
(backing off) Woops
Sorry
15
My fault
They so very badly do not want to actually touch
Erica hesitates
Harry gestures for her to go first then walks alongside her
So, Harry
What do you do
'm one of the owners of a record company among other things
Oh, really
Which record company
Drive by Records
(appalled at the name) "Drive By" Records
Is that a joke
What is that
It's a Hip Hop label
Hip Hop
Oh, rap
Oh, right
Well
(with disdain) Okay
That's
"interesting"
Let me see if  get where you're headed here
'm sorry, but, look, you know  hate rap,  mean  do
It's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic
Hey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry
Yeah, but come on, how many words can you rhyme with 'Bitch'
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter
(joining Harry) How we doin
16
Should've left when she tried to arrest me
'   - Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster
Zoe pours wine and Erica tosses a salad
Harry is the only one sitting
So, Mom, how's the new play
You gettin' happy with it
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger along "the nape of his neck
They smile at each other as she continues on
Erica notices, tries not to respond
Well, the thing with me is that 'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet
Yeah, right
What's your play about
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica
She's hesitant to reveal this
About
Well, 'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic
(everyone stares at her) Who's incredibly cute and lovable
(more stares) It's a comedy
(takes a seat next to Zoe) So, how did you two meet
At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's
Harry was the big buyer of the night
kept winking at Marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time  did that she misunderstood and  ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine
17
Zoe and Marin laugh
Ever been married, Harry
No
No,  haven't
Wow
Now why do you think that is
Some people just don't fit the mold
And so far
Hey, if it ain't broke
Exactly
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair
Erica takes note
Wait a second, aren't you like a famous bachelor
wouldn't say 'm famous
No,  think  read a piece on you in New York Magazine
guess people find it interesting that 've escaped the noose for so long
Yeah, wasn't the name of the article, "The Escape Artist"
Wait
read that article
That was you
You were once engaged to somebody big
Who was it
Not Joan Collins
Wait
Carly Simon
Yeah, it was somebody cool like that
(trying to remember) Not Martha Stewart
18
You could just
'ask him
No, this is more fun
It's like 'm not here
Harry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer
Okay
Right
Diane Sawyer
love her
(stunned) 'm impressed
Yeah, women your age love that about me
Erica pauses on that one
(trying to get thru this) You know what  mean
Yes  do
It's not a bad thing to say 'women your age'
No
'm sure it was a compliment
It was
just the truth
(stepping in) So when was this engagement
Long time ago
She was just this adorable lanky girl from Kentucky with the greatest pair of legs 'd ever seen
Never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them
(munches on his lobster) 19
You're not serious
She's Diane Sawyer, she goes into caves in Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head
Who cares about her legs
Just anyone who's ever had the pleasure of
You know what hate to eat and run but
No, wait
This is actually a very fascinating dynamic - what's going on at this table
(warning him) oe teaches Women's Studies at Columbia
Oh, so this is gonna hurt
No, come on, listen, here's the rub for women
Look at what we have here with you and Erica
Harry, you've been around the block a few times, right
You're what
Around 60, never been married, which, we all know, if you were a woman, would be a curse, you'd be an old maid, a spinster, blah, blah, blah
Okay, so instead of pitying you, they write articles about you, celebrate your never marrying, it makes you illusive and ungettable
You're a real catch
Then, take my gorgeous sister here
Any chance of you stopping here
Come on, this is interesting mean, look at her, she's so accomplished, the most successful woman playwright since who
Lillian Hellman
She's over fifty, divorced and still sits in night after night because the available guys her age want (to Marin) 20
(cont'd) --forgive me honey for saying this, but they want girls that look like Marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting, which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know -- men, especially older men, are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women
It's just so clear
Single older women, as a demographic, are as fucked a group as can ever exist
Erica and Harry's   for a millisecond - , we Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to help
What are you, possessed
How could you say those things
It just seemed so obvious to me
The injustice of it
Thank God men die younger than us
It's the only break we get
Then you know what
Write a dissertation on it, don't announce to the world that stay in night after night after night and by the way, one night after night would have been enough
Did you ever realize, stay "in" as part of my job
Why do you think  married the director of my plays
He was the only man  ever saw
Anyway, like staying in and  like this time in my life
Why do  have to defend myself
was married for 20 years
'm done
arin  carrying more dishes
What the hell was that
21
'm sorry,  thought  was onto something
Honey, what are you doing with this guy
He's old, he's chauvinistic
He's fun
He's fun
How is he fun
He's like
wrong
Wrong can be fun, Mom
Not this wrong
Can we not do this now
He's actually incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about something other than his marital status you would've found out how smart he is
He owns like 10 different companies
What does that mean he owns ten different companies
He can't commit, that's what that means
Not that, God forbid,  want him to commit
Yeah, that  get
Anyway, he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice and then said he's leaving as soon as the sun comes up
What
His car doesn't have headlights
Good night
Wait
have no right to get this nuts
(hugs her) He's your friend
Not mine
love you
22
(hugs her back) love you more
This is obviously a ritual between them
Erica kisses Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin No chance he said we were nice
Please
None
They   coming from Marin's bedroom
What are they listening to
don't care
(listens) Oy
Marvin Gaye
Erica turns on the garbage disposal
Zoe sings along, "Let's get it on"
, Erica shoots her a look, turns off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor
know she'll never see him after this weekend
She can't commit either
Then they hear Marin
He does sound fun
Marin
Admit it, he's got something
You felt it, right
Then they hear Marin
Oh, this is nuts
Erica covers her ears with her hands
Then they hear Marin  "
" Did she say, Mom
23
'  -  - Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry
on the floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him
We were fooling around and he said he felt funny Hthen he just collapsed
(out of breath) It's nothing
'm okay maybe it was the lobster
Does your chest hurt
Like an elephant's standing on it
(to Marin) Call 911
tell them to send an ambulance
Marin hesitates
Marin
Now
'  - Spinning
When he shuts his eyes, it goes
Spinning
Spinning
He sees Marin, soft in the background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him
He hears Zoe: (
) What are you doing
(coming closer) Mouth to mouth
Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her
mouth on his
His eyes   , he reels back
Erica catches this
You fucking guy
24
She does it anyway
Her-mouth on his, her breath into his lungs, over and over
Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head
As
Erica pounds on his chest, we As the  to
Paramedics Harry through the corridors and into the  with dizzying speed
Two Nurses jostle Harry  the gurney and arrives at Harry's side
Julian is in his early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you look too young to be a doctor' syndrome
Julian is a man whose goodness makes him sexy
He wears his hair shaggier than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose,
;hook him up to a heart monitor and connect him to an
How we doing here
#1 He's had 30 minutes of chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104, respirations 18
Let's get an
Mr
Langer, 'm Dr
Mercer
Are you in any pain right now
The Nurse wheels over an  machine, Julian helps hook it up
Feel some pressure in my chest
it's real tight
Can you show me where the pain is
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum
What were you doing at the onset of the pain
was uh, kissing a beautiful
25
(watching the monitor) Where you having intercourse
-- Unfortunately, no
ense of humor in tact
(checks ) Hang a nitroglycerine drip
Mr
Langer the  shows you have a blocked artery which is not allowing enough oxygen to get to the heart muscle
'm having a heart attack
We're gonna stop it
But  need to know what kind of medications you take
(scared shitless) take uh
uh
Lipitor
(reading the  tape) Uh-huh
Any thing else
-- and a white one for blood pressure
procardia
Yeah
What about, Viagra
Erica, Marin and Zoe  in the  of the
Harry eyes them
stalls
Mr
Langer
Did you take any Viagra today
Mr
Langer
No
No Viagra
26
You're positive
don't take Viagra
Don't need Viagra
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be there
They turn away
Great
Just needed to be sure because  put nitroglycerin into your-drip and if you had taken Viagra, the combo would make your heart leap right out of your body
- '  - As he watches the  make it's way and
Just as the amber liquid is about to enter his bloodstream he  the  out of his arm
The drip is knocked onto the ground
The Women shriek as the Nurses scurry to clean up
Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin hangs back
Harry catches the look on her face
Let's give him an aspirin and Metoprolol 5mg
Sorry, had an audience
(clutching his chest) It's okay
it was a great save
(to Nurse) Let's start the thrombolytic protocol
"4000 units of heparin
Mr
Langer, if this works and  have every reason to believe it will, it's going to reverse what's going on so there will be little or no damage to your heart
You with me
(Harry nods
Julian places his hand on Harry's) Okay, here we go
Marin paces, smoking
Erica sits
Zoe leans against the wall
Oh, man, what if he doesn't make it
don't know who to contact
27
(') don't know his family
've gone out to dinner with the guy three times
hardly know him
He's gonna make it
Don't worry
He's like a bulldog
He'll make it
This is a nightmare
go out with a guy who's so old, he takes Viagra
Are you nuts
You go out with a guy who's so old he's having a heart attack
All  can say is, thank God it didn't happen when he was inside you
That could be life altering
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor
Marin rushes toward him, her face begging for good news
Your Dad's gonna be okay
Oh, he's not my Dad
'm sorry
(then) Your Grandad's gonna be okay
(throws her arms around him) Oh, thank you so much
But he's not my
oh we're not related
He's just a friend
Sorry
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin
Zoe and Erica join them
'm Dr
Mercer
Mr
Langer did have a mild heart attack
gave him something to break up the clot in his artery and it worked beautifully
28
(') His  returned to normal almost immediately which means  don't expect any permanent damage
He's very lucky
(shoulders sagging) Thank you
No, whoever got him here so fast should be thanked
Another half hour and  don't know if this would've worked
Marin pats her Mom on the back
Oh, man
(realizing it all now) This was
intense
Erica wipes away a tear
Nothing could surprise her more
We're out of the woods
've given him something to sleep, it might make him a little loopy at first but then it should knock him out
(to Erica) You're Mrs
Langer
No, no 'm just
No
'm Erica Barry
He was having dinner at our house
just met him this afternoon
You're Erica Barry
Yes
The playwright
Yes
What a pleasure
'm a huge fan
Huge fan
Really
Oh, thanks
This is my daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe
29
Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and devotedly to Erica
Takes her in
Wow
- Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups
- Sitting in the hospital corridor as ' and hands her a cup of tea
She looks up at him with more adorableness than most men could handle
She blows on the steam
Thanks
Camera Pans to
Sitting next to Marin
She is also handed a Cup of Tea
Even she softens as she looks up at Julian
Thank you Doctor
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters trying on the Glass Slipper
Until we get to Erica, not paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea
Oh
Hey
Ew
Hot
Thanks
(eyes on Erica) You're welcome
May  join you
Yeah
Sure
This is very nice of you
First year of medical school you learn what can keep you up all night without making you nuts
Green Tea beats everything plus it's a great antioxidant
Cheers
(turning on the charm) So, urn, do you always work nights
30
Usually two or-three a week, gives me a chance for a real life during the day
(immediately turns back to Erica) You know,  heard you had a place in the Hamptons
really am a very big fan
honestly think 've seen every play you've ever written
think some were written before your time
There are some Marin's never even seen
No, 'm pretty sure 've seen them all and  saw the last one twice
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the
Doctor, we've got a walk in, may need stitches
(rises) 'll check on
Langer
if he's asleep; you all might want to get some shut eye and come back in the morning
Great to meet you Erica
Ladies
The Women wave and watch him exit
The second he's gone: (to Marin) Okay, now that's a perfect a guy for you
He's adorable
Mother
've never seen a man less interested in me
Or more interested in you
Me
He's thirty years old
No, he's older than that
31
Who cares how old, he is
mean, he's not my type, he's like a gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's perfect for you and hot for you, which makes him really perfect
Stop it
He likes my work
Not me
(they just stare at her) It's insane
would never
(off Zoe's look) Shut
Up
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital Gown, pretty out of it
Yuh-oh
(rises) Harry
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women a
The Women muffle screams
Harry
Over here
He faces them
Honey,  want to go home
Can you call Lowell to pick me up
(confused) Lowell
Harry wobbles
Is he going to fall
Marin freezes, looks to her Mom for help
Erica rushes to Harry
Harry, you have to get back in bed
Woman
And  say that as a compliment
You saved my life
(kisses her hand) Soft
( then) don't remember your name but thank you from the bottom of my
32
He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast, his mouth open
(afraid to breathe) Ugh
Look at this, even unconscious, he's a lech
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica
Mr
Langer, you shouldn't be standing
Got to take a whiz girls
We'll take care of that for you, Mr
Langer
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling
He likes that idea
that idea
Okay
You take care of it for me, sweetheart
'd like to see that
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a desert sky
This is the most insane night of my life
Yeah, but just admit that was one great ass for a guy that age
-       - 36 Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station
Now what can  do you for
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties, Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie
He's a Gershwin tune of a man
throwback to a kinder world
This is
, Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday
'm here for Mr
Harry Langer
Julian  the Nurse's station
33
(to Julian) Are we discharging Hurricane Harry
Yes we are
Hi, 'm Dr
Mercer
Come on, 'll take you to him
Julian  the Nurse's Station
Lowell, carrying the flowers, follows
He nods to ,  and  who follow
Both pack cell phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags
And you are
Lowell St
James'
Mr
Langer's houseman, chef
general valet
Well that sounds like a pretty, interesting job
Fifteen years
Never a dull moment
They arrive at: where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go
He squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called, "Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back"
Okay, Harry, looks like we're going to have to let you go
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down
Lowell looks like he might cry
The Girls hold back
Take it easy kids,  just sat up too fast
Doc, tell them
Am  in good shape
How were my tests this morning
He's doing extremely well
(holding back tears) Can  hug him
34
Absolutely
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug
Lowell's shoulders shake as he sobs
Okay, Okay
Let's not get goofy
We got no thin , but good news here
must say, you do look good
considering
You have a little extra baggage under your eyes, but know how to fix that
(to Julian) See what good hands 'm in
Did you meet my gorgeous assistants
Not formally
Girls
my Doctor, Julian Mercer
(then) Honey, did you bring the CDs
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs
(to Julian) These are for you
(to the Girls) The man loves Hip Hop
(checking out the bag) Maybe not this much but
And did you bring the other thing
Lexi hands Harry another bag
Harry reaches in and pulls out a small leather box, hands it to Julian
This is just to thank you for your brilliance the other night
hope it suits you
(opening the box) Wow
This is
Jesus, this is the most gorgeous watch 've ever seen
35
- Oh, good
It's a Piaget
(to Girls) He likes it
No,  love it and this is incredibly generous of you but  can't accept it
You save my life and you end up with some CDs
No,  end up seeing you walk out of here and  do get paid you know - (
) -- Knock, knock
hey all turn, see Marin at the door
She waves to Harry, more reserved than normal
Harry, 'll see you on the way out
(whispers) We'll pull up the car
Everyone  leaving Marin and Harry alone
Harry sits on the bed
Marin joins him
Harry places his hand on her thigh
All she notices is his hospital bracelet
So, 'm some great date, huh
Yeah
Mr
Excitement
Tell me somethin', we haven't actually had sex yet, have we
No we haven't
You're correct on that one
Something to live for
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek
36
Down to the cheek
(that's big, he digests that one) Come on, let's get outta here
- Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on either side
In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and the Girls standing next to it
Next to them is Erica, waiting by her car
She's on her cell phone
Harry spots them and tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops
Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin'
(she stops) Okay, now slow-ly
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly
Everyone stands by, ready to help
Look at these faces
Will you tell them 'm fine
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble
Whoa
Whoa
Everyone grabs for Harry as he taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin huddle around
Erica steps back a bit
Harry, 'm sorry, but  think we jumped the gun
can't let you travel quite yet
ain't goin' back in there
You don't have to but  can't put you in a car right now and  can't leave you in the parking lot
'd like you to stay nearby for a few days and let me keep an eye on you 'til you get your strength back
37
Doc, 'm out in the middle of the Hamptons
Where do you want me to go
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "
" '  -
The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood, talking on her cell
Market Delivery Van pulls away as a Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in
Flower Delivery holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door
- Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit cigar, and is on the phone
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower filled dresser
Lowell lifts a   off the bed as Kim stands nearby on the cell phone
Marin packs her bag
(into phone) Just promise me you won't make a decision until we talk
Thinking about it ain't promising me
Okay, man, 'm seein' you Friday
(hangs up, then to Lowell) Lowell, what was that
(looking down at the Tray) Your lunch
Somebody tell you to starve me to death
Kim hands Harry the cell phone
Russell
(into phone) Rush
No, man, you're livin' the shit
just got a clean bill of health
Kim hands Harry a  that says: , 38
Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim
Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge
Her back is to a Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a sandwich
He wears sweats and a baseball cap
His natural expression is -- worried
This is
This is the best turkey sandwich ever had in my life
What kind of mustard is this
(not turning around) don't know
All right, don't get pissy
It's not Dijon, right
Don't get pissy
you say that 'cause this, of course, would never happen to you
1 come out here for peace and quiet and suddenly 'm a character in a Kaufman and Hart play
(the phone ) And the phone does not stop
(phone  ) And it's never for me
Lowell  with the Bed Tray
Sorry to interrupt
That's fine Lowell, 'll take that
No, please, allow me
No, no, 'll take it
No problem
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell
The man does not know my name and 'm doing his dishes
Lexi , all 5'10" of her
Dave suddenly looks alive
She carries an empty water glass
39
Hi Erica
Um
where should  put this
Right here
'll take it
And Harry has a headache
Do you have any Tylenol
Tylenol yes
(reaches in cabinet) (extends her hand to Dave) Hi
'm Lexi, Harry's second assistant
Hey
Dave Klein
How ya doin'
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and
(holding the water glass) Where should  put this
It's an empty water glass
What are the choices
(rises) 'm gettin' outta your hair
Thank you
So you're not ready to show me any pages
'm not putting pressure on you, 'm just asking
haven't written a word
'm on page twelve and the first eleven pages stink
So you have one good page
(then) How tall do you think that girl was
Before Erica can respond, Marin
40
Dad
didn't know you were here
'm just on my way out, bubbee
Well,  was just gonna drive into the city with Zoe but if you're driving back, 'd much rather go with you
have to meet someone before  go
(to Marin) Wait wait wait wait
You're leaving, Zoe's leaving, the entourage is leaving
And 'm supposed to stay here with him alone
The doctor said" he's 'sending over a Nurse in the morning
The morning
That's nineteen hours from now
(takes a deep breath) Okay,  can handle this
'm just going to get into a zen' place, play music, cook, write, focus
She never changes
(setting him straight) Yes
Maybe that's a good thing
'  - No cars are out front
Quiet and peaceful
On the Soundtrack we hear the French tune,  wish You Love sung in French
'  -    - Erica cooks, softly singing along in French
(
) Smells great in here
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway in his pajamas, robe and slippers
No one's ever had more gorgeous clothes to sleep in
His presence disarms her
41
Coq au Vin
(he looks confused) Chicken cooked in red wine
French Food
French music
Part of my play takes place in Paris so 'm hoping this helps me think
'm hopin'
How you feeling
Well,  walked all the way in here, only bumping into two chairs and an ottoman
Everyone bumps into that ottoman
Harry appreciates the thought
Before it has time to become awkward, the Phone
Hey, thanks for letting me
Yeah, no
it's fine
(answering the phone) Hello
Yes, he is
(hands the phone to Harry) (into phone) Hello
Hey sweets
(Erica hates this) Oh, you got the flowers
Are they pretty
Erica can't stand this
She puts on her glasses and skims her recipe
Hey, can  call you in a little bit
What's your number doll
(spots a pad and pencil) Harry squints, can't see what he's writing
backs his head away from the pad
Erica hands him her glasses
(slips them on, jots down the number) Okay
Call you in a little
42
Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica
Same prescription
Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch of the imagination,  think you're all that right for my daughter but  don't really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women
It's like 'm an accomplice to you cheating, it's
Your daughter knows  see other women
She does
mean, fine, it's none of my business
but
(struggles to open a bottle of wine) She knows 'm not monogamous
We've discussed it
Great
And that's what
Why are you proud of that
Not proud
Just honest
Your daughter said she likes that about me
(takes the wine and opens it with ease
) My daughter is confused when it comes to men
don't blame her
We're confusing
Harry hands her the open wine bottle
- Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table, under a purple sky
Another French Tune plays
If this wasn't them, this would look romantic
othing is said
Just two people eating
Harry lifts the salt shaker, about to add salt to his chicken
43
Should  just call the ambulance now
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the table
-  -  -  ' starry sky gives the house a storybook setting
We '  -   - Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table
The  tells us it's a little after
Annoyed by the ringing phone, she points her remote at the  Player and stops' the song
Harry answers the phone in his room
moment of quiet
Erica points her remote, starts the song again, starts typing again
Now the other line
She looks over at the phone watching one ", while the other line is answered
What am  doing
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it
She clicks on her   and is told: She's pissed
Then, worse, she  something
'  - Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar
His pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place
His bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor
Erica stands in the doorway
He quickly hides his cigar
(into phone) Can you hold a see, doll
(looks to Erica) Hey
Okay, here's the thing
really don't want to play the part of the uptight Nurse to your bad boy patient
If you want to have another heart attack, go ahead, it's your life but  have work to do and  don't have time to make another run to the hospital because you're filling your already clogged arteries with smoke but more importantly, 'd rather not have my house smell like a pool hall
44
Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to deposit his cigar in
have a question for you
She waits
She doesn't say anything
What
Do  Hhave to say what
Have you always been like this or do  bring this out in you
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit
He drops the cigar in
don't think 've ever had this effect on a woman before
(picking up the newspapers) And what effect do you think you're having on me
don't quite recognize it, that's how know 've never had it before
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up
So you don't sleep
only need about four hours a night
Me too
Never slept eight hours in my life
Me either
wish  could
but
(re: curtains) Want me to shut these, sun comes in pretty strong in the morning
Sure
thanks
(drawing the drapes) Who you talking to at this hour
45
friend in
It's only ten out there
And that's not past her bedtime
So you don't get more mellow as the hours pass
(heading out) Good night, Harry
Can  ask you one other thing
(Erica turns) What's with the turtlenecks
It's the middle of summer
Now seriously, why do you care what wear
Just curious
like them
've always liked them
'm just a turtleneck kinda gal
You ever get hot
No
Never
Not lately
'  - Almost
Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with the typing paper over it
She  a corner of the paper, takes a peek
The one lit line
Finally
"Erica turns off her computer, sits for a second
No one has rattled her cage like this in quite some time
And no, she doesn't like it
She stands, starts to undress
- 46
As Erica's  lands on it
Then her , then her then her
-  - She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom
She passes by her partially open door, happens to look out : - Seeing it all
- and
flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the wall, covers his eyes
'm sorry
Oh, God am  sorry
(
) What are you doing
Trying to find the kitchen
(
) Back here
- got confused
It was dark
didn't really see anything
Just your tits and a little of your- Erica
Photos on the wall shake
This is gonna be murder
- very wide    gruffly crosses thru the room toward the Front Door
Just as she opens the door, Erica in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt
Pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever
She carries a few packages
Good bye Mrs
Barry
47
Good bye
You're leaving
That's not good
Been fired
Fired
You just started
Not fired darlin'
Just not needed
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs
What do you mean, not needed
Of course we need her
She's gonna take care of you and feed you and
-- No, no, 'm actually feeling pretty perky today
Making quite a recovery
(opening the screen door) Sorry for the trouble Mrs
Gimble
Take care, dear
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd
Mrs
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits
Erica, now alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest, pats it
Listen, about last night
Yeah
How 'bout we never talk about that
(hands him some pills) was at the drugstore
Your prescriptions were ready
They said take these two with food and this one without
Honestly, you were in silhouette
think that's talkin' about it
really didn't see all that much
48
(heading toward her room) Yip
There you go
Okay
Won't mention it again but
(almost out of the room) Goin' to work, Harry
(yells) You saw my ass, you don't see me acting nuts, wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups
The Sound of a
- Harry flinches
' Harry and Julian sit on the bed
Julian takes Harry's blood pressure
Yes or no
What's the deal, can go
You still getting dizzy
Not as much
Out of breath
Only sometimes
(listens with stethoscope) How's Erica treating you
Who
(nods toward Living Room) Erica
Her
Oh, she's a major piece of work
The woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer
49
(') She's beyond uptight
Almost makes her fun to be around
Uptight
That's funny
haven't noticed that
Try livin' with her
Julian takes Harry's pulse
(with secret glee) actually saw her naked last night
That doesn't sound so uptight
It was an accident
She thought was asleep,  thought her room was the kitchen
You know what Freud said - there are no accidents
Trust me
This was an accident
Although, why would she be walking around naked when she knows 'm 20 feet away
Why would you think her bedroom was the kitchen
It was dark, it was two in the morning
That could explain why she was walking around naked
Deep breath
You know 've never seen a woman that age naked before
You're kidding
Hey, we're not all doctors
50
Well,  think she's very beautiful and she's a fantastic writer, you know
No,  don't know
Erica Barry
She's pretty major
(writing a prescription) So, you date her daughter
Okay, now she's a great chick
Must take after the father
Which reminds me
Doc, what (about Mr
Midnight here
indicates his dick) When can  be up and running in that department
think Mr
Midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks
But it won't kill me when  do it, right
It's exercise
It'll be good for you
And just so you know, 'm told after a heart attack, if you can climb a flight of stairs, you can have sex
: Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck
Harry stands at the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and sunglasses
' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's Mt
Everest
Bravely, he climbs the first few steps
Not bad
After two more, he's out of breath
Determined, he holds onto the railing and drags himself up to the next step
Happy with himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one more
and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move, yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up one more
- The tea kettle  as Erica and Julian stand on either side of her island
Erica reaches for a tea bag
51
So, you're saying, he's not ready to travel at all
Not even by plane
Train
don't think so
(sees her disappointment) It's been tough, huh
Well, he fired the Nurse after an hour, now says he doesn't need one
He's a bit of a workout
yeah
How are you holding up
Oh, fine
'm fine, 'm
One more fine and  won't believe you
The Phone
Oh, shoot, hold on
(into phone) Hello
Hey
Oh, hi
- Smitten
Just something about her
Watching her
- Not noticing, pouring water for her tea
(into phone) No, 'm finally getting to it
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her
Looks over at it
It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad
On it is written
Have dinner with me tonight
Erica looks up at him
Stunned (heading out) Pick you up around seven
-What about the patient
52
Like he said, he doesn't need a nurse
We begin to hear strains of another French song
'  -   - Erica at her desk, typing
The Music plays from the player
As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this attention from Julian has fueled her
-   - Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious
(yells, warning-like) 'm Walking Around The house
Laughs
Even she knows this is funny
Harry arrives at her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in
Listen, 've decided to get over the whole "you saw me naked" thing
So, we don't have to deal with it anymore
Okay
Good, 'cause 've been hiding from you all day
know
You want to come in
don't want to break your rhythm or anything
That would be wishful thinking
Harry  cautiously and curiously
Beautiful painting
So 'm gonna venture out there and go for a short walk
You up to that
53
My doctor recommended it
gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that
You wouldn't want to join me
That means you don't want me to
No,  was asking if you wanted to
Oh, well,  would but
don't usually like to break once 've started writing so  probably shouldn't, not that a little fresh air would hurt but
It's just a walk Erica, not a marriage proposal
You know my name
Erica Jane Barry
looked you up on the internet
-   - Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge
They are the only two people on the beach
-- Did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you
That can't be possible
No, it's true
know everything about you now
And not because of last night, but
Yeah,  understood
actually looked you up too
You grew up in , which  thought nobody did
54
(') You were the road manager for a group sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest Hip Hop label in the world
It's exhausting just hearing about it
know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it
Like the blink of an eye
Erica bends down and picks up    , then another and another
noticed you have bowls of those all over your house
know, 'm crazy,  just think they're so beautiful
But why do you only pick up the white ones
don't only pick up the white ones
Oh, so you really are crazy
pick up only the white ones
(looks in her hand) Oh, God, what does that mean
'm controlling, unadventurous, what
So you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that
Harry bends down, picks up a  stone, places it in her palm among the white stones
Something to remember me by
55
Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all
So can  ask you something Harry
What's with all the young girls
mean, what's the story there, really
just like to travel light
You just like to travel light
Oh, please, what the hell does that mean
Now see a thirty year old gets that
You mean falls for that
mean, accepts it
If that's what you want
a non threatening woman, who won't get your number, you get to run the show
think our relationship is growing by the way
Have you noticed
There he goes again
She can't believe he's cute like this
'm serious
Maybe we just needed to get out of the house
Now, you may notice, interestingly, we're walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again
Of course it's getting a little rocky, we're talking about you
See, 'll accept that slight hostility because 'm enjoying your company so much
hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs
Harry looks up, daunted
You okay
56
Yeah, but  think '11 stay down here and watch the sunset
You interested
Erica checks her watch
Big dinner date
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact
With your doctor
Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not too young for you, huh
No, he's totally too young for me
But we're just having dinner
It's not a date
Does he know that
Well, 'll tell him, but  doubt that he thinks of it that way
doubt that you doubt that
Anyway, you may like it
Think of it this way -- he's not threatening, won't get your number, you get to run the show
You might have a hell of a time
Over, we ,
-    - And we find Julian
Looking just as any girl would hope
Dream Date
is Harry, in his robe and 's
Hey, look who's answering the door
And look who's at the door
Brought you something
57
Julian hands him a take-out food box
heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria
(
) Hello
Both guys turn at once
She looks beautiful, wearing a dress, probably the sexiest one she owns
No turtleneck tonight
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek
You look beautiful
Thank you
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the '' sign
(thrown) We ready
Let me just see how Harry's doing
It'll take two seconds
Har, have a seat
- sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse
Harry looks straight ahead
- ' as she sits right in front of him
She crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh
furrows his brow
What
That's not the face you want to see your doctor making
Your pulse is a little fast but maybe you're just excited about something
Harry   '  again
58
(quickly) don't think so
'm not excited about anything
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt  even higher
There it goes again
Racing
Doc
Impossible
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line
Oh, there we go, now  feel better
Back to normal
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in
Harry rushes them Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything wouldn't do
Well that wouldn't leave us too many options would it
And do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee
(whispers to Erica) Let him pick up the check
It'll make him feel older
On Erica's shocked expression, the
-    - Harry lies on the sofa
Harry's body, past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to his face
As the  moves we : (
) Hi, it's Marin, 'm not in so leave a message and 'll call you back
Hey, it's me
just sitting around looking at your baby pictures
Thinking about you
59
He hangs up, dials another number
'  (
) Hi and , you've reached Brooke and Shannon
For Brooke push one, for - Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as funky as he wants
Everybody's out but old Har
Old, old old old Har
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves
He rummages around, finds ' , pulls it out, randomly opens it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck
Harry smiles
'  - Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm
He notices a bowl filled with white beach stones
Harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile
(complimented) Top of the heap
Staring at Erica
He can't get enough of her
They're in a And Erica's blushing for the first time in twenty-five years
-- So, when the land came up,  snatched it and the house was built in record time and
(blushing to death) It's like a thousand degrees in here
You know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone
Really
never heard that one
(starts fanning herself with the menu) Julian, how old are you, like
-- Thirty-three
60
Thirty-three
-Okay, so, 'm twenty years older than you
More than twenty years older than you
You look fabulous
Thank you   but you know, 'm not sure where you   were headed with that thing you were just   saying, but in terms of us, you just want   to be friends, right
Honestly
No
Well, then, what is it that you
want to be
think 'd embarrass you if  told you
was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you
This may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy
've never been married
'm a doctor
You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women
Oh yes  would
But, you don't like girls your own age
do very much
But 've never met one 've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is
suppose but, see,  don't date all that much or all that well
Oh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick
61
Now you're kidding, right
No, guys my age, the ones 've met
well, 'm not that regular a person and they really like regular
Men your age may be really stupid, you ever think of that
(takes her hand) Yes  have
Many times
(looks from her hand to her eyes) There's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you
Ow
Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck
Julian kisses her palm, then her
knew you'd smell good
It's just
soap
How much is soap that smells like this
don't know
got it at the market
Erica, you're incredibly sexy
No, swear to God, 'm not
,      ' Her scrapbook open against his chest
We  the pulling up to the house
Harry wakes up
Oh shit
He leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of there
- Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh
She's brought back to reality when she hears the  in Harry's room
She heads his way, then changes her mind and stops
62
(yells) 'm back
(
) You have fun
It was interesting
So
Good night
'  - Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in
(yells) 'Night
'  - Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing
She hears the  of someone
It a message from HARRYL37
It says: What   doing
e go    between their
She answers: Writing
Hi
What   doing
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date
She types:  think so
He types:  told ya
(then) You hungry
Surprised, she types:  just had dinner
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates
(to herself) How does he know everything
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but, 'm in my pjs
He writes: Me too
Pajama party
stares at the screen biting her lip
does the same
63
Erica rises,    , checks out her boobs in her pajamas
They look so low
She opens a drawer, rifles through it, takes out a bra, takes out a better bra
, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it than he has
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs again
Better
She adjusts the straps
Lifts them higher
Erica and Harry       , both in their pajamas
We are cute
This is pretty unusual for me
'm not used to having sleepovers
Me either
Really
With your social life
My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping
Sleeping is something  prefer to do alone
Okay, good to know
(heading for the kitchen) So, what are you hungry for
(joining her) What are my choices
mean  know you think 'm not very discriminating but
She looks through the fridge
Oh, God, what's the difference what think
can't imagine what you think of me
Okay, so
Pasta, left over coq au vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese
Pancakes
Totally what  wanted
Blueberries
64
You ever miss being married
bet you were great at it
Sometimes  miss it
At night
But not that much anymore
Was one of us just saying something interesting
You said you can't imagine what  think of you
Oh, right, but you don't have to answer that
Okay
mean, if you had an opinion, 'd be curious but
' will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night
(cracking eggs) Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to
But  got the hang of it
You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed
It's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side
She starts mixing the batter
Okay, now 'm convinced what think of you is right
(Erica waits
) You are a tower of strength
(shoulders sagging) Ughhhhhhhhhh
Try not to rate my answer
'm sorry
It's just
'm sorry
65
You're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts
No, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace
Words have been invented to describe women like you
( fearful) Such as
Flinty   and
Impervious
So you think 'm inhuman
No
think you're formidable
But cold and distant
Like 'm frozen in some painting
Not at all
think you're strength defines you
(sees how sensitive she is) But it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated
That, believe, is your winning combo
killer combo actually
So  can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me
don't hate you
The moment is broken when they  the    and Hello
Marin     in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from Zabars
She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy
Room service
What are you doing here at this hour
66
Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents
Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair
Erica catches all this
(enters, kisses Erica) had this big photography auction tonight, then  went out with a bunch of people,  checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here
thought  should come out and at least see how he was doing
(kisses Harry on the cheek) Thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way
They were so huge
Erica nods to herself
Oh, God, he sends them all flowers
Harry notes Erica's reaction
So how are you guys
(sets down the Zabar's bag) Oh, this is too sweet
You're making pancakes
Awwww
And you're both in your pj's
Now  feel 'm interrupting
Don't be silly
You know  never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either
It's
What's in the bag
(reaches into the bag) quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry
know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol
(hating to correct her) But high sodium
Oh, sorry
Stupid
For Mom, your favorite raisin-bread
And for me
(reaches into the bag) My favorite Vodka
Marin's cell phone
67
(into phone) Hello
No 'm here, babe
Made record time
Everyone's still there
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair
Harry watches her
She catches him and shrugs
Marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse
So, Mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and 'll get back to work
Mom
just got here, hold on
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice
So your ex-husband stood me up today
We were supposed to have lunch at Barneys
He never showed up
Was he always like this
Honey,  don't know
This is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems
Not that 'm a kid
(then to Harry, the flirt in her coming back) So how are you, how do you feel
When can you go home
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell
She picks it up, looks at her caller , throws it back in her bag
really am gonna do a little work
you two catch up
and just flip these Hin like two seconds
You don't want pancakes anymore
, uh,  don't think
(looks at Marin so) gorgeous, next to him No
don't
68
Marin watches her mother  then looks to Harry, his eyes following her Mom out the door
She's sees a look on Harry's face she never remotely saw when he looked at her
At first she's shocked
He likes my mother
Then a flash of jealousy
He likes my mother
Then pure joy - realizing how perfect it is
- Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket
Marin   , baseball cap, sunglasses, picking cherries
'm breaking up with Harry
Why
What do you mean
'Cause  met someone else
In the two days you've been gone
You know me, my life's crazy
meet a thousand people everyday
Also, let's face it, the guy's insanely old for me
'd be nuts to keep this going
True, but you know he is
--  know
He's soulful when you don't expect it, right
It's unnerving
Now, Mom, if you could handle this, was thinking
you and Harry
can't handle it
Wouldn't want to handle it
But you're only saying that 'cause you think he and  have had sex
Yes
Lower your voice
Haven't you
69
(whispering) Never even got close
Swear to God
(Erica digests this) Just puttin' that out there
'cause for two people who are convinced they got life beat, there's was somethin' cooking in the kitchen last night other than pancakes
' Erica looks out her   and  Marin and Harry She leans so far to see them, she's about to lose her balance
The Phone , she reaches for it and slips right Out Of Frame
(
) (into phone) Hello
Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the , on his
've waited a reasonable amount of hours before calling you, even though you've been on my mind since  woke up at 5:15
'm wondering when we could have dinner again
have to work the next few nights and if we wait 'til next week,  know you'll chicken out so how's Friday know it's like a date night but  think that's good
Who is this
Julian stops short
'm kidding
Can you meet me at The Grill at eight
Okay
Yes
That's seems fine
70
look forward to, seeing you too
Erica smiles to herself
- turning off the phone and grabbing his heart ' Marin  through the kitchen door, looking almost a little dazed
Okay, he's all yours
Stop that
How'd he take it
He just took care of it for me; He was an ace
Elegant
Said our fate was to be friends
Oh my God
(realizes something) He was breaking up with me
He's a genius
That's impossible, he wouldn't
It doesn't matter, we're done and we both feel good about it
(hugs her) gotta get back
(as she exits) Now Erica, try to think of this as the smartest thing you've ever done for yourself
Marin  and the
(into the phone) Hello
(from the beach) Thought you'd like to know your daughter broke up with me
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the Kitchen Window
71
heard
Made up a story about meeting another guy
Guess  wasn't so cute with an  in my arm
No,  think she really did meet someone else
Hey, it's alright
Her mother didn't like me anyway
(smiles) How 'bout  bring you out some lunch and a couple of blood pressure pills
You're a great woman, Erica
(Erica relaxes) Is this why my doctor is falling in love with you
- Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch
Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams with laughter
- Erica picks them up as
she walks with Harry by the water's edge
They talk non-stop
- Out of nowhere, a downpour
Erica and Harry gather their picnic things
The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind
- Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows
Lightning crackles across the sky and and a  is lit
Then  , and
Erica turns and finds Harry just looking at her
Before either of them has time to think, they kiss
72
'm sorry
(truly confused) For what
just kissed you
No, honey,  kissed you
Relieyed, Erica kisses him
know that one was me
Try not to keep score
He kisses her again and again
Soft lips
'm so glad they still work
haven't used them for kissing in so long
They've been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and
He kisses her quiet
Relieved, she finally fully kisses him back
big gorgeo~s kiss
Well, well, now look who's got something that works
They both look down at Harry
Hello, Mr
Midnight
And you didn't even take Via- (puts his finger on her lips) Kiss me before you make it go away
he kisses him long and sweet
' They're kissing on it
The rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down
73
This could be world class interesting
(Erica nods) Having any doubts
(as they kiss) Yes
Me too
But so far the kissing is spectacular
(He looks at her) 'm not grading you, just mentioning it
Brilliant
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her
Can't get past your damn turtleneck
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet
He comes back up when Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a  and hands it to him
(breathless) Cut it off
Please
What a brilliant invitation
He takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts
The turtleneck falls open from the center
When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is
He takes her in
You're beautiful
She shakes her head, 'no'
shuts her eyes
Open your eyes so  know you can hear me
(she opens her eyes) Beautiful
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants
74
What about birth control
Menopause
(thrilled) Who's the lucky boy
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and Erica can't quite believe life held this twist for her
Then:, think we should take your blood pressure
His head
What
It's irresponsible not to
-' sprawled out on the bed
Erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard
Like a warm Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix
He looks up at her, shaking his head
Nobody but you would
Yeah
so you're lucky
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results
(ecstatic) One twenty over eighty
Baby
- hurdles recklessly into the air
-  - The rain is coming down in torrents
We are   '  -  , hanging off the side of the bed
She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed
75
Oh my God,  do like sex
and we  , sprawled nearby, catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared
You certainly do
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath
Wow
So this is what you're supposed to do on a rainy afternoon
Harry smiles
He's trying to be his debonair self but something's off
He's very aware of himself
They lie there quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up
Harry slowly, nervously turns to her
really thought  was sorta closed for business
Just never expected this
(nods) Nothin's ever surprised me more
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close
Harry puts his arm around her
Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears
This is crazy
can't remember the last time  cried
think 'm overwhelmed
(crying with him) Me too
That's the perfect word
Baby,  had sex three days after a heart attack and  didn't die
Erica pauses
Oh
That kind of overwhelmed
That's gotta be some kind of record
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up
(wiping her tears) Let's not brag about this to our doctor, okay
76
Honey  may not be many things but one - thing  am is a gentleman
Harry holds her close
Erica, Erica, Erica
(she turns to him) You know 'm not good at being monogamous, right
Monogamous
Please,  hardly know you
He looks at her wondering if she's for real
She smiles as she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye
Then he kisses her
- ' ozy
Candles light the room
It's still raining
-- So there  was at nineteen, in New York, by myself, and 'd never seen snow before and  didn't have enough money for the bus, so  had to walk
Had no idea how far it was and 'm talking blizzard and 'm in sneakers
Awwwww,
- ' in Erica's room, making out
Cell Phone
They both look around for it
Erica reaches for it on her desk
(disoriented) Hello
mean
Hello
(turns phone upside down) Hello
- ' Mom, you guys okay out there
We're fine
Why
What's going on
77
What do you mean, it's like a hurricane
The news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour
Oh, that
Oh, no, we're fine
Are you having sex
Tell the truth
You are, aren't you
Absolutely not
No
That is not going on now
Oh my God, you already did it
Was it amazing
have to go
Just tell me, was it amazing
Yes and thank you for the wonderful opportunity
Marin
Erica flips the phone shut, looks to Harry, embarassed
(to Harry) Am  interested in buying aluminum siding
Really
Marin's selling aluminum siding
Erica buries her face in his chest
Harry and Erica       , drinking wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan
Candles light the room
--But why Paris
just always wanted to write a play that ended there
78
(') People need romance like that
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it
Real life
(slightly insulted) Excuse me
What do you call this
Eating eggs by candlelight in our robes after
She kisses him, starts to say, "'m sorry" when he pulls her back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed
So where do you like to eat in Paris Oh,  love this place called Le Balzar, it's just a little bistro on the Left Bank, best roast chicken in the universe
You'd be fun to go to Paris with
It's a great city to stay up all night in
(then) When's your birthday
February
Mine's in January
So, how 'bout if we still know each other by then we go to Paris for our birthdays
(a beat, then) Maybe
Oh
Sorry
You just
(sees the look on his face)
have no idea how to do this
be intimate but not
The color is draining from your face
Okay, look, 'm gonna pee,take one of your blood pressure pills then when  get back, let's not talk anymore
79
She gets out of bed
You're the funniest girl  ever had sex with
She has no idea how to take that
Decides to accept it
That's somethin'
Honey
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her
think 'm gonna go back to my room
let you sleep
Let me sleep
Oh, right
you usually send the girls home
but  am home
so
okay
'm an old dog, you' know
Hey, it's perfectly
whatever
Good night
This was
This was a great night
For me
Me too
At one point  even thought soul mates, you know
Erica nods
She knows
stares straight up at the ceiling
'  - Erica gets back in her bed
She lies there for a second,securing her armor back in place
She routinely moves to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her eyes
Then a small  on her open door
She sees Harry in the doorway
'd like to try sleeping with you
80
Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as Harry climbs in next to her we: : - The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm
'  - arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms snuggly around her
The     and the room is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on full blast
Harry opens his eyes
He's surprised to see he has his arm around her
Erica awakens just as surprised
In the light of day, a definite hint of embarrassment
(grabs his watch, blinks) Can you see this
Not really but it looks like it says eleven
(slips on his glasses) It is eleven
It can't be, that would mean we slept eight hours
Impossible
They turn and finally look at each other
Both look wrinkled, messy haired, a little wiped
How ya doin' Ace
(she ,elts as he lies right back down) Whoa Nelly
little dizzy
Okay, just stay still, here's the clicker
You know you have a doctor's appointmQnt in an hour
(getting out of bed) ( ) 81
(') 'll make us some coffee, get you your pills, whip us up some french toast, have ,the best maple syrup ever
' Erica
(she turns) You are a woman to love
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up for it in the last 12 hours
She holds onto the wall as she exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten off a horse
Alone in the hallway, she stops
You are woman to love
What the hell does that mean
Spits out a long tape
to Julian at the end of the tape
Harry sits on an examining table in ' , buttoning up his shirt
Okay, buddy, 'm sending you home
These past few days have done wonders for you
Yeah, 've been working on that stair thing
can do it by the way
Do what
(quickly) Climb a flight of stairs
Several times actually
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself
Way to go
How's Erica
(caught) Erica
know you must know her name by now
82
Yes,  do
Erica, as it turns out is an amazing woman
Does whatever she can to make me happy
Really
Turns out she's very giving
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words
Very giving
(looking away) Yeah, well that's wonderful think she's wonderful
real moment between them
Julian decides to take the high road
think she's wonderful too
(gathering his things) Give her my best
Julian
Thanks for everything
Julian shakes Harry's hand
Harry's eyes
You're gonna be okay
(touching his tears) What the
This is the second time 've done this now
get overcome or something
It's very common to become emotional after having an episode like you've had
Everything takes on a new meaning
(wiping his tears) So it's not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack
(handing him Kleenex) Like crying
83
Yeah and totally changing their tastes
Like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like
ever
and 'm talking really liking it
It's
unnerving
think you can expect just about anything right now
People have done some wild things after having a heart attack
selling businesses, getting divorced, moving
Some people say it saved their lives
But most people go back to being themselves, right
'll go back to being me, won't
We'll see
-  - She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life
She picks up the phone
' ,
(on his cell) Hi
Hey
What'd he say
He said you're wonderful
No, really, what'd he say
How are you
He said 'm good
that  can go
(obviously conflicted) Oh
So
Congratulations
That's really
great
Yeah, he said
by tomorrow for absolute sure
You think you can deal with me for one more night
84
-  - Packed with Young People
In the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest people in the room, dancing with each other
' - Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing Britney Spears' Oops,  Did It Again
When she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds
(big breath) Okay, here goes
Here goes what
Here goes me singing to you
(pulling a  out of his pocket) Bought my own music
You knew they had karaoke
Baby, it's why we're here
Harry makes his way   , hands them his disc
He's handed a microphone
He looks right at Erica
This is for you, Ace
(then, under his breath) wish me luck
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of Erica's French Songs, " Wish You Love"
(sings) wish you bluebirds in the spring
To Give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
wish you love
arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses
Don't want to blow this part
Now Harry sings the rest of the song
85
-
(sings) Et en juillet une limonade
Pour vous refroidir dans quelque lefy glade
And so on
Erica watches knowing something in her life has just that second, forever changed
And as Harry continues singing, we: : - Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house
'  - Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag
Erica enters doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong
(holding some cigars) Here you go, you can have these back now
(Harry looks confused) confiscated them your first night here
(smells them) Thank you darlin'
Try not to smoke them
(hands him a small bag) And  packed you a sandwich, just in case your blood sugar got low
And some of that iced-tea you like, and a nonfat, low cholesterol cookie
And a peach
what a doll
(notices) Got something else
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with all dark beach stones with    in the center
Something to remember me by
Harry hugs her
Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him and kisses him, then kisses him better
He's moved by her
86
There is that
And hey, we'll always have Paris
Honey, no words can ever express my gratitude for taking me in and taking care of me and
Hey, your heart attack could be the best thing that ever happened to me
(kisses her quickly, even faster throws out) love ya
love you too
if that's what you said don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an official  love you but
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain
Then
You're not like anybody
Neither are you
-      - Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been calling about him
Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the house, until it is finally out of view
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials
'   -   - , The room is empty
Erica rushes in, picks up the phone
knew you'd call
- on her cell phone,
87
Who
It's me
What's wrong
had breakfast with Dad this morning and we're talking and he starts looking all weir~ and then he tells me he met someone three weeks ago and it's "really something and then he (sobbing now) He tells me he's getting married
Why am reacting this way
'm almost thirty years old
(people stare at her) Yes, 'm crying, leave me alone
Who's he marrying
don't know
Some chick he met three weeks ago
She's four years older than me and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor
Has he lost his mind
have a huge auction tonight
Why do  have to be the one to deal with this
Can you please come in
'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~ away for two weeks
know you're working but
please
- One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen movie that makes New York seem quaint
Harry's Town Car pulls up in front of a
Harry steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar
Lowell joins him as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music
Good to be back
Let's find out
'  - Camera quickly  Erica down the front path and to her car
She's on her cell
88
Hold on, 'm losing you
Okay,    so you'll let Harry know 'll be
in the    city tonight and he can reach me on    my cell
if he wants
Okay
Aw    shit
Hello
'   - Crowd files in for tonight's auction
- tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a -shirt to a proper dress and heels
Erica leans on a table, listening
-- Look,  get that he has a right to get remarried, but he doesn't even know her and she's like my age
You know what that's like
It's like beyond creepy
And know he's not replacing me so why does it feel like he is
This is crazy, right
Crying like this
lights a cigarette) Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me
And all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry
That's just the way they're built
(slipping on her dress) Mom, you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life
Why 'm always with the wrong guy
This is why
Because the wrong guy can't do this to you
You have some control with the wrong guy
This thing 'm feeling right now
This is my big fear
that some guy could get me unglued like this, like nothing's connected
And this is just my father
'm just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama
The drama in life is what makes you strong
No, it's what makes you strong
You've never really understood this,but we're not all like you
89
(') 'm sorry, if  were you and my ex husband, the man who  still allow to direct my plays
was getting married to some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat Babe, 'd be bonkers
And look at you
(realizes) You've never looked better, by the way
(sinks) My anti-depressant is obviously not working
It should cover events like this shouldn't it
Since when do you take an antidepressant
Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who doesn't
Yes
Me
rest my case
on the door
Marin, we're all set
Mom, can you do one other really big thing for me
Just say yes
(taking two Turns) Anything bubee
Will you come out to dinner tonight with me and Dad and the fiance
Absolutely not
No
Please
He wants me to meet her and  can not go alone
already asked him if you could come and he said it was fine and she said it was fine
Look, you're gonna have to meet her too, so, we might as well meet her together
Come on, you know you can handle it
90
Erica pauses, thinks about it
She knows she can too
Okay
That's it
See that look on your face
That's the gene  didn't get
'  - Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front of a packed house
If' you didn't know, you'd never guess
Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and this evening's sale of Impressionistic and Modern Art
Bidders should know that the auctioneer may open bidding on any lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the seller
Okay
Let's start with Lot , the Bonnard drawing
And $5
000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000 gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on the phone
in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry
She slips out her cell, checks her messages
Her phone lights up and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail
- ' 8:30 We are in '   in The Hamptons and her phone is
- as  Man's  turns it off
We are: ' Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie, tucking away his phone
The Waiter sympathetically approaches the table
Guess  got stood up
Would you like to order or
91
Why not,  put
on the tie and everything
And can you bring me another
(indicating his drink) Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away
and as the   we realize we are: - Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and ' , , a combo of a hot tie and a young professional
Everyone has menus and drinks
Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and Erica
They both go right for them
Erica drinks too much too fast (to Erica) Thirsty
've had a big week Dave, forgot how these slip right down
'm fine
So, Kristen, where'd you go to
(burps) --medical school
Excuse me
University of Pennsylvania
went to school in Philadelphia too
Bryn Mawr girl
That's amazing
My Mom went to Bryn Mawr
Wow
So not only are you marrying my father but our mothers went to the same college
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes
Anyone mind
Actually  do
92
Okay, 'll just
have one
(lights up) So, this isn't going badly so far is it
mean for a totally surreal situation like this
Shall we order
Absolutely
(peruses menu) Erica, do  like duck
Yes
It's rabbit you hate
(to Kristen) 'll give you a list of everything he likes and dislikes
Let's let her figure some things out on her own
didn't mean those things, Dave
She did go to medical school
(pointing to herself and Kristen) Hey, not in front of the kids
(polishing off her Martini) will tell you this
Dave has one truly great love in his life
Really
What's that
His balls
Okay,  forgot to mention she can't drink hard liquor
(to Marin) Why did you order her a Martini
93
What
It's not true
The man can not watch  or read without the hand down the pants-- Here's my advice after 21 years  say who cares, they're his balls,let him enjoy 'em
(chokes) think  swallowed my olive, whole
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away
and headed in her direction
sexy Young Thing followed by her date -- no other than Harry
Harry stops to shake someone's hand, holds his date around the waist
Suddenly, the    of the restaurant as Harry and his Date walk right by Erica's table in  , not noticing her
as the room comes alive again
Her eyes follow Harry as he is seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date facing her
Marin hasn't seen him
Erica tries her hardest to act normal but apparently isn't
Mom, you okay
Yeah, fine
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying
Harry leans in to her, whispers something to her
She touches his hand
You know what
Maybe  need a little air
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a glass breaks
Everyone turns to her, including Harry
She now stands right at his table
He smiles up at her
Hey
Hello
Harry
(to his Date) Hello
94
Erica rushes out
She's a little high and her heart is pounding
She heads down the street
Oh, God, 'm so stupid
She picks up her pace, starts running
Her cell phone
Hello
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart
(walking quickly) Slow down
You want to kill me
She considers it
Harry,  gotta go
Erica, she's just a friend
Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind of a girl
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner
Harry
Come on, it's just a dinner
Look, Harry, here's the problem really like you
really like you
Yeah, but  love you like you
(that stops him) do
love you
Harry swoons and not in a good way
think maybe you should consider that you're in love with the idea of being in love
95
o you
Okay
Oh, God
(stomps her feet) 'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it
(tries not to cry in front of him) 've never been the dumb girl before
It ain't so great
Let's just calm down
This was just a a meal with a friend
-- Did you know  called you seven hours ago
was gonna call you
've been jamming all day, it's my first day back
Uh-huh
had these plans before  met you
But do like seeing you
do
'm always surprised by it
What was  thinking
Maybe you weren't thinking for once and look what a good time we had
Let's not ruin something great
Harry,  won't be good at this
At what
Acting like  don't care
have never lied to you
have always told you some version of the truth
(freaking on that one) The truth doesn't have versions
96
Can you cut me a little slack
My life's been turned upside down
Yeah
Mine too
Then let's each get our bearings
don't want my bearings
've had my bearings my whole fucking life
felt something with you that
Oh, you don't want to- Yes  do
(she won't open up) Tell me
felt something with you,  didn't know really existed
You know what that's like after a twenty year marriage
To feel something for another person that's so off the charts, that - (Harry looks down) Okay, not your problem
This is why 'm not good in relationships
You know writers are like teachers, those who can - do, those who can't - write romantic comedies where does not happen in the third act
and it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman
In the play 'll be 36 so it won't be as pathetic
'm just too old to feel crushed
've written this feeling but  never really got it
(realizes) You know what this is
(pointing to herself) This is heart broken
How's that for impervious
You're killin' me
just wish it had lasted more than a week
Me too
97
That's a horrible thing to say
(walks off, comes back) The life  had before  met you knew how to do that, could do that forever
Now look at me
what do do with all this
Can we talk tomorrow
What for
saw your friend you were having dinner with, if that's what you want, it's never going to work with me
Look at me
'm a middle aged woman, don't let this brown hair fool you, don't have a real brown hair on my head, 'm almost all grey
that would freak you out, wouldn't it
And  have
high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and 'm post menopausal and have osteoperosis and 'm sure arthritis is just around the corner and  know you've seen my vericose veins
Let's face it man, that's not quite the buzz you're lookin' for
pulls up
And you know what
Everyday, 'm gettin' older
just like you
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi
Wait
Erica turns
This is his chance
just
the truth is
don't know how to be a boyfriend
That's what you have to say after all this
You don't know how to be a boyfriend
That's not a small thing
They're both out of words
98
Are we done
don't know
She nods
He doesn't give
She ducks into the  and it Harry stands on the street, watching her go
(winces) Ouch
He grabs his heart
Oh, God
- wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital
This is not the Hamptons
This place is crawling with patients
Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her thirties,
As he's taken off the gurney, he's immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest pain, no nauseau, some shortness of breath, was hospitalized a week ago with a coronary thrombosis
Hang a nitro drip
You can't
took Viagra
You have been through this before
Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol
You h~ving chest pain right now
No, and the pain  was having was sharp, not like before
That's good
Not like before is we like to hear
(reads ) Give him aspirin
99
(') Based   on what  see so far, your heart   is not in distress but 'm gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be sure
What were you doing at the onset   of the pain
Having a fight with someone
woman
Can a woman give you chest pain
Are you kidding
Love hurts, haven't you heard
Yeah, but so far, 've only given pain, never got any
(confused at how literal he is) All right, well you're battin' a thousand here
Your enzymes look perfect, your is normal and the pain doesn't sound like the kind of pain we worry about think what you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress
Stress
And incase you haven't heard, that can give you a heart attack
Mr
Langer, donlt know what you're up to gallivanting out and about at this hour, but if you were my Dad, 'd make sure you were home, in bed, recuperating
'  - Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his Townhouse
Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step, takes out his cell
If you were my Dad
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them, they're not his -- they're Erica's
He puts them back on and dials
100
' Hi
It's Erica
'm not here so leave a message
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks at her glasses
(grabbing his chest) Ouch
and Erica   , crying
She flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses, puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's
She dials
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message
She sits up, excited ' Erica, Hi, it's Julian
It's about 8:20, 'm in the restaurant
just Wondering if you're
Erica hangs up, starts crying again
She takes off her glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding Harry's glasses
Just the sight of them makes her burst into tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the making
'   - tear lands on it
Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the while, tears flood her eyes
- wakes up
As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears
While in the , the crying never stops
While she , a downpour
Running   , she's wailing
Back at the ", she's sobbing as her hands fly over the keys
An actual boo hoo can be heard
At , laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,     plays in the
At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an from
He writes: Do  hear French Music
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair
101
'  - Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth thermometer is propped in his mouth
He writes:   there
She answers: Yes
Hello
He writes: How are ya
She writes: Great
as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve
e writes:How's the writing going
She answers: Pouring out of me now
Go figure
He types:  miss y
He stops, thinks before sending
rica waits on her side
Nothing, is coming over
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out
Take care
Harry deletes the  miss y
and instead writes:  2
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped
'   - Harry takes out his thermometer
Feels lost
Looks at the clock
It's 10:00 p
m
'  - Lowell lies in bed in pj's,  , smoking
Harry arrives at his doorway in his pajamas
Lowell puts out his cigarette, fans the smoke
Lowell, 'm goin' out
(confused) Okay
Don't forget to put some clothes on
mean,  should go out, shouldn't
Since
when don't  go out
Just cause some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to stay in bed, doesn't mean  have to turn into a monk
102
Is there something you'd like me to do for you, Mr
Langer
Well, no, just
well, what are you doin'
Watching Lucy
Would you hate making me something to eat
- - lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating bowls of pasta, watching
Funny women are adorable, don't you think
never really thought about it
Neither had , but think about it
Funny's a unique thing in a woman
It's fun to be around
There's some reason we've been watching these two for 5O years
Exactly
It lasts
We're not sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van Doren reruns
No we're not
You feeling okay
don't think 've slept one night since 've been home
Every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me
can't get a handle on my emotional life, don't know what want, don't know if what  felt was because  just had a heart attack or was real
Plus,  feel needy never used that word in my life
103
(') Lowell, have you ever seen me like this
Be honest
Nothing even close
That's right, buddy, 'm a mess
And 'm no good at it
(realizes something) Those are very nice pajamas, by the way
Did they used to be mine
Yes but you gave them to me, you said you never wore them
know
But why would  do that
They're so elegant
Nice piping
Mr
Langer, you're always giving away beautiful things
Awwwww
How did  get like this
(eyes fluttering shut) 'm gonna shut my eyes for a few minutes
Keep Lucy on
Harry nods off and Lowell
-   -  - Erica and Zoe are taking a walk
Erica, still crying, picks up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe
Zoe holds the stone, makes an `awwww' face
Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something
frolicking on the beach
He's a   in a tank top, shorts, highlighted hair
Erica rolls her eyes
- Marin rushes down the stairs
Erica sits near the bottom of the stairs, watching the sunset
Mom, we're going into town
Erica turns, wiping tears
104
Are you crying
(joining her) didn't know you did that
Yeah, it's my new thing
've gotten abnormally great at it
(sitting on the step with her) Is it Harry
Seems  gotta learn how to do that love 'em and leave 'em stuff
Fucking men
You don't care when say fuck, do you
Not really
Sometimes
Not right now
So now you get my theory about love
You gotta self protect
It's too dangerous
Marin, that theory
how can  put this so your feelings won't get hurt
It's just so crazy, it makes me want to
And how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings
Listen to me
you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won't work out and maybe you'll become unglued
That's not a way to live
So you're telling me you're happy right now
This is good what happened to you
105
No
This was bad
But for the three days it was good, it was electrifying
Marin's eyes fill up
think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize
let someone in and  had the time of my life
(tearful) 've never had the time of my life
know
And bubbee,  say this from the deepest part of my heart
what the fuck are you waiting "for
'  -  - is in progress
It's loud
The place is crawling with characters from the Hip Hop world
Harry winds his way down his crowded , Girls grabbing at him as he passes by
As hard as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to be
(as Harry passes) aving fun
Not quite
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded entry and
, Harry steps into the , looks up at his house and the party inside
-   - Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't remember her, keeps on shopping
Zoe thinks for a see, wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right back at her, his face full of hope
'   - Erica sets the table for two
Zoe pokes her head in the door
got you something great at the farm stand
106
Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet of fresh cut flowers
These are for you to give me when you apologize
-  - Candlelit
Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal
The  does a 360 around the table, their faces saying it all
The Women bask in Julian's warmth as he entertains them with stories
Zoe looks from Julian to Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again
- Erica places coffee cups in the sink
Julian is next to her, leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine
Julian,  hope you know 'm mortified by my behavior
was going to get in touch with you, send you a note or something
note
That's a little chilly
'm embarrassed
just haven't been myself lately
What can  say
Just tell me you're sorry
am sorry
Then you could kiss me
Kiss you
ulian nods
You'll forgive me if  kiss' you
Think so
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss
107
No one on earth would forgive you for that kiss (places his wine glass on the counter) May
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a kiss that doesn't quit
(still holding her, whispers) forgive you
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the  of her own heart
: '   - On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black as the music continues to play
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses
Finished at last
She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk
She tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right in the trash can
- Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of the play
fire burns in the fireplace
Erica approaches the back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages
It's the best thing you've ever written
It is
It's wonderful
It's sweet
It's smart
It's funny
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder
How great is it that 'm not intimidated by your brilliance
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation
108
Must we go through this every time
Come here
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly
She holds onto the sofa for support
: - eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop
'm totally excited about this audition
It's such a great part
It's supporting but she's a really funny character
There's this totally hilarious scene where she's dating this like chauvinist older guy and just as they're about to do it, the guy moans and she thinks he's just really into her, right
Except he's having a heart attack and she's like creeped out and her mother, who basically despises the guy, rushes in, gives him and saves his life
choking on his lunch
- Auditions are in progress
On stage,   reads for the part of "The Sister"
Look, we're four sophisticated people
Why can't we all stay for the weekend
' in the audience
She sits in a row by herself, listening
Harry   , sitting directly behind her
need to talk to you
Erica freezes, horrified
Turns, sees him
Got a minute
109
Erica and Harry stand in front of a
So your play's about us
No, it's about me
Am  in it
guy like you is in it but he's not you
What happens to this guy who's not me
Haven't totally decided
He can live or he can die
What are you leaning towards
Death
(Harry reacts) It's funnier
He dies of a funny heart attack
He's sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine, so it won't be too sad
Schmucks are people too you know
Death doesn't seem a little harsh
just went where the story took me
It's a work of fiction, Harry
Really
just stuff  made up
(approaching) Erica, we're ready to do the hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra scene
Should we wait for you
110
Erica nods, horrified
So 'm going to be the laughing stock of Broadway
Harry, he's not you
He's a version of the truth of you
So to speak
Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants to know, when Henry says, " love ya", you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You', right
Right
We now  Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout the theater
The  backing is 'raised and an is lowered behind them
They both try to ignore the music, but it's impossible
Well, you look really nice
You feeling all right
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, from above
You know it isn't like  wanted to stop seeing you
We could've carried on a fun thing for awhile
Why is it you dames want all or nothing
don't know, we're just goofy when it comes to love
Look, Harry, if it's all right with you, 'd like to be friends 'm not ready to be your friend
How's that
Fine
understand
Anyway, do you actually buy that horse shit
that men and women can be friends once they've had sex
111
'm friends with my ex-husband, but then again, we didn't just have sex
We didn't just have sex either
Then what was it
Love to know
Can  e-mail it to you when  figure it out
(laughs) This is perfect
have given the `Can't We Be friends' speech for 40 years think  invented the 'Can't We Be Friends' speech
But you know what,now get why they never went for it
You dames got one thing right
Sometimes sex does change everything
Call me crazy, but just don't see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, 'cause 'd bet you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread
You get what 'm saying
You don't want to be friends
Not "don't"
Can't
Can't be friends
Doesn't work that way
(tries to calm down) Okay, 'm moving into another phase of this thing
'm mad at you
(realizes) It almost feels good
think 'm mad at you too
Excellent
'Cause  don't like thinking about you so much and worrying about how you are and if ruined your life or
-- You've worried about me
Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to die, worries about you
112
(cont'd) Sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job
Well, doll, 'm doing fine
So you don't have to work that shift anymore
Again, The Stage Manager
Erica, they want you to take a look at the costumes for the dancing Henry's
These gonna work for you
Harry and Erica  and  a   of  60 - Harry   the Stage Door, right into the street, is almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care
- Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace starting to get to him
He spots a bench with a at one end
He parks himself at the other end of the bench, out of breath
Tries  reason with himself
to God is a woman,  know that now
No man would punish me like this
You never change, do you
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman
She drinks from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile
She's adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair
Do you know me or are you just talking to me as "man" in general, the beast women love to hate
No, no,  know you Harry
Oh
Don't tell me
dated your daughter
(the Woman laughs) Right
broke her heart then she married some hard working Joe on the rebound, has three great kids
What is so funny
113
You dated me and you broke my heart but after you  met the right guy
've been married thirty-seven years, have four kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the way
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless
dated you
(the Woman nods) Did we
ever
No
we did not
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her
Can you give me hint
year decade
The sixties
(Harry squints at her) You took me to Shea Stadium
To a Mets game
must've really liked you
You took me to see The Beatles
Oh, God,  really liked you
You're Sandra
Cook
We did
We saw The Beatles together
How the hell have you been
What happened to you
Well, let's see, after we stopped going out,  went back to school, got my doctorate in marine biology, went around the world a few times, met the man of my dreams at Oxford, married him, we lived in London for 25 years
wrote and taught, we raised 3 sons and a daughter
've just finished my ninth book and now 'm training for my first marathon
Now,  must confess,  actually remember the very last thing you ever said to me
114
(cont'd) You walked me to my door,  was tearful and you looked at me with those puppy dog eyes and said, "Honey,  just don't know how to be a boyfriend
" Now, tell me, what have you been up to since 1964
Harry's face, we  the  of a
- Harry is wheeled through the  with the gurney
Dr
Martinez runs along with the gurney
Mr
Langer
Back so soon
This is it, 'm dyin', 've had 20 minutes of severe chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure's gotta be 170 over 100
(sticks out his arm) Give me the nitrate,  didn't take viagra
(rips open his shirt) Plug me in to the ,  need an aspirin, 'm taking 2 beta blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor, Procardia and if  were you, 'd be pounding my chest
Ow
You're a doctor, huh
Just a very sick man
-     ' Dr
Martinez reads it
Mr
Langer, your diagnosis although fascinating, was entirely incorrect
That's impossible
Your realize a severe anxiety attack can masquerade as a heart attack
So 'm nuts
Perfect
The one thing 'm not taking pills for
115
If you don't want ,to end up in here every week,  suggest you do whatever it takes to decompress
Try something with me, okay
(takes his pulse) Close your eyes
now give yourself a visual image of something that gives you a feeling of peace and serenity
don't know
hammock
Okay, good
what else
Palm trees
clear blue water
We hear the    ,
Anybody there with you
Yes
Beautiful women
in thongs
(disgusted) Okay
What else do you see, feel, taste
margarita
a Cuban cigar
miles of soft beach
Keep going
you're doing great
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera     as the   gets
: Boom down to see the   of Erica's play on Broadway
On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and a banner that brags, "Sold Out
"
to street level
Couples walk by, bundled up against the cold
Harry
116
He looks different
He has a beard and has lost some weight: And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before
He pauses in front of the theater -- loo~s at the
He Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting "Emily" and her Sister
He sees   of The Dancing Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes
Then, finally, of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses
Harry , steps inside and listens, hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience breaks out in
Harry smiles to himself
- The elevator opens
Harry steps out, looks around for an apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his throat
The door quickly  and we see
She looks relaxed and happy to see him
couldn't believe you were calling from downstairs
(hugs him) So great to see you
You couldn't look better
Thank you
Come on in
No, no,  just wanted to stop by and say hi and tell you 'm sorry if  ever did anything to you that wasn't on the up and up or
What do you mean
You were great to me
was
Always
That's refreshing
Good
Well,  don't know what you've done to yourself but you look absolutely radiant
'm three months pregnant, that might have something to do with it
117
, Really
Who's
the, lucky guy
My husband, hold on, he really wants to meet you
(calls) Danny
Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie, glasses
Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin
(shaking Harry's hand) 've heard so much about you
bet
Yeah, with Hthe play and all
'm famous,huh
Just to us
In every interview my Mom does, she always says she made you up
So the guy in the play, he doesn't make it, does he
He basically dies at the end of the second act, but it's very funny
(as if that's some consolation) Was hopin' she'd give me a reprieve, but
Yeah, well
Yeah
Okay
Best of luck, kids
Marin is stumped by this little visit
Harry heads toward the elevator, pushes the button, then turns back
118
How is she
She's
(Harry waits) Really good
Up to her old tricks
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city
Now if  wanted to see her
how would that go over
(encouragingly) Only one way to find out, except she's out of town right now
Oh yeah
Where is she
Paris
She left two days ago, for her birthday
But she'll be back next week
The Elevator arrives
Harry salutes his goodbye and steps He turns,
Paris
And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere coat, gorgeous scarf
out of the elevator and through a      then right onto does a 360 and we catch glimpses of just as the , sending a flood of golden lights high into the night sky directly behind him
Showtirne
- Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine
She looks vibrant
She glances up from her drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around the tables
She leans to the side for a better look, to make sure it's him
It is him and he's corning right toward her
Her stomach sinks, her mind races
and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is
119
(proud of himself) knew you'd be here
You did
've come a long way to see you, Erica
You mean we're not bumping into each other
You came here to see me
Yes,  did
(she seems to shiver) 'm aware it was a bold move, one of those impulses that grabs you,' but
so far, we're okay; right
Well, uh,  mean, 'm just
'll take that as a 'Yes'
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook
You want a glass of wine or something
was just gonna give you a kiss hello
Oh, Okay
Neither is sure where to go
Cheek
Lips
He lands on her chin
Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from her
She looks at him - utterly speechless
remember you said if we still know each other we should go to Paris for our birthdays, well, we still know each other
"
That's true, but, Harry,  haven't heard from you in six months
120
know but 've certainly been thinking about you
There's a lot  have to say
First thing is
'm not mad at you anymore
Good, 'cause 'm not mad at you anymore either
That's a relief
since  did come all the way to France and everything
And
Happy Birthday
(afraid of everything he could possibly say) Thank you
And congratulations on your amazing success
It's been quite a ride
Funny,  thought maybe 'd hear from you when it opened
Where've you been
After  saw you in the theater that afternoon,  had another "episode
Oh, 'm sorry
was actually okay, but  was sure  was dying and the doctor in the  said  needed to decompress
So  did
walked out of there and changed my life, sold most of my businesses, packed my bags and moved to an island in the Caribbean
That's where you've been all this time
In the Caribbean
Actually
No
- Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian shirt, shades
steel drum plays in the distance
121
(
was there about ,six hours, when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean wasn't going to remotely cure what was ailing me
Harry sits straight up into
and we realize we are in '
(
) So  decided to take another kind of pilgrimage
into my past
Harry   , reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books"
(
) My thought was -- if  retraced my steps and visited all the women 've dated
He blows dust off of the books
-- maybe  could figure out how got so screwed up
- ' Harry  at one   after the , (
) lot of the women wouldn't see me
Then, we see  of various ages
(
) Or speak to me
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama
(
) But  was on a mission to save my soul
Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a carrying groceries
122
Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she picks up her pace and ignores him
(
) My losing streak finally ended when got one to open up to me
In a  , an Older Woman on life support, scrawls out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by herside
Priest stands in the background
The note says, "As  remember it, you were wildly insensitive"
Harry lowers his head in shame
She places another note in front of him
It says, " forgive you
" Relieved, he smiles
Then, one last note: "Now, scram
" (
) Hearing what they had to say was no picnic
In an Upper West Side  , Harry pas coffee with a Woman in her Mid Forties
She talks his ear off
Harry can' t deal with it
He looks away ~ The woman places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to her and keeps talking at him
(
) But  stuck it out and  listened
Then  listened harder
Harry  down   with a   in her Thirties, who carries a cello
She never shuts up
(
) And one of the things  realized was,  was actually giving closure to generations of women
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye
(
) Although  admit, some refused to give, no matter what  did
- On the set of
She glances out the and sees Harry    among the folks holding signs
He    that says, ", `
"   She looks him straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger
123
-   -     - (
) When you hear the same story about yourself over and over, your life begins to make sense and the future becomes your only salvation
- It took me six months to find them all
visited 18 different states but  came the furthest to see you
lands on his shoulder and he : ' don't believe it
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated
Me either
Harry stands
The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next to Erica
Harry slowly takes his seat across from them
should have told you he was coming, but was so engrossed in your story
What story
Oh, maybe another time
So
(looks from Erica to Julian, it all dawns on him) guess  should've seen your play, then would've Jknown how this ended
Yeah, big twist, huh
So what are you doing over here, man
Just a uh, vacation
never been to Paris in January
It's amazing to run into you
You look wonderful
124
You do
Haven't been on a gurney in six months so that's somethin'
Well, 've just been to every store in the city, this woman is impossible to buy for
But think  finally found the right gift
He puts what can only be a   on the table between Erica and Harry
Happy Birthday baby
He kisses her
Harry watches, dying
(reaching for it) 'll open it later
Harry rises, reaches for his coat
No, no, you know what, 'll let you two celebrate
Harry, stay
can't really
Why
You have somewhere to go
: Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal
Julian is doing the talking as well as laughing
Harry laughs along, trying to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally faking it
- -- To the forces of destiny that brought us together tonight
125
Erica lights a cigarette
What are you doing, you don't smoke
'm in Paris, the second hand smoke will kill you anyway
She's very brilliant, but the woman can not hold her liquor
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close
like that about me
Me too
The Guys exchange looks
Now, if  were writing this, this is where 'd write, 'an awkward moment'
Honey, if you were writing this, 'd be dead
Erica laughs
Never fails to amuse her
The Waiter drops the check on the table
Harry takes it
No, Harry, please, let us
No, no,  insist
crashed your party
(to Erica) At least let me buy you dinner on your birthday
(squints at his watch shows it to Erica) What time does that say
(squints) have no idea
126
(feels around) Wait,'  have my
(reaching into her purse) Me too
They each take out  '  and put them on
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs
You think you look so handsome in mine
You know how long 've been looking for those
Yes  do
Harry hands Erica her glasses
She hesitates
He snaps, gesturing for his to be turned over
She hands them to him
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry
(tucking away his glasses) Once again
closure
(reads his watch) So it's only 5 in the afternoon in New York
What do they do around here for fun
- Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table
The place is dark, loud, crowded and young
They're all drinking champagne
The air is strained
(at the same time) Want to dance
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance
Julian takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor
Harry watches them slip through the crowd
Erica turns back, Harry waves
Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's comfortable in his embrace
None of
this is lost on Harry and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt
- Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together
127
- Harry is gone
-  - Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre
-  - Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just making it all worse
He stops, looks out at the Seine
He hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him
Without warning, a tear falls from his eye
(laughs at himself) At the end of the day, 'm nothin' but a sap, a stupid old sap, standing on a bridge in Paris, crying my eyes out
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him
Beauty's not supposed to hurt
Another tear
(almost amused) Look who gets to be the girl
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as  begins to fall
(looking toward heaven) Anything else
' Harry
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor running, snow falling on her hair and coat
Where's Julian
He went back to the hotel
How come
128
(walking to him) He said when he saw me with you, he knew  was still in love with you
What do you have to say about that
If it's true, my life just got made
Why'd you come here, Harry
Because  realized what  was feeling for you, have always felt for you, was something  didn't understand, like a language  didn't speak
(she listens
) It scared me so  did what  do
snuck away
Turns out the heart attack was easy to get over
You were somethin' else
(she's starting to melt) And when  went to see all those women, found out  was never really present for any of them
And something inside me at some point, had just
shut off
That's when  think my heart gave out and you saved me
finally get what it's all about
'm 63 years old and  am in love for the first time in my life
And that's what  came here to say
Okay, this is the best birthday ever
know 'm no spring chicken,  figure only got another 30-40 years in me
Tops
But how 'bout we figure out a way to make this work
Okay
Okay
Okay
'll take it
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping out of it's tinny speakers
Honey, they're playing our song
129
She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great
And as they separate, he smiles, relieved
: : -  - The same restaurant from the first scene of the film - One Year Later
Harry  , just like he did before
" Langer, party of four
and a half
The Maitre' snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica, Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through the crowded restaurant
The Baby fusses and reaches out to Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of the room
Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits with his family for a Sunday dinner
