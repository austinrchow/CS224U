Written by Eric Bergren, Christopher De Vore & Nicholas Kazan We  the soft voice of Frances Farmer
(
) No one ever came up to me and said, 'You're a fool
There isn't such a thing as God
Somebody's been stuffing you
' : - On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed
After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface girl's face breaks through
(
) It wasn't a murder
think God just died of old age
And when  realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me
It seemed natural and right
The girl, , is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence
She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes
then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach
(
) And yet  began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall
He watches over all his children
' That jumbled it all up for me
- The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees
Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary
Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun
(
) But still sometimes  found that God was useful to remember, especially when  lost things that were important
'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings
' -   - Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair
An older woman, , sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time
small suitcase stands by the front door
It usually worked
God became a superfather that couldn't spank me
But if  wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it
appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read
But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always
Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head
She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly
Bye, baby
See you next weekend, Dad
He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian
She doesn't look up
He leaves
began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything
They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice
: - Frances stands at a podium
Other  and  sit to either side of her on folding chairs
Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School
Below that a banner hangs: "    , 1931
" wondered a little why God was such a useless thing
It seemed a waste of time to have Him
After that He became less and less, until He was
nothingness
The  consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries
We  several shocked faces
Lillian is there also, smiling
Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman,
Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried
felt rather proud that  had found the truth myself, without help from anyone
It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too
God was gone
We had reached past Him
Why couldn't they see it
It still puzzles me
Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response
There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause
Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet
In the back a  also stands
You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer
stately man sitting next to her, her husband , puts a restraining hand on her arm
The woman continues to glare at Frances
Frances stares back, dumbfounded
: - The screen erupts into violence
large unruly  skirmishes with  in a cobblestoned square
On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now
", "Workers of the World Unite
", and "Elect Kaminski
" stands By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes,
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family
& No
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children
& No
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
& No
No
Good
Because, Brothers, that's you
The crowd cheers
Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World
" : : : '     ' '
' We realize we've been watching a newsreel
We  the presenting Frances with an award
Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God
City Hall steps
Judge Hillier and other  speaking heatedly to reporters
This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools
Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian -- Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small  of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors
Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense
(emphatically) Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion
What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them
To paraphrase Mr
Voltaire,  may not agree with what she says, but 'll defend to the death her right to say it
Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America
And in my home
Among the  in the cinema, we  Frances and her father
Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight
() - Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag
Her hair and skin gleam in the sun
People in their yards stare at her as she passes
She walks on, coming to a group of slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall
girl, , 13, glances up
Hi Emma
Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play
Bye Emma
Frances shakes her head as she walks on
' Hey
Frances hesitates, then turns to look: man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her
(friendly) 'mere
wanna talk to you
Frances keeps walking
Harry hurries after her
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh
(reaches her, grabs her arm) Hey
Don't touch me
'm not gonna hurt you
just wanna talk
She stares at him
He's got a newspaper wedged under one arm
(waiting) Okay then
Well
you're causin' trouble, you know that
'm causing trouble
You're a pain in the butt
You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since won that dumb contest
'm just sixteen, you know
Who the hell cares what  think
Not me
But other people seem to
Yeah
Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it
Now wait a minute, sweetie
Do look like a newshound to you
(examining him) No
Actually, you look more like a cop
Harry laughs
That's rich
Hey, if  was a cop, 'd be packing, right
(holding coat open) You see a gun
Go on, search me
Pat me down
Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him
Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed
'll
take your word for it
So who are you, then
Harry York
work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here
(smiles & points to him) Oh yeah
saw you in the newsreel
(embarrassed) Yeah, well -- You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski
Now you're catchin' on
Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you
Whattaya mean
Well
see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist -- But 'm not
The newspapers're -- Right again
You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours
Could look bad for your Daddy
Yeah
Could look bad for you and Kaminski too,  guess
Beat
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen
Well aren't you the smoothie
Now you're going to ask for my number, suppose
suppose not
Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut
Well
'll give it a try, Mr
York
Harry
(hesitates, nods) Harry
They half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end
Then Harry doffs his hat
Bye
She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house
(admiring her) Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither
- Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench
These are perilous times
With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas -- ' know
The
We  that the courtroom is empty
Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant
Who's behind this, her mother
Now we  who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium
Impossible
As her attorney, 've known her for years
What about the father, he's a little pink
Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals
(shaking her head) He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home
No,  think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended
It was her teacher who entered it in the competition
Well, the publicity must stop
It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country
(sternly) Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma
Of course, your honor
He nods with satisfaction
Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in
-   - Ernest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table
Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars
We  bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes
Ernest rises
They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air
can thank you for that
It was a hard-earned talent
She moves the bread so Ernest again faces the check
As Lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly
(offering to Ernest) Bread
(taking a piece) Thank you
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer
Mama
(pushing back her plate) 'm not hungry
You two just enjoy yourselves
After all, this is a celebration
She leaves
long silence
They both glance slightly awkwardly at the check
Frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight
'm
'm really proud of you, Frances
Thanks, Dad
An essay contest
a national contest
That's pretty impressive
didn't have much to do with it
You wrote it, didn't you
Yeah,  suppose
Dad, who's Harry York
Well, Harry York is a guy who
well, he does a lot of things
Why do you ask
He talked to me today
Told me to keep my mouth shut or 'd get everybody in trouble
Yeah
well
it's possible
Harry York and  both work for Mr
Kaminski right now, and
well
There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break
That's the way of things, but Mr
Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous
Is Kaminski a Communist
No, no, no
All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation
He's a socialist, then
-  - Sitting at a rolltop desk
She's looking through a large scrapbook
We  articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading
She listens to the conversation in the other room
(
) The label's not important, Francie
What's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it
Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing
they don't mean much
All a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name
Lillian's face becomes set
She looks down at the book
An article titled "Girl Denies God" is there, freshly pasted
She lays a hand on the blank page opposite
(
) It's already started, Dad
with me
(
) know
- And  can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more tried to explain -- (what  meant) Lillian appears in the doorway
Don't listen to him, little sister
When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand
Yes, Ma
And you
should be proud
You won that contest and made a name for yourself
She stomps out
Frances and Ernest push back their plates
- Lillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly
As Ernest approaches, she senses him and grows silent
She speaks without turning around
You're poisoning that child's mind
have a right to talk to her
She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why 've sacrificed so much in order to achieve
You've sacrificed
If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents -- They need help, Lil
They pay me back in other ways
How
What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends
They're all anarchists
Traitors
(sadly) No, Lil
It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism
That's right
can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure
Beat
'm going back to the hotel
Good
See you next weekend
As usual
Everything as usual, Mr
Farmer
Just give me my due
Ernest starts back toward the house
He sees Frances watching them and slows down, turns
Lillian
'm more than willing to meet you halfway
Don't make me sick
'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound
(under his breath) That's a thought, Lil
That sure is a thought
He trudges back toward the house under Frances' eye
'  comes from behind the fence
' Are you all right, dear
'm fine, perfectly fine
- Ernest stands on the porch holding his little bag
Dad, please, don't leave early
Just because of Mama -- Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away
He trudges out and down the walk
Frances watches him, shaking her head
That is not a lesson she wants to learn
: - Opening night
Harry is reading a playbill displayed in a theatre lobby: "1934 Spring Production
University of Washington Players Present: 'Uncle Vanya' by Anton Chekhov
" Frances is playing Sonia
Harry turns and enters the theatre
- Frances on stage seen from a distance
What can we do, we must live
We shall live, Uncle Vanya
Frances is acting with a nervous young man,
As her speech progresses, the camera moves in nearer and nearer, ending with a close-up
It is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion
And then we shall rest, we shall rest
We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world
And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress
(wipes away tears) Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying
(through her tears) In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait
We shall rest
(embraces him) We shall rest
Curtains close
bursts into applause
As the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we in the audience: Lillian and Ernest, Lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging Ernest to clap harder
And in the back stands Harry York
(to himself) Not bad, Farmer
Not half bad
- celebration in progress
Masks of Comedy and Tragedy hang on the walls
lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily
Bing Crosby is on the record player, singing "'ve Got The World on a String
" The Drama Teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students
Art is a constant struggle
Some of you have the will but not the ability
For others, the opposite
don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two
The front door opens
Frances and Chet enter
On cue
The young men rush over to congratulate her
Frances takes a mock bow
She laughs as people cheer
observe from the back
#1 could really learn to hate her
#2 Stand in line
- Things have quieted down
The Drama Teacher has cornered Frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of "Voice of Action
" Frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action
" First prize is a trip to Moscow
You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski
But 'll never win that
Yes, yes, it's all arranged
Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name
And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York
(intrigued) Really
New York, Frances
Broadway
This is your chance
You belong on the stage
(flattered/embarrassed) Thank you
door opens quietly and Harry slips in
He smiles at Frances, who disentangles herself from her teacher and rushes over
Hi, Harry
Did you see the play
You think 'd miss it
Well
What'd you think
(shrugs) just wanted to see how you looked
How'd  look
(teasing) Enh
(smiling) Don't be a rat, Harry
You looked okay
(glances around) Joint's pretty dead
How 'bout take you home
She hesitates, looks around and sees Chet passed out, snoring in a chair
She takes Harry's arm
- The beach is very dark, but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old Chevrolet parked near the shore
(
) You really think so
- Frances and Harry are sitting in the back seat
Honest
When you were up there, you were really
there, know what mean
Everyone else looked stupid
don't know
did
feel different
Alive
Yeah, it's a gift
You gotta do something with it
Yeah, but if  win this trip, Mama'll kill me
She hates Russians
do want to go, though
to New York, especially
but  wanted to do it
What
Quietly
You're not the quiet type, Frances
They are silent for a while
You know, my old man was an inventor
Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that
Well, was supposed to be his partner
When told him the smell of his workshop made me sick,  thought he was going to die right there
What happened to him
He retired to Florida
made a killing in vending machines
He grins ironically and Frances laughs
kick myself sometimes, but the thing is,  would have been miserable living his life
So you think  should go
Sure
Try this acting thing
You can make good money at it
don't know, Harry
want so many
You don't know what you want
Yeah
She looks at him, smiles wistfully
Not in the long run, anyway
She starts to unbutton her blouse
Harry is pleasantly surprised, but unnerved
Frances
What
Well
don't you think it's up to me to
Come on, Harry
This is America, land of the free
(whispers) thought we might go skinny dipping
(pregnant pause
smile
) For starters
Harry can't believe his good fortune
- Lillian's face, distorted
Communists
No daughter of mine is going to Communist Russia
Lillian is in her apron, canning peaches
You act like 'm a bomb-thrower, Mama
It's just a trip
She leaves
Lillian follows her down the narrow -- almost institutional -- hallway
But they're using you
Oh Ma, they're not using me
It's just a chance to travel, see things
Besides, it's the only way  can get to New York
They've reached Frances' room
She puts on her coat
'll pay your way to New York
'll work, 'll slave
'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or -- (sighs) Oh, Mama, don't you understand
She stares out the window
We see Ernest mowing the lawn
have to do this on my own
You see, 've learned your lesson very well
To do what  think is right and everyone else be damned
Frances turns and heads back down the hall
Lillian follows
never taught you that
Frances keeps walking
Little sister, if you don't wise up soon, it's going to be out of my hands
They've reached the kitchen
Ernest is there, sweating, drinking water
It isn't in your hands, Mama
It's my life
Yes, but important people are concerned about this
Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles -- don't care
(grimacing) You will
She storms outside
Frances sighs, looks at her father
What do  do, Dad
You really want to go
Of course
And you think it's worth all this
If  didn't,  wouldn't put you through it
Then go
- Lillian has a few reporters drawn off to one side
Alma Styles and a  stand nearby
has gathered
Inside the station, more reporters are milling around Frances
(almost conspiratorial) The authorities tell me there's no legal way  can stop her, but the way  see it, it's bigger than me or my family
(the following is heard faintly as b
g
to the scene below) American integrity, that's what's at stake here
They're sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness
the dark forces that would overthrow our country
Your country
My country
-    - Ernest and the Drama Teacher stand at Frances' side
#1 Has your earlier denial of God led you to Communism
'm not a Communist
#2 But Frances, you said -- said all countries are of cultural interest
Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world
#2 Better than any American company
#1 What do you think of Stalin
Not much
Ask me about Stanislavski
#2 Who
(suddenly frantic, loud) Help me save my daughter
Save the children of America
dressed in black adds: Repent, Frances, Repent
Repent
Repent
Their cries seem weird, almost deranged, and Lillian is taken aback
- Passengers climb onto the bus
As Frances is hugged by her Drama Teacher, the Tall Spectral Man approaches her
In his arms he carries a potted plant, a Bible, and a flashlight
Bless you, sister, bless you
(dignified, as though conducting some bizarre ceremony) Here is a Bible for solace
and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us
and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest Russia
Frances accepts the gifts, bewildered
The Tall Spectral Man stares at her through hollow eyes
She staggers on toward the bus, looking like a bedraggled Statue of Liberty
The Tall Spectral Man sings an ethereal hymn
Lillian blocks Frances' path
Frances looks at her tearfully
love you, Mama
(turns to her father) love you, Dad
(hugging her) Be careful, Francie
As Frances climbs on board
Frances, 'm warning you
'm gonna throw myself beneath the wheels
'll do it, Frances
Frances
Inside the bus, Frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly
The bus starts
Everyone looks at Lillian
She is motionless
Furious
Frances sighs, and the bus moves off unimpeded
There is a homicidal rage in Lillian's eyes as she stares after the vehicle
Then the Reporters rush toward her
What do you say now, Mrs
Farmer
She looks down, her lip quivering
Humiliated, crumbling
As the reporters shout unanswered questions, Ernest puts his arm around his wife and leads her away
: : - Lillian is happily thumbing through her scrapbook
Her hand runs down the page, and we  a series of headlines, with photos: ' (Photo Lillian & Frances) Then: (Photo Lillian) Next is a  of Frances on board on ocean liner
Then   of her in what is clearly Moscow
She wears a Russian hat
The Kremlin stands behind her
Then  of her in New York, with a small clipping from the "New York Times": Visits Moscow Art Theatre
, Below this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad
Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her
Lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite -- blank -- page of her scrapbook
handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her
She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out
The clipping says: " " and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars
Lillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it
- We  the Hollywood sign in the distance
then to see the front of the studio
-  - Frances' hair is tightly curled
She is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool
Behind her   fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid
seasoned  kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, , surveys the scene
(
) One more time
Frances stares dramatically off into space
Hobbies
The camera clicks
Oh,  swim some
play the piano badly
and  read like a fiend: like history
No, no, people don't want that
Now listen: you spend lots of time at the beach
You're crazy about dancing
And you're the kind of girl who's just a little in love with love
Get it
Now try again
Hobbies
Look,
(writing in notepad) Beach
dancing
in love with love
(ironically) That's me
The camera clicks again
-- a tall, brooding, well- dressed man --
Good morning, Mr
Bebe
Who's this
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option
(an assessment) Okay
Good tits
Can't we show them off a little more
guess so, sir
(nods, stares again at Frances) Very fine bone structure
He leaves
Claire stares after him with profound contempt
(coming up to Claire) Not much to work with
How's this: (reading) 'The most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to Hollywood was 12,000 miles long
After winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to Europe
' She made some deal with the Commies and went to Moscow, but 'm not going to say that, am
Heavens no
Go on
Um
'Miss Farmer returned to New York City and had a brief fling with the Broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom
' 'Brief fling
' Well, actually she couldn't get hired, but lucky for her, some guy in our New York office saw her
She says soon as she gets a stake, she's going back
Claire rolls her eyes
She's heard this before
The Camera clicks again
Frances is frozen in time
- are doing a scene from "Design For Living
" Others sit around watching, whispering, flirting, sleeping
but Frances is paying very close attention, making notes
The  next to her rubs her arm and whispers something
She grimaces and pays no attention
Then she notices, two rows in front, a young handsome student, , who's also making notes
She stares at him for a second, then back at the stage
- tiny rustic cottage, dogs everywhere
Two identical old Fords are parked out front
- Frances sits on the couch talking on the phone
Did you get the check
Oh my God, it opened
, what'd you think
Water lands on her face
She grimaces playfully
Well,  hope  get bigger parts, they don't come much smaller
The last line is garbled as water streams in her mouth
She fumbles for something on the floor
No, 'm fine
just have water in my mouth
She finds a water pistol on the floor, picks up the phone, and starts searching for her assailant
No, Mama, 'm not changing my name
They can't actually make you, you know
Most people don't realize that
(playfully, covering receiver) Oh Dick
She flings open the bathroom door and finds him: Dick from drama class
furious water battle ensues
No, no, nothing's going on
(fast) love you too, Mama
Give my love to Dad
Bye
She hangs up, lowers her gun as Dick squirts her
She's getting wet
Her shirt clinging to her breasts
She likes it
Okay, handsome
You win
On the small screen we  Frances in the arms of a '
Kurt
Oh, Angela
Go with these trappers
They'll lead you safely down the mountain
But, Kurt,
No, No arguments
Be my good girl and go
There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what  have to do
Oh, Kurt
Oh Angela, my own
Angela
the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent
The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers
The brim of his hat hits her forehead
Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing
The Fire Chief looks stunned
She tries to control herself
'm sorry
(looking into camera) 'm sorry, let's go back
Laughter inside the screening room
small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly
#1 (irate) What the hell is that
What's she doing
That's talent, Andy
#1 (after a beat) Oh
- Frances smiles and eases shut the screening room door
We the Laughing Man inside shout: "Let's see that again
" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match
man's hand appears, holding a lighter
She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat
Harry
Harry-god-damn-York
real person
Frances throws her arms around him
They hug warmly
How ya doin', Farmer
Me
Look at you
What're you doing in Hollywood
Came to get a tan
They compare forearms
Not bad
But come on, Harry; what's the real reason
(staring out) Kaminski
Yeah,  read about that
Terrible business, suicide
Since when do you believe the papers
They killed him, kid
What
They killed him
They threw him out that window
Oh no
Eight stories
She stares down two stories to the ground, imagining: Jesus
(also staring down) Yup
Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die
Too god damn much heart
He just didn't want to die
(walking on) But
but why, Harry
Why'd they do it
(shrugs) He wouldn't play ball
What can tell ya
it's done
(brightening) Anyway,  didn't want to be next, so skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig
Tail and nail job
(confidentially) 'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman
(turns around, displaying his shirt) How d'ya like the camouflage
You jackass
(pushing him down the stairs) 'mon, let's get out of here
- Harry and Frances walking arm in arm
Not bad
It was slow at first, but 'm doing bits now
always told ya, Frances
You got real ability
(smiling) know what ability you're interested in
Hey, 'm a man, aren't
Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other
(off her sober expression) For old time's sake
(serious) Harry
met someone
(stiffens slightly) Yeah
What is he -- muscleman
Lifeguard
Frances shakes her head
Actor
She nods
Good
Then it's temporary
(whispers) All actors are phonies
He's joking, but she doesn't respond
Serious, huh
Yeah
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great
She smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment
She squeezes his arm and they continue walking
-  (   ) - Lights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking
In the midst of this we  Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the  , who is listening without enthusiasm
(spreading her arms) These creases
look like  just came from the laundry
'm supposed to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping on floors
(cool) This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer
(friendly) Oh,  know that
But it could look more realistic, don't you think
(looking her over) It'll do
No one will notice
'll notice
We  a man conspicuously clearing his throat
Both women turn as Mr
Bebe steps forward
Oh, Mr
Bebe, good morning
He nods imperceptibly
Come along with me, Fanny
She hesitates, then goes
That's Frances
'm not the cookbook
(leading her off) You see: We've got to change that name
- Frances and Bebe come through the sound stage door into the light
He gestures to indicate what direction they're going, but remains silent, watching her
She's uncomfortable, blinking like a bird
like your looks
You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties
Garbo, Dietrich -- Thank you -- intend to make a great deal of money off you
Frances is taken aback
This is all rather blunt
Since we have you on a seven year contract, 'm planning long-range
'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It
" Really
That's a very good book
It'd make a terrific -- Never mind that
'm concerned about you
Your attitude
They hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look: are fighting with
It is raucous, brutal
Bebe turns back to her with a stern look: Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs
You see,  view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and  can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can
But 'm concerned with everything, Mr
Bebe
(fierce but very muted) No, 'm concerned with everything
But 'm the one up there on the screen
That's right
You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act
She's about to reply, but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips
Kisses it very formally, like a suitor
Then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building
She watches him go
: : - Brightly colored bulbs flashing, causing the wisps of fog around them to glow
The bulbs spell: "   "  ' noisy  is gathered outside the theatre, straining against velvet cordons
Big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear, to the applause of the crowd
All slightly small-town, off-key
Harry, now sporting a mustache, hat pulled down over his face, stands across the street
(puffing his cigarette) Not bad, Farmer
- Two limousines streaking through the night
- Frances sits next to a faceless
She's all dolled up
She looks uncomfortable
Silence
She glances up at the limo ahead of them
- Dick sits between Lillian and Ernest   and crouch in front of them
guess it's no secret that 'm proud
Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done
(confidentially) As for her looks,  flatter myself that she gets them from me
Obviously
He winks at the reporters
And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law
Mr
Farmer, what was your reaction when Frances told you she had married
Dwayne
Dwayne Steele
What
Oh
Well,  was pleased, of course
Richard
uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman
Dick smiles and hugs them both
Well, all  can say is:  feel like 've known these two for years
(girlishly) Oh, Dwayne
(overcome) This is like a fairy tale
They're stopped at a light
Outside their window we , casualties of the depression, huddled in the night
'  - She's staring at the derelicts
We feel her sympathy for them
Almost like she'd rather be out there shouts something at them
What'd he say
She rolls down her window
The Studio Executive beside her looks at her like she's crazy
(to Driver) Let's go
We'll be late
The limousine lurches forward
Frances settles back in her seat, letting the night air sweep over her face
- The two limos pull up, the second emptying first
As Frances gets out, the  cheers wildly
She walks past them, eyes glazed
She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons
Lillian is posing and signing autographs
In her tight, formal dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted
As she walks, voices assault her: There she is
#1 (
) How does it feel to be back in Seattle, Frances
little strange
' Isn't she gorgeous
(
) This way
#2 (
) How's the movie, Frances
It's okay
(
) Smile, little sister, smile
Frances sees her mother smiling nervously
They have entered the: - Again there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle luminaries are sipping champagne
Reporter #1 lurches forward: #1 Can you make some statement about Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools -- Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it
was lucky
And what wasn't luck was hard work
#1 (disappointed) Oh
Judge Hillier's Wife, whom we recognize as the Woman who shouted at Frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a garish gown
She's holding a large key
' Miss Farmer,  can't tell you how proud  am to meet you
She embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little put off
After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' hand and won't let go
Judge Hillier steps to his wife's side
Lillian also approaches
' On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration -- Excuse me
' (startled) Yes
Don't  know you
' don't believe so
Sure
You shouted at me in the auditorium when  read my essay
' No, my dear
You must be mistaken
(barely audible) Oh bullshit
beg your pardon
(to the dignitaries) Listen, 'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all
hideous silence
Judge Hillier is fuming
His wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her
She shoves it into Frances' arms
Frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio Executive, who escorts her into the theatre
The crowd follows
Lillian is utterly mortified
- We  along the side of the theatre
An exit door is thrown open, and Frances storms out
As she does, she trips over an She stops and looks at him
He peers up at her with large forlorn eyes
then holds out his hand connection is made
All the anger drains out of her
She gives him money, several bills
He breaks into a wonderful crooked grin
She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city
He stares at it, bewildered
She strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley
The are talking and smoking a cigarette
Her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo
As it pulls into the street, we see Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it
- Frances sits on the old wood jetty staring out at the water, the lighthouse
Harry approaches
It's one thing to marry the guy, but did you have to sleep with him
She cracks up
Harry laughs at his mistake
Shit
meant the other way around
(still laughing) Well, the studio told me not to
Is that why you did it
Who ever thought they'd be right for once
Jesus, Harry
it's a zoo back there -- You're telling me
Dick
and my mother
She acts like she's on Mars or something -- Well, she's back to earth now
They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving
think you better go back, kid
Forget it
He looks at her thoughtfully, then sits
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie
mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending
And all my friends, know they're going to smile and say they loved it
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it
Not everybody lies, you know
(warmly, to him) No, they don't, do they
Beat
Frances, you're a movie star now
If you give them what they want, you can get anything
don't have what they want, Harry
(stares at the water) Harry, will you tell me something
How can  keep making movies when people in the streets are starving
Some people starve, kid
Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie
Makes 'em feel better
But  don't want to be like that want to do something
(important) What're you gonna do, waste your talent
Why not use it to make something worthwhile
You can do that, you know
(laughs) Yeah, if  don't make too big an ass of myself
They start to walk now along the beach
We see Harry's car and the chauffeured limousine parked above
Tell you what
Let's ditch the limo
Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy
The hell you will, Harry York
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits
She shakes her head mischievously
moves backward unbuttoning her coat
(like a clock striking) Bong
bong
bong
The coat falls
Don't start, Farmer
(dropping her scarf) It's midnight, Harry
My glittering raiments are dissolving
(nervously) The chauffeur
He's watching
He deserves a show
He missed the movie
'm serious, Frances
This is important
(kicking off a shoe) know
She kicks off another shoe, sailing it into the water
Frances is zipping off her dress
Harry bends to pick up the first shoe
single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands
Who was that girl, anyway
Harry watches her, mesmerized
The dress is off
'Come and get it,' Harry
She skips off down the beach, her dress strewn on the sands
After a moment, from the darkness, we  her underclothes fly into view
Harry can restrain himself no longer
(excited) Hot damn
He drops the shoe and runs after her, tearing off his clothes
After a moment, from the darkness, we hear her squeals of laughter
-  - The street outside the Studio Main Gate
Actors, directors, etc
arrive in their shiny expensive autos
Among them is Frances in her old battered Ford
She waves to the Guard and drives through
- As Frances pulls into her parking space, Claire, the woman from the photo session, strolls up
Hi Frances, got a minute
Sure, Claire
If you don't mind walking my way
They walk toward the dressing room
(nervous) Well,  suppose  should just say it
It's your clothes
(bewildered) My clothes
Yeah,  mean slacks
and work clothes
and that awful car -- It's a perfectly good car
It runs
Yes, but
Really,  hate to sound
it's just that the public expects something different from its stars
People won't take you seriously
don't care if my clothes are taken seriously
Or my car
You know what  mean
Uh-huh
You mean what if the public finds out  perspire
And wear slacks
And drive an old jalopy
What if they find out 'm a real person
Oh no
Say it ain't so
Not a real person
Claire is laughing
They go inside
'   - Posh, fit for a star
Frances smiles at the
Morning, Eddie
As Frances sits at the table and Eddie goes to work: That's not all, Frances
Mr
Bebe is very concerned about your politics
He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies
Yup
Claire
please, please tell Mr
Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies
'm sorry, Frances
It's my job, you know
know
(imitating Bebe) 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs
The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress
' (laughing) acts
'll relay your message
'  - Dick is talking on the phone in the living room
Yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights
Call back tomorrow, okay
He hangs up
Immediately the phone rings again
He stares at it wearily, then answers: (pointedly) Dwayne Steele's residence
Through the half-open door to the bedroom we see Frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her
Yes
(confused) What
(hurt) Yes
Yes, 'll tell her
He hangs up
Stares off
Slowly enters the bedroom
Frances looks up
You learn your lines
(nods drowsily) Sort of
There've been some calls
Who
Well
about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name
Claire
Yeah, Claire
She said she was fired
Too bad, huh
(apprehensively) Fired
Yeah
She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand
Frances looks stricken
Dick presses on
There was another call too
From your agent
He says your summer stock deal is all set
So you're going back east, huh
Yes
Without me
(sighing) Showdown
You weren't going to tell me, were you
Just pack up and leave, is that it
Dick, we need some time apart -- Hey, 'm not a complete fool, you know
can see you're going sour on me, and when  try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing
Dick,  can't even breathe here
Dwayne
'm Dwayne now
And you damn well better get used to it
(softly, remembering) Dick
don't suppose it occurred to you that  might want to leave too, that might want to do theatre
No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you
And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock
No
No
It's all about that night, isn't it
(bewildered) What night
The premiere
never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were
(quietly) You want his name
Dick is crumbling inside
What
We watch it sink in
Confusion
self-pity
building gradually to resentment and rage
He starts to throw a tantrum
Hurling things around the room
Frances just sits there
My God
think you're overplaying this a bit
He hurls a pillow against the wall and rushes out
Frances looks after him, then turns
She's now facing the bureau
Goodbye, Dick
mirror sits on top of the bureau
She looks into it
Doesn't like her expression
Turns the mirror away
: : - playbill in a theatre lobby reads: "Mt
Kisco Playhouse, 1937 Summer Season: '  '
" Among the names listed is: "Frances Farmer, the 'Come And Get It' Girl
Suddenly we  an eruption of applause
-  - on two men:   -- a thoughtful aristocratic man -- and  , who is taller, slimmer, with black hair and intense dark eyes
Around them we see (mostly ) the  going crazy, leaping to its feet, yelling "Bravo
Bravo
" Clurman and Odets sit impassively
As the hurrahs die down and the audience files out, the two men sit there
Finally Clurman turns to Odets
Odets nods very slightly
- Frances sits in the cramped room, listening intently to Clurman
Occasionally she sneaks a glance at Odets, who is pacing like some caged beast
The Group is more than a theatre company
It's the embodiment of an ideal
Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change
You see -- (watching Odets) Really, Mr
Clurman, you don't have to sell me
Forgive my indulgence
Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy
The point is, Mr
Odets here has written a wonderful play
Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead
Who is she
She's a tramp from Newark
Forgive me, but  think you'd be perfect for the part
Odets is pacing furiously, seizing their attention
He stops, looks at her, then resumes
Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault
a seduction
a plea for understanding
think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets
and you make very attractive ammunition
He stops
Tentatively, almost boyishly, he smiles
She returns it
She's charmed
And what's the title of this seduc
assault
(mysterious, intimate) 'Golden Boy
' - It reads "Golden Boy"
Crowds of people streaming out of the lobby
sign over the box office reads: "Tomorrow's performances sold out
" Odets sits on the curb
Behind him the lights in the theatre lobby flicker off
stroll by: an odd mix of affluent theatre crowd and 1930s bums
Frances emerges from the theatre, sees him sitting there
Sits beside him
Hi
He nods
You wanted to talk
Another nod
He's silent
He peers up the street
, 16, selling pencils catches his eye
You see that girl
She looks like a waif: tough, vulnerable, pleading with a , following them down the street
drama being played out in the distance, out of earshot
That's who my play is about
Frances watches the girl
That's me, Clifford
(strong) know, but 'm not seeing it
It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through
You're lazy -- - The same conversation continuing: 'm not
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire
But  want to
'm trying
need an incendiary
An arsonist
Then show me
That's what 'm here for, to learn, to grow
Good
Then it's very simple
You have to stop being afraid, Frances
It's in you
-   - Clurman is delivering a speech in the background as snap pictures
Behind them on the platform Frances and Odets continue their conversation in whispers: can see it
You just have to let it out
Trust it
No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle
Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle
We now  Clurman's speech
The initial words below were background to the above
What we  now is underlined: Not only an artist, but an instrument of change
We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs
We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy
We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive
(presenting check to ) The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too
'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford
Yes you are
We all are
The first step is to acknowledge our fear
- They're walking
The conversation continues
Face it
Confess it
You're weak
'm not
You're afraid
'm not
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it -- (angry) God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up
tell you,  want to give these things
want to give them to the audience, and  can give them, will give them, so shut up
She is seething
Gorgeous
Alive
He smiles, watching her
Good, good
Give them that
What
As she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about
She looks at him, still breathing heavily
Gradually her face turns toward a smile
He reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her
'  - Later
They enter slightly drunk, laughing
He takes her coat
Madam
Thank you
She's looking at the apartment
He sees her
dark thought flickers across his face, and he breaks into an exaggerated act: Oh my God
Frances, 'm such a cad
can't go through with this
My wife is in Europe, but this is her house
(gesturing off) her bedroom
can't ask you to
(playing along) Oh well
guess  better leave then
She starts to put on her coat
He watches her
Okay, but come here first
Huh
(Leading her down hall) Come here
want to show you something
He opens the bedroom door
- The bed is drawn back, and the sheets are sprinkled with rose petals
Frances' eyes are large
The kiss is very hungry now
'   -  - Bebe's huge desk
Variety Headline: "
" Next to the newspaper are a dozen pencils which Bebe is lining up precisely parallel
His expression is totally obsessive, crazed
Behind him a woman () is cutting his hair paces nearby
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer
She wants out of her contract, Mr
Bebe
She says she's through with motion pictures
(muttering) 'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Excuse me, sir
don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but  don't think it was me
Tora is massaging the back of Bebe's neck
He's oblivious
(startled) Well
you could always dump her, Mr
Bebe
Teach her a lesson
There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics
That's not the point
Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you
No
No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it
Oh
mean, good
think it's time to take the gloves off
(scowls, speaks into intercom) Get me some reporters
(afterthought) Particularly Louella Parsons
During this conversation, Bebe has been drawing on the Variety
We now see his work
Beneath the headline was a photo of Frances, on whom Bebe has drawn a mustache
: - The marquee for "Golden Boy" reads "Held Over"
are opening the glass doors from the empty lobby onto the street
We  thunderous applause from the inside
-  - Frances emerges from the stage door to a throng of She smiles tiredly, but good-naturedly complies little ways back stands a boyish   holding a single red carnation
When the Autograph-seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away, the Young Man steps forward
Miss Farmer
've never done this before
but
had to tell ya' you're great
He shyly hands her the flower
Thank you very much
'm glad you liked the play
She smiles and begins to walk away
The Young Man follows her
'm really sad it's closing
Now what am  gonna do on Tuesday nights
You can always come see it in London
Only if you were in it
Are you
wouldn't miss it
Boy, 'd love to
but 'm going to Hollywood
(smiling) Are you an actor
Hell yes
well, okay, 'm still in school
But as soon as graduate
California, here  come
(after a pause) Are you really serious
About acting
Why
yes
Then don't go to Hollywood
Why
'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place
It'll crush you
You sound as if you hate it
No,  don't hate it
Again she walks on
He follows
Aren't you ever going back
Not if  can help it
Gosh
You'll break a lot of hearts
They'll mend
(after a pause) What about your husband
Frances stops walking, her eyes shoot to the Young Man's face
What
Will you be getting back together
When you quit Hollywood,  mean
What is this
The Young Man suddenly seems much older, and there is no sign of the awkward boyishness
Is it true you're getting a divorce
Comrade
Why, you
you little bastard
The Young Man grins
Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer
Be seeing you
He begins to walk away
Just one minute
(turning) You're wasting your time, lady
Nothing's off the record with me
He is gone
- Odets sits at a table in back, drinking and writing in a notebook
Frances comes up to him
He smiles, draws her to him for a hug
How'd it go
She hesitates, still affected by the incident outside the theatre
'But how do  know you love me
' Your big speech
'How do  know it's true
You'll get to be the champ
They'll all want you, all the girls
But  don't care
've been undersea a long time
When they'd put their hands on me  used to say, "This isn't it
This isn't what  mean
" It's been a mysterious world for me
But Joe,  think you're it
don't know why,  think you're it
Take me home with you
' (smiling) already have
She nods, turns her back to him
How's it sound
The speech
Real good
You think  got it
You got it
Yeah
Yeah, tonight  think  got it
She is crying
'  - Frances comes in the front door with a bag of groceries, removes her key
Walks into the living room, stops short
Clurman is sitting on the couch, a bottle and two glasses in front of him
Hello, Harold
(nodding) Frances
(looking around) Where's Clifford
He's not here
Oh
She sits
Bourbon
He pours
She drinks hers, watching him
What's up
hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract
That's right
don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London
Well
well, you see, that's the point
You won't be opening in London
Frances looks like she's been punched in the stomach
(insecure) You don't think 'm good enough
What
Good Lord no, it's just
It's money
We needed backing and
well, we found it
Who
An actress
rich actress
Yes
That's the deal
She plays Lorna
(growing angry) But
but wait a minute
We're supposed to be different, right
Clifford says
This theatre is supposed to be different
And this play
this play is all about what greed and money do to people
know, but -- (over his line) What does Clifford say
Right now we have to be practical
Does Clifford even know
(off his silence) You didn't tell him, did you
(standing) 'm gonna tell him
Where is he
He knows, Frances
She collapses back into her seat
Her head is swirling
(gently) He approved it
She's glaring at him
He hands her a letter
'm very sorry, but
well, Hollywood wants you back, right
Her eyes fill with rage
She hurls her drink in his face
Prick
He stands and, with as much dignity as he can muster, leaves
Frances is shaking
She rips open the letter he gave her
Stares at it in horror
- Plain room
few tables with phones, men on the phones writing down numbers
Behind them are blackboards with horses' names and prices
Off to one side Harry is conferring with the
Of course it can be done, "Mr
Jones," but it's how you do it
There's a way to pay off
cops and a way to get yourself arrested
First you gotta know who to approach -- Man at one of the phones looks up, calls
You Harry York
Harry nods, startled
The Man at the table holds up the phone and goes to his next call
Harry takes the phone
'  -   - Frances on the phone
half-packed bag lies on the bed bottle and glass sit beside her
She's been crying and drinking
Harry
Harry, where are you
(
) Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me
called your god-damned office want you to kill him, Harry
You'll do that for me, won't you
loved him,  loved him
that bastard
'  - Calm down, Frances
(
) Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter
'  -   - Frances unfolds the crumpled letter Clurman gave her
Two lines
Two fucking lines
'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow can't see you any more
' Just like that
(
) Frances
(sobbing) Harry,  hate being in love
don't ever want to be in love again just hate it
- With the patter of the bookie taking bets beside him, Harry listens to Frances' sobs
know, Frances
know
He  a  on the other end
He hangs up and heaves a long slow sigh
: : -    - Frances, in a pair of overalls, falls face down into mud
-    - We  the slate: 'Flowing Gold', Scene 31A, Take 11
then the same action is repeated from a slightly different angle
Next to her is an old car, its wheels mired in mud
-    - Slate: Take 12
She falls again, this time splattering mud all over her face and hair
She lies still for a moment, gritting her teeth
Sitting comfortably in a nearby director's chair is a reading Daily Variety
The headline reads: " " Behind the Director, off to one side, stands Bebe
The
tugs on the Director's sleeve: How was that
(looking up) Good, good
One more time
(standing) For God's sake
why
Because we want to get it perfect
just the right combination of fury and confusion
You can understand that, can't you, Miss Farmer
We're serious artists here, right
Right
The Director glances toward Bebe, who nods with satisfaction
Frances watches this interaction
She hesitates, then approaches Bebe
She wipes some mud from her face and drops it at her feet
Look, Mr
Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me
'm back, and 'm gonna make the best of it
(somewhat snidely) 'd like nothing better
She turns and walks, with an air of pride, to her wardrobe trailer
- Lights everywhere
Cars line the driveway
We  the of a large party
car pulls up
gets out, goes around to open the door for Frances
She's exhausted
She doesn't move
Well
come on
This is a mistake
No
This is a disaster
Come on, it's just what you need
Let everyone see you
Talk to them, live it up
(tiredly) But we've been at it since six this morning
At least you could've let me go home and change
Look, Frances,  didn't want this job
Think 'm crazy
But you begged me: improve your image
So please
lemme try, huh
(getting out) You're right
'm sorry
(sighs) Okay, let's go get 'em
(taking pills from pocket) Here, take a few of these
Studio makes 'em in the basement
They keep the fat off
(joking) So not only am  a troublesome bitch, but 'm fat too
Come on
They make you feel nice and peppy
She nods, takes a few
They head for the door
-   - The
The hostess, , a pleasant-looking woman, answers the door
Hi
Bob Barnes
Looks like a swell party
(pleased) Frances
As they embrace, Frances looks around with trepidation: (whisper) God, who's here
(also whispering) The usual vermin, 'm afraid
Barnes tries to pull Frances inside
She sees a flurry of waiting faces
Everyone's watching her
(sotto voice) Get me a drink
Barnes nods, concerned, and crosses to the bar
Hi everybody
Some people seem amused, some curious, some scornful
The Director from the mud scene nods to her
Connie is at her side for support
voice from somewhere pierces the chatter: So nice to have you back, Frances
As Barnes returns with her drink, she turns to Connie: Connie, can  use the upstairs bathroom
Sure
- Later
Frances lies in a bubblebath, relaxing, sipping her drink
She obviously feels a lot better
Someone knocks
Come in
, stares at her
(relaxed) Hi
He is dumbfounded
He slowly retreats into the hall
- Barnes is talking to a Young Man whom we recognize as the reporter who tricked Frances in New York
You wouldn't believe the offers
Just piling in
mean piling
Some of the best scripts 've read in years
(sarcastic) Yes
My employer will be glad to hear that
Louella
Is she here
How could you miss her
He nods toward a hard-faced   surrounded by admirers
Louella's here and 'm talking to you
- We  the open door to the bathroom
Frances, with a towel around her, is going through Connie's closet
Barnes
Frances
(enters, sees her) Oh no
Refill my drink, will you, Bob
(aghast) What're you doing
Putting on my armor
Come on, Frances
Louella Parsons is here
She wants to talk to you, help you out
(musing) Louella
didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch
Come on, she's an important columnist
What's the matter
thought you wanted these people to forgive you
(darkly) 'Forgive'
For What
'm sorry
that was an unfortunate choice of words
Frances pulls down a dress and inspects it
You're not kidding
(firmly) Get me a refill, Bob
'll be down in a minute
He nods and retreats out the door
- Everyone chattering away
then hushing slightly
Heads turn: Frances is descending the stairway in one of Connie's dresses
She looks absolutely radiant
like some kind of goddess
Barnes, looking very pleased at her appearance and the others' reaction, hands her the drink
Thank you
Then the Young Reporter steps forward
(his callow youth act) Gee, awful good to see ya again, Miss Farmer
Frances bristles
Barnes looks on nervously: It's all becoming unravelled again
My employer would like to know something very important: is it true your friend Clifford sleeps in the nude
Frances is broiling
She stares at him
Under her steady gaze, the snide smile gradually fades from his face
You seem like an intelligent young man
Huh
Can't you find a more dignified way to make a living
He blanches
This hits home
Frances turns on her heel and leaves
- Frances rushes out, followed by Barnes and a few curious partygoers
She is very upset
Tight
Holding it in
Barnes pleads with her, tries to stop her, but she leaps in the car and speeds off, spewing gravel over him
The partygoers salute her with their drinks
- In the pale moonlight we  the dim outline of a poster tacked to the outside wall
The highway disappears down to the sea glittering dully in the distance
We  the of an approaching car
Its headlights crest the hill, illuminating the poster, showing a woman driving an open car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure
The poster reads, "When You're Riding Alone, You're Riding with Hitler
" The lights grow brighter, almost blinding
The car, accelerating furiously, flashes by
Then we  a motorcycle start up
It emerges from the blackness and speeds off in pursuit
roadsign reads: "Dimout Zone
" Frances drives fast, tears running her face
The   pulls up alongside and shouts, "Pull over
" She hesitates
He waves insistently
Gradually she slows
He gets off his bike and walks over, preparing the usual lecture
Okay
He leans over the car and sees Frances, her hair wild and tangled
(a come-on) Hey, where's the fire, sister
(sarcastic) In my eyes, officer
Cool off, beautiful
Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone
" (switching off her lights) There's a war on, you know
Come on
You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights
(testy) didn't make the law, lady
just enforce it
She switches her headlights back on
God, you bore me
She starts the car
The Cop, angry now, lunges in and grabs the keys
Don't touch me
She leaps out of the car
The Cop turns off the car lights
As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights
Hey
He runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way
When he catches her, he grabs her arm
She struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt
She switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea
He lunges for it, knocks her down
They struggle
He rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand
trying to handcuff her
She writhes, knees him in the balls
She crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones
The Cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on
As they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him
The Cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle
He pulls out his radio mike
(panting) Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six
got a live one here
: : - front page of the Los Angeles Times, October 1942
The headlines read: "24 Jap Ships Sunk", "Errol Flynn Sex Trial Delayed", "Frances Farmer Arrested on Drunk Driving Charge -- Actress Gets $250 Fine and Six Months Probation
" to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of Frances' beach house
As the papers ruffle in the wind, a little kitten swipes at them
Frances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one we saw at the opening of the film
man's shoes (
) Got any ginger beer
She turns, surprised and pleased to see him
Take a look
He walks off into the kitchen
She puts her diary away
(calling) How the hell do you find me anyway
(
) Animal magnetism
(she laughs) No ginger beer
What's this red stuff
What's left of my blood
(
) Think 'll have a glass
Help yourself
Everyone else has
Harry returns, sipping the drink
Very tasty
She smiles
(looking around) Nice joint
Can you afford it
Nope
The studio pays
Thank you, Harry
What for
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter
Well,  would have, you know
just didn't know how to cook it
She laughs
Six months' probation
You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer
You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops
took the early rounds
(laughs) 'll bet
don't know
It hurts, Harry
Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt
So you drink, and you fight with a cop
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads
Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads
And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really
Beats me
Beat
gotta get outta here
gotta get out of this town
We see a thought come to him
Hey look,  got some business down in San Diego
Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days
No, Harry,  can't -- (right now) You're coming
- Waterfront bar, full of , , and
Hanging over the bar is San Diego paraphernalia
Frances and Harry sit at a table
Heavy boozing has led to philosophizing: You know
when  started acting, you know what  wanted
He grunts: what
just wanted to be part of something
one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine
memorable
And  could say: did that,  made something good
And
Well
to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first
So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on
And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top
and there's nothing there
And you look behind you and there's no one below
You're just left there all alone
swaying in the god-damned breeze
In the background, we  a   lurching toward their table
Well, like the man said: "You can make a fresh start with your last breath
" The Sailor trips and falls across their table, spilling beer on Frances and knocking things over
(irritated) Hey, watch it
(eyeing her suggestively) Watch what
Get away from me, you foul slime
That's no way for a lady to talk
Take a walk, pal
Who said  was a lady
Sorry  insulted you
bitch
Hey
Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat
The Sailor goes berserk, takes a swing at Frances
Harry leaps in to protect her, starts to fight with the Sailor
Frances joins in; she's not going to let anyone fight her battles
The Sailor's  enters the fracas
Everyone's getting hit
As the melee continues we: : '   - cab pulls up
Frances gets out
She looks weary and has a bruise on her cheek
car is parked in the driveway
She frowns at it, shrugs, and carries her suitcase toward the house
- She enters with her bags, then drops them, stunned
The house is stripped bare
holding a measuring tape comes out of the bedroom
What happened
Who're you
Who're you
live here
You're Farmer
Oh
Well, look, they took your stuff out
Moved it to some hotel,  think
What
'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow
Frances stares at him, dumbfounded
: - Frances on the phone
Boxes spread out, their contents strewn over the floor, tables, etc
Frances is going through various piles, again and again, looking for something
(muttering) God damn it, god damn it
(into phone) Yes, 'll wait, 'm waiting
(to herself) don't believe this
They can't do this to me
She takes a long drink, sifts through a pile, then throws it on the bed in disgust
We  a voice on the phone
(into phone) Barnes
It's my diary
They stole my fucking diary
Find it, will you
Find it
God damn it, that's my life
She slams down the phone
-   - The crew is idle and the Director paces, muttering: Never
Never again
swear,  swear will never work with this broad -- Frances, looking pretty hung-over, enters blithely
You're four hours late
It's insane
It's unprofessional
'd say 'm behaving as professionally as anyone else in this town
Where were you
Terribly, terribly sorry;  overslept
What's the name of this fine entertainment we're all so involved in
The Director clenches his fists as though about to punch her
(looking blearly at the slate) Oh yes
"No Escape
" That's it
There's no escape
She walks to her dressing room as the Director explodes anew
'   - Small, cramped; not like the earlier one we saw
The Hairdresser -- whom we recognize as Tora, the woman who cut Bebe's hair -- stands waiting, holding her brushes and looking vexed
Frances enters
It's about time
You're not the star on this show, y'know
Frances sits
Tora begins brushing her hair, yanking Frances' head back with each stroke
Building tension
Of course, it's not up to me to say anything
'm just crew
'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful
Wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves
In fact,  think you are already
Fact,  think you better -- Frances cries out and twists around suddenly
Tora is thrown back: stumbling
falling
hitting her jaw against a chair
That's it
'm not taking this any more
quit
She storms out
Tora is left moaning, holding her jaw
-   - Frances marches across it
Everyone stares
Goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
When she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them all, grandiloquently
'   - She's snoring in bed
Face down, spread-eagled
The light is on
whiskey bottle (three-quarters empty), a tumbler (three- quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table
The phone
She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over
Her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off
Shit
The phone keeps
Her arm gropes for it
loud  at the door
What the hell's going on here
(calls) Hold on
(answering phone) Hello
(we  a dial tone) Hello
The  at the door becomes violent
Someone's breaking it down
Hey
The door splinters
What
Help
Men stream into the room
Back-lit from the hall they look like monsters, phantoms
They're carrying sticks
Frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom
Don't kill me
Don't kill me
She slams the door on the advancing figures
- Frances leans her weight against the door
Mama, help me, help me, Mama
Don't let them kill me
It's too much for her
She's shoved back, falling to the floor
The door flies open revealing
Leering at her
Frances clutches at the shower curtain, trying to cover herself
Get your clothes on
(crying) You have no right
You have no fucking right, you bastards
Get the hell out of here -- Get your clothes on, lady -- You're under arrest
- Frances is being led to the booking desk
All around her Photographers snap her picture, and Reporters walk alongside subjecting her to a never-ending barrage of questions
Frances just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour-faced facing her
Name
don't believe this
You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell  am
The Photographers laugh
Age
Fifteen
(bristling) Address
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond
Come on, this is a joke
Assault and battery
barely touched that bitch
Occupation
Frances considers for a moment, then smiles matter-of-factly
Cocksucker
The Sergeant reddens
Frances laughs as the Photographers snap their shots
'  -   - escort Frances to her cell
She shakes their hands off her arms and enters
They slide the door shut
Photographers press up to the bars
Frances calls after the matrons
Hey
'd like to leave a wake-up call for say, ten
Hey
'll have my bread and water in bed
Frances looks disgustedly at the Photographers and lies down heavily on the cot
Hey Frances
Why don't you comb your hair, okay
Take me the way  am
- Frances, looking disheveled, dazed, and over-tired from a sleepless night in jail, stands alone before the
Next to the  sits Tora, her jaw heavily bandaged, glaring at Frances
The spectator's section is packed
Is that not true
(under her breath) Who's writing this guy's lines
Answer the question
Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation
No,  couldn't get my hands on one
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed
never saw him
Why didn't he show up
Did you expect him to look you up
Why, certainly
wanted to get a peek at his face
Suppressed laughter ripples through the courtroom
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady
That's fine with me
(turning to spectators) Get it
Fine
fine
Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night
Sure it's true
was fighting for my country as well as myself
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen -- Frances moves closer to the bench
Are you telling me you didn't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning
can smell it from here, Your Honor
The courtroom erupts into surprised laughter
That's enough
Frances laughs triumphantly and spears the air with her finger, pointing at the Judge
It's the truth
can smell it from here -- you old hypocrite
The laughter grows
The Judge bangs his gavel
Miss Farmer
In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here
am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail
Fine
(rising) You are a deeply troubled young lady
only hope you change your course before it's too late
The Judge pounds his gavel
Frances is about to say something when suddenly the realization of what's happening hits her
The Judge is leaving the bench
runs out of the room
(frightened now) Wait a minute
haven't got a lawyer
The Judge ignores this
(shouting) What  want to know is do  have any civil rights
The Judge closes his chambers door behind him
Frances turns slowly
The Matrons are coming toward her
want to make a phone call
She lunges at the Matrons, trying to get past them
have a right to make a phone call
-      - The Reporter is phoning in his story
The hallway is pandemonium
(from his notes) "The kleig-lighted road to fame and fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair
Today film star Frances Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and drugs" -- 'm  going too fast for ya
In the next phone booth we  Harry listening to the Reporter's spiel
He regards the confusion around him with calm eyes
- They burst open
The Matrons and Two Cops come out carrying Frances
Reporters and Photographers rush past her
They're stealing my civil rights
Help me
'm being kidnapped
Oh God, help me
Help me
She suddenly sees the phone booths
Her eyes fill with tears, her shoulders slump forward and her lower lip begins to tremble
She no longer struggles
(to a Matron) Haven't you ever had a broken heart
The Matron relaxes her grip and gives Frances a handkerchief
Frances dabs at her eyes
wraps the kerchief around her knuckles
and slugs the Matron in the jaw, sending her sprawling
Frances runs to the phones
Oh my God, she's loose
Frances throws herself at the door of the booth
The Reporter is delirious with joy: what a story
She's attacking your correspondent
Right here in the Court Building
Good God, this bitch is crazy
Someone stop her
Frances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to the next booth
into the arms of Harry
(a whisper) Harry
Harry shakes his head
Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator
have a right
have a right
(into phone) With what must surely be the final act of madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer's once promising career
The crazed blonde who at 27
Harry opens the door to his booth
The Reporter looks up at him
Hold it a second, Bub
Harry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the face
The Reporter sags, out like a light
In the confusion, no one has noticed a thing
Harry pulls the door shut
- Frances is sitting in a wooden chair
The venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed
The room is dim and terribly quiet
is murmuring something to a kindly-looking
Another  is standing beside her
Frances can't quite make out the words
and we feel that this would be more appropriate
a difficult decision, but, 'm sure, the proper one
He nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn away from the bench
As they pass in front of one of the tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman
It is Alma Styles
What
She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens
Her mother's face appears by hers
(whispering) It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine
Mama, what's
Shhh, shhh
You're not going to jail, Frances
The Judge has put you under my care
'll see you get the rest you need
You're taking me home
Two other  appear at either side of Frances and Lillian
Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands
(smiling) First things first, little sister
Trust me
She kisses Frances on the forehead
Frances looks at the two Women
They are smiling understandingly at Lillian
Frances looks a little alarmed
- wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates
On a white-washed wall are black letters: " "
The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up
The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway
As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene
The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees
- Frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette
Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance
Why it's beautiful here
What a view
Lillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that
An awkward moment of silence
Lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say
She is rescued when the door opens and
(early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters
He holds his right hand out to Frances
Good afternoon, Miss Farmer
'm Dr
Symington
Frances stares at the proffered hand
Lillian steps in quickly and takes it
Good afternoon, Doctor
The Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's arm
'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs
Farmer
'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later
Right now think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in
Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here
He smiles pleasantly
Lillian is obviously very put off by the idea
She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the window
Oh
Well,  have some background that you should probably know about if you're
have no doubt, Mrs
Farmer
If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment
He goes to the door and opens it
Lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces
She bends down and tightly hugs Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times
'll be back real soon, little sister
You be a good girl
She waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door
(staring out window) Mama
Lillian turns back expectantly
(warningly) want to go home, Mama
Lillian looks to the Doctor, who nods sympathetically at her
You'll see, little sister
Everything will be fine
The doctors know best
She goes out and down the hall
The Doctor closes the door
find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
Am  supposed to say 'thank you'
Thanks are hardly necessary
Aw, shucks, ma'am
'weren't nothin'
'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor
It ain't for lack of trying
So it seems
May we be serious for a moment
(seductively) Why, Doctor
We've only just met
He reddens ever so slightly and looks away
feel 've known you for a long time
you see, 've followed your career
you're a fascinating case
'm looking forward to resolving your predicament
Frances' face begins to set in hard planes
Oh
Are you really
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of
It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which
(can cripple your ability to function
) He stops as Frances rises and leans over his desk: Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than  do
Please sit down
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor
You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me
'm not interested
can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian
see
Besides,  don't want to be what you want to make me
And what's that
Normal
Average
All right
Will you please sit down now
(smiling) Symington says
Did you really say that
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer
This whole thing is a joke
Stay calm, please
No, you stay calm, Doctor
But you're finding that difficult, aren't you
(soft, seductive) Why, are you attracted to me
Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions
after we know each other a little better
(turning harder) and you've torn my personality to shreds, and 'm weeping and vulnerable
(very hard) then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor
" 'll have someone show you to your room
Oh, that's good, very professional
In control
But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away
Symington stares at her
With a careful, almost scientific gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip, then rubs the two fingers together
Yes, there is sweat
You really should get some rest now
Nurse will meet you outside
Good day
He pushes a button on his desk and reaches for a folder
Frances hasn't moved
She gazes at him evenly
Is there something else
You didn't say 'Symington says'
His eyes are very calm now, he smiles at her patronizingly
Symington says
'  - Small, white, spartan and rather pleasant
Lillian is standing by the window, testing the locks
She turns and goes to the bed, fussing with the pillow, seeming very uncomfortable
She pulls at the corners of the mattress
The door opens and a tall, sullen-looking  walks in
Lillian doesn't pay much attention to her
Not much on hospital corners, are you
You Farmer
Something in her tone makes Lillian look up
The Matron closes the door behind her and advances
Lillian assumes her full height
- Frances is walking with a
They pass a variety of other patients, some of whom look old or beaten but few of whom seem overtly crazy
So this is the nuthouse
The Nurse smiles confidentially at her
Honey
take my word for it
This is a resort
They get to the door and  Lillian's protesting voice: (
) You have no right
They enter and  the Matron struggling to get Lillian's coat away from her
Lillian pleads with Frances
Tell them who  am
Tell them who am
Are you crazy
Unhand that woman
That's Amelia Earhart
Frances bursts out laughing
The Matron releases Lillian and comes for Frances
'  -  - little fluid squirts out the tip
(
) But what is it
Frances strapped down on a white cot
The Nurse is holding the syringe while a   and an  stand by
You've got to tell me what it is
It's insulin
It throws your body into shock
Frances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic
(reassuringly) It's just vitamins
This sounds more reasonable
Frances relaxes somewhat
, , -Complex, certain minerals
(inserting hypo) Just stay relaxed
Good, now open your mouth a sec
Frances does
The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth
Frances squirms, fights
The Attendant holds the bar in place
And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo
Frances goes rigid
Her eyes widen, her back arches
With a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse
The into bright white light
She is unconscious
The -   - Frances sits beside Lillian on a bench
Other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about
There is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to Frances
Frances seems restless
and here's the one from Duluth war widow with five children
She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you
answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time
She hands it to Frances, who lets it drop beside her on the bench
And here's one from nice Mr
Zeiss
He says that
Why are these all opened
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances
It's good manners and good sense
You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now
Then why did you bring them
It's your fan mail, little sister
(looking off, under her breath) You kill me, Mama
What
Go on
Frances sighs
She looks for something to divert her attention
'  - Frances is alone in the room
The door is ajar
She's standing over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad
The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic
After a moment, Symington  holding several folders
Frances' manner changes very subtly
'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over
Did you enjoy your mother's visit
(sitting) Yes
It was very good to see her
Really
Any problems
Symington puts the folders in a drawer
All except Frances'
Not at all
She brought me my fan mail
(a performance) had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me
But guess that's the best thing about working in the movies
You make so many friends
want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake
You're telling me you feel guilty
(slightly edgy) No
What  mean is
'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all
(after a pause) Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you
(laughing) What
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me
" never said
Oh look
That's just a figure of speech
She said something funny, and  said
And you accused her of tampering with your mail
Oh for Christ's
Frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief around her knuckles
Looks a little crazy
Symington's watching it
She stops
'm sorry
She misunderstood, that's all
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative
Whom do you think  should believe
Doctor,  hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety
You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends
Consequently,  didn't recommend your release at the staff review
You what
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though 'm pleased you're feeling more
capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time
Don't you agree
Frances stares at him
Stunned
Horrified
(smiling) 'm sure you'll see it my way in the end
Dr
Symington, how big is your dick
Huh
'Cause if it's long enough, which doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass
Symington smiles patronizingly
want outta here, you understand
'm ready to get out
So you go back there
you go back and you tell them to let me out
(calmly) Frances, 'm warning you
No, 'm warning you
Who do you think you are, God
You bumble around with your folders
(she knocks her folder to the floor) and your pencils
(she grabs some pencils and throws them at him) and your god-damn buttons
(she pounds on the inter-com; a voice says, 'Yes, Doctor
') all your badges of authority
But you have no authority
You're nothing
You're a zero
She tears open the door
Two huge  are waiting
Frances tries to barrel past, but they easily restrain her
Doc
Symington sits forward, his hands smoothing his hair
Frances smiles sarcastically at him: Symington says
(tonelessly) Sedate her
They haul her away
- few  stroll about, visiting with relatives
Frances lies on a chaise lounge
She's wearing a robe and dark glasses, a big hat, and she seems to be sleeping Her hair is a mess, her skin splotchy
And something is moving: her hand
one finger on one hand is moving in agitated little bursts
We realize she is not sleeping at all
(
) Hi there
How 'bout a walk in the woods
She looks to one side and sees him
Frowns
Takes off her glasses and runs her fingers nervously through her hair
Oh my God,  look awful
(friendly) You've looked a whole lot better
'mon
- Frances and Harry walking in a relatively secluded area
She glances around continuously
suspiciously
They're doin' stuff to me, Harry
Can you see it
You feel it
They're putting stuff in my food or something, my water, and they're using it to put thoughts in my head
You understand
They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're trying to drive me crazy
Oh, Harry
She breaks down and weeps on Harry's shoulder
Harry looks around warily
can't stay here anymore, you understand
can't,  can't
gotta get home
gotta get somewhere else, anywhere, okay
Harry nods, squeezes her arm firmly -- a warning -- as a white-coated
Frances straightens up
Oh, Miss Farmer
Time for your bath, Miss Farmer
(urgent whisper) Listen: to the left
Straight through the trees and over the wall to your left
My car is there
The Attendant reaches them
(as if to a child) It's time for your bath
Oh good
love my baths
Come along now
Frances starts to move off with the Attendant
For an instant Harry -- and we -- wonder if she really is crazy
Frances
Did you hear what  said
She turns
The Attendant turns
She smiles sweetly, madly
Of course, Harry
The Attendant is between her and Harry
We  her face turn dark
She shoves the Attendant toward Harry and shouts: (fiercely) Over the walls
She runs
The Attendant staggers toward Harry, who knocks him down with two punches
runs up
Harry whips out an icepick and brandishes it at them: You want crazy
'll show you crazy
The Attendants hold their ground
Harry runs after Frances
- Frances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall
(offering to lift her) Here
Frances hugs him tightly, kisses him
He lifts her by the waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up
Harry joins her
We , over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr waiting on a dirt road
Harry and Frances jump down as we the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up
As their heads pop over the top of the wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust
-  - Harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead
The   quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad
After a while, there's movement in the back seat and Frances sits up
She yawns and stretches as Harry watches her in the mirror
Evening, gorgeous
(yawning) That sure looks like fun
(leaning over front seat) You know how long it's been since was behind the wheel
Forget it, Frances
You're not driving
Have  told you how mean you're turning, York
Harry smiles
Frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio
Where are we, mean man
Couple hours from Idaho
We'll cut across to Montana
've got friends there with a ranch
should've known
What
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone
That's right
(smiling) Take advantage of me
Harry laughs
They pass a poster: "
" Frances stares at it
don't think 'd be much good in a war
Whattaya think you're in now
(sleepily) don't know
Not a war exactly
It's more a
a misapprehension maybe
Huh
misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things wasn't declaring war, Harry
was just saying my prayers
Harry looks at her quizzically
Who to
Beat
Harry,  have to go home
have to talk to Mama
Frances, you're fulla drugs
You don't know what you're saying
Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood
Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her
(sitting up) No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all
Yeah
She's a shark, Frances
'm not taking you there, and that's that
She rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften
She looks at him fondly, thoughtfully
You know something, Harry
guess
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect
There's only one other thing wrong with you
What's that
You can't drink
: - The Lincoln is parked beside a few other cars
- Frances and Harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses
The  , a few  dance
Frances is gulping down a tall Scotch
(wincing/grinning) Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch
(calling drunkenly) Hey
Another shot for the lady and a double for me
What a man
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground
(hoisting her glass) To quarter-horses
No
To thoroughbreds
He knocks back his drink
hand puts a nickel in, and we  Bing Crosby singing "Love Is So Terrific
" We  across the dance floor, where Harry and Frances are dancing
' Love is so terrific Such a funny feeling Makes you want to cuddle And coo
Frances squeals with delight when she hears the song
She holds Harry forcefully and starts to lead him around the floor
Harry starts to sing along: & Makes you sentimental, Makes you kinda gentle Ouch
(Frances pinches Harry) Terrific thing
Around them an infection is spreading: all the women are leading their men
For an instant it is magical, liberating
She leans her head against his shoulder
Why are you always leaving me, Harry
Huh
You should stickaround sometimes
Look out for me
Look, Frances, 'm only gonna ask this one time
mean it
swear after this, 'll never ask again: Will you marry me
(after a long pause) know a thing or two about marriage
You
you understand me more than anyone, Harry
maybe even more than Mama
But
you're too important to me
'd fail you
don't know how or why, but  would
And that's a chance  just can't take
Do you understand
(a bitter smile) Well
'll act like  do until do
They are silent for a moment
There's just one more thing
What's that
Will you marry me
She laughs happily
He joins her, but his seems a little forced
She leans her head on his shoulder and holds him tight
They dance
-  - The Lincoln, Harry at the wheel, drives up and stops
Harry shakes his head
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver
Be the smartest thing
Thanks, Harry, really, but
can't explain it
She's my mother
She's just
can't give up on her that easy
You give up on her
Yeah
It's just
something  gotta do,  guess
(smiling warmly) Frances, You're crazy
(whispers) know
Don't tell anyone
He laughs
We  Lillian come out onto the porch with uncharacteristic trepidation
Anyway
if you need me
(warmly) got your number, Mister Man
She gets out, waves to him, and walks toward the house
Harry drives off
As Frances reaches the top step, Lillian suddenly opens her arms: (nervous, forced) Welcome home, little sister
- Frances and Lillian enter
On the sofa sits Alma Styles
Alma and Lillian seem slightly furtive
Caught in the act
Well, who have we here
(anxiously) Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles
Hello, Frances
You seem to be having quite a time of it
called Alma because  think we'll need
Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood have petitioned the court for your return
Your mother has asked me to intervene so you can stay here
swear  didn't know what they were doing to you
wouldn't have let them
She bursts into tears
Frances takes her in her arms and rocks her like a child
It's okay, Mama
It's okay
You realize, of course, your mother is now your legal guardian
In the eyes of the law, you no longer have any rights as an adult
You're going to have to hold your tongue and be selective about whom you mix with
That man who drove you here, for instance -- You leave him out of this
Frances, please don't
Never mind
We won't have to worry about him much longer
-   '  - Harry pulls up at a stop sign
He rubs his forehead wearily as a car crosses the intersection
It stops dead in front of him
Another pulls up alongside
Another behind
Harry thinks about this
His hand slides down slowly under the seat
We the handle of his ice pick
Harry turns to smile at the in the next car
The Man flashes an  badge, points revolver: (smiling) How ya doin', Al
You got the wrong guy
Name's Slocum
No, it ain't
And it ain't Harry York, neither
Look, 'm tellin' you
The  Man pulls the hammer back on the revolver opens the passenger door
'd give you till ten, Al, but we ain't got the time
: ' Judge Hillier walking
out of the chamber and down a corridor
His stride is long, his demeanor purposeful
The corridor leads into a courtroom
Harry standing at attention
We hear Hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official
Harry stares up at the judge
Alvin Hanson, a
k
a
Ronald Burns, Thomas Slocum, Harry York
Mr
Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years
Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed -- inciting to riot -- and the cause you sought to promote -- a worker's rebellion -- are such anathemas to this court that  feel compelled to mete out the full sentence
only wish it were longer
(slamming gavel) Six months in the state penitentiary
- Frances sits at the piano playing "You Are My Sunshine"
Lillian is lounging on the couch, leafing happily through her scrapbook
Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton'
Frances' brows mesh
Oh Mama, 'm so
tired of that song
Please
want you to
It would make me so happy
Frances sighs and begins to play it
Lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along
It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day
Life has been so good to me
Why,  have just about everything one could wish
but  still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook
She smiles warmly at Frances
Frances abruptly stops playing
think  need a little air
What's wrong
Nothing
think 'll just go out for awhile
Where are you going
For a walk, Mama
Just a walk
She gets up and Lillian rouses herself
How long will you be
Not long
Frances goes down the hall for her coat
Lillian follows part way
(smiling) 'll have lunch ready by one
'll be back
At one
Promise
Sure
Frances returns wearing the coat
Lillian half-blocking her path
Say you promise
promise 'll
promise, Mama
Lillian nods, moves aside
As Frances heads for the door: You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister
(exiting) Yes, Mama
don't want you drinking, Frances
Yes, Mama
Lillian enters and re-establishes herself on the couch with a happy smile
She begins to hum "Flow Gently Sweet Afton" -   - sleep on broken couches and armchairs
In a corner by a pay phone Ernest Farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs
Frances sits across from him
They've been talking
So what do you think
don't know, honey
Your mother has such big plans for you
know that, Dad, but -- What you have to understand, Francie, is that she
well
she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to
The only time  ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers
but she could have been
if times were different she could have been a politician or
don't know
But Dad, 'm asking about me
What do you think  should do
(after a pause) Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same
Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got
or just let it go
This is the way of things, but guess you already know that
Dad
whatever  decide, will it be okay with you
Always
Always
Frances rises from her chair, looking around the room to hide her tears
Ernest rises too
'm sorry,
don't have a desk in my room, and
(it's not a proper office) don't care, Dad
love you
love you too, Francie
They look at each other across the desk for an uncomfortable moment, then Frances slowly leaves
He looks sadly after her
-  - Frances exits and starts across the road
Ernest comes to the window to watch her leave
It is raining and the water on the glass distorts his view
- '  - Lillian is straightening up Frances' room, rearranging things to suit herself
She hears the door slam downstairs
(
) 'm back, Mama
(coming into hall) Oh Frances, do  have news for you
Guess who -- (excited) Wait, Mama, wait
have something to tell you
've decided
well
'm not going to make movies anymore
thought that's what  wanted, and went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but  was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me
So now
now it's over
want a different kind of life, something
simple
want to live someplace quiet and peaceful
in the country maybe, and 'll have dogs and cats -- feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in
It's going to be okay, Mama,  know it
And love you
She goes to hug her mother, but Lillian has changed
Frances' news has chilled her
(coming down stairs) Don't
talk crazy
Mama
(entering living room) They want you back
Your agent called today
Don't you understand
He's sending the scripts
He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people
Frances, you can't do this to your fans
Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare
You can't turn your back on them now
Look at this fan mail 've been answering
She points to a stack of letters on the table
Haven't you heard what  said
told him to come up
told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured
'm not cured
was never sick
They had no business putting me in there
My only responsibility is to myself now
You
you selfish, selfish child
At least talk to him, hear what he has to say
No
You want to throw it all away, is that it
You had everything, little sister
Beauty
a brilliant career
a wonderful husband
You were a movie star
Mama, shut up
And now you're throwing everything away
You're gonna be a nobody
Nobody
You know what that's like
(sudden realization) You
You'd send me back, wouldn't you
You would
Frances grabs her coat
Where are you going
'm going out
You're not going anywhere
Yes,  am, and you can't stop me
You can't tell me what to do, mother
'm a grown woman, and  can decide about my own life
Frances
They're wrestling, Lillian trying to prevent her from leaving
Don't you try and stop me
Don't you dare
She grabs Lillian's wrists and twists them, throws her back
If you follow me, Mama,  swear 'll fucking kill you
Frances storms out
Lillian sits back in the chair, suddenly looking very old
She massages her wrists
That's it
You've done it now, little sister
- Dark
Blinds drawn
We  a single light with a green shade, the soft coo of Lillian's voice
The gradually onto her earnest face
All my life, 've tried to live up to my parents' example
To have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great
taught that to Frances: Speak out
Aspire
Make something of yourself, something -- (to be proud of) (bored) Yes, yes, Mrs
Farmer -- Frances has always been a battleground, Lillian
, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with Judge Hillier around a table
The point is: it's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse
Well
yes
Doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him
And you feel you're unable to control her any longer
No
mean, yes, Doctor
Alma holds up Lillian's bruised wrists as evidence
And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution
Well, Alma told me that
Alma looks coolly at Lillian
Yes
Hillier nods slightly, approvingly, toward Alma
(closing his folder) believe that's all  need to know about Miss Farmer
think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs
Richardson
Her married name
Yes
It's less recognizable
'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum
Oh yes
Now
Can you tell us where we might find Frances
- It's late
Frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted
Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it
Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up
Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini
' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no,  gotta close
Big Otis is coming to town
' Behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain
In the street a police car cruises slowly past
Salesman says, ' don't care
gotta have a martini
' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back
Salesman sits there sipping his martini,
he's got the bar all to himself
Then he hears it
This big roaring in the street
(stomping her feet) Gigantic footsteps
coming closer
Stopping
We  the police car again
It stops out front
Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges
This huge man stomps in
Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere
appear at the window, looking in
He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here
' Salesman says, ''m just drinking a martini
' 'Oh yeah
' the guy says
'Well you better get outa here
Big Otis is coming to town
' Everyone laughs
long moment of enjoyment
Then Frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops
- Hillier behind the bench
Doyle sits at a table with Alma Styles
taps out his notes in an odd, jerky style
(: This scene is , where appropriate, with shots of  in a bare room, wearing a strait jacket
) From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism
Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother
In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care
(to Styles) Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for Mrs
Richardson, do you waive jury trial
Yes, your Honor
She signs a paper which is passed to Hillier
Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician
and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician,  do hereby order that the said Mrs
Richardson, an insane person, be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom
He bangs his gavel
So ordered
Are the gentlemen from Steilacoom present
- Huge, dark-red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees
van pulls up to the front entrance
Two  get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out
She is strapped into a strait-jacket
She yells and struggles violently but a piercing  stops her
She looks up at the building
From a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves "hello"
- Frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum-covered hallway
There are many patients here, talking to imaginary birds, laughing at unheard jokes
few of them notice Frances, most do not
The two Orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open
bare 6'10' room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows
Frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click
- wheels a small electrical machine up to a table
On the table Frances is securely strapped down grease Frances' temples and put two metal electrodes on them
The electrodes are connected to the machine
#1 What's she getting, anyway
#2 Standard series to start
#1 Fifteen
Doctor #2 nods and jams a rubber bar into Frances' mouth
The Medical Student steps forward
Can  push the button on this one
Doctor #1 shoots a silent query to Doctor #2
#2 Sure
The Medical Student pushes the button with great gravity
Frances' body immediately begins to convulse
It seems as if it will never stop
-  '  - Beds three inches apart
Women patients lie on them in varying stages of madness and decay
Some are bound to their beds with coarse cloth strips
One bed is empty, the bonds chewed through
We find Frances sitting on the floor staring at a hissing radiator
Her lips are caked with blood
Her eyes are glazed
She is dreaming
Or remembering
: ( ) scene from one of her movies or plays
Soundless
She looks radiant, vivacious, alive
: -  -  - ushers Frances and two  into a sparse tiled room with dilapidated plumbing and fungus growing between the tiles
In the center are three steel baths with hammocks suspended above them
The Attendants strap Frances into a bath as Dr
Doyle enters
(speaking with difficulty) Doctor, it may sound odd, but believe 've profited from my stay here
It's just what 've needed, to get away like this
But 'm recuperated now
've had lots of time to think and 've made a few decisions about my life
'm ready to get on with it
know you believe that
Don't you
'm afraid not
You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators
Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure
Does that make sense
The Attendants lower her into the empty tub
No
Cut this runaround, Doctor know better
(smiling) Listen to yourself, Frances
The resistance, the anger in your voice
(tightly) You
'm sorry, forgive me
Doctor, tell me honestly, what do  have to do to get out of here
Be patient, that's all
Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments
You'll be yourself again,  assure you
see
We'll talk more about this
'll see you later
One question
If 'm not myself now, just who do you think  am
The Doctor smiles sympathetically
We'll talk
As he turns to leave, Frances laughs triumphantly
The two Attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with ice-cold water
What the hell
They shove a rubber bit between her teeth
She immediately spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep her teeth from chattering
-   - Everyone eating gruel
parade of lunatics
The edge of incipient violence is palpable
Frances eats listlessly
Others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, fondling each other
Suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall
Other voices join in
At first we don't understand it, but gradually the words become clear: Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
The whole hall joins in
The Nurses make no effort to stop it
Others at Frances' table smile at her, try to push her to her feet
When they succeed, the hall breaks into applause and a new chaotic chant: We want Frances
We want Frances
The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds
Everyone is watching Frances
She climbs up on her bench
Her eyes are glazed, her face expressionless
This feels like some kind of automatic behavior
She takes an exaggerated posture and speaks in almost a whisper: Come and get it
The hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping
Frances climbs down from her bench
That was the entire performance
- Two dark  move stealthily along the shadow of the main building
little ways ahead, a door opens, sending a shaft of light across the ground
The two Men duck back into the shadows
Five young  , paying off and waving goodbye to one of the Orderlies
The door closes
They head off down the road laughing and joking together
The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door
They try the handle
It opens
The first one in is Harry, followed by the other Man carrying a rolled-up bundle
- We  Harry and the other Man, now wearing a white Doctor's coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway
They come to a large door with a barred window
The Man fiddles with a keyring and unlocks the door
They enter
We  the door lock behind them
- Just inside the door the Doctor flicks on a flashlight and they walk down the center of the room
The beam of light sweeps over women  in their cots, crammed side-by- side
Some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling
few smile invitingly at the two Men, whispering obscenities
The light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner between the wall and a cot
It is Frances
Harry goes to her, putting his arms around her
She is very heavily sedated
Tears spring to Harry's eyes
(whispering) Frances
Frances
Who
Frances, it's me, Harry
Touch me again and 'll kill you, you pig
Watch out, Harry
Let me look her over
Harry is on the verge of tears
Oh, God
Let's get her out of here tonight, right now
Let's take her with us
The hearing's tomorrow
If she gets out legally, they can't come after her
Look at her
She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow
'm taking care of that, Harry
Just hold her
(pulling a hypodermic from his pocket) Reserpine
guarantee you this'll clear her head
She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing
Harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm
Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly
Yeah
she knows about these
Shut her up
Harry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the Doctor injects her
Her arm is covered with sores
(tenderly) You'll be okay, honey
He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay
Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful
The Doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm
This stuff takes pretty quick
Let's go
(grabbing Harry) Please
Take me
Other women in the ward cry out: "Take me
Take me
" (pulling Harry) Let's get out of here
'll lose my job
Frances, we gotta do it this way
Just remember tomorrow, remember what  told you
What're you gonna tell 'em
(groggily) 'm grateful
grateful
'm grateful
'm grateful
(very worried) Harry
gotta go now
Harry, please
- The two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door
We're all square now, Harry
Right
All square, Doc
Good
'Cause  don't want to see you again
Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window
We can just hear her: love you, Harry
love you
love you too, Frances
Behind Frances we  the Women screaming: " love you, Harry
" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the corridor
- Frances turns to face the women in their cots
Collects herself
Looks repentant
She is practicing tomorrow's speech
realize now that  was a very sick woman
Sick
She's sick
couldn't relate to others in a normal way
(playful warning) She's
not
normal
The others laugh
We realize that if Frances can handle this, she can sail through it tomorrow
The catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech
And  was not taking responsibility for my actions
But now, thanks to your treatment,  feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which  so single-handedly shattered
only hope
hope  can make you all proud of me
Thank you
Thank you so much
The room is silent now
very odd moment
To their astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her
- The vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling
The house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made
car pulls up
Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets out
As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks around, heaves a sigh; she's home
Then Christmas lights spring on over the porch
Lillian comes out grinning broadly, followed by
Frances blanches
- Frances sits on the couch next to Lillian
They're sipping tea and answering questions
Frances is uncomfortable
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind
No
No, it all depends on what offers get
Who did your hair, Frances
She touches it shyly
It's swept up in a continental style
Well,  like to try different styles
Sometimes if you're old-fashioned enough, you find you're modern
Right, Mama
Lillian laughs
What do you think of all this, Mrs
Farmer
It's a miracle
Just a miracle
- The porch light goes out
Shadows pass over the curtained windows
Across the street a match flares
Harry is leaning against a tree
He lights a cigarette and settles back to wait
-   - Lillian walks from room to room turning off lights
Frances is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray
Very domestic, out of character
She carries the tray into the kitchen
Oh, just leave those things for now
No, Mama, 'll take care of it
'll wash them in the morning
Lillian smiles warmly at her
You know, little sister,  never resented you for refusing to see me in the
the hospital
knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back
Thank you for understanding, Mama
Lillian links her arm with Frances' and they go upstairs together
Little sister,  don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work want you to rest
for a while anyway
will,  promise
They hug each other
Good night, dear
Lillian waits until Frances has shut her door before closing hers
- The front door opens and Frances, suitcase in hand, slips out onto the porch
She eases the door shut behind her, tiptoes down the steps and, without looking back, starts down the road
- Frances rounds the corner, then sees him: Harry, standing by his car, smiling
Where to
Oh Harry
She approaches him tentatively
This is it, kid
This is our chance
When you got a chance, you better take it
Yeah
don't know
You don't need to screw around anymore
You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother
You need me
know, but
There were so many people in there, Harry
Every time turned around someone was pressing against me
watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me
When  feel somebody near me now
anybody
my skin starts to crawl
Long beat
She turns and stares at him sadly
You can't change the things they did to me, Harry
Only  can do that
by myself
He nods slowly
Been a lot of years, you know long time waiting
For what
End up feeling like a sap
Oh please, Harry
don't even think it
You're the only person who ever
It's just
Can't you wait for me
don't know
(getting frantic) Yes you do
If you love me you can wait, right
month, six months, whatever it takes
Right
Except
time has a way of -- No, Harry, it's not time, it's us
You and me
And 'm telling you now that 'll come to you, okay
'll find you
will
(smiles wistfully) hope so, Frances
They hug
Together for an instant
Then she shivers as if the contact were too much
(disentangling) 'm sorry
He nods, looks at her
'll be seeing you, kid
He turns and walks slowly to his car
- Barren desert
The middle of nowhere
lone male , poor, stands at a crossroads
car coming the wrong direction raises dust along the highway
It slows, stops, and lets Frances out
She is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt
She has a heavy tan
She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually
He responds in kind
relaxed silence follows
Two strangers passing
His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm: Pretty morning
(nods) It's always beautiful at this time
Peaceful
And no people
Yes
Beat
Where you goin'
Wherever they're going, 'm going
Yeah,  know what that's like
Where you been
Well,  was picking fruit with some migrant workers until
She stops
She sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car
She averts her face
then tries to hide her gesture
What's the matter
Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away
They're looking for you, huh
She's uncertain whether to trust him
Takes the plunge: Yeah
What'd you do
You know, 've never been able to figure that out
He laughs
She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her
He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings: 've got a little whiskey here, warm you up
She smiles, truly grateful: Thank you
Then she sees a ball of dust nearing
a car on his side
Wait
Maybe they'll pick you up
The car stops
Its lights flashing
jump out
Shit
Run
She does
She's pursued
The Hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside
The Cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her
- Frances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly He watches them get in Ernest's car and drive off
His expression says very clearly: 'm glad that's over with
- Ernest's at the wheel, Frances at his side
Silence, then: Dad
Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out
Ernest writhes slightly with discomfort
Francie, you know  can't do that
Why
It's such a simple thing
You just let me out and  disappear down a road and you never have to see me again
They'll just catch you again, Francie
Besides, your mother will know
We  them approaching a side road
Dad, here
You don't have to stop, just slow down
You can tell Mama jumped out
She knows that's the kind of thing 'd do
She won't blame you
But  gave her my word
Besides, she's still your legal guardian
My hands are tied
They are nearer the side road
You know where you're taking me
You know what she'll do
Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please
Please, Francie
(pleading) Daddy
They pass the side road
It disappears behind them
All the life seems to drain from Frances
'll try to protect you, Francie will, 'll talk to her
We'll have a real talk
Frances buries her face in her hands
Are you
are you hungry
pity us, Dad
pity us both
-   - Lillian is sitting on the couch, waiting
We outside and stop
Doors slam
Steps come up the walk and onto the porch
The door opens and Frances and Ernest enter
Lillian rises to face her daughter
(coldly) Do  go right away or do  have time to take a bath
was hoping for a kind word, little sister
You were hoping for a kind word
You're my mother
You're supposed to nourish me
Support me
have
Through the window we  a white van pull up outside
No
All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you
But 'm not you, mother, and  never will be, and thank god for it
(to Ernest) That goes for you too
And frankly, don't know how, with the two of you,  turned out as sane as  am -- (to the who are at the door) Wait right there, gentlemen, 'll be with you in a minute
and believe me,  don't want to stay here one second longer than  have to
(turning back) But 've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame
In shame
But what -- (have  done
) No
You're not talking now
You listen
You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend 'm crazy and pretend 'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore
You can't pretend  love you because  don't
can't
Not after what you've done to me
Because you see
'm still me
'm trying real hard all this time to be me
and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all
(walking out the door) Okay, boys, 'm ready
The way she goes out that door we know she's never coming back
-   - The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their hair cropped very short
The walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing
The place looks like an enormous tool shed
The     and  never stops
These are the forgotten ones
beyond hope
Everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been
Their faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity
Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are pushing, kicking and screaming at them
Many squat in the dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, chanting wordlessly to themselves
Some appear lifeless, their prone bodies shoved out of the way
Some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some in mindless fist-fights
In a far corner we  a group of men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to us, facing the wall, grouped around something
We  their cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the back
We    and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity
It's Frances, lying naked and spread- eagled on the floor
Four hospital  pin her arms and legs
, his pants down around his ankles, is squirming violently on top of her
Frances' eyes are open but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker
She is passive and unresisting
She is reciting to herself, over and over
We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds
Two of the , waiting their turn, are smoking cigarettes and chatting idly
#1 Best deal  ever made
Twenty bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star
#2 Yeah, it's worth it  guess
#1 What's she saying, anyway
#2 Who knows
She's crazy, ain't she
Frances keeps reciting as one rapist gets off
The Soldiers cheer as another quickly takes his place
- heavy snow is falling
From the corrugated-tin Violent Ward, a thin white hand protrudes from a narrow window to catch a snowflake
As it opens and closes, capturing individual flakes, a "You Are My Sunshine
"
We recognize Frances' voice, still surprisingly strong and steady
: -   - discuss Frances' condition as we , background, that she is getting electroshock treatments from a pair of doctors
don't know why they even bother
She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant
Yeah
(nods) checked the files
This one holds the record for shock treatments
Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
(wincing) You're kidding
(indicating the doctors) Yeah, well, you know doctors
They sure hate to use that word
What
'Incurable
' -   - Frances, barely conscious, lies strapped to a bed
Doyle and an  approach her
Doyle nods toward her as if to say: that one
He and the Orderly unstrap her
(to Doyle) Harry
Oh Harry,  knew you'd come
love you, Harry
love
Take me home, Harry
We'll get you home, Frances
Thank you, Harry
She's untied
The Orderly helps her up onto a gurney
She lies down
Doyle nods to the Orderly, who starts pushing her
She is wheeled out and down: Past other patients, doctors, etc
We see some of this from her point of view
She goes through two swinging doors, down another hall
at the end of which a man opens a door
She is pushed onto a: She is wheeled into a row
between two other patients
In the background we  a voice: (
) One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain
The lights are bright, on her and the other patients
We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching
(
) Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation,  am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour
Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling
It's moving round and round
The voice drones on
(
) The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever
We now see vaguely that
has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney
We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale
The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation
In the same time, working alone,  can treat fifty
Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket
This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli
It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment
The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted
In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas
Along with the cure comes a loss of affect
a kind of emotional flattening
Frances turns away and stares at the fan again
There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring
with diminished creativity and imagination
Patients become like good solid cake with no icing
But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed
We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn
These patients will soon be leaving the hospital
Harlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view
Lobotomy gets 'em home
He moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan
As the leucotome descends, we: : - Total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles
This house is easing slowly back to nature
-   - Neglect is just as evident inside
Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains
Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window
She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability
The scrapbook is open on her lap
What was  saying
Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances
Ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace crouch on the floor, totally bored
Yesterday's headlines are now old news
They capture the mind by first seducing the heart
suppose  never taught Frances to close her heart
Two Reporters rise and edge toward the door
Uh
excuse us, Mrs
Farmer
We're going to have to
uh
(rising) Yeah,  better pack it in too
(distractedly) Pardon
Oh, would you like more lemonade
The last Reporter gets to his feet
(kindly) think we've had enough
Thank you, Mrs
Farmer
Goodbye
He follows the others out
Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out
Ernest stares into the fire
You know, Ernie,  think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home
That'll brighten her day
Ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad
He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home
:    against a dark background The show is "This Is Your Life"
We  a smiling , reading from a large black book
Next to him stands Frances
She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman
She seems uncomfortable
Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn
Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life
These are sad, desperate times for you
Throughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt
until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution
Were you mentally ill, Frances
No, Ralph
don't believe  ever was sick
But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one
We   from the screen to see that the  set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home
On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York
He still looks athletic, young for his age
Tears stream down his cheeks
(
) Were you an alcoholic
(
) No
(
) Were you a drug addict
(
) No
Never
Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her
We've never seen any of them before
and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight
so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail
(indicating seating area) And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you
The curtains behind them open to reveal a car in a spotlight
brand new 1958 Edsel
The audience applauds
Frances smiles guardedly
Thank you, Ralph
Thank you, Frances
And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel
Applause
So, Frances Farmer, this is your life
Good night
God bless you
The audience applauds
Frances smiles wearily and accepts congratulations
-  - group of  are coming down the front steps, Frances among them
They all talk happily, Frances is silent but smiling
Where shall we drop you, Frances
Home
(vaguely) No
no, someone's picking me up
The people all excuse themselves, calling goodbye
Frances waits by herself for a few moments, but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk
(
) Hey
She turns
Harry is leaning against the side of a building, looking much as he did when they first met
But there is very little light of recognition in Frances' eyes
'mere
want to talk to you
(flatly) Oh
Why, Harry York
How nice to see you
Harry is a little puzzled by her reaction
How
how ya doin', Farmer
Fine, thank you
Did you watch the show
Sure  did, that's why 'm here
(concerned) How did  look
Oh, you
(smiling) ennh
(a glimmer, but she does not pick up on the cue) Well
you're looking well
They are both silent a long moment
got a new car
Only it's red
Did you know Mama died
Yeah
Yeah,  heard about that
Dad, too
sold the house
'm a faceless sinner, Harry
Why do you say that
'd ask you to take me home, but 'm a faceless sinner
(she smiles) You smell good, Harry
Familiar, you know
'd ask you to take me home, but
Harry is alarmed now
(taking her by the arm) Frances
She angrily bares her teeth; then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid
Don't get mad at me, Harry
Please
It's just
Some things happen for the best
Beat
She takes his hand as if to shake it
Harry clasps hers tenderly
She holds on like an old woman, stroking his hand
For an instant she gets lost in time, just holding his hand
Then she looks up
It's going to be slow from now on
Do you know what  mean, Harry
'm not sure
Very slow
(uncertainly) But we're not going to stop, are we
No
(reassured) No, we're not
It is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will
but the words bear no emotional power
Goodbye, Harry
It was very good to see you again
Yes
Would you like me to walk a little way with you
That would be okay
Just a little way
He offers his arm
She takes it
All rather formal
They stroll on together
