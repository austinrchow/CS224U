Suspect Zero Written by Zak Penn Revisions - Billy Ray Director's Shooting Script November 30, 2001 : on a   - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us
The wave is relentless, huge, menacing
We can't tell if this is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything - noisily
It sucks, it yawns, it roars
Then we realize
this massive wave of darkness is actually just a - of dirty black  alongside the edge of an Interstate
We     now
to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds
1
-    - 4:30
1 Amongst the refuse is a discarded  , resting on its back
The carton asks "Have You Seen Me
" above a photographed face that's been obscured by grime
Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers
in that bed of untended weeds
hollow Texas wind blows through it all
We stay with the carton
Then that hollow wind gains speed
and a deep  grows in the distance, becoming a
The yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us
as an 18-   blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness
Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates
The milk carton, the coke cans
they lie undisturbed
begins to fall
and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton, revealing a face
child
"Have You Seen Me
" It's heartbreaking
to take in the vast flatness of Texas' -35: concrete forever
In the distance, gray highway yields to black  gathering silently over endless prairie
vertical vein of  streaks through one of them
: a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee

) sits: mid 40's, pleasant face
family man
Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine
Has a '  by his side
Around him is a - in twilight: Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud
" mirror
The   can be heard on a
(
) Top that off for ya, Hon
That's , a waitress, (50, been here too long
) Speck looks up, smiles thinly, "No
" Dolly heads off
Speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage
until a  seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite Speck's
Speck reacts, startled
Jesus
The 's name is '
We only see  of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka
' What's in the case
'm sorry
' You're always lugging that case around
'm curious
Speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here
So why is this guy bothering me
' (') What do you sell
'm
in restaurant supplies
didn't get your name
' Must travel a lot, huh
Speck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone
' (') Whole country, or just hereabouts
3
don't mean to be rude but-- ' How's your wife feel about it
That spun things a bit
Speck pauses
What
' She must get lonely, with you gone all the time
Does she
Look,
' Do you get lonely
Speck's so thrown now he can't answer
' (') Ya miss fucking her, Harold
Listen,  don't know who you are but you can't-- 'Ryan silences him
by holding up a piece of paper
On it is a
The image faces away from us
But Speck can see it in rich detail
And his eyes go wide
We catch : The color of flesh
body-part
Looks like a rendering of a young, naked
And, just like that, Speck finds himself
Glued
' (') Did it myself
It's sort of a hobby
(no reply) 've got more
Would you like to see them
'Ryan lowers it and slides a   over
Speck is speechless, transfixed
Can't look away
' (') Tell me: those jokes about the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter - are they true
() 4
' (') (Speck remains silent) Here
This one's my favorite
'Ryan slides over  #3
Again, we don't get to see it
And we still haven't seen all of 'Ryan's face
But we can see Speck, and his reaction
Utter horror
In fact he recoils so violently that his coffee spills
' (') Really says it all, wouldn't you agree
You're a
You're sick
' That's a matter of opinion
You're sick
He rises, leaving the drawings behind
We    as he crosses the diner - deeply unsettled
He reaches the Manager, (, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register
Mmm-hmm
'm having a problem - with another customer
'd like you to ask him to leave, please
What kind of problem
He's-- He turns, to point out 'Ryan
but the booth, suddenly, is empty
The guy has simply disappeared, taking those drawings with him
Speck tightens
Mel eyes him, annoyed
: 5

-  -   -               3 Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder repeatedly
Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys
They fall to the asphalt
He grabs them, opens the door
: 4
'  -  -                          4 Speck guns the Buick
Interstate 35 flies by
The farther he gets away from that Diner, the happier he'll be
until a strange  gets his attention: it's , as if whistling through a ghost town
Hollow, varied - building then falling off again
Wind
Trouble is, the windows in this Buick are up
Yet there it is again: a thin, hollow - , whistling over his shoulder
He's heard it before - in every Western he ever watched as a kid
But this wind is coming from his back-seat
The blood drains right out of Speck's face
Doesn't know if he should jam on the brakes or drive faster
He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a snapping onto a hand
Dear God: 'Ryan is back there, making that odd Ghost-Town wind sound
Whistling
(sheer terror) What-do-you-want
What-do-you-want-with- me
No reply
Instead, another gift appears from the back: a , tossed from the darkness into Speck's lap
He looks down, registers the image
and
' (
) There's a rest stop, next off-ramp
Pull into it
have some money
It's not a lot but-- ' Nobody wants your money, Harold
Just pull in
6
Why
'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu
' Because  don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour
It could be dangerous
Speck finds the off-ramp
His breaths are shallow now
Please, Mister - what do you want from me
'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it
: the face of   , on a bulletin board

-   -  (       5 ) We're looking at the
's "Ten Most-Wanted List
" Starkey is #7 on it
He's 40, white
His crime are listed as rape, murder, kidnapping
stares at Starkey's image
At the eyes
Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact, a whiz at everything he's ever attempted
So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas
, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices
Quiet phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig
(
) Got a spot set up for you, Tom
That's  : late 40's, thinning hair, friendly
Charlton heads around a corner
Mackelway follows
(') Ms
Potter's the nice girl you met at the desk
She puts a package together for all the new agents, things to know about the area, help with finding apartments and such
This one's yours: Charlton stops at a : Carpeted walls, formica desk corner of dull Hell
Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread
7
(') Not so different from Dallas, is it
(fuck yes) No, Sir
Good
An abandoned   tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October
Charlton heads out
Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: framed picture of himself and his , ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip
Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs
He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of into the back of it
but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as: (
) Ya like Frito Pies
Mackelway turns
stands here, holding a white grease-stained paper-bag
Grieves is Mackelway's age, not quite as ambitious
But solid, decent
dunno
What are they
Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a semi-burrito
Pure Texas
Tosses it to Mackelway: Welcome to the minors
Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a few other agents
Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie
God, get me outta here
: 6
-                           6 : Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as take calls, strap on guns, head out on assignment
Men in motion
8
But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report
It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word "beige" and replacing it with "tan
" His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him
But after lingering for a half-second on that "Most-Wanted List" again
Starkey
It's a wound
7
-  -                    7 Mackelway struggles with a   that's unfamiliar to him
Filter, water, grounds, etc
(
) Here
Lemme do that
He turns
This is
She's 25, friendly, under- challenged by her job
Been here two years
In two seconds she's got the thing percolating
Of course
(') It takes some experience
He shrugs, not feeling too smooth
(') You're Mackelway, right
Mmm-hmm
Fax came in for you
It's the room next door
Oh
Thanks
He rises, heads for the "fax room"
8
" " -                                       8 former closet, converted into useful space sit on stands, sharing a surge protector
One fax machine is printing
Mackelway approaches it
Six pieces of paper await him
The first is a -, written by hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, Resident Agency - Wichita Falls
" No sender named
He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax

young  stares back at him, his face photostatically copied
Across the top, also-handwritten: "
" At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read: "Jason Corey, Age 14
Ht
5'1", Wt
130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn
Last Seen: Riverside, Ca
Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99
" Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals
No idea why this was sent to him
Then he looks at Page Two
young  stares back at him this time
Another faxed photo
Another "
" scrawled across the top of it
And, at the bottom of the sheet: "Anna Casitas, Age 22
Ht
5'6", Wt
125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk
Last Seen: Macon, Ga
Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00
" The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and vitals
Faces
Facts
"
" He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax number of the sender
Dials it
All he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line
He eyes the faxes again
It's not alarming, but it's odd
Then Charlton emerges from his office, shouting: Mackelway
You gonna sit on your ass all day, or do you wanna do something
Mackelway's out of this room in an instant
: 9
-    -                          9 Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near
Those we saw earlier are  now
and    fill this site
Charlton's   pulls up
He and Mackelway get out
Two men approach:   , 50; and his deputy, , a gangly, baby-faced pup
Afternoon, Rick
(Charlton nods) Looks like a robbery/homicide
Body's over that way
10
He gestures toward a ravine, where a   is currently lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle
It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice
Ya run the plates
Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot
" Mackelway nods, reminding himself to remember his new rank
Dylan hands a preliminary report to Charlton
Fella's name is Harold Speck
Traveling salesman, from Abilene
Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway
The hierarchy is being made clear
Very
Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a  that reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving Oklahoma" on the other
vehicle, left right on the state-line
Odd
Then, a : that Tow-Truck , grinding badly
It's just about to yank the Buick out of this ditch
(it blurts out) Hey
Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the -
10
-                                  10 The Driver, , is operating the winch from a hydraulic handle on the back of the truck
Mackelway barrels in: (') What the fuck're you doing
What's it look like, Bud
Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the "Stop" button himself
The winch shuts down
Mackelway turns
handful of stand atop this ravine, watching
11
(') You guys ever heard of evidentiary procedure
No one replies
Charlton approaches
Mackelway tightens, expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds
(') Sorry, Sir
There wasn't time
Charlton eyes the car
Then Mackelway
Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway
Let's have a look
Charlton starts down the embankment
Mackelway doesn't, hanging back as he eyes the  this Buick made before tumbling
Something about them
He pulls a small  from his pocket, a Minox
Snaps off a few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks, some  alongside them
Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment
11
-                                           11 It's an ugly sight
Speck is inches from us, but his head is facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally
Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some gloves, puts them on
He will not lean on the car, or even breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious
(
) What's that
Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window, pointing at the  that 'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's lap
It lies face down on the seat
But something's been - on the back of it: , with a  through it
Charlton begins to reach for it, when: (to stop him) Sir
Charlton stops
Mackelway indicates: "Gloves
" 12
Charlton eyes him
It's irritating being corrected by a guy you outrank, especially when he's right
(') Sort of a
stickler for procedure
imagine you would be
That was a jab, but we don't know it yet
Charlton puts on his gloves
Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox, looking over the rest of this car, as: (aloud) Hey Jumbo
Toss me down a crowbar
Granger's by the trunk
Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo has tossed a  down from the top of the embankment: a ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us
Everybody ducks
as it  on the roof of the Buick
Jumbo shrugs
You said toss it
Mackelway shakes his head
"Shitkicker
" Granger grabs the crowbar
He's just about to open the trunk as: Hold it a second
Granger pauses
Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off a few shots with the Minox
Something catches his eye, along the line of the
He kneels closer
An odd , crusty and hard, has formed a thin line on top of the paint in a single post
He takes out a , and scrapes some of the residue into it
Then he sniffs it
Pauses
(') Smells like
clove
He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk
(re: Mackelway) Where the hell'd you find this guy
13
Field Office
Dallas
(impressed) Well now
(Charlton shrugs) So what the hell's he doin' here
That one is left unanswered
Granger opens the trunk
Mackelway and the others look inside
There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt- shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel
And a fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet
Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's nothing significant here
So he returns to Speck's body
He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the steering wheel
Gently
which is when we learn that Speck's  have been torn off
It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly
Charlton leans in, gets a look
Christ
Mackelway is expressionless
But something about these draws him closer
He leans in, then
We are rocketed into a series of dark, disjointed images: 12
-                                         12 Seems like we're standing in a field of  ; we can't say for sure
Everything's wet, wind-whipped
Someone just fired a gun
We slump hard to the ground
Then we look up
Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain
Then, just as quickly, those   and we are: 13
-   -                  13 We start on the   '
Cross-Dissolve to a pad of paper, on a
Scrawled on the pad is a
He holds the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if expecting to get some kind of pulse from it
Here come those  again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash, Mackelway
Choppy, disjointed, dark
Then they cease
14
and 'Ryan begins to , hurriedly
Only half of his face is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is total
His pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as the  of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain, the wind
They're all alive in 'Ryan's mind
And that  takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the gun, Mackelway
Then, the pen is set down
The drawing is complete
'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the exact time and date on to the drawing
Then he slips it into a folder marked, "
" : 14
'  - ,  -
14 Picket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing
file in, each bringing food
and tissues to cry into
15
'  -   -   ()             15 Shocked faces
Food on unmatching trays
Speck's wife - , 40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile
and mill about, tending to her
hover
Two of them, a 4--  and an 8-- , sniff back tears as people offer condolences
But the focus here is Jan - her grief
She's shaking
' (
) Mrs
Speck
She looks up
'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty faces in here
Jan half-nods
' (') Just wanted to offer my condolences
(takes her hand) didn't know him well but
think Harold was a much more complex man than people realized
Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now
15
(through tears) He was, wasn't he
' 'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am
She sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile
'Ryan extends his hand to her
She takes it
He moves off
Beside her is a   of Speck
We blow past it, and into the   that is adorning the corner of the portrait's , and: We're rocketed back into a set of odd  again: 16
-                                    16 This time, everything before us is a blur of gray
We hear that wet wind
We hear our own heavy , as if we were running somewhere
a , rising above the wind, seems to be saying: (
) Please
The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite somewhere, or a distance of time and space
Then the sound and the soupy grayness
This vision just ended
When we pop back out of it, we're  on Mackelway
: 17
'  -   -  10:30
17 Mackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked between two big-rigs in the lot of the "All-American Diner
" Sky looks black tonight
It rumbles
And that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw
It was all his
He pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket
Slugs them down
This headache is a constant
Then he gets out of the Yukon
18
-   -                    18 Mackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite a , her back to us
16
19
-                                          19 Mackelway approaches
The Woman doesn't turn
Agent Mackelway
was 'bout to introduce you, but  understand that won't be necessary
Mackelway doesn't get it
until the  turns
She is 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to be
But with a guard that never comes down
Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react
It takes some effort
(') Seems your former office has decided we might need some help on this one
So they sent out Agent Kulok
Tom
Fran
That was terse, from both of them
Charlton takes note
guess we're skipping the tearful reunion
Have a seat, Tom
Mackelway sits opposite Fran
She folds her hands
How's things back at the ranch
Movin' right along
That might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell
Okay
Whadda we know
Picked up a foot-print in the back seat of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger than Speck's
Just like that, Fran is piping up
Mackelway's unoffended
17
'Kay
Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he was strangled from behind
think our guy waited for him in the backseat, sprung this on him once the car was moving
She slides that   to Charlton - giving us our first look at it
-  : a -, lined with plastic
Inside it are large Inside the bags are
It's realized so accurately that it looks more like a photograph
No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply
- Charlton eyes it without reaction
(') Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges of the paper, consistent with powdered gloves
(Charlton nods) So he gets the dropped in his lap, it spooks him, and the car winds up in the ravine
Plausible enough, until: don't think so, no
think it was pushed
How ya figure
The look of the tracks
Foot-prints near the embankment
Without embellishing any further, he slides over the that he took this morning with the Minox: tire- tracks, foot-prints
She eyes them
Then she eyes Mackelway
Charlton notes the tension
18
Okay
So our guy likes to draw pictures of body parts and then spring 'em on people
What's that get us
(they're silent) That's what  thought
There is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran
Charlton has no time for it
Oh
'Fore  forget
This came in for you: He tosses a 9-by-12  at Mackelway, who opens it
Six sheets of paper slide out
First one we see is the   of a : same hand-written inscription as the last one: "Attention, Agent Thomas Mackelway,  Resident Agency, Wichita Falls
" Okay
This is twice now
He knows what will be under this top sheet without even looking
But here's Page One: photo of a middle-aged African-American
Across the top of the photo, in hand-writing: "
" And typed on the bottom: "Tanya Green
Age 42
Ht
5'9", Wt
165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk
Last Seen: Ames, Iowa
Date of Disappearance: 3-22-97
" The following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women, young, old
Four more    's
But before he can think it through, he hears: (
) It's about time
They turn
That came from the  : a humorless guy named
He's looking at the front door, through which Dolly has just entered
Pink cowboy boots tonight
Don't start in on me, Les
couldn't get the pickup started and Harlan took the Dodge
The Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the booth
Dolly stops short, taken aback
19
(') Holy Hell
My one shot at winding up on "Cops" and 'm in my weekday boots
: 20
-  -                                        20 Dolly and Mel sit opposite Mackelway and Fran
He was a quiet guy
Normal
Liked to read fishing magazines
Not much of a tipper
Is that a lousy thing to say
It's fine
Mel rolls his eyes
What can you tell us about the other man
Like  said,  never really saw him
Harold came up, complainin' about the guy - but time  turned, he was gone
(at Dolly:)               (at Dolly:) Could you de--            Did you get a-- They each stop short, waiting for the other to yield
Finally Mackelway nods, "Go ahead
" Can you describe him, Ma'am
Sure
He was
Dolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit
Troubled
(') That's weird
Guy was in here better part of an hour
We had a real pleasant chat
But  can't remember a thing about him
For the life of me
Couldn't even tell you what color his eyes were
She shrugs apologetically
20
Happen to see what he was driving
That one's easy
It's still in the lot
(they perk up) The Bonneville out there with the awful paint job
She gestures to the lot, where an old   sits, its paint stripped down to the primer
Bingo
Fran and Mackelway eye it, then one another
: 21
-   -                            21 Fran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville
We ought to work out some kind of protocol
For what
Interviews
Witnesses
Looks pretty silly, our talking over one another
Fine
'll handle them from now on
He doesn't argue
They come to a stop at that Bonneville, stripped down to its primer
Time to work
Two agents, all instinct
We see them study things, details, their minds always churning
Mackelway pulls out his Minox, snaps off a few more shots
Then: Trunk's ajar
She turns
Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar
Mackelway approaches, cautiously
He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to protect against prints
He opens the trunk
First thing he sees is that  again: a circle-with-a- slash-through-it
staring right at him
21
But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back
Mackelway stares
So does Fran
Before them lies a body, stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged
Dead
Mackelway sighs
Things just got tougher
: 22
-                                    22 Harold Speck lies on a table
examines him
Victim #2,  , lies on another, his ample frame yet to be examined
The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a  , with a  pinned to his gown
He speaks into it with a quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc
Mackelway and Fran are here
watching
Mackelway is particularly focused on Fulcher's face
His , we now see, have also been torn off
Hmmmm
Why eyelids
Huh
No other signs of torture here
Why take somebody's eyelids off
So they can't blink
She sighs, aloud: " know that already, Asshole
" Coroner keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone
(') It's a metaphor - to make certain the victim sees
or to make certain that we see something
(she's silent) Or maybe it's just a fuck-you
Coroner continues his monotone narration
then crosses to the sink
That puts him out of earshot
So: 22
(') (to Fran, quietly) 'm sorry about Don
(thrown) Huh
You're not wearing your ring anymore
That was an attempt at kindness
She knows that
Still, she eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's
Then there's a
They turn
Charlton stands on the other side of a , in a   adjacent to this Morgue
He presses a piece of paper up against the glass
On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: " " Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash- through-it
This is a , which Charlton's just received
He points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map
The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission
Those scrawled lines take us to "The Hope House," in Oklahoma City
At the bottom a scribbled name, "David Dyson," and a contact number
Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods
He just got a break

Rain falls
The street is still
Mackelway approaches this halfway-house
few lights shine within, and the blue glow of a tv
Upstairs can be heard the strident, off-key voice of somebody singing
25
/
-  -                        25 The front door is open
Through a  , Mackelway can see an old-fashioned "foyer
" He knocks
Waits
Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "La Vida Loca" audible through an open bedroom window
But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open anyway
So Mackelway enters
Hello
26
-  -                               26 room is to his left
There, a single 35 year-old / (we'll call him "") sits, watching "Behind the Music" on VH1
Tonight's subject
Leif Garret
Piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge Mackelway at all
Rather he     to drown out the singing upstairs, which seems to be intentionally off-key
Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window
Posters and fliers on the walls
10  upstairs
(
) Agent Mackelway
Mackelway turns
Descending a creaking stairway is : 50, lean, with a friendly smile
: 24
27
-  -                        27 We are staring at a   that has been covered, floor to ceiling, with 1,000 identical renderings of that same symbol: the -----
1,000 of them, in bright red paint, against pitch black enamel
Only a machine could have achieved this kind of repetition
Or a maniac
This basement is leaky, drafty, poorly lit
But it's also quiet: the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been by the basement door and the rain itself
Benjamin spent hours down here
Mackelway takes it all in, every corner of this basement
He notes a row of standing
(re: lockers) Did he have access to those
No
They're staff-only
Would you mind opening them for me
Dyson shrugs; he thinks it's a waste of time - but he'll do it
Mackelway follows him across the dank room
(') He was here
seven years you said
Off and on
It's not uncommon for our guests to vanish for months at a time
Dyson works a combination lock on the first locker
ran the name through our database, just to be sure
There's never been an Agent Benjamin 'Ryan in the Bureau
No
but as elaborate fantasies go, it was one of my favorites
(fondly) And he always seemed so sincere about it
25
Dyson half-chuckles; he always liked the guy
He throws open the locker
Inside, nothing
Mackelway indicates the next locker
Dyson works the combination
Is that what you called him
Benjamin
It's what he wished to be called
Locker #2 is opened - also empty
Only one locker left
(') (re: locker #3) That one's mine
Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, it has to be opened
" Dyson sighs, then works the combination
Mackelway waits
Locker #3 is opened
Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater, some old junk, two trophies
Dyson eyes him: "See
" Mackelway nods
Dyson shuts the locker
Mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with- a-slash-through-it
No idea what they signify
(') He painted one of the walls in his room, too
Can  see it
We've painted it over
Still, might be helpful
Dyson heads for the stairs
They're wooden slats with more basement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture
Mackelway follows
They climb
(') Wait
They stop
Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible beneath these stairs: a , with a bucket of  sticking out of it
26
28
-    -                   28 Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing aside all of the aforementioned junk
He grabs the box
Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color 'Ryan used to cover that wall
There's also a bucket of here
And some used brushes
Mackelway brings the box into the meager light
We get a look now
So does Dyson
Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few  , a yo-yo, a football
Then a  on
Mackelway grabs it, eyes it
He flips through a few pages - odd images: a  with eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc
Mackelway sets the book down
Then, amidst the other materials in this box, he spots a large folded
He grabs it, begins to unfold it
We see that this map's been written on, in pen
Cities on it have been
But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: photograph of himself
It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at
But there it is, a  , of Agent Thomas Mackelway
It is part of a - , dated July of this year, concerning the trial and release
of Virgil Ray Starkey
#7 on the
's Most-Wanted List
Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway
Mackelway stares
Suddenly we    ,  , for a brief, choppy
29 29
-  -  - ' We're , dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet
This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town
Squalor and sin
We find a
He nods: "This is the place," and sticks out his palm
27
30
-  -                           30 Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist, murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning failure for all involved
as we  '  - Matamoros again
31
"" -  -                     31 Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a , and a - taking place on a bare stage
Feels like we've stepped into some kind of evil carnival
It's dizzying
Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing
Suddenly our  is pointed right at his head
Starkey freezes, caught
Some of the  around him find somewhere else to stand
But the show goes on
32
-  -                           32 That  gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's case was thrown out of court
It is this: The
Agent on the case had made a mistake in "evidentiary procedure
" Hence, Mackelway's picture
On his face, we     : six months ago
33
-  -  -             33 Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros
Now Mackelway sits in this courthouse , adjacent to a courtroom
Four sour  surround him
#1 'you understand how fucked we are
Yes, Sir
#1 Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a Mexican lab
Are you fucking kidding me
They assured me that they understood protocol
28
#1 Well guess what
They didn't
And this prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not
That registered
34
-  -                              34 Beneath this newspaper article are  , all concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it
Mackelway's memory just got stoked again: 35
-  -                      35 Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped
The hall's busy with  and other traffic
First face he sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring )
Her eyes say how lousy she feels for him
It almost helps
36
-                     36 The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in
No need to look composed now; he's alone in here
He crosses to a paper-towel dispenser,
Stares in the mirror
He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his own reflection
Then he hears , behind him
He turns
Out of the darkness of a badly-lit , Virgil Starkey emerges, coming into view under a single light
Beside him is a  , his chaperone
Starkey passes by Mackelway, almost snickering
Then he's gone
Mackelway shuts his eyes tight
His head is pounding
37
-  -                              37 Mackelway stares
at a record of his deepest wound
But what the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient
: 38
- "'' " -                   38 Mackelway leans in, looking around
bed
small end-table
Bathroom
window without bars
29
From down the hall we hear the sound of a  , then a  transmission
An old fax machine begins to whine noisily, creaking
It's a distraction
But Mackelway's focus is in this room
The walls have been newly painted
But there's a hint of barely-perceptible color beneath one of them
Rain from a   is causing some of the new paint to peel a bit
collects drops in the center of the room
The feeling in here is damp, mildewy, creepy
Mackelway remains in the doorway
then backs out
(
) guess you fellas're never unaccounted for, huh
39
-                                        39 Mackelway turns, a bit startled
Dyson is approaching,  in hand
Huh
Dyson extends six pages
On the -, written by hand, are the words: "Agent Thomas Mackelway, / Mr
David Dyson, Hope House" with a street address
And under that top sheet
Five more pages
Mackelway sighs, takes them from Dyson
Sure enough, he's staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets
Five more 's
But how would anyone know to send them here
Anything urgent
(doesn't look up) No
Dyson is glad to hear it
: 40
-  -                           40 Mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place
Piper is where we left him, watching VH1 in the  Room
30
Mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more '
He reaches the door
Ever seen a fifty-foot shark
Mackelway stops, turns
'm sorry
Fifty-foot shark
Ever seen one
No
Doesn't mean there aren't any
Great
Mackelway reaches for the front door again
Then he halts
Maybe this guy can be helpful
Mackelway turns: Did you know him
(Piper's silent) The guy who used to stay upstairs
"'Ryan
" Did you know him
Why
Is he dead
don't
You said "Did
" Is he dead
Oh
mis-spoke
No, he's not dead
(a beat) You know him
Piper nods
Mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that image: the circle-with-slash-through-it
(') He ever talk about this
circle with a slash through it
31
Piper rises, crosses to us
leaning in unnecessarily close
It's unsettling
That's not a circle
It's a zero
Oh
How do you know
Piper doesn't answer
Instead he simply starts whistling
But it's not a tune coming out of his mouth
It's that same sound that 'Ryan made:   , blowing through a ghost town
Building, then falling again
Piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it, stifling a giggle
Then, suddenly, everything turns ,
We've jumped into a distorted,   of this same scene - as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or a distance of time and space
We see images, fragments: Piper, the tv, the sofa, Mackelway's face
Then all sound breaks up, and we are
41
- ,  -                   41 Start on 'Ryan's
Then a pad of paper
The spasm of a pen, scrawling a  on to it: "Piper
Whistling
" We're in another non-descript
$29 a night
He holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that list of words, keeping it there for a few seconds, as if expecting to receive some kind of pulse from it
No more pulse
He has lost the "connection" that had somehow transported him
He notes his watch
Jots down the exact time
Slips the pad into that : "Mackelway
" Then he starts to  - a hurried but accurate sketch of Mackelway and Piper, just as they stood during that conversation
The geography is fairly accurate
'Ryan continues to draw

It's fun being 19 and beautiful

Little cute for my taste, but  can stand three minutes of it

Seven and seven
Got some i

She half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re- fastening that chip-clip
It's her best move
It's in the car
No one's asked me for it for a couple years now
If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end of the song
She eyes him: are you really carding me
He smiles: nothing personal, Sugar
So she heads for the door
on her way, she passes a booth
In it we find a familiar face - Virgil Ray Starkey
He remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her
But behind his eyes, something primal just took place
He rises, heads for the door

-                                            45 Loretta walks to her  Bug

She doesn't notice
We  : the lights are off in 'Ryan's motel room
46
'  -                               46 It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground beside the open  door
battered - speeds away, kicking up gravel
: Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread
47
' - -                              47 We're off-road
Missouri's woods can be seen through the windshield
And Starkey is staring at us
Pawing at us
Please, Mister
Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the window, hard
That makes things start to swim
Starkey tears at her clothes, lowers himself on to her
She whimpers
: 48
'  -                                  48 This is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen table, scuffed blinds
and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night
Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear Loretta's helpless cries
Some nights are like this
His head is  again
Down go four more Bufferin
Above him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the  he took from that Hope House basement
'Ryan's map,
It's : 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror
As we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been written on, in pen
'Ryan's notations cover it: Over a   on it have been , by hand, in Each of those circled cities has a  written beside it, also in red: ("4/6," "5/19," "10-26," etc
) 34
Mackelway studies it, his face working
Another of those from Loretta seems to hang, suspended
Mackelway shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it
He won't sleep a wink tonight
We  , returning to: 49
' - -                                  49 The attack continues, its terror unimaginable
Loretta sobs
It hurts
Starkey's too powerful to fight off
We stay on her face: dazed, her mind simply checking out
until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a that just passed by
Then the window behind Starkey simply
Glass flies everywhere, and   reach into the pick-up
They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up, his back sliced open by shards
He screams
She can't resist coming to the window, where she sees: 50
- ' - -                        50 Starkey lies, face up
Shocked
Squirming
Bleeding
Standing over him, looming large as a Grizzly
is 'Ryan
long extends from his hand
But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational: ' Hey, listen, 'm sorta new in town
Ya know where  can find a good donkey show
Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac: Huh
' Oh
Forgot
Wrong country
In America animals have rights
(pointedly) Don't they, Virgil
How the fuck should  know
'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head
Loretta's eyes go wide
Another kick follows, to the ribs
Then one to the groin
Then: 35
' (at Loretta) Turn around
He said that without looking at her
But he can tell that she hasn't moved - too frightened
So he eyes her
' (') (again) Turn around
She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her head
No idea what kind of terror is to come next
We able only to hear what follows: The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a horrible , covering the  coming from 'Ryan
In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from Starkey
Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock
She keeps her face buried, shutting her eyes tight
The sounds of savagery fill the night
Then, one last gasp from Starkey
followed by an awful silence
and the assault is over
Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with the knife will be coming after her next
But then she hears , trailing away
So she rises, peeking over the edge of the window
, as she sees what's become of her attacker
Her horrified  fills the woods
51
'  -  -                    51 Mackelway  out the window; seems like he just  that scream
Of course, that'd be impossible
He looks to that map

Narrower
No, they were

Composite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look anything like the face of 'Ryan
Charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing
Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up
Mackelway steps out of it
We follow him as he takes in the scene

But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face yet
Sir

d
yet
Mmm-hmm
(Mackelway waits) Might wanna find yourself a fender
You're gonna need to sit down
(Mackelway's still waiting) It's Virgil Ray Starkey
Mackelway pales
We stay on him for a moment as it registers
The man he caught, and then lost, has killed again
No
God, no
(struggling for composure:) Starkey did this
No
Starkey's the one on the ground
Mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong
But he turns toward the face, as   illuminates it, searing the image into the darkness
Starkey
Dead
His eyelids ripped away
Mackelway stares, stunned
Can't fucking believe it
(breathless) My God
37
It's like looking at a ghost - a spectre that's been haunting him, dead now
Mackelway pulls out his Minox, starts photographing, moving in on those
Gonna make a wallet-size of that one
Give him a break, Grieves
Mackelway doesn't comment
Just keeps snapping shots
: 53
- '  -                     53 The number of    's has now grown, quite a bit
45  sit stacked on Mackelway's desk
45 victims
He grabs the stack, rises
Heading for the Conference Room, he nearly bumps into Katie, the Receptionist, rounding a corner
'Scuse me
She smiles
He carries the    's into: 54
-   -                      54 room has been dedicated solely to those three murders
On an erasure board are the words: The "'Ryan" Room
On one wall is the  Mackelway took from Hope House: over a thousand  circled by 'Ryan himself
Mackelway puts down the stack of    's
Picks up a box of  -, affixing them to the map - one for every faxed face
Here's "Jason Corey, Age 14
" Last seen in "Riverside, Ca
" on "10-16-99
" Sure enough, 'Ryan had circled "Riverside, Ca
" on this map
Next to it he'd written "10-16
" Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside
Next, the fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22
" Last Seen
"Macon, Ga
" on "5-6-00
" Of course, 'Ryan had circled "Macon" too
Beside it he'd written "5-6
" So Macon gets a yellow pin
38
Mackelway continues, as: (
) Got nothing on the last fax
Mackelway turns
In comes Fran
(') Came from a business center at a Mariott in Dallas
Nobody saw who sent it
Mackelway nods
Then they both turn
Charlton enters the room
Whadda we know about the map
It matches the faxes, Sir
Almost perfectly
Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red
Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every (45 of them so far
) Charlton eyes the stack
45    's
Then the map: 1,242 cities
Each with a  beside it
Why's Greenville in blue
(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities
but tiny Greenville, Texas has a   beside it
) Only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didn't correspond
He pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named "Steven Kim
Age 16
Last Seen: Greenville, Tx
Date of Disappearance: 8-7-98
" (') Fax lists the date of disappearance as August 7
On the map he's written "10- 26
" The  on 'Ryan's map reads "10-26" beside Greenville, Tx
So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map
Charlton notes today's date: October 17
39
Any of these bodies been recovered
Two so far
Female, disappeared from Dayton, Ohio on April 12
And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th
On the , Dayton's got "4/12" written beside it
Trenton has "1/5
" Both have yellow pins in them
(') But both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where they'd last been seen
One in Montana, the other in Oregon
Got autopsy reports on both
Charlton looks to the table, where   and sit - two victims we've never seen before
We see the  photographed face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below
Charlton gives the photos a cursory glance, nothing more
But we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from Trenton - an odd   on his lower left calf
Looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf
Either of the bodies have the zero on them
No, Sir
Charlton, frustrated,
We look to that , a handful of yellow pins in it
: that same map, over a    in it now
55
- "' " -                           55 It's 8:30 at night
Mackelway is alone in here - staring at the map
He's been doing a lot of that lately
The stack of    's has grown as well
Every one of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map
40
(Some of the    's have arrived via
We see a stack of  in a box, each sealed in , each stamped and addressed to Mackelway
) Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling
Fran's right beside him
Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he took himself with that Minox
Why you
Huh
He could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country
But he's sending them to you
Why
Mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately
don't know
She grabs it
( ) This is Agent Kulok
(a beat) Who's calling
She hears the answer, then covers the phone
(') (to Mackelway:) Do you know a professor named Daitz
Says he's from Tulane
(eagerly) Yeah

Turns a corner
Air can be heard, moving through the corridor
But he has found the right number, at last
tiny  fastened to a wall reads, "Dr
Emile Daitz, Professor Emeritus, Criminal Psychology
" It also lists his office hours
Mackelway knocks at a door

Books, papers, and all of it jammed to overflowing
Mackelway sits across from 'Ryan
' (as "Daitz:") The name of this theory was "Suspect Zero
" (Mackelway nods) The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a serial killer were diabolical enough, he could traverse the country without ever being caught, killing randomly
42
There's a  here in a glass case:   - crude knives, swords, blow-darts
Mackelway notes them
' (') Tell me, what makes a killer catchable
Patterns, repetition of behavior
' Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden desire to be caught
perfect vessel of evil, killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake
He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he
Your task forces, your forensics teams - they'd be helpless
Mackelway looks over Daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume about evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of serial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites
Is that something you believe in, Professor
Evil
' As a citizen of the world, it's hard not to
Wouldn't you say
(Mackelway can't argue) Evil is all around us,  think - a part of the natural order of things
Like gravity
Like wind
vast black wave, corrupting everything it touches
virus invades a cell, causing it to dysfunction
Perfectly logical
But did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully
Mackelway pauses, considering that
' (') Just because something's invisible to us doesn't mean it doesn't exist
Mackelway is silent: Something's off here
But he can't say for sure just yet what it is
' (') Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark
43
That wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it was a red flag
big one
Mackelway tightens
'm sorry
' shark, as we know, will only attack humans if he runs out of food
But biologists have theorized that for a shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet
He'd never run out of food, so he'd have no need to come to the surface
Consequently, we would never see him
Do you follow
(Mackelway doesn't) We'll never see one
But that doesn't mean they don't exist
Hence Suspect Zero
Mackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient weapons
Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his sidearm, as 'Ryan continues: ' (') Some of my colleagues think 'm fascinated with evil
think the truth is just the opposite: evil is fascinated with us
What better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the world - what better instrument - than Man
We're vain, we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have an imagination that is limitless in its perversions
Of course Evil keeps trying to harness us
Wouldn't you
The more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting that gun
Then, disturbing the silence, a  at the door
' (') Excuse me
'Ryan rises, goes to the door
as Mackelway unholsters his gun
'Ryan opens the door
Standing here is a , with a backpack
She looks confused
Oh
'm sorry
was looking for Professor-- 44
Just like that, 'Ryan has bolted past the Coed, literally tossing her onto Mackelway, exploding into the hall
She screams
Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as time allows, then blows out of the room
60
-   -                    60 'Ryan turns a corner, vanishing
Mackelway follows
61
-   -                      61 Mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor: One door after another, for what seems like a mile
But no 'Ryan
Then Mackelway spots an
stairwell
62
-                                       62 Mackelway enters
The stairs go six stories  from here
and one story
sub-basement
It's a guess
He descends, gun drawn

"-2" looks a lot like -1: long and endless
We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water, the wheezing of an old generator
And, on all sides of us, , a mile of them: maintenance offices, supply rooms, labs
He opens one - a janitor's supply
No one in here
Tries another door
Locked

Locked

Locked
Air sucks through a corridor around us
He thinks he hears footsteps around a corner
Runs at them

- -  -                           64 Nothing
No one
Just another vast corridor
More doors
Then, a sound
, shattering on the floor
He runs down the corridor, passing a long metal  that houses this building's
They're old and wheezy
It's dark behind them, shadowy
Not a bad place to hide
Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted glass
sign on it reads "Neuropsychiatric Lab
" That's where the sound came from
he thinks

65
- -  -                               65 Mackelway enters
The lab is dark
He throws on every light switch within reach
and finds himself standing over the shards of what used to be a
So he's in the right place
He scans it: five rows of work- stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it
Lining the walls are wide
But there's also a - down here: Four rows of , housing medical journals
These are the "stacks" - perfect for hiding behind
He plunges in
Row #1
Doesn't see anyone
Then Row #2, Row #3, Row #4
Okay, the stacks check out
He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching, nudging open cabinets
One has been opened: Bottles of  sit inside it
And a  that's been unsealed: It's got   in it
In the back of the room, an '  awaits
It's tall enough to hide beneath
Mackelway slinks around it
Kneels down, looking into darkness
Then, a
The   of this lab just swung open
And 'Ryan just bolted out

Mackelway enters
few meager  burn
He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath us
He walks along the edge of Furnace #1
and is assaulted, from above
'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp of that furnace, then down to the ground
Mackelway's gun skids across the floor
And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze
46
He wants to fight back
but suddenly he finds that his head is swimming
Something's on that gauze
The room is getting fuzzy
We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat
Then our own (Mackelway's  was torn open by the corner of that furnace
) Wait
Did we just see the glint of a
'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control
Then 'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of And we hear: (
) Hey
You
What're you doing down here
We turn, groggily
rush toward us, keys jangling
It's all foggy, wavy, distorted
We see 'Ryan
Then everything goes black
: 68
-                                    68 Mackelway's head is ringing
Feels like he can hear electricity in the walls around him
Slowly, he awakens
Above him are fluorescent lights
Monitors blink
Fran is here
So's Charlton
Mackelway tries to sit up
The shock of pain from his chest stops him
How ya doin'
Mackelway half-nods
His chest is bandaged
We're gonna need everything you can remember about this guy, Tom
Physical description, any kind of distinguishing characteristics
That was terse
Charlton looks pretty pissed-off
(scratchy) Where is he
The suspect fled
Couple janitors walked in on it
(before Mack can ask:) () 47
(') They're fine
But the description they gave of him wasn't worth a damn
Mackelway nods
(') Case you're curious the real Professor Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the country
We can't find him
(Mackelway nods) Whose idea was it to meet there
His, Sir
Uh-huh
Did he ask you to come alone
No, Sir
But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it
The truth
Charlton has him pegged
But: Sir, 'm the one who took the call
Agent Mackelway was acting under the assumption that 'd already checked the guy out
We're both to blame
Hold it
That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright lie
Mackelway eyes her, thrown
She's poker-faced
Charlton, however, seems unmoved
Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied
(reluctantly) Yes, Sir
Then whose fuck-up is it
Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying
" She nods
48
(at Charlton) It was
poor judgment, Sir
You wanna work alone, start your own agency
Mackelway can do nothing but nod
Then, bailing him out, another   enters, tools in hand
Charlton sighs, frustrated

Lots of Baptists, singing a rousing spiritual
Music and praise filling the room
We move along the pews, until we came to the very back row
There, one man sits
Alone
Quiet
'Ryan
Odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this rousing music, or feel the power of this place
People in the next row are stomping their feet
Music soars
But 'Ryan just drops his head, slowly
and begins to in the middle of this boisterous congregation

800    's, represented by 800 pins in 800 cities
It's like a national plague
Mackelway sits, examining it soberly
His chest-wound is killing him
(We see a thick bandage beneath his shirt
) In his pocket now is a bottle of
Percodan
He slugs one down without water, his eyes never straying from that map
Beside it is a   from 'Ryan, taken from Mackelway's description

Mackelway stands at the register, paying for his -
Another night with nothing but his thoughts for company
Great
Then: '  (

It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by herself in a nearby booth
Mackelway smiles
(') Hi

Character
And candles
Lots of candles
They throw  of Mackelway and Katie all over the walls
An odd  fills the room, coming from a - on the floor
It's a rhythmic Navajo , with Native-American drums providing the pulse
It's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic
and it fits the intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly, their eyes locked
She's breathless
52
First time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that furnace room
covers a quarter of his chest
Dried blood can be seen beneath it
There's an intensity in his eyes
The chanting, the candles, Katie's body, his wound
they've conspired to bring an intensity into his eyes
It's dark, primal
And he's been expressing it for an hour without relent
which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge of the bed, exhausted
She reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume
The chanting dies down into silence
She catches her breath
(softly) can't anymore
Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the on that boom-box back
The chanting fills the room again
And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently
That primal side hasn't been sated yet

'
-  -                         86 Mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that wound across his chest
He unwraps the gauze over that fat bandage soaked through with blood
He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep gash
Dried blood, torn skin, bruising
Looks like hell
But Mackelway eyes it calmly
He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide
as Katie appears in the doorway
She eyes him
Can't sleep
He shrugs, turns
What was that music
It's Navajo
song for dead warriors never played it for anybody before

The candles are down to their nubs

One of those 4:30-in- the-morning ideas that has to be expressed

He's just knocked on the door
Fran opens it, in a robe
Very confused
He looks manic
What're you-- can't get a read on this guy
Two minutes ago, she was sound asleep
Huh
Why is he sending us all this shit
've got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing people
What's he telling us
She gets it now: he's on a combination of painkillers and lack of sleep
Or maybe she can sense where he's been

(') (rapid-fire) He kills a travelling salesman, then a school-teacher
Then Starkey
It doesn't connect
You're a mess
'm fine
'm clear
just didn't think this could wait
Fran, this guy is trying to point us at something
Starkey's part of it
But the other two don't connect
Did you drive here
'm fine
just need somebody to think this through with me
He wanted to meet me
It's like he was interviewing me somehow
What is that
Then he kills Starkey
So what was he doing with Speck and Fulcher
You wanna come in
No
No
You come out
Get dressed
Out where

Somewhere
We're right on the edge of this thing
She studies him

You're welcome to the couch if you want

He sags a bit
She reaches for his hand
(') (gently) Mack

Just like that, there is contact
Their hands
It surprises them both
He appreciates it, but now's not the time
So he smiles thinly, turns, and goes
She watches him vanish around a corner

'  - 6:00
89 We've been to this house before
Suburbia
Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place
Rain falls in sheets, wind blows
And there he is, all alone, six in the morning, staring at a house
That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's still working on him
Beside him is the  that was found in Speck's car: The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic, containing body parts in plastic bags
Mackelway seems to be fixated on it now
: 90
'  - 9:15
90 hand knocks on the front door
Jan Speck opens up
(hoping for good news:) Agent Mackelway
Mackelway stands in the doorway, rain falling behind him
(all business) Mrs
Speck
Just had a few more questions

'  -   -                     91 Mackelway sits at the , looking over the backyard
Nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar door
But he's staring at it, intently
We're not sure why
56
Behind him, Jan re-enters, purse over her shoulder, umbrella in hand
She grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the coffee table
'm sorry  don't have more time, Agent Mackelway
It's my  Day
It's fine
should've called
She smiles tightly: " have to go now" and heads for the kitchen
Once she's there, Mackelway turns to the and  , eyeing that storm-cellar outside
She leaves the cup in the sink
He enters the kitchen
hope  was of some help
You were
Thanks
friend of mine said 'll feel like this one month for every year we were together
Sort of a grieving rule-of- thumb
Have you ever heard that
(gently) No
Sorry
She half-smiles
He turns to the door
Turns back
(') Oh
There was one other thing: Did he keep any kind of chemicals around the house
Acids, that sort of thing
No
Why
He shrugs, dismissing it: It's nothing
Trace elements we found on his trunk
Any interest in chemistry
Maybe as a hobby
Jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory
Then she shakes it off
He lets it go
57
(') Anyway, thank you
And thanks for the coffee
Next time 'll call first, promise
No trouble at all

'  -                                   92 Mackelway sits in his car
Through his windshield we see Jan as she backs out of the driveway
She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a grieving widow can give
He waves back
Then she's gone, disappearing around a corner
Mackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be sure
Then he gets out of his car

'  -  -                          94 He emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that storm cellar door
He knows he shouldn't be doing this
It's beyond risky
But here he is, without a warrant
There's no lock on the cellar door
He reaches for it
Then he stops himself
Just noticed something: -, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is looking right at him through her bedroom window
Fuck it
He enters the storm cellar
95
'   -                              95 Seven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor
Mackelway looks around
58
Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of potable water
And long -
Two of them
That's where Mackelway's eyes go, instantly
He hurries to them
Throws one open
Nothing but sheets and blankets inside
He paws through it
finding nothing else
He throws the other trunk open
Inside
Pillows
Fuck
He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on shelves
He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their rows, making more noise than he ought to
But he finds nothing behind them
except more cans
He approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside
Behind them is a tall , locked
He pulls at the cupboard door, hard
It splinters
Inside, a rifle and some boxes of ammo
same as you'd find in every other storm-cellar in Texas
He pauses: Am  crazy
: 96
'  -                              96 He emerges from the storm-cellar, confused
Shuts the storm- cellar door
Then he turns
Something else just caught his eye: Above Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one
An attic
He heads for that   , and enters
97
'  -   -                     97 He hurries toward the stairs, reaches them
then spots something through the Entry Hall window: On the street outside, pulling up to the curb
is a Sirens off
That Neighbor-Lady must've placed the call
And here's Mackelway, without a warrant
Shit
Two   get out, approaching the house
Mackelway climbs the stairs

99
'  -   -                   99 tiny hallway, with four doors
Up ahead, dangling from the ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold- out stairs
and an attic
Mackelway tugs on the rope
The fold-out stairs drop down out of the ceiling
Then he hears: (
) He's inside
He's inside
Went in through the back
which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to hell
So he climbs up those fold-out stairs
The two   now circle the house, entering through the back-porch door, just as Mackelway did
He pulls up the folding stairs
Maybe the guys'll do a half- assed search and then leave
100
'  - ATTIC_-                         100 Mackelway looks around: lots of dusty junk around here - old clothes, mementoes
and one more trunk
steamer-trunk
Huge
And locked
Looks just like the one in that  rendered by 'Ryan
Mackelway races for it
Takes out his gun, uses the butt-end to bust the lock off
Throws it open
as we hear the sound of those fold-out steps, being tugged down from the second-floor hallway
And: #1 (
) Freeze, Asshole
The  is just ten feet away, most of him still concealed by those steps - gun trained right on us
But Mackelway seems utterly untroubled
(calmly) It's okay, Fellas
60
#1 'll bet
Mackelway drops his gun, kicks it toward the cop, who doesn't quite know what to make of that
Also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across Mackelway's face
But we understand it now: The inside of that steamer-trunk is filled with  : bagged, stacked, and sealed in Ziplocs
Powdered  is sprinkled on them
Mackelway stares, at once satisfied and sickened
#1 can be heard, approaching across the attic floor
His gun is drawn
until he too sees what's in there
#1 (') Oh Jesus Christ

We turn toward the sound
The freezer is open

Inside this freezer, frozen into a block of ice
are six female
No arms, no heads
Just six slender hands, each with a wedding band on the ring finger

He is pleased with himself
Out of nowhere, a firm hand grasps his right shoulder stopping him
Mackelway turns abruptly, finding himself sandwiched between his Yukon and Charlton, who is now in his face
Listen to me Cowboy
You have any idea the kind of favors  had to pull with the Abilene cops to cover your ass
Sir
(not allowing him to talk) Breaking and  the Speck house without a shred of evidence and (not going down without a fight) The sample  took from Speck's bumper
It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the odor of the acid
Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through
(') It was  not his killer who was hiding something
Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent from Dallas gets sent down to the Wichita Falls Field Office
'll give you
Hell 'll even write it down for ya
Charlton leans in to emphasize his point
He pulls out a pad and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using Mackelway's chest as support
It's humiliating
(') "
" Don't talk about it
Learn it

Those words just hang there, haunting Mackelway
Charlton tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into Mackelway's hand
(') Turns out you were right about this guy
You were right about both of them
But that doesn't change the fact that you went about your business like a rookie
Got it
Charlton turns, the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence throwing a circle of light around the Yukon
Mackelway watches as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away
sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of Mackelway's hand, he stares at it, as it disappears into darkness

) Also, that : of the ghastly Ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk
Damn thing seems prescient now
Agents mill about, awaiting a conference
(passing by) Nice job, Mack
Thanks
few   also pat him on the back
Fran's proud of him too - we can see it
In fact everyone in here seems to be giving Mackelway his due
It all feels good
Charlton enters
Seated please
The agents find seats around the table
Charlton takes his place at the head of it

(') (to the assembled:) Okay
We've got a serial killer of serial killers
Fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "What a genius
" Slides it over
Mackelway conceals the note, as: (') (still grand-standing) He's a transient with a history of mental illness
He also happens to think he's a former agent of this Bureau
And he is pursuing something that he calls "Suspect Zero

Nobody's volunteering

Then he stops
because Katie is waiting out here, leaning against her Toyota Camry
(fondly) Hey
Somethin', huh
Guy with a wife and kids keepin' bodies in his attic
He nods
but what is she doing out here
Yeah
(a beat) You okay
Yeah
Just
Wondered if you could do me a favor
64
Mackelway waits
as Katie hands over a manila envelope
Mackelway opens it
Inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl named  , with an attached sheet listing her vitals: height, weight, age, etc
Another face
Another disappearance
(') Her name's Karen Sumpter
We were friends
(almost reluctantly) She disappeared last year
Nobody knows where
She was a little wild, but not like that
Her sadness is obvious
Mackelway nods
(') Anyway,  know you're gonna be in on the autopsies - of the girls they found over at Speck's
Figured you might see if one of 'em was
Her voice trails off
This is hard
(') If it is, 'd like to be the one to notify her folks
Out families've been friends for years
(gently) Sure
Of course
Thanks

Mackelway puts the envelope under his arm
She starts up the Camry
The sky rumbles
He eyes her
For some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet

Shadows on the wall

65
Mackelway is studying her, staring into her eyes, her breathing
She's beginning to climax now
and those eyes go wider
We   , and: We are abruptly , again,      , from that unidentified place: 107

'  -                                   108 She is utterly lost now
And that  seems to have gotten louder somehow
at us now: culled from that  on , found at the halfway house: a  with eyes rolling back in his head, foaming at the mouth
Mackelway tries to shake it off, tries to keep his focus on Katie
He buries his head into her neck, as: 109

There is no way in hell he's going to let himself get deterred by a State Trooper

'd like to hand it over, voluntarily, so you won't think 'm trying to conceal anything
Would that be all right
What kind of weapon, Sir
' It's a hunting knife, right here on my hip
Trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed  - the one 'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath 'Ryan's shirt
' (') was on my way to the woods
My gear's in the trunk

Take the weapon off your hip, place it on the ground, and kick it toward me
' Happy to
'Ryan takes the knife off his hip
The size of it gets some attention from the Trooper
What exactly were you planning on hunting, Sir
' fifty-foot shark
No reply
'Ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and kicks it toward the Trooper
Trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes off 'Ryan

It's a thick , roughly 150 pages, in a
The word "" is written across the front
He leans down, opens the folder
The light is spotty out here

The entire career of Special Agent Benjamin 'Ryan
in black and white

Sounds like 'Ryan just laughed
Then, another curve: ' Was she pretty
Huh
' could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting
Whole thing was downright tribal
What's she look like
That was unsettling
Very
Mackelway looks around feeling violated, feeling "watched
" He draws the blinds
Double bolts the front door
Runs his hand under the window frame for any kind of wire tapping
But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react
Not now, with 'Ryan on the phone
(calmly) You tell me
'Ryan laughs
He liked that
' Fair enough
We'll stick to business: How'd ya like my old room

That  down the hall is at it again, off-key as ever
Tonight it's the "Gilligan's Island" theme-song
'll be in my office
Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar
Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed, sink, window, the leaky ceiling, the bucket, the peeling paint
This room is heaving with energy
He sits on the bed, checks his watch
9:05 p
m
Opposite this bed is that , re-painted in industrial white, with the hint of a shape underneath
It's what Mackelway's come here to investigate
73
122
- ,  -                            122 'Ryan sits at a desk: eyes closed, writing pad at his wrist
On it, more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to us
They're called
He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them, as if receiving information from it, and we jump back into: 123

Sitting
Staring
Outside this room we hear that awful, toneless singing as it fills the hallway
Mackelway rises, approaching that re-painted wall
He pulls out his keys
Checks to see that no one's watching
124

Semi-darkness
until   throws a burst of white light against that wall
faint shape becomes visible, just beneath the white paint
Then it vanishes again
Using his keys, he begins to scratch away at the white paint
It's an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the last few days it makes an odd kind of sense
Instantly, a hint of  can be seen underneath

Outside, he can hear an 18- rumble by

More  appears beneath it
Then, a  behind him
He turns
The door to this room just ; someone outside must've pushed it
He keeps scratching at the paint
rages outside
We  , away from that wall, which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway is too close to the wall to see for himself: 74
There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white paint
It is the shape of a vast, black
hand-painted image as large as this wall itself
Mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal
In fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow him whole
and he can't even see it
But we can
Must've taken 'Ryan days to paint something this large
vast, black wave
Evil itself
And Mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it
128
- ,  -                         128 'Ryan, somehow, seems to be sensing what is going on in that room
Or maybe he's just feeling the power of that wave, from memory
Or maybe he's just plain crazy
But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are feeding one another
129
- ''   -                  129 Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly, revealing more of the blackness underneath
We   on it, moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping
Then we're beneath that thin coat of white, and: 130
-                      130 Somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself
black, tidal force of nature
And it is
Alive
We hear the  of it: a sucking, a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before exploding forward
The sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that bucket
Evil itself, on the move, gathering might
And we're along for the ride
The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon
It is massive, powerful, dark
And we're right on its forward edge, as if surfing it somehow
131
- ,  -                         131 'Ryan reacts
Something just changed: 75
132

which is when we hear the laughter of a

Then new images come at him - but they are, at first, ,

Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a moment to crystallize before us
But then it sharpens: We're in the   of a - , but it feels like we're looking at it through a broken lens
The images appear  to us, surrounded by darkness
Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing
Call him
135
- ''   -                  135 Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now - enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave, its lip
He continues
136
- ,  -                         136 'Ryan tightens

There, through a window, we see a , presumably Charlie's mother
Her name's , 40
Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy diapering her nine month-old  at a table

-                                       139 The sound of that wave is still a presence
Charlie looks up at us as he swings
His smile is pure, genuine
We whip around for another look at Kathleen
She's still busy with that diaper
Then we look back to Charlie
140
-                                      140 'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total
but every part of him is becoming tense

More of that wave is visible to him
But he doesn't step back to take that in

And we're running we know not where

toward a
But we do so smoothly, without effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave
Then,   bleeds in
The  of the Diner's back door, which leads on to that Play Area
And we hear a horrified yell: (
) Charlie
Charlie, where are you, Honey
(fainter) Charlie
Honey, are you out here
The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken over by the sounds of that awful
145
- ''   -               145 Mackelway suddenly stops
as if some electric charge had just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness
He begins to step away from the wall

An awesome sight
His head is pounding worse than ever

Bits of chipped white paint litter the floor
vast black wave
It fills the whole wall
Mackelway eyes his watch
It's one o'clock in the morning
He's been in here for four hours
That seems impossible

- '  -                         154 Ten minutes have passed, but Mackelway has seen a revelation
We can read it on his face
He eyes the map
which has now been stuck with over 1,000 , one for each city with a     to its credit
And those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when the pins were yellow
Looks like a big black
And that's just what it is
1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that 'Ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave of darkness, gathering strength
But this black wave is consuming America
Mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened
The thing seems vast, unstoppable
black wave - pure malevolence, covering the states like a fog
One blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart of Greenville, Texas
Then, piercing the silence: (
) Got one of those pins in Denton yet
Mackelway turns
Charlton leans in the doorway
(') 'Ryan was spotted there tonight
Took a squad-car and a side-arm from a State Trooper

We're establishing a perimeter around the city now

What makes you so sure
Professional courtesy
Charlton's at a loss
until Mackelway gestures to the table, where he has laid out 'Ryan's entire  File

Charlton eyes it, calmly
He's not going to let his jaw drop, not with Mackelway watching
So he just nods
(') Is that
possible, Sir
An agent can just be deleted
Looks like it
Mackelway pauses
It's a depressing reality
couldn't understand it before - pushing Speck's car onto the state line
Makes sense now
He wanted to make the case Federal
He's drawing us in
Why would he do that
So we'd be paying attention when he found Suspect Zero
Ya know what
'm getting extremely tired of hearing that word
In fact, that's gonna be policy from now on
No Zero
Sir, profile the guy
He's straight outta Quantico
All he's doing is working a case, like we would
He's not kidnapping little kids - he's chasing the guy who's doing the kidnapping
Look at the map
80
What're you saying - that all these abductions are the work of one guy
Do you know how fucking insane that is
(over Mackelway) Not let's try something that actually makes sense: He sends in these faxes, picks off three scumbags
For what
So we'll think exactly what you're thinking right now - that we've got a friend out there, somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us
And it's all horse-shit
What if it isn't
What if there really is a Zero out there and 'Ryan's the one guy who's got a shot at him
(just blew his top) Fuck's sake, Mackelway - when did you start buying into this guy
beat
Mackelway lets the silence hover
(quietly) He's smarter than we are
Speak for yourself
Charlton heads for the door
Sir
What if  told you  knew how to catch him
Charlton stops
Turns
Do you
And what if  told you that the way 'd catch him involved sitting in a dark room, with nothing in front of me but a pad of paper
until 'd tapped into some kind of
energy out there
The collective unconscious
Something
If told you  thought  could target and () 81
(') locate him, without ever leaving this building, what would you say
'd say you'd watched too many "-Files
" 'ever heard of a project called "Icarus," Sir
No
Mackelway tosses over a few pages from 'Ryan's file
Agents, trained to "see" distant locations using nothing but the mind
They called it Remote Viewing
Charlton eyes the pages without comment
(') Army stole it from the Soviets
The Bureau stole it from the Army - used it to track serial killers
(a beat) Experimental program
'Ryan was the first agent they recruited
Good for him
Voodoo, right
Pure Bullshit
(Charlton's waiting) except, it worked
It's how he drew this: Mackelway's referring to that : a steamer-trunk, filled with ghastly Ziploc bags: (') He'd never been in that house before
He just saw what was in there - the Bureau taught him how
same one that deleted him
Same one that's trying to catch him now
Does anything about all this strike you as odd
Charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him
Then: 82
'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred
You can take the day off
With that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here
Nothing to look at but that black wave
He hears Charlton, leaving the building

He rises

The fax has spun out a single sheet
No top-sheet
That's odd
But here's another face, another victim, with the customary across the top
young African-American boy: "Lloyd Simms, Age 9

There's that wave of black pins, with the one   in its center; Greenville, with a "10-26" written beside it
Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a black one
Now the wave is complete
All black

It rumbles along the highway
We don't see who's driving, but we do see who's in the passenger seat: 83
It's Charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just witnessed
He sleeps fitfully

He picks up a , shoves it into the tape deck
And out comes the sound of "Barney the Dinosaur
" (  ) Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear them once again/And maybe you're hearing an echo/Or maybe it's only a friend
The truck continues to rumble along

Fran pauses outside the 'Ryan Room
where Mackelway sleeps on a chair
Poor guy was here all night
She regards him
then her eyes find that , and the gaping black wave across it
horrible image
She studies Mackelway again, almost tenderly, until: (
) Does he listen to you
She turns, startled
Here's Charlton, right behind her
And she's been caught
watching Mackelway sleep
'm sorry
It's not a strength of his
'm noticing that lately
Truth is, she doesn't like Charlton
Or trust him
He's fine
'm not so sure
(a beat) You oughtta sit him down, remind him how a chain-of-command works
He's fine, Sir
84
Talk to him
With that, he's gone
Fran watches as he heads for the Front Door
and exits
She looks back to Mackelway
He awakens with a start
Thinking no one's watching, he pops another Vicoden
160
'  -                                   160 Fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange
Mackelway checks his watch as a few  exit the suite
They going to Denton
Mmm-hmm
But not you
Sitting in on two autopsies
Oh
He rises
Heads for the door, stiff
She looks at those 'Ryan - her first time seeing them
You okay
Yeah
Why
Nothing
She leaves it at that
He's about to exit, when: Are they male or female
Huh
The autopsies
85
Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur, Alabama
(Neither city is represented with black pins on that map
) She slides over a packet of : two  , photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below, etc
Mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room
We taking in that 'Ryan  file
It troubles her
Mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie gave to him
(') (re: 'Ryan's file) So is this what happens when an agent spins out
He gets deleted
Sometimes
The lucky ones get sent to Wichita Falls
She breathes out an ironic laugh
He hands over the envelope, opens it
Inside: that photo of Karen Sumpter
Mackelway didn't pay much attention to it before
Fran eyes the photo, then the vitals
(') Friend of the Receptionist, missing for about a year now
told her 'd let her know if the body ever turned up
Fran doesn't look up from the photo
The Receptionist
Her name's Katie
She half-smiles: "You mean the one you've been fucking
" He shrugs, confirming nothing - wishing Fran weren't quite so smart
She puts the photo back into the envelope
see you got the blue pin out of Greenville
86
Yeah
Last night
Kid named Simms
That confused her
(re: Sumpter) No
meant her
The girl
That confused him
What're you talking about
Did ya look at her vitals
She hands him the material on Karen Sumpter
(') Greenville, Texas
October 26
He grabs the material, looks at it for the first time: "Karen Sumpter, Age 25
Ht
5'6", Wt
110
Eyes Blu, Hair Blnd
Last Seen: Greenville, Tx
Date of Disappearance: 10-26- 00

The one on top is the one that came in last night: Lloyd Simms, Age 9
Ht
4'10", Wt
67 lbs
Last Seen: Greenville, Texas
Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99
At last, a pattern
break
Mackelway grabs the Simms fax, hurries out of the room
Nearest Agent is Grieves
Mackelway hands him the fax
Need an address on this fax line
Grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never yields their suspect, but: 'Kay
Mackelway leans back in to the 'Ryan Room
'Ryan's in Greenville
87
What makes you think so
That's where Zero is
(Fran's a blank) Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99
Karen Sumpter - October 26, 2000
Both disappeared from Greenville
(still no reply) Zero comes back to the same spot, once a year
Today's the 25th
Wait
When did we establish that Zero was real
'Ryan thinks so
Do you
That's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there
Mackelway's about to answer
when he stops himself
Just noticing something
That   from Logan, Utah: There's a   on the lower left calf of the victim
We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo
've seen this before
Huh
He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick Starts rifling through them
until he finds the one we've seen before
The body from Trenton
He extracts it
Eyes it
confirmation
He lays the two  side by side
Looks to Fran
Same burn-mark
(she leans in) saw it before but it didn't register
Fran eyes the photos
No doubt about it - they both have the same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost horizontal stripe across the flesh
88
He burns them
dunno
Almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn
(re: Logan victim) They're autopsying her this morning
Yeah
She gets the idea: "Find out where the hell this mark on the leg came from
" Grieves enters
Fax number traces back to a Copy Center on -30

They don't open for another hour
Mackelway looks to Fran
She's not entirely sold yet
but she's getting there

never saw that guy in here
89
He sent a fax from this location 'bout seven o'clock this morning
- We're closed at seven
Are your faxes programmable
Could he have paid last night to have it sent this morning
- Sure
But that costs extra
Were you here last night
- Nope
Haven't done nights since  got promoted
Mackelway eyes the guy
then hears a - ring
'Scuse me
Mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter

-                                 164 Fran is at a phone, in the Morgue
The Logan Utah  lies on the table
It's not a burn
It's a freezer-burn
You're sure
There's crystallization in the blood stream
The blood never clotted in the wound
It's a freezer burn
'm having the other body shipped out - the guy from Trenton
We'll see if he's got the same thing
Mackelway pauses, thinking
90
So
he keeps the bodies in a freezer, then buries them
That was a question
He can't do any better
dunno
If he kept them in a freezer they'd have marks like this all over
Wouldn't they
Mackelway nods - that made sense
Shit
The noise of the Interstate doesn't make things any easier huge  rumbles by
18 wheels
Mackelway eyes it, absently
Then a bolt hits him: On the side of the truck is a trademark: "-
" This truck is hauling ice cream
Things just began to click
Thanks, Fran
He has hit "End" before she can reply
Heads to his Yukon

You want some more breakfast, Honey, or are we just rollin' right on into lunch
91
Just some coffee, thanks
Might hit the buffet in a bit
Meatloaf's lookin' good today

Mackelway laughs
He appreciates a good jab
'm at the truck-stop we traced
Off the -30

She likes him, despite herself

He likes her, despite himself
Then a  passes by him, a trucker
Let's call him
All we see as he passes is the  on his forearm: a cobra
Keys jingle on his belt-hook
He wears a sleeveless down vest and a "God Bless America" cap
Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us
Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention
The walk, the attitude
Something
So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig
It's a beast
Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched
Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him
That  comes by with more coffee
Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again
And sees a   of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig
But this little boy is , struggling to get out of his car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly
all of this visible through the windshield
Mackelway locks in on the kid
Holy shit
Vic's rig pulls out
The kid pounds on his window
Looks like he's saying "Lemme out of here
want my Mommy
" He might be little Charlie - we can't tell from here
But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: "Shut up
" And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated
He's hauling dairy products
On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as coincidence
He might not be so vigilant
This isn't a normal day
He races for the door
169
- -   -                      169 Mackelway backs out in the Yukon, trying to keep a visual on Vic's truck
18- pulls in front of him, blocking his view entirely
93
Dammit
He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading for the exit of the lot
Just spotted Vic's rig again
170
/
'  -                      170 He follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road approaching -30
But there are three cars between them - Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate
Vic approaches the Interstate
So do the three cars between them
Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp
The three cars turn on to it
putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail
He grabs his cel, dials
This truck has license plates from ten states
( ) This is Mackelway
need a run down on a plate
Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha
Got that
He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up
Vic just made a turn onto a
huge  overhead reads, "
" 171
-   -                           171 There are several - parked here, but the vast majority of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and 's few pick-ups
There are  at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel, and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking
Must be a thousand people in attendance today
Vic parks his rig
Mackelway hangs back, watching: Vic gets out of the rig
From here we can see that that 5-year- old  is still stick in his car seat, and he is still screaming and flailing
Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "Behave or else
" Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival
94
172
-    -                             172 He gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck
We He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window
There's the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face
(We still can't tell if it's Charlie
) Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door
It's locked
Of course
And he can't shoot his way in
He looks to the kid inside: You okay
(Kid's a blank) Kid
You okay in there
The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked
Shit
Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd
Vic's still visible to us, but he won't be for long
(') (at the Kid) 'll be back
Don't worry
Mackelway heads into the carnival
173
-                                         173 He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy
Running
because we just lost sight of Vic
Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a tray or two
Then he stops
There's the ferris wheel
Was that Vic on the other side of it
Mackelway takes off
174
-                                     174 No Vic
But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy
heading back in the direction of the parking lot
He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn machine, past those ladies selling tickets
95
175
-                                       175 He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance
But he bursts through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big- rigs, then turns a corner and: runs smack into Benjamin 'Ryan
The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to recover from it
But here he is
'Ryan, five feet away
Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself second ago he was chasing a possible Zero
Now he's face to face with 'Ryan
And 'Ryan isn't running
In fact, he almost seems amused
' Well, well
Must be quite a moment for you
Congratulations
Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until: What're you doing here
' Waiting for you
which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right in front of Vic's rig
But he wasn't expecting what comes next: Vic has returned to the rig, with a  beside him
Turns out, she's his
Vic opens the passenger-side door, unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat
- Mommy
The kid dives into the Woman's arms
Morning, Baby
told you she'd be here
(to Woman) He's been a brat all morning
96
Mother hugs son
which means that Mackelway has misread things, badly
And 'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin
(at 'Ryan) Hands up
'Ryan raises his hands
Mackelway reaches for his cuffs

Reaches for his cel- phone
Starts to dial
' (disappointed) Awfully conventional - don't ya think
Mackelway pauses
Huh
' Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in for your pat on the head
Sorry to disappoint you
Mackelway continues to dial
' 'll get over it
(flat) But 'm not too sure that little boy will
Bang
That just stopped Mackelway, mid-dial
97
(minor test) What little boy
' The one from the Diner, in Denton
You know where he is
' can find him
How
' Same way  found Starkey, and Speck, and Fulcher
and you
That rang a bell
' (') need someplace quiet - someplace  can concentrate
And your assurance that once he's located, we go get him together
can't do that
' Then  can't help you
Mackelway, disgusted, pulls out of the lot

'  -  -                 178 Through sparse traffic, heading for an Interstate on-ramp
' (') 'm talking about uncompromised justice
No trials
No lawyers
No hiccups in a chain of evidence that can set a monster free
You of all people should be able to appreciate the value of that
Where's the boy
' won't be doing this much longer
Actually, this is the end of it
've () 98
' (') come to accept that
But there is one last thing to-- (anger rising) Where's the boy, 'Ryan
' Do we have an understanding
Mackelway pulls the car over, under an -30 overpass
and out comes his gun, pointed right at 'Ryan's forehead
(') Enough of this shit
Where's the boy
'Ryan can't help it
He's pleased
' Good
This is good
Sort of thing you'd never find in a procedural manual
It tells me  was right about you
(cocking the hammer) will kill you, 'Ryan
' know
But we have work to do first
Where's the Goddamn kid
Silence
Then that - rings
Must be Fran
' Don't pick that up
Mackelway eyes him: are you kidding
It rings again
' (') (a panicked offer) This is the guy who put all those pins in that map of yours
And  can take you to him
Ring #3
Mackelway grabs the phone
Fine
Where is he
(silence) Where is he
99
Silence, punctuated by Ring #4
Then 'Ryan smiles
and points to his own forehead
' Right here
Mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh
Fuck you
He punches the "Talk" button, taking his eyes off 'Ryan for a split second
What follows is a blur: 'Ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed wrists over Mackelway's head, yanking Mackelway out of his seat with a violent tug
The gun falls
We    , pulling back
obscuring our view of what's going on inside that truck
That cel-phone continues to ring
We keep pulling back, under this sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling
The cel-phone stops ringing
, taking in the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the peril beneath them
: 179
- -  -  -  ()                 179 Fran has just arrived
She scans the place
Doesn't see Mackelway
Great
She reaches for that cel-phone again
: 180
-                       180 Mackelway awakens
The room feels like it's swimming
His arms and legs are bound
His mouth has been
And he is staring into his own
He lies on his side
has been propped on the floor, just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look at but himself
He strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them
He's helpless, powerless
And that mirror is forcing him to watch it all with perfect clarity
100
few feet away, 'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the skin off of an apple with that huge   of his flickers on the floor by his feet
' Are you afraid
There was a delight to that question - we can see it on 'Ryan's face
Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the gag
But the answer's obvious
' (') (quoting himself, as Daitz:) "Imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any kind
No hidden desire to be caught perfect vessel of evil
" All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away
' (') And the name we give that killer
is Zero
(again:) Are you afraid
Slowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on the floor
It
Good God
' (') It'd be customary at this point to start praying
hear a lot of that
Haven't seen too many answers though
wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either
You're alone
Mackelway tries to speak
It's impossible
'Ryan pulls the  from his mouth, just long enough for Mackelway to say: Where's the boy
'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily
' (re: the mirror) My, my
Must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic
'm almost envious
() 101
' (') (casually) The boy's under the bed
In pieces
Are you afraid
Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then looks to that bed
Can't quite see what's under it
'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade
' (') know what you're thinking: "There is pain coming
Am  going to take it like a man
" Let me put you at ease: You won't
None of them do
Men, women, children
They all weep, they all beg
They pass out, they piss themselves
They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve
It's pathetic
Are you afraid
(of course, no reply) Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated
They're just mine
And they're helpless
And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender
well, it's almost pornographic
put this mirror here because  don't want you to miss it
Are you afraid
With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame
It is -
Even looking at it is painful
But Mackelway can't look at anything else
' (') How about now
Just like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's face
The heat alone makes his head jerk back
Wisps of smoke rise from its edge
And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it
He struggles against these ropes, to no use
guttural sound comes out of him
' (') Are you afraid
102
'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife just under Mackelway's chin
The anticipation of pain is unbearable
And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes
' (') Hmmm
Agent Mackelway
Are you
Two things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me to death
2) Please, God, don't let me give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry
'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch above Mackelway's right arm
The heat from it is so incendiary that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke
' (') Are you
Mackelway's shirt is officially on fire now
The pain is awful
He stares at his own reflection
as tears begin to flow from his eyes
He can't stop them
' (') (top of his lungs) Are you afraid
That bounces off the walls
Mackelway shuts his eyes tight - can't watch this anymore
' (') (infuriated) Open your eyes
Open your eyes Goddammit or 'll cut the fucking lids off
Mackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break
Deep sobs shudder through him, as
'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm: ' (') Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes,  am terrified
He , the sound muffled by that gag
With his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head forward, smashing it into that mirror
, obliterating the image
and everything goes black
103
Then,
We're helpless to beat them back: 180a
-                                180a Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've visited before: It is the wheat field that 'Ryan has Remote Viewed countless times
Only this time we see it through Mackelway's fever, or nightmare
We see the tall wheat, the wet wind - familiar images to us
All to the pounding Chant of the Navaho
But then   enter this world
They're jarring: -That , eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth, dancing around a fire in a frenzy
Then a curtain of wheat obscures him, revealing: -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting us
Looks like they're naked
But as we approach them, they seem to get farther away
Then that curtain of wheat that separates us from them reveals: -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us for something, a job well done, when: Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn
He
Then looks to see who he's just shot

He turns it over
and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the mud and pouring rain
It is a moment of shock and horror, giving way as we

181 on 'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a pad
Calm
Businesslike
His back turned to us
182
-                     182 Time has passed
We don't know how much
Or maybe we're dead, or dreaming
It's hard to say
But there's 'Ryan, at a desk
Writing
Mackelway's eyes are open
His  has a bright red raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror
But the brain is functioning
It starts running through a check-list: 104
'm in the same motel room
'm on a bed
'm alive
There's 'Ryan
Everything hurts
No, it's just my right arm
But it is searing
The check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that  has been removed
And
Legs too
Maybe  am dead
Mackelway tries to move his hand
It takes some effort
Everything's foggy
But he puts it before his face
Turns it
Flexes it
Squeezes it
His hand
He stares at it
Then he notices his
fat  has been wrapped around it - covering up the source of that searing pain
Looks as though a nurse had tended to it
But this sure as hell isn't a hospital
Then, 'Ryan turns, facing us
Mackelway recoils without meaning to
But 'Ryan's demeanor has changed
That look of possessed malevolence - it's gone now
We can't imagine why
' (softly) Stand up
Mackelway pauses, rewinding that one
' (') It's over now
Can you stand
Mackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat
So he's a step behind
' (') We really do have to go
'Ryan rises, crossing toward us
Even unbound, Mackelway is expecting another onslaught
But all 'Ryan does is drop a piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap
It's another : of a -, with a windmill in the background
Crude, but just specific enough
Mackelway's still too unwound to speak
' (') This is where he'll be
With the boy
(a beat) Zero
He's coming home today
We're going to be there
105
Mackelway's starting to understand now
This was an act
An initiation
That stuns him
' (') You're ready to come with me now
You've been in the pit
Stand up
Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief
'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of Basic: Sorry  was so hard on you but it had to be done
Can we shake on it
Instead, Mackelway simply : It is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an animal roar, knocking 'Ryan flat on his back
Then Mackelway is upon him
All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable sobbing
they  now into violence
It is an overwhelming force
'Ryan can't begin to fight it off
Mackelway has one hand on 'Ryan's throat
The other hand comes down like a sledgehammer
One blow
Then another
The sounds coming out of Mackelway are savage, barely human
He's out of control
'Ryan's eyes roll back
Mackelway now puts both hands around this fucker's throat
He's going to kill him - right here
He's going to squeeze the life from him
This is a Mackelway we've never met before
His eyes are wild, hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out of 'Ryan's throat
Then Mackelway is distracted, for just a second
No
Less than a second
by a glimpse of that   - his own twisted image
He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined to kill this guy
then those eyes drift back to the mirror again
and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger
An animal
His hands, without warning, release their grip
106
'Ryan gasps for air
His face has been bloodied
Mackelway rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from 'Ryan's chest
That makes breathing a little easier
Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap
183
-  -                            183 Mackelway enters
There's a mirror in here too
That fat on his shoulder stares back at him
He tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm - revealing a hideous wound
It's a ,
Now everything clicks: 'Ryan was branding him
Initiating him with that red-hot knife
Mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless
He splashes some water on his face, his mind still reeling
Then 'Ryan appears in the doorway
He too looks like hell - face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering
long beat
Mackelway eyes him, incredulous
'Ryan nods, then places that of the Ranch-House on the sink
Mackelway eyes it
Then 'Ryan stuns him
by laying Mackelway's  atop the drawing, without a word
Mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at 'Ryan's face, just inches away
We're  on Mackelway's hand
It trembles with rage
But 'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid
In fact he smiles, utterly confident
Then: ' (re: gun) Soon
promise
But not yet
He eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun
Then 'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the front door
Mackelway stands, rigid
He raises the gun
Maybe 'll just shoot this fucker in the back
Then those  come at us again, out of nowhere: 107
184
-                                           184 Out of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet wind, tall wheat, our own heavy  as we run
And that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the sound of 'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling: ' (
) Please
'm begging you
That was clear enough
gun rises
We seem to be holding it
Then those images vanish, and we are jolted back to: 185
-  -                              185 Mackelway tightens
'Ryan's out the door
This  that keeps getting clearer and clearer
What the hell does this it mean
Down go two more Vicodens
: 186
'  -  -                           186 huge  devours scenery on both sides of us
'Ryan drives
Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face, still recovering from what happened in that room
Silence
Then: Tell me about Icarus
' Why
Just
wanna know
'Ryan eyes him
The sky is black
' There were five of us
In the program
Mackelway's all ears
' (') We'd come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees
Then you'd go to your room, with your pen and () 108
' (') your pad of paper, always alone, and you'd try to lock in
Son of Sam
John Wayne Gacy
Ted Bundy
He might be driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth
or cutting someone's eyes out
That was said flatly, matter-of-factly
It's chilling
' (') If you did it right, you got all of it: The way it sounded
The way it smelled
Those people were looking up at you, begging you for mercy
It was like being God
(a beat) except you're not
Because you can't do a thing for them
Can't make it stop
You're just watching, helpless
He pauses
' (') They wired us into this current, the five of us: darkness, the pit itself
We were plugged right into it
But nobody taught us how to shut it off
(thinking back
) We were just men
And we saw things men shouldn't see
Agony, torture, evil - and it never shut off
Even now, it's still there
They all wind up like you
The other agents
' No
They're dead now
Oh
Mackelway doesn't reply
' (') They broke down
Then they opted out
(Mackelway's a blank) Killed themselves
After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible
Ya see
Mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head- lights
Then: 'm sorry
109
'Ryan shrugs
He appreciates it
The windshield wipers beat back rain
: 187
'  -  -                        187 'Ryan continues to drive
Silence hangs
Then: ' We're here
Mackelway sits up
'Ryan pulls over at: 188
- - ,  -                    188 We've seen this place before
That is, we've seen it in 'Ryan's , which lies on the dashboard before us: ranch-style house with a  in the backyard
'Ryan pulls over
Rain pounds on the roof and hood
Wind blows
Mackelway studies the house
Then his eyes shift briefly to the drawing
Can't bring you in with me
You know that
'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "Cuff me
" The  are lying on the floor in the back seat
Mackelway reaches back, to grab them
a golden opportunity for 'Ryan to club the guy
But 'Ryan remains still
Mackelway grabs them
Then he stops
Simply has to ask: (') Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's
How many of 'em is he actually responsible for
'Ryan lays it right out: ' All of 'em
Mackelway nods, sobered
Cuffs 'Ryan to the steering wheel and approaches the house
110
189
-  -                            189 The place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint, etc
Mackelway looks through the kitchen window
No one's visible
He walks around the side of the house
190
'  -                                  190 'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes
This is a moment of opportunity
With his free hand, he reaches into his pocket, grabbing a lighter
191
-  -                               191 Mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain
But now he can see inside the Living Room of this home: It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames
And an  , leaning over a record player
Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller
There's also an old tv in here: "Wizard of Oz" is on it
The lady is 70, frail, thin
She also happens to be
Cataracts on her eyes
Her name's
Mackelway watches her
as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen
He moves to another window
192
'  -                                  192 'Ryan, keeping his eyes on that house, now lights the lighter
and holds the flame up to the  connecting his hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel
The chain begins to heat up
193
-                                  193 Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen
It, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose
The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old
The oven is an antique too
Delia crosses to it, grabs a towel, opens it
and pulls a  from it
111
She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a lady who can't see
On the table is an old-fashioned baker's frosting tube
She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself
and begins to write on the cake, in frosting
Slowly
Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can
The first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: "Happy Bir
" It's a work in progress
194
'  -                               194 'Ryan has that handcuff chain  now
We don't know if he'll have time to break the thing
until: The passenger-side door is opened, abruptly
It's his birthday, isn't it
'Ryan turns
Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what 'Ryan's doing with that lighter
'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly
Mackelway decides to ignore the whole thing
(') He comes home on his birthday
'Ryan nods
Then Delia's front door swings open
(
) (aloud, delighted) Darling
That you
195
-  -                           195 Delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking to the dark rainy street
That confuses them
until we hear the rumble of an 18-
It turns a corner onto this street
Mackelway turns now
We've seen this truck before
monstrous, rolling beast
And Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm
Behind him, Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing
But that smile soon leaps from her face
as she hears the sound of that 18-wheeler,  , its tires locking- up on the wet road
112
Mackelway gets a look at the  now - a wiry, sinewy man of 35
Let's call him
Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again and begins to rumble down the street
(') (confused) Daryl
Honey
No answer
That truck is rumbling away
Mackelway turns, racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door
196
'  -                                196 Mackelway jumps in to the Yukon, unlocking those cuffs
Drive
He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain
(') (re: burn) Fuck
Cuffs are unlocked now
'Ryan starts up the Yukon
197
-  -                     197 'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig
Mackelway gets on his cel- phone, dials
Rain falls in  all around them
( -) (urgently) This is Mackelway
'm travelling north on
Grove Road, approaching -30 in Greenville
Request immediate back-up
Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated truck, Texas license plate Alpha-- The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path
Mackelway drops the phone
Grabs it again
(, ') Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha
Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the road, forcing 'Ryan to swerve hard
The Yukon gets shoved on to a curb, then clunks down to the street again
113
Then Zero jams on the brakes
Mackelway's eyes go wide
(') (at 'Ryan) Brakes
'Ryan jumps on the brakes
The Yukon screeches to a stop, throwing itself into a sideways slide
It bangs, passenger side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window
Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass
Then the rig pulls away again
'Ryan follows
198     -                                             198 Zero's rig turns hard onto a  , running parallel to the Interstate
Mackelway is locked in on that truck
(') (into cel-phone again) Travelling due west now
Don't see a name
It's a service road, running parallel to the-- Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word
He just saw something that made his jaw drop: On the other side of this road is a field of
Time seems to stop
His blood feels like it just congealed
Tall wheat in a wet wind
He has been here before
He has seen it before
And so has 'Ryan
Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past them
The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid
Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way
He knows that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with 'Ryan
And 'Ryan will be begging him for mercy
"Please
" 'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig
Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time
That shreds their front tire
which means that in one minute this car is going to be undriveable
So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that Interstate - now - Zero will be gone
114
(') (absently) What're you
' Can't let him hit the Interstate
Mackelway braces himself, as 'Ryan guns his car up the left side of the rig, shredded tire and all
Then: He pulls right in front of the rig
At about 60 m
p
h
And he jams on the brakes
Zero swerves, out of instinct
It throws the rig into a vicious -
The van whips around in front of the cab, swatting the Yukon away like a fly
We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and 'Ryan look like tinker toys
The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard
Metal hits concrete, sending up a shower of
The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road, upside down
Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out the busted windshield
What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig is lying flat on its side
And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field
199
-                                  199 The rig's cab lies driver's-side down
But the passenger-side door pops open
And Zero pokes through it, his eyes immediately scanning that
Rain pours
Mackelway's watching
'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry
Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises
Only thing in his hand is a
Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat field - vanishing
Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit
'Ryan's door is stuck
Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels across the street
Just then - a    arrives
115
(over his shoulder, running) Get the van open
He's got a kid in the van
hurries out of his squad car
Mackelway sprints into the tall wheat
'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open
Now he too disappears into that Wheat Field
200
-                                      200 Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to guide us
Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn
No idea where he's going
except he's been here before
He's seen it
And there is a feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting
He's practically blind in here
Can't see five feet in front of him
Nothing but the sound of his own breathing
That, too, was presaged
Those visions
201
'   -                               201 It's locked
Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock away
202
-                                        202 Mackelway keeps running, deaf and blind
'Ryan is running nearby, but they can't see or hear one another
203
-   -                 203 200 sides of beef lie on their sides
Ranger plunges in
Then the Ranger spots, in the back of the van, a - that used to hide a secret compartment
The crash has collapsed part of the false-wall
Frozen air blows out in wisps
He climbs over those carcasses, fast as he can
204
-                                        204 Mackelway keeps going, running blind
116
Then, another sound, up ahead
Sounds like the noise of someone stumbling
Mackelway stops
Listens
Silence
The sound does not repeat itself
He continues along, step by cautious step now
205
-   -                    205 Ranger gets over the last of the carcasses, pulling himself up to the now-open compartment
First thing we see is a  , the one that was responsible for those freezer burns
Then we see Charlie, bound
He's trembling with cold, but he's alive
His leg presses up against the rod
206
-                                       206 Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding
He hears a noise to his left
Whips around, gun poised
But it's nothing
He sighs
The wheat almost sounds like it's laughing at him
Then that   lashes out, from the right
It catches Mackelway with horrific force, shattering his wrist and sending that gun flying into the wheat
Before Mackelway can react, Zero is upon him
207
-                                   207 Fran's Ford skids to a stop outside the van
just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig
The kid is shaking, traumatized
He begins to cry
Fran gets the idea
She hurries over
208
-                                       208 Mackelway and Zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of that wheat
Zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron
Mackelway has a busted wrist
Hardly a fair fight
But Mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as many shots as he can
His shirt rips away from his body, exposing that brand-mark
They roll back and forth
Until: 117
' (
) (calmly, firmly) Up
Zero freezes
Mackelway too
They turn to find: 'Ryan
who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand
' (') Up
Mackelway's relief is total
He pushes Zero away, rising
Zero pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned
(re: Mackelway) Glad you're here, Man
Guy was about to kill me
'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left palm
That got Mackelway's attention
Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing
The - falls to the ground
Mackelway approaches 'Ryan
'll take it from here
He extends his good hand to 'Ryan: "The gun
" 'Ryan pauses
Then
' Are you going to shoot him
Give me the gun, 'Ryan
Hey,  just surrendered
' Shut up
surrendered
That's it
' 'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face
That shuts the guy up in a hurry
118
From that service road now, we hear a line of , approaching from a distance
Unit after unit
' (') (quietly now) Look at him, Mack
He's not human anymore
Go dig up that old lady's backyard - you'll find bodies there
Maybe hundreds of them
Of course, ya gotta get a warrant first, chain of custody's gotta be followed
One breach, and he walks
(no reply) My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid of him
It's a lot closer to justice than having some Prosecutor tell you you've left a tissue sample in the wrong lab
Isn't it
(that stung) Give me the fucking gun
'Ryan turns, studies him
and hands him the gun
Just like that
Mackelway eyes it
'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses back to Zero, and grabs that - off the ground
'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as: ' (at Mackelway) You have to understand: none of this was arbitrary
We were chosen, you and
'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage
We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs
He drops to his knees, gasping
' (') saw us here
You did too
Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the other side of Zero's torso
Now both sides of his rib-cage have shattered
Breathing is almost impossible
Mackelway tightens
His head just began to throb
Okay
You made your point
119
' Bullshit
If 'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now
Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's neck
He crumbles, face down
Fuck it
Mackelway crosses to 'Ryan and puts that gun right up against the back of 'Ryan's head
Enough
Then, an odd thing
'Ryan simply smiles
Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a relief
(') Drop it
' Or what
Just drop it
' Would you shoot me
That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider
Put it down
' (calmly) want you to think for a second
About your destiny
Who you are
You're cursed, like  am - except you keep running from it
(Mackelway's silent) You hear things
You see things
That's why you can't sleep, why your head always aches
He turns
They are face to face
Nothing but that gun between them
' (') and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal
And then you're going to kill me
120
That threw Mackelway badly
'Ryan seizes the moment - wheeling around
He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack
The tire- iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull , cracking it
He is dead
Mackelway's eyes go wide
Whole thing has been a blur
'Ryan releases the tire-iron
and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway
Mackelway is silent
Stunned
The blood from Zero's caved-in skull finds its way to 'Ryan's knees
But 'Ryan remains peaceful
Calm
Ready
Get up
' can't do that, Mack
've seen all this already
For months now
Get up
' Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain
And you
He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun
Then he pretends to pull the trigger
Mackelway gets the idea
' (') It's okay
want you to
'm begging you to
Mackelway doesn't know what to do
Then, making matters worse: (
) (aloud) Mack
She's about a hundred yards away
but she'll be here soon enough
That puts some heat under 'Ryan: ' 'm tired, Mack
(
) Can you hear me
121
She's 90 yards out now
' Pull the trigger
(no reply) 'm not going to jail
Now pull the fucking trigger
Mackelway's frozen
'Ryan knows it
' (') Fucking coward
'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway
' (') Some things are not up to us to decide
They just exist
They're inevitable
This field
This rain
This moment
It has all already happened
You know that
You've seen it too
He shoves Mackelway in the chest
(
) Mack
She's 70 yards out now
' Shut it off for me
'm not going to kill you, 'Ryan
' Of course you will
've seen it
You saw wrong
' (incredulous) That's impossible
(
) Mack
Can you hear me
50 yards out now
Maybe close enough to hear 'Ryan's voice
' (rambling, unraveling) You don't understand
Those fucking faces () 122
' (') on that map
They call to me
see their eyes in the dark - they're staring at me: "How did you let this happen to me
" But that's the thing about them - they're like pictures
They never blink
They just
stare, and always at me
That's my destiny, do you see
didn't help them when they needed me and this is my penance
Fine
But 'm opting out now, ya get it
can't stand this anymore
wanna close my eyes for once and see something other than torture
(Mackelway's expressionless) It's not a bad start, Mack
We've made the world a little safer now
Speck, Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero
We've made justice
But  get some too
You have to end all this for me
That's why you're here
It's your destiny
Stop telling me about my fucking destiny
' (again) But 've seen it
Open your eyes, 'Ryan
Here  am, standing here
'm not shooting you
Doesn't that fucking tell you something
You're a guy with a skill
Period
They taught you more than they should've
'm sorry about that
But you're not God
You can't see everything
' Yes  can
And you can too
That's why chose you
(
) Mack
Mackelway's not budging
'Ryan can see that
' (re: tire-iron) Fine
'll make it easy for you: 'Ryan picks up that tire-iron
Mackelway sees what's coming
'Ryan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its range
123
Put the fucking thing down, 'Ryan
'Ryan keeps pursuing
Another swing
Mackelway keeps backing up
The swing misses
' Look
It's perfect
Won't even need a hearing this way
You apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder
Then he turned on you and you fired in self-defense
'Ryan isn't letting up
And Mackelway can't quite fire
' (') These things are bigger than you - haven't you seen that yet
Destiny
Justice
Mercy
They're vast
We're just puppets
'm not going to kill you
' You don't get to decide that
Yes  do
'Ryan takes one more swing, as: (
) Silence
Mackelway turns
So does 'Ryan
There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right on 'Ryan
His shock is total
(') Drop it
'Ryan doesn't move at first
Then, slowly, an ironic smile snakes its way across his lips
' (at Mackelway, surprised) It's funny
never saw anyone else out here
Did you
Mackelway doesn't answer
He can't
'Ryan eyes him
124
' (') Do it, Mack
Please
(Mackelway's silent) Please

Two men, neither of them flinching
until 'Ryan nods - as if to say "Good-bye
" more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising
'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at Mackelway's head

Charlton hurries out of it, making a bee-line for Mackelway
Nice work
(Mackelway half-nods) Where is he

Mackelway rises, studies Charlton
There's nothing to say
So he extends a hand to Fran
She takes it, rising to her feet
They leave Charlton behind
