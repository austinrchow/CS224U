/ -: man is riding a dressage horse
We can't see his face
Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse's foamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal
We watch him for a while and hear the  of the horse, the dull  of   on the ground, the fast-uttered  of the rider
Then we start to hear a gentle voice: (o
s
): don't know if the story that want to tell you, reflects the truth in every detail
Much of it  only know by hearsay, and a lot of it remains obscure to me even today, and must leave it in darkness
Many of these questions remain without answer
But  believe must tell of the strange events that occurred in our village, because they may cast a new light on some of the goings-on in this country
The rider is the village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual- looking man of around 60, who has finished his dressage session, and now rides toward the open gate beside the , goes through it and into the landscape
We see him in the avenue, now visible behind him, and watch him grow smaller until he vanishes
(o
s
continuing):
Everything began, if  remember correctly, with the doctor's riding accident
After his dressage session in the manor's riding school, he was first headed for his home
2
'  / The garden opens up on the meadows and fields of the flat countryside
The doctor lies beside his wounded horse
His arm is strangely twisted, his broken collarbone has made a bump in the blood-drenched jacket
He yells with pain
After a few moments Xenia, the doctor's 12-year old daughter, comes running out of the house
She rushes up to her father and looks at him, horrified, then at the twitching horse, screams with horror
Her father shouts something to her, she bends over him and tries to raise him to his feet
He screams at her as he's in such pain
She staggers back helplessly, he shouts something to her again, whereupon she runs off
We hear all this from far away, because during the whole scene the narrator has continued his tale: :
to see if any of his patients had arrived
As it entered the property, the horse had tripped over a hardly visible, taut wire that had been strung between two trees
The doctor's fourteen-year old daughter had watched the accident from the window of the house, and was able to inform the woman who was their neighbor, who in turn got the message to the manor house, so that the agonizing doctor could be transported to the hospital of the district capital that was over 30 kilometers away
3
-   / : Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly dressed woman in her late thirties hurries along the village street
:
The neighbor, a single woman of around 40, was the village midwife, who had filled the invaluable position of housekeeper and receptionist for the doctor since the death of his wife in childbirth
After tending to the doctor's two children, she had gone to the school to fetch her own son, Hans
Since she didn't like leaving him alone, she asked me - in return for a small fee - to keep him at the school with me every day, after the other children had finished their lessons
But on the day of the riding accident there was choir practice in the afternoon, so that most of the children were still present
few children pass Emilie and greet her
Then she reaches the school
The door is open
The schoolchildren stream out
We see the schoolteacher, a slight man, hardly 30 years old, talking inside to some of the older students
Martin, a tall gangly boy of around 12, whose elegant clothes make him stand out among the other children coming out of the school, turns to the midwife: : Were you at Xenia's place
He's interrupted by Marie, a delicate, pretty and polite girl of around 13 who has the odd characteristic of already behaving like an adult
: Can't you say hello
Good afternoon, Mrs
Wagner, excuse me
: Hello, Marie
: We're so worried, you know
That's why Martin forgot his manners
: That's all right
: How is the Doctor
: Not very well
: Will he have to stay in the hospital
:  don't know
The midwife is tired of Marie's precocious and endless questions
She peers over the heads of children surrounding them, looking for someone in the classroom
: We'll take care of Xenia
Maybe, we can help her somehow
(distracted): Good idea
It'll cheer her up
She has seen her son, who's coming out of the door: he is a mongoloid boy of 8
His name is Hans
He hesitates, as he sees his mother surrounded by the others
The midwife leaves the group and goes over to him
: Well, did you enjoy the singing
(nods eagerly): It was great
The schoolteacher comes in
: Show your mother what you've been singing
Hans looks doubtfully, first at the schoolteacher, then at his mother, who nods at him encouragingly
After hesitating for a second, he starts to : : La
La
lalala
turns to leave
: Good-bye, Sir
Good-bye, Mrs
Wagner
Her saying good-bye acts as an invitation to the other children: they also  -, though some less distinctively, and follow the girl
with the children
After a short distance, Georg, a strong boy of around 13, shouts, encouraging the others: : Last one is a rotten egg
Then he sprints off
Most of the children follow him
But Marie and some of the other kids merely walk off at a brisk pace
The , that stopped when Georg ran off, now Marie, so that, after a while, the others can be seen again at the far end of the street

'  / Xenia, who is herself in a pitiful condition, holds her four-year-old brother Rudolph on her knees
She rocks him and herself back and forth
As his head is bowed, we can only guess that he's crying
After a while (quietly): If you want,  can cut out some animals for you, as  did last week
No reaction
Would you like that
Rudolph shakes his head faintly
We could color them together, no
No reaction
Or we could cut them from the lovely colored paper
The golden one, do you remember
The one got for Easter
No reaction
Xenia ends up pressing her head helplessly against her little brother's head and mutters: Come on, come on
They remain that way for a while
Finally Xenia raises Rudolph high enough so she can stand up: All right
Now 'm going to make us something to eat
Mrs
Wagner has prepared everything,
(interrupts her softly, his head still bowed): What if he never comes back
(as if she hasn't understood): What
Rudolph merely shakes his bowed head
Xenia kneels down in front of her brother and tries to look into his eyes, but the boy bows his head even deeper
(tenderly): Come on
Don't be stupid
It goes away just like the flu
Remember last winter
You were very sick, weren't you
And then, two weeks later
makes her cock her ear: it's as if something had hit the window in the next room
Xenia stands up and listens
And then, after listening for a while, once again the same noise
: Hush
She goes into the   and, hiding behind the curtain, looks out
Outside, the group of children are gathered around Marie
They look up at the house
They're waiting for something
After a while, Georg, the boy who earlier had urged them to race, throws another stone at the window
Xenia is startled
She hesitates
Finally, she opens the window
: Hi, Xeni
Xenia doesn't answer
After a while (quietly): How are you
Can we help you
5
/ The steward of the estate, a heavy set rustic man in his mid fifties, is talking with the landowner (who's about the same age)
They are standing beside a team of carthorses
With a torch the steward lights up a dead horse that lies on the ground after being towed in by the carthorses
:
its tendons were almost severed
It never would have recovered
The landowner bends down and examines the wounds on the pasterns of the dead animal's front legs
: How did that thing get there
Didn't the Doctor say anything
(with a snicker): He was in no mood to talk, with his collarbone sticking out of his throat
asked his daughter
She has no idea
He always rides through those trees
: Did you look at the wire
: Of course
It's thin, but strong
You can hardly see it, if you don't look closely
: But why was it tied there
(shrugging): And at knee height
don't know
Maybe so the kids could jump over it
No idea
don't think the doctor himself was stupid enough to tie that thing there
: Meaning
: Meaning:  don't know
Anyway it was definitely put there intentionally and looks damn
6
/ Sigi, the 9-year old son of the landowner stands at the window, and watches his father and the steward standing in the torchlight beside the dead horse
In the background  (Piano/violin)
After a short while the two men down in the courtyard separate: the landowner heads to the manor, the steward with the team of carthorses to a farm building
Sigi turns away from the window and looks into the room
There his mother Beatrix, a beautiful, nervous woman in her late thirties, is sitting at a baby grand piano
Beside her stands the tutor, holding a violin tucked under his chin
He looks as if he's in his late twenties, plump and slightly greasy, and obviously infatuated with his beautiful employer, who has just interrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh
: 'm sorry, Madame
You're just playing too well for me
:   Stop  apologizing   and  concentrate
That'll be more helpful for both of us
: To tell the truth: You're just playing too fast for me
'm not Paganini
Beatrix looks up at him with a quick amused smile, then turns back the pages of her sheet music
: Well, let's start all over again at the letter
The tutor does the same, they glance at each other and start again
Sigi watches them from the window, then he saunters in, stops some distance away and watches
Then he saunters away again
Suddenly, Beatrix stops playing again
: Listen, darling
If you like the music, then sit down beside me and turn the pages of the sheet music
But if you're bored, go up to your room and at least stay out of my sight
It makes me nervous if you're constantly sauntering around in front of me
Sigi bows his head ashamed, but doesn't move
(turning to the tutor): By the way, what time is it
Where is the girl
The tutor pulls out his pocket watch
: She's with the twins,  presume
Twenty to nine
: Twenty to nine
(turning to Sigi): You should have been in bed long ago
(to the tutor): Has he done his homework
: Of course, Madame
: All right
(to Sigi): Well, do you want to turn the pages for me or not
Sigi nods
: Then come here
With a little caustic smile, she taps beside her on the piano bench
Sigi comes over sits down beside her and looks at the sheet music
Beatrix turns the pages back
(to the tutor): All right, here we go again: the letter
Try to play a bit faster
Or else  might as well play with the village schoolteacher
They  again
Sigi reads the music with her, then turns the page

/ Marie and Martin come through the door and stand in front of it
At the dinner table, the pastor (in his mid-forties) sits with his back to the door
In front of him, at the other end of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman in her late forties
On the sides of the table sit the children: Anton (11), Magdalena (10), Katharina (9) and Florian (7)
Two other places are empty
The table is set for 8 people, but the plates are empty
(quietly): Please forgive us
(following her lead): Please forgive us
Then the pastor speaks very quietly, without turning to the two children: : There's no question of forgiving
You haven't offended me
It's your mother and your brothers and sisters that you have frightened away and offended
Ask them for forgiveness
You amaze me
didn't know that the two oldest and therefore most reasonable of my children wouldn't mind frightening their mother and brothers and sisters to death
He turns around toward the two children: Are you now grown up enough to live on your own
Are you
Do you want to leave home and start a life of your own
So you can come and go as you please, and nobody gets in your way
Is that what you want
The two remain silent, their heads bowed
The pastor turns his back to them again, and faces the table
Nobody at this table has eaten tonight
When it grew dark, and you hadn't returned, your mother went all over the village in tears, looking for you
Do you really think we could've enjoyed our meal, if we feared something had happened to you
Do you think we can enjoy our meal now, when you've come back and dish up lies as an excuse
don't know what's worse: your absence or your coming back
()
Tonight we shall all go to bed hungry
He stands up, followed by the mother and the children who were sitting at the table
Again he turns to the two wrongdoers: : You probably agree with me, that cannot leave your offense unpunished, if we want keep living in mutual respect
So, tomorrow evening at this hour,  shall give each of you 10 strokes of the cane
Until then, you have time to ponder over your offense
Do you agree with me
and : Yes, Father
: All right then
Go to bed now, all of you
The children who were sitting at the table go first to their mother, then to their father
They kiss their hands and leave the room
As Marie and Martin want to do the same, the father says :  refuse to be touched by you
Your mother and  will sleep poorly because we know have to hurt you tomorrow, and because it will more painful to us than the strokes will be painful to you
Leave us alone and go to bed
As the two children are about to leave the room, he says : When you were small, your mother once in a while would tie a ribbon in your hair or around your arm
Its white color was to remind you of innocence and purity
thought that at your age you were well-mannered enough to get by without such reminders
was wrong
Tomorrow, once you've been purified by your punishment, your mother will tie such a ribbon on you again, and you'll wear it until your behavior shows us that we can trust you again

'  / : one of the trees to which the wire was tied that tripped up the doctor's horse
policeman is looking for clues
With him are Xenia, Rudolph, the midwife and her son Hans
The    two  boys   don't  show   much  interest  in   the investigation
They run after each other in the garden and the neighboring fields
Hans especially seems enjoy this, and is shrieking with delight
: Where is the wire now
The midwife looks at Xenia, who shrugs her shoulders
: Then who took it away
:  don't know
: You weren't here
Xenia, uncertain, looks at the midwife
:   Did   you   accompany   your   father
To town
: No
: That means you were here
:  was in school
Today
: And when you left for school, the wire was still here
:  didn't check
The policeman turns to the midwife: : And when did you come
: At noon
make lunch for the Doctor and the kids
Since the death of the Doctor's wife, 've been helping him out
: Since when
10 : It's been 4 years
Since the birth of little Rudolph
'm the midwife here
We often work together
: But you didn't see anything
: No
: Do you have any idea how long the wire had been there
: 'd never seen it before
(angrily): Let me get this straight: Nobody saw the thing before, nobody saw it afterwards
It wound itself around the two trees all alone, and made itself vanish after the doctor's fall
Right
Neither the midwife nor Xenia know what to answer
At that moment Hans comes running in from the field, excited: : Mother
Look
Look
come
(reluctantly): What's happening
: People
Lots of people
Come
(to the policeman): Sorry
Indeed, as the midwife sets outs for the field, a group of people hurry along the path bordering the doctor's property, and cross our
They carry a body on a makeshift stretcher
The policeman and Xenia follow the midwife
The group vanishes as quickly as it appeared behind the surrounding bushes
As the group was approaching, we have been hearing : The day following the doctor's riding accident not only brought no solution to the question of who'd done it, but a second, far more tragic incident almost made people forget the misfortune of the previous day: the wife of a tenant farmer died in a work-accident
9
/ It's very dark in the low-ceilinged room
Small windows
couple of women in peasant dresses take care of the dead woman, who's been laid out on the bed
The women remove her clothes and wash her
: The woman, who because of an injured arm could only do light work, had been dispensed 11 by the steward from harvesting chores, and was assigned to easier work in the sawmill
Everything happens very silently
An elderly woman, a midwife specialized in bathing, takes care of the proceedings
Every time the door is opened, one hears the mutterings of the people waiting outside
Soiled water is carried out, new underwear brought in, and the women start to clothe the naked corpse again
Outside, the sounds of excited  are getting louder
Then the door opens and the farmer (around fifty) enters the room
The old midwife turns around angrily: -: You stay outside
haven't yet
(quietly): Get out
Reluctantly, the old midwife abandons her half completed work, not without having spread the dress she had draped over the still half-naked body of the dead woman
The other women follow her, embarrassed
Once the door has closed behind them, the farmer just stands there
Only after a long while does he move forward and sit beside his dead wife
He remains seated, motionless
For a very long time
He only tugs once at the dress draped over the half-naked body, as if he wanted to cover a patch of nudity
Then he just sits there again in the dark room, and only his halting breath lets us know that any moment he may cry
10
/ With his net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher is landing a fish
: On the same day,  had a strange encounter: the weather was beautiful and hot, so decided to try and improve my meager menu with some brown trout, which are plentiful in the river
The landowner apparently liked me, and allowed me to fish
Suddenly, the schoolteacher stops dead: like a tightrope walker Martin is walking along on the top of the wall of the bridge, thirty feet above the riverbed
(shouts, fearful): Martin
The boy doesn't seem to hear him and keeps up his balancing act
(louder): Martin
The boy keeps at it
12 The schoolteacher quickly wades ashore, throws his fishing rod and the net and the wriggling fish on the gravel beside the river and climbs up the river bank
When he gets on top, he sees the boy balancing himself at the other end of the bridge
: Martin, be careful
The boy takes a few more steps, then reaches the end of the wall and jumps down onto the bridge
Hesitatingly, he turns to the schoolteacher, who comes toward him
: Are you completely insane
Do you want to break your neck
(his head bowed): Hello, sir
The schoolteacher has reached him
: What's happening
Are you mad
Don't you know how high that is
The boy remains silent, keeping his head bent down
: Didn't you hear me
shouted to you
(after a short silence): Yes,  did
: Well
The boy remains silent
: Well
Keeping his head bowed, the boy shrugs a little
The schoolteacher, realizing that this won't get him any further, tries again, talking in a gentle voice: : You saw me down there and wanted to impress me
The boy shakes his head
: Well, why didn't you
(interrupting  him)   gave  God  an opportunity to kill me
He didn't do it
That means, he's pleased with me
(staggered): What are you saying
: He doesn't want me to die
(bewildered):   Who
Who   doesn't want you to die
: God
Pause
: Why would God want you to die
The boy stops answering, his head bowed again
The schoolteacher remains silent and looks at him for a while
Then, he adds softly: 13 Promise me never to do such nonsense again
All right
Look at me
Martin looks up reluctantly
Promise it to me
Martin remains silent
He doesn't dare look down, and instead looks past the schoolteacher
You don't trust me, don't you
(polite, emotionless): Yes,  do, Sir
The schoolteacher realizes that there's no use in talking any further
(concluding): All right
Go home now
'll be coming tomorrow for the piano lesson
'll talk to your father then
Martin turns and faces the schoolteacher, and says in such a pleading voice that it startles him: : Please, don't tell him
Please, sir, don't
: Why
Martin just looks pleadingly at the schoolteacher and shakes his head, as if to stress his request
11
/ Franz, the farmer eldest son, is searching for evidence of his mother's accident
He is accompanied by the neighbor's son Matti, a slight boy of around 16
The sawmill is a ramshackle wooden building beside the river
Matti, who obviously was there when the accident happened, shows Franz the place
: There
Be careful
Everything's rotten here
Franz moves slowly forward
He looks down at the lower floor
Immediately below: the saw
Franz steps back carefully and turns to Matti: : Who made her climb up here
:  haven't a clue
They told us to collect all the lose ends
She just climbed up there
: She could never stand heights
It made her dizzy
Who assigned you to this job
(uneasy): You know how it works
The sawmill needed to be cleaned up, and the foremen pick the weaker harvesters 14 : Who picked her
12
/ The schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish that he caught
: It was on my way home after the strange encounter with Martin that  met Eva for the first time
Eva (18), a redhead, somewhat chubby, but pretty girl, crosses him way on her bicycle
big bag is strapped to the baggage carrier
: Hello
(passing by): Hello
The schoolteacher stops, turns to the girl: (hesitantly): Excuse me
(Off): Yes
(embarrassed):  Excuse   me   for accosting you this way
You're the new nanny of the Baron's children, aren't you
We hear the bicycle stopping
(o
s
): Why
The schoolteacher has turned around and now moves toward the girl
: They say you're from Oberdorf
: Who says that
: Folks around here
: Oh
So what
: Nothing
don't know
Sorry
'm the schoolteacher here
just thought don't know (he laughs embarrassed): when  saw you,  thought
'm from Grundbach
'm the tailor's son
:  know
(confused): What
: The Baroness already told me
: What did she tell you
15 : That the schoolteacher is from the village next to mine
(laughs): Oh,  see
Yes
Well
thought
(he points at the bag on the baggage carrier): You look as if you're going there
: Where
: Back home
To Oberdorf
(doesn't understand what he's referring to): Yes
: Are you going there
: Yes,  am
(doesn't know what to say): Well, thought
since you'll cycle through our village
you might perhaps
(he's thinking, looks down and sees the fish):
say hello to my father and (laughing at his own idea, he holds up a fish) bring him one of the fishes
They're fresh
just caught them
Now Eva laughs too
: What
(smiling as if to apologize): Well
'm sure he'd be delighted
Especially as it's the start of the weekend
She nods at the fish
The absurdity of the suggestion amuses her
At the same time she doesn't really know how to behave
: Well, how
The schoolteacher holds up the fish, laughs, as if he himself doesn't how he got this idea
:         don't    know    either
Unfortunately,  have nothing to wrap them in
The both laugh
Pause
Then the girl points at the bag on the baggage carrier of her bicycle and says regretfully: : Neither have
Unfortunately
The schoolteacher has a new "idea ": ("amused"):  could give you some fishing line, to tie them up
(equally amused): There on the bicycle
The schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile ("why not")
:  don't think that's a very good idea
16 :    You're   right
It   was   just   an idea
: Yes
Embarrassed pause
Then : Is that your bicycle
("What an idea
"): No
It belongs to the estate
:  see
Pause
: Is this your first day off
(rather suspicious because all this is too intimate for her): Yes
: Well, you're         probably   looking forward to being at home
: Yes,  am
:  can imagine
Pause
Then says (putting the pedals and handlebar in a "ready to leave" position): Well
've still a long way to go
(stepping back): Of course
Well, good-bye
: Good-bye
She's about to ride off
(with a smile): If you cycle through Grundbach and see my father, at least say hello to him from me
:  don't know your father
: That's true
They look at each other for a while and then Eva rides off
The   her
Eva and the bicycle are tottering a bit
The girl looks around and shouts, laughing: :  only learned to ride a bicycle today
(now o
s
, also shouting): Well, you're doing fine
But be careful
As she picks up speed, Eva rides better and soon is just a speck on the dusty country road

'  / It's still too early to switch on the light
Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in the kitchen, eating
For quite a while
Suddenly : The woman today
What was wrong with her
(eating): Which woman
Oh,  see
She was dead
Pause
Then : What's that
: What
: Dead
Xenia looks up from her meal
: What's dead
My God, that's when someone doesn't live anymore
When he's stopped living
Then : When does one stop living
Xenia looks up from her meal again
Now she tries to talk more seriously to her brother because she understands that these questions matter to him
But she's also feeling uneasy and put on
: When you're too old or very ill
: And the woman
: She had an accident
: An accident
: Yes
That's when you hurt yourself very badly
: Like Dad
: Yes, but much worse than that
So bad, that your body can't take it anymore
Another : Then : And then you're dead
: Yes
But   most   people   don't   have   an accident
: That means they don't need to die
: No, they die much later
: When
: Later, when they're very old
Long
18 : Do all people die
: Yes
: All of them, really
: Yes, everyone dies
: But not you, Xeni
: Me too
Everyone
: But not Dad
: Dad too
: Me too
: You too
But not before a very very long time
All of us, only in a very long time
: And you can't do anything against it
It has to happen
: It has to happen
But not now, not for a very long time
Long
Then : And Mom
She didn't go on a trip
: Is she dead too
: Yes
She's dead too
But that was a long time ago
Both remain
In the meantime it has grown dark in the kitchen
Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia
The plate shatters on the floor
At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed
Then she starts to sob, but tries to hide it from her brother
14
/ While we hear the  of the punishment and the children being beaten,  the strokes with increasing  and stifled , we see ( ) the faces of the other brothers and sisters
Some have turned away their faces, and others start to cry with pity and fear
Finally both have received their 10 strokes
: The pastor
He is breathless and beads of sweat on his forehead
: There
19 He hands Martin the cane
: Martin
Here, take the cane and put it back in its place
As Martin is about to go, his father goes on: But first you can thank me for trying to protect you from any further misconduct
: Marie
You know how much  love you and how much it hurts me to inflict such pain on you
Today was a very sad day in my life, and  hope for all of us that it doesn't happen again
: Both kiss their father's hand
: The pastor
(smiles): And now hug me
There's nothing we have to forgive each other anymore
love you with all my heart
He first hugs Marie who, her face still wet with tears, tries a forced smile and then Martin
Then, the pastor turns to his wife: : Now the ribbon, Anna
Anna goes toward the two children, tying a white ribbon around Martin's upper arm and another in Marie's hair
: This will remain on you until we're all sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts and manners
You're well aware, this year you will receive Christ's body in the form of bread and wine
Until then, strive to be free of sinful thoughts
Now let's eat
Martin carries the cane out of the room
The pastor and the other children sit around the table
Marie leaves the room with her mother
After all the others have sat down and put their plates back where they were before the punishment, the two come back with two soup bowls and put them on the table
Martin has also come back and sits down at his place beside his father
The pastor folds his hands in prayer, the others follow suit
(very friendly): Marie, would you say grace today
(smiling eagerly): With pleasure, father
She bows her head, so do the others
: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest And bless what you've given to us
: Amen
Blessed be this meal
: Blessed be this meal
20 The mother and Marie open the soup tureens and hand out the soup
Then they eat
15
/ The body of the farmer's wife has been laid out
The candles to its left and right are almost burnt out
Its very quiet
Little five-year old Sepp sneaks into the room, bare- foot and wearing a shirt
He hesitates
Then, slowly and carefully, he comes over to his dead mother
He ends up standing beside the bed
The face of the dead woman is covered with a white handkerchief
Sepp is very frightened
He makes several attempts before he dares to lift the handkerchief
Then he watches her, breathless, his eyes and mouth wide open
Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back
He turns around: his 14-year old brother Paul is sitting on a bench against the wall
He too only wears a shirt
(surprised, with a whispering voice): Pauli
Paul doesn't say a word
Sepp doesn't know what to do
He looks at his mother again, then again at his brother
He goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench
Like birds in a cage, they remain seated in the dark
Very close together

'
/ The steward and his children Liesl (15), Georg and Ferdinand (10)] are waiting for something
Then the door opens and the midwife comes out
She tells them to come into the other room
: That night, the wife of the steward gave birth to her fourth and last child at the age of 42
The children want to follow their father
At least Liesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain, can't wait to go in
But the midwife tells them to be patient, and only the father is let through
(burning with curiosity): What is it
(smiling): Well, what do you think
(shakes   her   head   impatiently):      don't know
: It's a boy
: Oh God
21 : What do you mean
Don't you want a brother
: Pff
: You're lucky your father can't hear you
Instead of the father, Georg hits his brother on the back of the head
They quarrel
: Stop that
She steps in and distributes a few smacks
Liesl runs out of the room howling
: You should be ashamed
(Suddenly, as if he'd become another person): Sorry
The midwife looks at him, confused
17
/ The farmer, Franz and Paul leave the farm, they go to work
The two oldest carry scythes
In the background vast fields of crops
The three walk hurriedly
After a while (hesitantly): Father,  have to tell you something
: What is it
:  went to the sawmill
The farmer keeps on walking as if he hasn't heard
Franz looks at him from the side
For a long moment he remains silent, while all three keep walking
Then, Franz goes on softly: The floor, on the first level, where mother worked, was totally rotten
They keep on walking
The steward, who sent her there, must have known it
And the landowner too
The farmer remains silent
They keep walking
Father
(hostile): What do you want
(doesn't understand his father's refusal): They sent her there knowing it was dangerous
The farmer stops, turns to Franz: (aggressive): What are you getting at
(doesn't understand): But
22 (furious, but with forced calm): Do you want me to sue the Baron
Or kill the steward
:
: Go and cut off his head of with your scythe
Sure, that'll bring your mother back to life
He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking
The others follow
After a few steps (softly):  think our father loved our mother
Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost crying with fury and despair: : Shut up
: Paul
He was listening carefully the whole time
He looks at the father
Then, lowers his eyes
: After these two days in July, life in the village returned to what it had always been
18
/
// a) Harvesting
Even teenagers and children are used to tie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs
:
The daily harvesting drove the people almost to exhaustion
Most of the children were busy helping their parents
b) The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house
quarrel between her retarded son and the 4-year old Rudolph (that we barely can follow due to the Narrator's voice, o
s
) is settled by the midwife in favor of her son
For the time being, the doctor remained in the hospital
In the meantime the midwife catered the basic needs of Xenia and Rudolph, his two children
After the burial of the farmer's wife, that was attended by the whole village, the two accidents were soon forgotten
19
/ :
until the harvest festival at the end of the summer brought the whole village 23 together again, first in a festive hustle and bustle, and then in horror and perplexity
The courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sunday best:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   the village, children and teenagers
dance hall has been set up
On it we see the landowner, the steward and the pastor with their families
couple of younger women, a delegation of the harvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown to the landowner
:
with our songs and our prayers We've gathered the rye and given that crown to your lordship
It is not big, it is not small, But pretty, nice and fine
Not with thistles or thorns is it made, but with pure grain
Had our lordship sowed more, The men would've scythed more And we girls gathered more
We girls have gathered the grain, Over mountains and valleys, Over thistles and thorn, Over the fields of our lordship
wish our lordship a happy life, As many years as there's sand on the beach As many years as there are drops in the rain So much may our lordship be blessed
And as a reward to be of good cheer We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer, And if we could have a fried goose perchance Then we'll all be ready to dance
During the poem, the camera has shown all those we have met until now
They have all ( except for the Doctor, the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast
While all the folks present  and , the maid, with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown to the Baron
The village band plays a fanfare
As soon as the hullabaloo has died down (answering): My thanks to all of you
Thank you very much
You have worked well and the heavens were merciful, and now the barns are full
Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you won't starve today
He points to the open barn, where food and beer are waiting
In front of the barn are tables with long benches
: Enjoy your meal
Eat and drink as much as you wish
You deserve it
24 Again the people  and
Then, the  starts and the feast is off and running
20
/ The vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house
In the distance we hear the  from the feast
Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate in the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages and slices them all off with his scythe
The whole scene looks like a mass execution
21
/ The party is in full swing: people dance and shout, children run around, young men quarrel and show off in front of the young girls
Older women are stand around in groups, gossiping
Some farmers are gathered around the landowner  he is friendly with them, but we don't understand what they're talking about
His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place in this crowd
She's talking to the schoolteacher
:
didn't you promise us a little chorale sung by your proteges
: You have to talk to the pastor, Baroness
We're still busy studying the choir pieces for the confirmation feast
(amused): But that's in spring, my dear
This is the start of autumn
(smiles, embarrassed):  know, but unfortunately not all of our little singers are very musical
'm sorry if
22
/ quieter part of the estate
Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers of the landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs
Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful bustle
Sitting beside her, turning her back to the manor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeeding her baby
The steward separates from a group of men and comes over to the two women
As he comes over, he shouts to them: 25 : Well, you two "mothers"
Don't you want to be part of the festivities
Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how to react to the "mother joke"
But the slightly naive wife of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her husband cracks
She turns halfway to him and says: : It's so nice here in the shade
In the meantime the steward has come over
He's smoking a pipe
(in excellent mood): Well, our son seems to be enjoying that, right
: Yes
:  can imagine
Who wouldn't like that
(rebuking him gently): Georg
(to Eva): What about you
Don't you get bored taking care of other people's children, with all the young lads over there
(uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, love to be with the children
He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chair beside Eva: How old are you anyway
: Eighteen, Sir
: Eighteen
And you want me to believe you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your arms than your true love
(good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her alone
: 'm not doing her any harm
Can you get us something to eat, Emma
(stands up, to Emma): If you mind the children for a moment, 'll get us something
(stands up too): Don't worry, princess, 'm going
Not to panic
23
/ bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both wearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other 26 children, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg, Ferdinand and Sigi
They leave the manor and head toward the fields
As they pass by the vegetable garden, they notice the sliced off cabbages and stop
Some laugh at it, others are unsettled
Most of the children keep run on out into the open fields
24
/ Farmhands and tenant farmers are eating at the tables
One of them tells a story, that we only partially understand because of all the noise: :
so the guy really tried to steal the rooster from the steeple
He was already completely pickled, but even then they couldn't stop him
huge, massive guy, you see
So they just let him go, saying to themselves: if he falls down, he falls down, that's it
But he didn't get much farther than the first window, that's where the trellis ends, see
And even with all his strength, he couldn't hoist himself up on the lightning rod
So the guy stands up there in the window
And what do you think that idiot does: he starts to crow
He crows, shouting: 'm the rooster on the steeple
You'll never catch me
He made such a commotion that little by little the people in the neighborhood started to wake up
At the same time someone else starts to shout, causing the others to join in: and : More beer, more beer, or 'll fall down, hurray
More beer, more beer, or 'll fall down
Has the landlord hung himself, that he doesn't serve me any beer
More beer, more beer, or 'll fall down
Laughter
Leni, Franz's sister, and another farmgirl do their best to cater to the drinker's thirst as fast as possible
The two young women try to keep their spirits up, but the guest's indelicate jokes and rude gestures don't make it easy
: 'm coming
haven't got a magic wand
(with a grin): Shall  help you, Leni
'd love to help you
(also grinning): What do you want to help her with
: All over
Front and backside
27 More
(to Leni): Are you as slow with the Baron
: Come on, leave her alone : You like her that much
Go and help her
(sitting beside the second, almost in a whisper): Don't you know: it was her mother who had that accident
At the same time a boy of ten comes over to the first farmer and butts in to his story: : Father, they cut off the Baron's cabbages
: What's that
(grin): They cut off the Baron's cabbages
Leni, who's just putting some glasses with beer on the table, glares at the boy, flabbergasted
25
/ On the dance floor, Eva and the schoolteacher try to dance
Neither is very talented
Eva keeps looking at her feet and smiles, embarrassed
:  never learned it
(also with a smile): Neither did You just have to count out loud
One
Two
Three
One
Two
Three
One
Their steps are far too big
They look clumsy and embarrassed, but happy
After a few spins : Aren't you afraid your students might laugh at you, when they see you dancing with me that way, sir
(laughs): They'd better not
And stop being so formal with me
'm not that old, am
Eva laughs, embarrassed and looks down
: One

: You see: we're getting better
: Well
: Stop looking at your feet
28 She lifts her head, looks at him and
stumbles
They laugh and start again
26
/ of the village band can be heard coming from the manor
The Baroness reaches the vegetable garden, followed by the pastor's wife, the tutor and some "ladies" from the village
Behind the fence, among the "beheaded" cabbages are the Baron, the steward and some farmers
couple of curious onlookers have gathered by the fence
Mutters, and now and then laughter
The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, points to the "heads" lying around him
: Quite a job, isn't it
The Baroness looks at the extent of the disaster
Then says, revolted: : This is disgusting
The steward comes over to them and, with a little grin, comments on the sensitivity of his masters: : It used to be an old custom (he quotes): "Now that the harvesting's done, "It's time to pay us, every one, "Any miser who leaves us in a rut, "He shall have his cabbage cut
The Baroness, who doesn't think the symbolic character of the deed is funny at all, looks briefly at him and then back again at the cabbage cemetery
Suddenly, she turns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor
She makes her way through the bystanders, who step aside to let her through
27
/ The pastor works at his desk
Suddenly a  on the door (looking up): Come in Florian comes hesitantly through the door
: What do you want
(shy, almost frightened): 'd like to ask you something, Father
: Yes
29 The boy comes over to the desk, opens a few buttons of his shirt and then seizes something inside
In the open shirt we see the head of a little bird
: So what
:  have found it
It's wounded
Short
: What do you want
(pleadingly): May  keep it
Short pause
The pastor is moved by the request of his youngest    son,  but   manages  to   hide   his emotion skillfully
: How do you plan to do that
: We'll heal it
(softly): And when it's healed
Florian looks at him with round eyes, he doesn't know what to answer
The pastor continues: Don't you think, you'll be attached to it then
Will you let it fly away
Florian thinks, then nods toward a cage behind the desk
: "Pipsi" also lives in a cage
The pastor looks at the cage shortly, hides a smile and turns to Florian again: : Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity
(nodding at Florian's bird): This one is used to living in freedom
Florian doesn't know what to answer
So he merely looks at his father with pleading eyes
(repeats): Will you set him free, as soon he's healed
Florian, looks down and nods with a heavy heart
: Have you already asked Mother
Florian nods eagerly
: And
What did she say
: She said, it was for Father to decide
(smiling faintly): That's what she said
Florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyes that are pleading with expectation
: You'll really to take care of it
That's a heavy responsibility
You know that, don't you
Sensing that his father is not quite against it, Florian nods eagerly
30 : Well
You're its father and mother now
Florian nods yet more eagerly, if that's possible
The pastor finds it difficult not to smile: We'll have to find a cage for your patient
Florian can hardly believe it
He'd like to fling his arms around his father's neck, but doesn't dare
So he just keeps standing there, beaming
: Thanks, Father
28
/ Leni comes along the track, excited
She`s almost running
She reaches the farm and disappears inside
29
/ The family is eating
They're in working clothes, since they didn't attend the Thanksgiving feast
Only Leni, who visibly just came into the room, is still wearing the clothes she wore at the feast
She's out of breath and very excited
The farmer looks very concerned
(to Franz): Is that true
(hostile, keeps on eating):  don't know nothing
(threatening): Is  that - true
(looks at him, aggressively): Nothing is true
And even if it was true, so what
Serves him right, that miser
(trying to control himself): Did you do it, or did you not do it
Franz doesn't answer and keeps on eating
: It seems somebody saw you
For a moment Franz remains calm, then he bursts out: (to Leni): So what
They should be glad that they still have their own heads
(to the farmer) And  want you to know this, Father: 'm proud of it
The father responds to this by slapping his face hard
Franz jumps up
(orders Franz without looking at him): Sit down
For a moment, we don't know how Franz will behave
Sitting on the corner bench, he's jammed between his 31 father and his brothers and sisters, who stare at the table, embarrassed
Only Paul, who sits opposite his brother, looks up at him
Franz finally sits down again
The farmer stares at his plate, tries to speak softly, which is obviously difficult for him, to judge by the sound of his voice
: What did you intend to do
As Franz doesn't answer, he looks up, right into Franz's face, who avoids his father's eyes
: Well
: Tell me
Franz keeps on glaring straight ahead
The farmer adopts a gentler tone
Come on
Tell me: (who   can   hardly   speak):   You   know   why, Father
(after a pause): Because of your mother
Because you feel they're responsible for her death
Is that it
What do you think
That 'm not man enough to settle this
It's that what you think
Franz keeps on glaring, remaining silent
The father tries to stay calm, staring straight ahead
He takes a spoon and eats twice from the milk soup
He puts down the spoon, and looks at Franz again
Did you ever think of what your behavior can mean for the whole family
If Leni loses her job, which enables us to keep our heads above water for the whole year
What if we can't work there anymore during the summer
Franz makes an impatient movement, takes raises            his spoon and wants to go on eating
The farmer grabs          his arm and slams it down
The two stare at each other
For a moment, we don't know what will happen
Then             the farmer goes on: You want to marry and take over the farm in two years
Yes
And how will you feed them all (he points with his head at the other children) without the help of the manor, tell me
Franz turns his head away
He disagrees, but does not know what to answer
The farmer goes on: 32 And how do you know they're responsible
Franz turns to him abruptly: : And how do you know they're innocent
The farmer looks at Franz with round eyes
long follows
Then the says (quietly):  don't know
And after another
: But  don't know the opposite either
30
/ The Baron stands at the bottom and shouts up at the tutor who's standing on the stairs: :
What do you mean "not there"
(sheepish):   He
disappeared
`ve already looked everywhere
can't find him
: Nonsense
He can't have vanished     into thin air
When did you see him last
(as above): Around 2 o'clock
(his anger mounting): Around two
Do you know what time it is
(guiltily):  know, Sir
Furious, the landowner turns away from the nincompoop, pensive
Then he turns to the  again: : What does my wife say, doesn't she have any clue
: Madame sent me to you,     Baron
She is beside herself with fear
(wryly):  can imagine
(looks up to the tutor): You're an idiot, Huber
Why do you think you're here
To take care of a single child
Is that such a hard task
(softly): 'm awfully sorry, Baron
: You're even too stupid for that
The Baron turns away and heads for the door
Then he turns around again and asks: 33 : Where did you see my son for the last time
: Outside, in the courtyard
He said, he was going to play with the other children
: Where
: That he didn't say
: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything either
: After that business with the cabbage heads, Madame retired to her room
She was indisposed
(sarcastically): Indisposed
: Yes
She had a terrible migraine attack
(almost to himself): My God, this place is a zoo
He turns away and goes out into the courtyard
The tutor follow him with his eyes
He feels he's being badly treated and hates the Baron for his insults
Finally he goes back up the stairs
31
/ The torches of the feast have almost burned out
Here and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate the cleaning up
Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast courtyard
Half way across he screams: : Braker
The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the barn
He walks toward the Baron
Have you seen my son
(surprised): No
(quietly): Could you please ask your boys
Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole bunch of kids
:    Immediately
(shouting    to   the farmhands): When you're finished with the cleaning up, wait for me
There's still a job to do
Get some fresh torches and lanterns
: In the meantime 'll go round up the men
34 The steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   the outbuildings
There, he switches on the
: The steward's children said, they had seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had gone off with other kids, and that they didn't pay much attention to it
32
// Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches
The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns the areas to be searched
Most of this is drowned out by the narrator's voice
:
The search began shortly after midnight
Before, the Baron had ridden to the Rectory
But there he found out nothing new from the children who had been specially woken up
: , ,
The search
The searchers, who were tired and some of whom were still drunk, were divided into two groups: one group started to search all the buildings on the estate, one by one, while the others combed the surrounding areas
It was around half past two, when some members of the search party had already preferred to lie down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded again, calling the men back to the courtyard
The men come in with a stretcher
They had found Sigi
He had been tied up in the old sawmill, upside down
His trousers had been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding from cane strokes
He seemed to be in a state of shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher, lying on his belly
33
/ The room is packed
The whole village is gathered
35 : The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end of the service, asked the pastor if he could say a few words: : You all know now what was done to my son Siegmund
Policemen from the district town were here this week
They questioned many of you
But to no avail
First  thought that the people who tortured my child were the same people who cut off my family's "cabbage heads"
Unrest in the attendance
because they wanted to "get even"
Get even for what
Because their mother had died while she was working in the sawmill, and it was supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd assertion
The farmer, Leni and the other children are there, with the exception of Franz
The unrest grows
At least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the motive for his "mowing prowess", when the policemen arrested him
have always supported the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't always expect people to be grateful
That's a matter of character
The farmer wants to leave the church
: Don't run away, Felder
It's your honor want to salvage
It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder has been boasting of his feat in front of his fiancee
Then the coward that he is, hid among his family, and so he didn't have time to torture my son
And there's one thing  know for sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off his tongue, than cover for his wayward son
May remind you something what most of you have already forgotten
Almost two months ago, the doctor had a riding accident and he has still not returned from the hospital
This accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down
And in that case too, nobody knows anything, saw anything or heard anything
36 Disconcerted  among the attendance
We all know that the people responsible for the terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those suffered by the doctor are sitting here among us, in this room
won't tolerate that crimes of this nature go unpunished
don't wish something similar to happen to any of your children
That's why  call upon you all to help me find the culprit or the culprits
Ask questions, keep your ears open, be watchful
If we fail to find out the truth, the peace within our community will be gone
Thank you, pastor
The pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp, that the narrator's voice drowns out
The people file out of the church, quietly and slowly, but talking worriedly to each other
: The landowner's speech frightened the people
Most knew about the incident at the Thanksgiving feast
But the majority didn't know exactly what had happened, and in the end they didn't care
The Baron was not really popular among the people, but he was respected as a powerful social figure, as well as the employer of nearly the whole village
34
/ The people are leaving the church, groups are forming
As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they're shunned
Gauntlet down the village street
The  follows
:
His threat about loosing the peace of the community couldn't mean anything good
At the same time the mysterious character of what were obviously criminal deeds fed the mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since time immemorial
35
/ The empty classroom
On the harmonium: a petroleum lamp
The schoolteacher is
After a while, someone knocks at the door
The schoolteacher stops
(surprised): Come in
37 The door opens hesitantly
In the dark: Eva (hardly recognizable because she's so far from the lamp)
(surprised and glad): Eva
(hardly understandable): May  come in
The Schoolteacher stands up, goes toward and, laughing with surprise, says to her
: What a question
Of course
Come in
What happened
Eva enters the room and closes the door behind her
She's carrying a suitcase
Shyly she looks around and doesn't say a word
:   Come   over   here
It's   so   dark
Come on
He moves toward the lamp and waits half-way because she doesn't follow
: What's going on
: They fired me
(startled): What do you mean
She shrugs her shoulders
: Nothing
They just threw me out (pause, then) The tutor has also been fired
Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, she bursts into floods of tears
At the same time she turns away from the schoolteacher
He goes over to her, and stops in front of her, but is too shy to touch her
Suddenly she turns to him again and says, sobbing: don't know where to go
can't go back home in the middle of the night
'm afraid to walk on the road all alone
(calming her down): Don't worry
Try to calm down
There's nothing to worry about
38 (sobbing, childish): There is
(with a calming smile): Come here and sit down
Please calm down and then tell me what happened
All right
She's sits down on the school bench beside her
The schoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her: Well
It takes her time to calm down
What happened
Slowly she manages to calm down, breathes deeply a few times
The schoolteacher is visibly charmed by her childish despair
: The son of the Baron isn't at all well
His parents are angry and desperate
Now they say that it's the tutor's and my fault, because we didn't pay enough attention to him
But 'm only there for the twins
She starts to sob again: 've always taken care of them very well
When you and  were dancing, the Baroness had given me permission
haven't done anything wrong, really
:  know, come on
Stop crying
: Where shall  go now
We need the money was earning here
:   You'll  find   something  else
Besides, you know very well that the Baron is quick-tempered
With him, nothing is ever as bad as it seems
(fiercely shaking her head):No, no, that's all over now,  know it
The Baroness doesn't want to see anyone
She wants to take the children with her to town or to her parent's estate   don't know exactly
39 : (after a pause): 'll try to talk to her
while back, we played music together
(with a smile): Unfortunately,  wasn't very good
Now she's got the tutor, he plays better
As far as  know, he's been studying music in town
(forgetting her grief a bit): He doesn't play that well
: That's true
(after a pause, serious again): Who could have done such things
: What
: To beat a child that way
:  don't know
Long
Then she says softly: : Can  stay here tonight
Don't send me away, sir, please
: How can you think something like that
: 'll just wait for the daylight to come
Here in the classroom
Then 'll leave
Suddenly she starts to cry again: They won't understand this,      at   home
They'll think  did something wrong
Then the : Do you want me to come with you
She stops crying and looks at him, surprised
40 : What did you say
(cheerful):   Tomorrow,   after school
can try to find us a carriage
'll be back by evening
: And why should you do that, Sir
: Stop being so formal
(after a break): Why should you do this
Then the schoolteacher stands up and says: : Come here, 'll play something for you
If you'd like that
She thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly
She follows him, as he goes and settles in front of the harmonium
She sits on a bench nearby
He starts to 36
// The farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not very big
The pigs grunt excitedly because of the disturbance
Suddenly, Franz enters
: Good morning, Father
The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody had come in
Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent
After a while, they've done their work
Ignoring Franz, the farmer goes outside
Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, says to him as he goes out: : 'm back again
They set me free
At this, the farmer stops and turns around
He looks Franz right into the eyes: :  can see that
So what
Franz bows his head
Paul, who has followed his father, out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at his brother
The farmer goes over to the fountain and washes himself
Franz follows him slowly and stops beside his father, who keeps ignoring him
After a while 41 says (softly): Can't you forgive me, Father
The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz: : What do you want me to forgive for
That the estate won't give me any work now
That Leni has been fired in disgrace
That your brothers and sisters soon won't have anything to eat
Is that what you mean
Or is it something else
37
'  / The  follows the carriage in which are Eva and the schoolteacher
: The next day, after school,  went to the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to intercede for Eva's reinstatement
We were told the Baroness had left that morning with her children
Reluctantly, the steward lent me a carriage to take Eva home
An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from the opposite direction
The passengers of the two carriages greet each other
The  follows the Doctor and looses Eva and the schoolteacher
The doctor has one arm in a sling
The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property
The driver helps the doctor get out
Xenia comes running out of the house and greets her father
The driver unloads the luggage
The doctor and Xenia go into the house
Just as we were leaving the village, we met the doctor
few days after the Thanksgiving feast, Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly disappeared
Of course, everybody was terribly upset in view of all the previous occurrences
Finally, he was found walking down the road, scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly toward the town
When he was asked where he was going, he said he wanted to visit his father
Seems he fought tooth and nail against being taken home
Somebody must have told this to the Doctor
Since he was scheduled to be released from medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an end to his stay at the hospital
42 38
'  / (calls several times): Rudi
He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia
Xenia shrugs her shoulders, clueless: : He was in the living room a short time ago
Just as they're about to go to the living room, the driver comes in with the luggage
The Doctor thanks him and pays him
The driver leaves
Xenia has been waiting in the doorway
Now they go together into the There's nobody
They go into the kitchen Nobody
The look under the kitchen table, in the pantry
Nobody
: Rudi
Where are you
Again the The doctor doesn't know whether to be angry or to laugh about the whole matter
He goes to his wardrobe to take his off his jacket
Because of the sling, Xenia has to help him
That's when she notices the toilet
She tells her father with a smile
As Xenia hangs up the doctor's jacket, he goes to the toilet door and tries to open it
It's locked
The Doctor stops in front of it
(quiet): Hello, Rudi
Don't you want to say hello to your father
No
: heard you even wanted to visit me at the hospital
And now you lock yourself in
The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carrying the luggage upstairs
Then he keeps on talking to Rudolph: All right
Then,  don't want to see you either
'm going away now
You can stay in the toilet, if you want
He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits a moment and then leaves the house

' / scene
43 The doctor steps out of the door, and wanders through the garden
He goes over to the trees, where the wire had been strung
He examines the traces of the wire on the bark
He lights a cigar, then looks out at the mowed fields
After a while Xenia comes over to him
He glances at her, then again at the fields
Both remain silent
After a while says:  Everything  is   ready  in   your practice
Mrs
Wagner  prepared   everything yesterday
then : Why do you tell me that
Xenia looks at him, surprised, shrugs her shoulders
:  don't know
just thought you might want to know
: Has she taken good care of you
: Yes
The doctor turns to Xenia: : How old are you now
: Fourteen
The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his head
Again he looks out on the fields
After a while he says: : It's amazing how much you look like your mother
Xenia remains silent
Suddenly she whispers: : Dad
The doctor turns to her
She nods toward the house
The doctor follows her look
Indeed Rudolph, who from here looks even smaller than he really is, has stepped gingerly out of the door
Unsure and undecided, torn between defiance and longing, he's kept one hand on the door handle that he can barely reach

/ The pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind the desk and feeds the animal
As he does it, he talks to 44 Martin, who, the white ribbon still tied around his upper arm, stands in front of the desk
: Your mother and  are deeply worried about you
Think about it
Are you sleeping badly
Are you overtired
(as   if   he   didn't   understand   the question): No
: Do you have problems in school that don't know
(as above): No, Father
The pastor turns shortly around to his son, looks at him, then turns again to the bird
: You probably don't understand why we worry
It comes from a sad experience  want to tell you briefly about: As you know, 'm also acting as pastor for the communities of Birkenbrunn and Hebern
In the latter place, some years ago, a mother came to see me
She had noticed that her son, who was about the same age as you, and had the same symptoms that you've been showing for some time
Although until then the boy had been healthy and active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes, seemed depressed and joyless
The boy had also changed emotionally: before he had been funny, frank, almost naughty, but now he became withdrawn
He tried not to look his parents in the eye, and was caught telling small and even big lies
The pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, and now sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him: That lasted approximately half a year
Then everything went very fast: he lost his appetite, couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on the brownish color of the rings under his eyes, his hands began to shake, his memory stated to fail him, he was covered with numerous small pustules, first on his face, then on his whole body and finally he died
The body, which blessed, looked like the body of an old man
The pastor watches Martin: : Do you understand now why 'm worried
Martin reacts with a timid nod of his head
: So, according to you: what caused these changes that led to the miserable end of this boy
(hardly able to speak):  don't know
45 :  think you know well
Martin doesn't know what to say, he looks down
The pastor watches him for a long moment, then he gets up, walks around the desk and sits down on its edge, in front of the boy, so that their heads are facing each other
Won't you tell me
No
Then 'll tell you what the cause was: The boy had learned from someone, who had harmed the finest nerves of his body, in the area where God's will has erected sacred barriers
The boy imitated this action
He couldn't stop doing it, so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves in his body, and so much that he died of it
Martin seems very affected
He has bowed his head, swallows several times, and hardly dares to breath
Look at me, Martin
Martin looks up fearfully, then immediately looks away again
just want to help you
love you with all my heart
Look at me
Martin looks his father in the eyes
Be sincere, Martin
Why did you blush and become so nervous when  told you the story of the poor boy
: Blushed
don't know
felt sorry for him
: Is that all
No, Martin, there has to be another reason
It's written on your face
Be sincere, Martin
Sincerity brings you closer to God, our beloved Father, and to all human beings
(starts to cry): Oh, my God
He cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor has tears in his eyes
He embraces the boy
The latter seizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely
: Well, Martin, why are you crying
Shall spare you that confession
You too have done what that wretched boy did, haven't you
(crying): Oh my God
Yes

/ Intercourse between the midwife and the doctor
She holds on to the sideboard, as he penetrates her from behind
Both are fully dressed, she has just lifted her skirt
When he is ready, she turns around and puts her arms around him
He lets her do it, with a patronizing smile and pulls gently away from her
: Careful, my arm
She tries to hide her frustration, sits down again with him at the table, on which are the leftovers of their meal
With a little ironic smile, the doctor raises his glass to her
She takes her glass and clinks it with his
She drinks
An embarrassed silence follows
Finally, she says : It's great that you're back
It was about time
: You can say that
Yes
: It was   difficult    with    the    children, without you
:  know
: He doesn't like me
: Who
: Rudi
(after a pause): He's at a difficult age
: Actually not
Then: They're always at a difficult age
(more to himself, with a faint smile): Yes
: You didn't miss me
: Come on
What are you saying
: Nothing
said it because it's the truth
: There's   nothing   like   a   nice    dose   of self-hate
: What
: Nothing
Forget it
47 After a pause, she reaches over the table, takes his hand, puts her cheek against it
He lets her do it, then takes his hand from under her head and strokes her hair
42
/ It's snowing
From the inside of the church, we hear the children's choir: (singing in harmony): us free from all misery, That has hit us now
That old evil enemy, Is serious about it, Great power and much deceit Are his cruel armor, No one on earth resembles him
* Over this: : Winter came early that year
At the Reformation feast on the first Sunday of November, a deep blanket of snow covered the village
The Baron, who had come back without his family, didn't attend, which was very unusual for him
43
/ scene
The community celebrates the Reformation Feast
The schoolteacher conducts the children's choir
The children sing enthusiastically
Marie and Martin wear the white ribbon on their arm
:
The villagers took that as a sign of his anger
Indeed, no evidence had been found as to the possible author of the crime, although the Baron's appeal had led to a flood of mutual suspicions,   even    to   some    attempts   of denunciation that had all turned out to be untenable

/ The doctor examines the steward's baby that is crying
Finally, he turns to the parents
: Well, it's not pneumonia
But you must be careful
If his temperature rises, call me again
For the time being you must give these drops every two hours
And hang some wet sheets over the oven
That facilitates breathing
While the mother puts the child back in the cradle, the doctor and the father go down the  to the How long has the window been open
: Difficult to say
My wife nursed him at about one o'clock
When she came back, it was around half past two
At that time it was icy cold in this room
: And the baby didn't cry
: No
The children were upstairs and didn't hear anything either
They have reached the living room where Liesl, Georg and Ferdinand get up as he comes in
(to the children): He's doing all right, considering the circumstances
We have to wait
The children seem worried
To calm them the doctor adds: For now we'll have to wait
The steward has gone to the sideboard
: Can  offer you something to warm you up
: No, thanks
'm overloaded with work
When one has been away for so long
: Georg
At a sign of the father, Georg jumps up and gets the doctor's coat and hat from outside
In the meantime, the father keeps on chatting with the doctor: And how is your arm doing
: It's all right
Everything will be fine in two or three weeks
: That must be terrible,  imagine
You probably feel like half a man when you can't use your arm properly
Georg has come back with the hat and the coat, and hands them to the doctor, : Thank you
The steward helps him with his coat because of his bad arm
49 (laughs): Quod erat demonstrandum
Thank you
Well, good night, children
: Good night, Doctor
(to the steward who holds the door open): Thank you
If your wife thinks that the baby
The steward closes the door to the stairwell, so that we can't grasp the rest of their conversation
The children are alone
They remain silent
Then : Well
: What do you mean "well"
("dumb question,      it's   obvious"): mean
That's fine
(to Ferdinand): When did you go down to see Father
Down in his office
: Why
: Just asking

-   / The schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks through the snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks
: In mid-December,  finally got a letter from Eva
Her father had found her a new job in the district capital, which she would start at the beginning of the New Year
Since that night, where she had come looking for shelter in the school and we had tried to tell each other the story of our short lives until the wee hours of the morning,  could no longer banish from my thoughts her pale face, her shy but frank personality and her shining hair red
The school holidays lasted until the morning after New Year's Day, but already the second day after Christmas  the weather was cold but sunny went on my way to Obersdorf in order to visit Eva and her parents
50 46
-' - / lower middle-class room
The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her siblings, 6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva
Embarrassed silence
The younger children whisper and giggle
The conversation is slow
After a long pause says: And Sigi
:  don't know
The Baroness isn't back yet
: And the Baron
(shrugs): We hardly see him
He talks to nobody
don't know
Some say they've gone to the south
To Italy
: To Italy
Really
The   children    giggle,   amused   over    the embarrassment of the two people
The schoolteacher and Eva look at each other, but Eva soon averts her eyes
: They now want to tear down the sawmill for good
That's what the steward says
Because it isn't worthwhile to
At that moment the door opens and Eva's parents come in
Obviously, the mother went to fetch the father
She is plump, in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawl over her shoulders
The father wears a hat and overcoat
He's a sturdy man in his early fifties, of peasant stock
He probably came straight from a tavern, and appears to be slightly drunk
The schoolteacher, Eva and the children stand up
The schoolteacher bows deeply: : Good morning
: Good morning, young man
They shake hands
: Please be seated
We're not very formal here
With a short movement of his hand the father invites him to sit down
(to the children): Scram
The children, rather sheepish since the arrival of their father, leave the room
The father unbuttons his over coat, throws the hat on the sofa and sits down
The mother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher: : Would you like something to drink
: No, thank you
Very kind
: Really
: Really
Thank you very much
51 The father sits      down beside Eva and looks at the schoolteacher
Eva    appears to be awkward, and stares at the table in front   of her
: So   you're a schoolteacher
: Yes
: Can you afford to have a wife
Short embarrassed
: My father works as a tailor in Grundbach
have an apprentice's diploma
So earn quite a bit on the side : You should have taken over your father's business, that would have been smarter
Well
And why are you so focused on that girl
She's almost still a child
You could almost be her father
(smiles): 'm thirty-one
(grinning): Well, you can still handle what matters
(embarrassed): Father
Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look
: Let's be serious: do you know whether she's willing to get married
She's still a child
She hasn't seen anything of the world
To Eva: Say something
Do you want him
Eva wishes the earth would engulf her
: Come on
Don't make such a fuss
He walked all the way over through the fresh snow
: Why don't you leave her alone
Of course, she wants him
Can't you feel that
: How can
If she keeps her mouth shut
Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears out of shame
The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly at the father
The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran out
He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite toward the father
The father says calmly: : Just sit down
That's how women are bit hysterical, the whole lot of them
Listen
'm not a big talker
On one hand, it suits me for the girl to leave the house
We have a lot of mouths to feed, as you can see
52 On the other hand, it's all moving a bit too fast for me
don't know you
It's not that don't like you, but  need to get some information about you first
Besides, the town hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an apprentice
That way she'll get to meet people and she can make up he mind whether she really wants this or not
And if in a year's time she has stuck to this idea, we can l talk about it again
And you can make up your mind too, all right
:  actually thought
(interrupts him):  know,  know
But it's either that or nothing
You get it
(after a short pause) steps back: If you insist
: Yes,  do
He holds out his hand to the schoolteacher, who accepts it after a brief hesitation
: That's it
'm pleased
Well, business is waiting
Even on holidays
'll send the girl back in so that you can say good-bye
year goes by fast
The world won't collapse
And during your holidays you can come and visit her
Good-bye
He leaves the room
The schoolteacher is thrown off balance by all this
He stands up and takes a few steps
He sits down again and thinks
Finally, the door opens and Eva enters
She doesn't really know what to do
Neither does the schoolteacher
As she comes in he stands up again
Finally Eva goes over to the table and sits down
The schoolteacher also sits down
They exchange a short glance and an equally brief smile
says: Did your father tell
: Yes
: Is that all right with you
: Is that all right with you, sir
(smiles): Don't be so formal with me
Eva looks up
Their eyes meet
Then she takes his hand in her hand
They remain seated without saying a word

/ It is dark
Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don't recognize at first glance, are lying in their beds
Through the window, a red glow, slowly getting stronger
Suddenly ' : Toni
Are you awake
Toni
'  (half asleep): What is it
: Look
' : What's happening
: Look
Look what's happening out there
Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes
' : My God, what do you want
: Over there
Have a look out of the window
Anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow
Then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window
Suddenly, he is wide-awake: : Something is burning
Over there at the estate
: Untie me
Anton turns around to Martin, hesitates
: Come on, untie me
Anton doesn't really know what to do
He turns to the window again, then again to Martin
The latter screams angrily: told you to untie me
:  don't know
: 'll beat you black and blue, if you don't untie me
The loud dispute has now also awakened Florian, who says in a drowsy voice: : What's happening
Why can't you be quiet
: Flori, come over and untie me
: What's going on
(yells): Untie me, dammit
You idiots
It's burning
54 : It's burning
Florian gets up himself and patters to the window
He looks out and then says, amazed and enthusiastic: It's burning
(imitates him angrily): , it's burning
Now untie me, godammit
Florian looks at Anton with questioning eyes and then says to Martin: : But Father hasn't allowed it
Reverse angle  of the two boys at the window toward Martin, who we see for the first from the front
His wrists are tied to the left and the right side of the bed
Trying sit up, he pulls furiously at his ties
(furious): But if there's an emergency, you idiot
Somebody must warn them
(he yells loudly: Faaaather
Mooooother
Father
Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to him and undoes his ties
: Stop shouting
'll untie you
: Shall  call Mother
We already hear hurried  in the corridor
The door opens and the mother enters, dressed in a nightgown
: What's going on here
Martin has just been untied
: It's burning
:  know
Your father has already gone
In the door, the girls appear after their mother
They have left their room attracted by the noise
The mother turns to them: : What are you doing here
(to everyone): You all go to bed now
It's nothing
There's a fire on the estate
You don't need to be afraid
Go to bed and sleep
Come on, Marie, take your sisters with you and go to your room
Otherwise you'll catch a cold
The girls disappear again
The mother turns to Martin: Why did you make so much noise
You woke us all up
Martin doesn't know what to answer
Then he says apologetically: :  thought it was dangerous
(apologizing):  had to untie his hands
(calming them down): Now, everything's all right again
Tomorrow, Father will tell you what happened with the fire
All right
Now you 55 all got back to bed
'll wait till you're back in bed
It's freezing cold outside
The three boys go back to bed
But first Anton ties up Martin's hands again
He pulls a blanket over his brother
Then they all disappear under their blankets
: Good night then
Sleep well
, , : Good night, Mom
The mother closes the door
Coming from outside, we can see the glow of the fire

// Paul discovers his dead father in the pigsty
The farmer has hung himself up from a hook in the wall
The knocked-over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet
Paul runs from the stable out to the courtyard
He stops
Then he tiptoes toward the stable door
As he touches the stable door, he lacks the strength to go inside again
Slowly he heads for the living room
The children, who are gathered, pay no attention to him
Leni, who's cooking, has looked up from her work briefly
Paul sits down on the bench against the wall
It is quite dark in there

/ The doctor sits at his desk, the midwife sits on the visitor's chair opposite him
She tries to masturbate him
56 This time, too, both are fully dressed
Over his clothes, the doctor wears an unbuttoned white coat
He watches the woman for a while in her activity, then he says coldly: : Wouldn't it be better if you stopped doing that
It's like a slap in the face
She looks dumbfounded
: Why all the effort
Don't look at me so dumbfounded
It's not that you lack talent
It's just that can't do it with you any more, that's all
To tell you the truth: you disgust me
He gets up and buttons up his pants
She feels as if the world had collapsed around her
Please finish your work now
don't want to spend all night here
The midwife remains seated, her head bowed, as if struck by a lightning (quietly): What did  do to you
(irritated): My God, you haven't done anything at all
You're ugly, you're messy, you're flabby and you have bad breath
Isn't that enough
He points at the examination couch on the other side of the small room, saying casually: The upholstery has to be sterilized with boiling water She remains immobile, and shoots a quick mechanical glance at the examination couch
He looks at her
Stop sitting there as if you were carrying all the world's woes on your shoulders
The world won't collapse down
Not on you, or on me
(explains): just want it to stop, that's all
've been trying, but it's just disgusting try to think of another woman when 'm making love to you, a woman who smells good, who's young one, one who's less flabby than you, but my imagination can't handle it
In the end, it's you again and then  just feel like throwing up and am embarrassed at myself
So what's the point
: Are you through
:(contemptuously)): Yes,  have been for ages
He turns away
The midwife hardly moves
She's still sitting on the visitor's chair
It takes her a lot of 57 strength not to faint  at the same time she speaks out calmly
: You must be very unhappy to be so mean
: Oh God
Please, not that routine
:  know that 'm not much to look at
My bad breath comes from my stomach, you know that very well
But it didn't bother you in the past when we got together
already had my ulcer when your wife was still alive
: Please spare me these sordid details
But let me reassure you: it has always disgusted me
accepted it, because  wanted to ease my pain after Erika's death and  didn't care with whom
could have screwed a cow
Whores are unfortunately too far from here and regrettably once every two months isn't enough for me, even though 'm getting older
So skip your damn martyrdom routine and get out
(keeps on speaking softly): Why did this only occur to you now
: According to you: when should it have occurred to me
At the hospital,  had forgotten how tiresome you were
One grows sentimental when one's in pain
(tired): Get out
Why don't you get out
Don't you have any pride
(equally tired): There's no room for any with you
: That's true
: Aren't    you   afraid   that      might   do something silly
(laughs with disdain): Go ahead
At least that would surprise me
But be careful: it might be painful
:  know
'm ridiculous
You wouldn't care anyway
: Well
She looks at him
58 : Why do you despise me
For helping to raise the boy
For watching you fingering your little daughter and not saying a word
The doctor goes over and slaps her
Tears start to run down her face, but after a short pause she keeps on speaking, "unmoved": For helping you to deceive yourself
For listening to you claim how unique your love for Erika was, though the whole village knew, how badly you treated her
For loving you, although  know you can't stand being loved
The doctor snorts with disdain
: That's it
Now leave me alone
've got work to do
She gets up and makes room for him
He sits down at the desk and "works"
She looks down at him: : You can't afford to get rid of me
Who would do the dirty work for you, who would help you with the children, and here in you practice
You're not speaking seriously
You just want to see how far you can go, don't you: will she still put up with it or can  drag her even lower through the mud
The doctor "works", as if he hadn't heard
She keeps watching him for a while, and then says softly: 'm tired too
've got two retarded children: Hans and you
You're the one that gives me most trouble
He looks up at her
After a pause, he says: : My God, why don't you just die

The men carry the coffin out of the house
Some people are already waiting outside
All wear mourning clothes
The coffin is shouldered, the funeral procession forms, with the pallbearers and in the lead
The others who had gathered in the house follow
Paul comes out with Sepp, whom he tries to calm
Finally Leni comes out and, in 59 words that we can't hear, asks the old midwife to look after the farm for a short while
She gathers her sisters and with them gets in the funeral procession right behind the coffin
The procession starts to move off
As it comes around the corner of the farm to go down the path leading to the village, Franz comes toward them
Muttering is heard from the villagers
They don't know how to react
The procession slows down
Franz comes over
For a while he stands in front of the coffin, head bowed
Then he joins his brothers and sisters
He and Leni exchange a glance, then he takes his place beside her
After he has motioned to the coffin bearers, the procession starts to move off again slowly, despite of the continued muttering
Paul, who is still carrying Sepp, looks expectantly toward his older brother who squeezes his hand
Paul smiles shyly
Then Franz takes over little Sepp, in the most natural way
For a long moment it almost looks as if, despite of all the gloom, these people weren't desperate

: The year was coming to an end with fine weather
The sun made the snowy landscape sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eyes
None of us suspected that it would be the last time a year moved on to the next in an era of peace, and that that same year a radical change would take place of which no one had the faintest inkling
54
/ The decorated Christmas tree
Outside bright sunlight
The pastor is taking the white ribbon off Marie's head and Martin's arm
The rest of the family witnesses this almost solemn act
:
Despite of the strange events, that had unsettled the village, we thought of ourselves as united in the belief that the life in our community was God's will and worth living
:
take of this ribbon from you, in the belief that from now on you'll no longer need it
You, Marie, will be accepted this year as a full member of the church community
You will receive 60 Christ's body as bread and as wine
May the time of preparation for the confirmation feast be one of happiness and enrichment
And you, Martin: from now on you shall not only be free of that ribbon, but also from those nightly ties that were intended to save you from yielding to the temptations of your young body
For in a house full of festive expectation, you too, on your own, shall make your contribution to mental and physical purity
trust in you, my beloved children, and wish you a profitable and happy new year
He strokes the children's heads
They kiss his hand
The mother embraces them heartily

/ Springtime
The Baroness, Sigi and a new, a forty-ish nanny with the twins are get out of a carriage in front of the manor
: Shortly after Easter, in the last week of April, the Baroness came back with the children
She was accompanied by a new nurse
Thus my secret hope that Eva would be able to come back here, had definitely been dashed
The nurse was a chubby, middle-aged Italian who came, as everybody soon learned, from the town on the Mediterranean coast where the Baroness had spent the winter
maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements, the Baroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggage is being unloaded
The nurse gives instructions in Italian, which leads to some confusion
Then the nanny talks to Sigi who translates to the servants, laughing
Besides, the boy looks transformed: instead of his former pale skin color, his face now has a nice tan, his fair hair has been further bleached by the sun, he has grown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier
The Baroness too seems more relaxed and restored
She and Sigi are about to go straight into the house when we hear, coming from the other side of the courtyard ' : Sigi
Sigi turns around
Ferdinand has seen him from the window and called
Sigi waves back: : Hi, Ferdinand
: Wait
'm coming down
Sigi wants to run over to the steward's house
61 :   Stay   here,   Sigi,   you   can   see   him later
(in Italian): Let him go, Signora
He's so happy to be home again
(muses, then smiles): All right, you can go
But don't stay too long
Sigi hurries off
The Baroness and the nurse look at each other in agreement
The Baroness smiles faintly
Then they go through the door into the house
For a moment we only see the open door with the dark stairwell behind it
Then we hear the  of the Baron, first on the gravel in the yard
Then Baron comes into frame, and goes through the door into the house
He vanishes into the darkness of the stairwell
From there we hear his voice: (calling): Beatrix
Beatrix, where are you
The nurse comes out after a while again (calls in Italian): Sigi
Don't you want to come say hello to your father
But Sigi is talking intensely to Ferdinand on the other side of the courtyard and doesn't answer

/ The children are going wild
Brawling, sponge and chalk are flying through the air
Some are packing up their belongings, preparing to leave the classroom
In short, the way children behave once the lesson is over
Marie stands at the classroom door
She watches her classmates
The she looks through the door into the It's empty
She comes back to the , but stays at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the corridor
Apparently, she has been posted there as a lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a teacher
The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on
Suddenly, Marie sees the schoolteacher in the with her father
The two are having an animated conversation
Marie bursts into the  and closes the door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to her classmates: : Watch out, he's coming
But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn't heard by all of the pupils
The noise dies down, some of them stop misbehaving
Somebody picks up the sponge, and 62 the blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces of the fight
But a small group who had started to chase each other around, doesn't hear and keeps at it
Marie shouts to them again, this time louder: Be quiet
For God's sake
Be quiet
But as the wild chase goes on and some over-exited children even make fun of her, and she yells at the top of her voice: At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes in with the schoolteacher
Almost instantly, the room becomes
Without saying a word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by the ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall
The pupils remain silent, embarrassed
While the pastor goes back to the black board, putting his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the lack of discipline of his classroom, says: : What's going on here
Why are you still here
You know that there's a confirmation class now
Get out
The children disappear quickly
To the first child who tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says: How about saying good-bye
Immediately all the  rushing out say: Good-bye, Sir
Good-bye, Pastor
Finally, all the children have left the classroom, except eight candidates for confirmation, among them Paul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to the wall
The schoolteacher turns to the pastor: : 'm sorry, Pastor
It won't happen again
The pastor answers with a reserved nod
In an icy silence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils to leave
As the schoolteacher notices that there will be no further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly to him and says: Good-bye, Pastor
: Good-bye
The schoolteacher leaves the room
The pastor turns to the candidates for confirmation: Let us pray
They say the '  together
Then the pastor says: Sit down
63 The students sit down
Marie keeps standing facing the wall
The pastor stops too
After a while he begins to talk
This is a very sad day for me
In a few weeks, we all want to celebrate the confirmation feast together
For many months  have tried to bring God's word closer to you, and to make responsible human beings out of you in His spirit
And what do  face today
horde of yelling monkeys,   without  any   discipline   or   human dignity, as childish as the seven-year olds, with whom you're sharing this classroom
But what makes me even sadder is the fact that my own daughter is playing the leading role in this pitiful display
Last year  bound a white ribbon in her hair
Well, you all know that white is the color of innocence
The ribbon was meant to help Marie to avoid sin, selfishness, envy, indecency, lies and sloth
Well, at the start of the year,  was naive enough to believe, that now, in the year of her confirmation, she'd become mature enough, and that she wouldn't need that ribbon any more believed that she felt responsible, being the daughter of the spiritual leader of a Christian communi
Marie, who all this time has been waiting beside the stove, faints and collapses to the floor

/ The only light comes in from the living room
Rudolph comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt
(softly): Xeni
He goes into the
It's empty
(as above, anxiously): Xeni
Where are you
He goes into the
It's also empty
Rudolph is desperate
He starts to cry
Finally, he goes back to the  and goes up the stairs to his room
On the stairway, he notices light coming from under the door of the practice
He goes back down the stairs down again and opens the door of the
In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, are the doctor and Xenia
The doctor has his back to Rudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first
She sits on 64 the visitor's chair
He has placed his chair in front of hers, and his legs are closed around her legs
She's crying
The situation is ambiguous, we don't know what has happened
The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks at Rudolph: (startled, her face tearstained): Rudi
The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his young son
Both look as if they have been caught red-handed
: What are you doing here
Why aren't you in bed
Rudolph doesn't really know, what to think of all this, but   being    the  good   child   he   is,  he   answers automatically: :  can't get to sleep
: That's why you're wandering around like a ghost in the middle of the night
:  woke up and you weren't there
Short
Xenia wipes the tears from her face
(trying to smile): Dad has pierced      my earlobes
: Does it hurt
: Yes, a bit
: That's why you're crying
(tries to smile): 'm not crying any more
(trying to joke): Beauty has to suffer
That's what they say
At least for girls
He gets up and goes, still seen from behind, to a closet, and puts something into it that we can't recognize
He's straightens his clothes
Then he goes over to Rudolph: : Now go to bed again
You too, Xeni
: Yes
As Rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously, she explains, almost eagerly: haven't worn earrings for a long time, that's why my earlobes grew back again
To show him, she grasps one of her ears
For Whitsun feast, when we all want to look our best make ourselves look beautiful, 'm getting new earrings
The ones that Mom had, with garnets
65 Rudolph looks at her
He doesn't think she's telling the truth

/ Marie comes in
She's wearing a nightshirt, her hair is damp and sticks to her head
She looks sick and feverish
She closes the door quietly, then goes to her father's desk and opens a few drawers
She ends up finding the letter-opener
It has a hilt and looks like a small sword
She takes the letter-opener, goes to the birdcage, puts the letter-opener down beside it and grabs the tiny canary
As the bird chirps, she glances round at the door, as if to make sure that nobody is coming
:  few days after Marie's fainting-fit that frightened us all, and that was followed by her feverish and debilitated state
She takes the bird into her left hand so that its little head is turned upwards, and picks up the letter-opener with her right hand

/ The schoolteacher is led by the steward's wife to the living room
She carries an apron and her sleeves are rolled up
Apparently she was just preparing a cake, and her sticky hands make her open the door with her elbow
Because of the narrator's voice, we don't grasp what they're saying, but we understand that she's asking him to come in and wait for the person he wants to see, and that she can't keep him company now
:
went to see the steward, because wanted to borrow the carriage for the Whitsun holidays again
Since my marriage proposal, Eva had written me once a week, and  got the feeling that she felt lost and alone in the city, and was asking me between the lines to come to see her again, despite of her father's interdiction
wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so that  could be back on Sunday again and prepare the confirmation feast with the pastor
The steward had gone to the sawmill, but was supposed to be back any minute
His wife, who was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into the living room and to wait there for his return
66 The steward's wife has left the room
The schoolteacher sits around, bored
After a while he gets up, goes to the window and looks out
The courtyard is empty
Suddenly, the schoolteacher hears a female  in the next room  softly
He listens, then he goes to the wing door and looks through the gap on the etched glass-window of the door into the next room
There, Liesl sits beside the cradle and talks quietly to the baby
The schoolteacher opens the door
Liesl sees him, gets up and greets him politely with a curtsy: : Good morning, Sir
: Hello, Liesl
Smiling, the schoolteacher goes to the cradle and looks into it
: He's cute
: Yes, he is
: Do you like him
: Yes
Very much
: He was very sick last winter, was told
: Yes
Very sick
But the doctor cured him
With God's help
The schoolteacher looks out the window to see if the steward isn't coming
:   Maybe,  'll   pop  back   this evening
: 'm sure Father will be back for coffee at four
She looks at the grandfather clock, that indicates quarter to four
The schoolteacher thinks for a moment, then he goes to the living room: : Then, 'll go sit down again next door
: Can  bring you something
cup   of coffee
'm sure it's ready
(smiling at her eagerness): No, no
Thanks
He stands in the door: 'll sit down over there again and just wait
He wants to close the door behind himself
Suddenly 67 says: Sir
: Yes
: Can dreams come true
The schoolteacher smiles, surprised at the unexpected question: : That depends, why
(serious): On what
(smile): On what does it depend
Well if you dream of getting the first prize at the school feast, and study hard for it, then your dream can come true
, shakes her head, quietly: That's not what meant
The schoolteacher feels that she has something on her mind and asks, this time without irony: : Well, what did you mean then
She looks at him, wondering if she should really discuss it
He nods to encourage her
:  mean, if you dream something in your sleep,  mean, if you really dream it in your sleep, can it come true
(also serious): Why, what did you dream
She bows her head
The schoolteacher thinks for a moment, then he goes over to her
Come on, tell me
You have something on your mind, haven't you
She shakes her bowed head
But suddenly, she starts to cry: (crying):  always dream such horrible things
(dear): Tell me what you've been dreaming
She sobs, he takes out a handkerchief and hands it to her: Take this
Now, calm down again
And then tell me what's going on
Liesl takes the handkerchief, blows her nose and wipes away her tears
She doesn't completely manage to hold her tears back, and breathes haltingly
She hands the handkerchief back to the schoolteacher
: Thanks
The schoolteacher puts the handkerchief away with an imperceptible smile and then says reassuringly: 68 : All right
Now go on
The girl sniffles a couple of times again, then swallows and says quietly: :  dreamt that the Hansi  the midwife's odd little boy
(reassuringly):  know,  know
: -
that something very bad is going to happen to him
: Something very bad
Liesl nods eagerly
: Like what
:  don't know
Something like what happened to Sigi not long ago
But even worse
She starts to cry again: But he's so sweet
He harms no one
Touched, the schoolteacher puts his arm around Liesl's shoulder
: All right
All right
That was just a dream
You needn't take it so seriously
(crying): They always make fun of him, because he doesn't really
(calmly): Yes,  know, but nobody will do him any harm, you can be sure of that
Liesl can't calm down
Do you want my handkerchief back
She shakes her head
: What gave you the idea that your dream would come true
She just shakes her head, and keeps on crying
Then he takes the handkerchief out again and hands it to her
As she doesn't take it, he nudges her
She looks up, confused
He holds the handkerchief again with a cheerful nod
She takes it and blows her nose
The she slowly calms down
(now "reasonable" in order to "calm her down"): Dreams don't come true
Let alone that kind
She shrugs her shoulders, as if she disagrees with what he's saying
Her head bowed she stands before him, holding his handkerchief
She breathes a few more times, then says with an almost "adult" voice: (serious): But sometimes my dreams do come true
69 : What do you mean
says: Last winter, before Putzl (she points to the baby) became ill,  dreamt that my brother put him beside the open window, so that he'd die
And the day the window was open and he caught a chill and he almost died
The schoolteacher is completely perplexed
At first he doesn't know what to say
: What are you saying there
That's complete nonsense
Liesl bows her head again
: Somebody probably didn't close the window properly
What gave you that idea
Why would your brother do such a thing
,(defiantly, as he's not believing her): Because he's jealous
: And because you believe that, you dreamt it
It doesn't mean anything at all
It's just a coincidence
(keeping her head bowed): All right
The schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze
: Look at me
She looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiant reserve
: Don't tell such stories to anybody
You obviously don't realize the harm you can do with it
Again she looks down at the floor
You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents, didn't you
She shakes her head
All right then
Forget it quickly
shall    forget     it,   too
Promise
As she doesn't answer, he repeats: Promise
70 She nods almost imperceptibly
Good
Now can  have my handkerchief back
He holds his hand out to her
Astonished she looks at the handkerchief in her hands
She had forgotten it completely, and gives it back the schoolteacher
Thank you
He pockets the handkerchief
Now, we both have a secret
And you promise me that it will remain a secret between us
All right
She nods reluctantly
He insists, seeks her gaze: Yes
(reluctantly): Yes
: Well
All right then
You don't have to worry
Nothing will happen to Hansi
(smiling): Nobody is jealous of him
She glances at him to see whether he's making fun of her
He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that demands an answer
She nods briefly
But it isn't clear whether she just does it to please him
Dreams don't come true
That only happens in fairy-tales
Forget all about it
He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed
Finally he smiles and tries to "crack a joke" to make the matter less serious: Do you know what they did to little girls who predicted the future in ancient times
They burned them at the stake as witches
She looks up at him, round-eyed

/ The pastor comes through the door, goes to his desk, and is about to put down his briefcase
The dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with its wings spread out
The pastor's letter-opener is stuck in its neck - only the hilt sticks out from its beak

/ The schoolteacher and Eva drive in the carriage
In the background, we catch glimpses of the town
: We had arranged to meet at the town railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being seen with me
She was living with distant relatives,   who    were    apparently   reporting regularly to Eva's parents about her life-style
She had become thinner which made her even prettier, and once again  was ravished by her mixture   of   shyness    and    almost  childlike outspokenness
(imitating somebody):
"
You want your hair parted r to the right or to the left
" "How about one parting to the left and one to the right"
Both laugh heartily
All the people in the saloon were laughing their heads   off
Even    Mr
Murer,   who's   so distinguished that he never cracks a smile, had to laugh
, in which the laughter fades down
: Then, it isn't really so awful, is it
: No
But sweeping up hair all day  honestly the twins were more fun,  must say
But it's all right
can't really complain
The schoolteacher looks at her sideways, smiling: : No
She looks at him, doesn't understand that he's trying to make her complain about their forced separation, and says cheerfully: : No
Really
The schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her, then looks back at the road: (smiling): And apart from the twins, there's nothing you're missing
She looks at him, surprised
Suddenly, she understands
She shakes her head with a smile, then takes his hand for a short moment, as if she were apologizing for her lack of sensitivity
: Oh, you of course
He looks at her hand on his, but she already has withdrawn it
Both seem very happy
After a few moments, during which the horse keeps trotting, Eva leans against the schoolteacher and puts her head against his shoulder
But the shaking of the carriage on the rutted road makes that position untenable and so they sit side by side again and drive on
Finally 72 says: And how is the nurse
Does she only speak Italian
:    don't   know
That's   what   the steward told me
:  see
At that moment the road crosses a brook, that runs through a small wood
The schoolteacher steers the carriage on to a trail that branches off the road after the bridge
: Where are you going
: Over there, into the forest beside the brook
We can picnic over there brought a basket of food
(softly):  don't want that
(perplexed): Why
Eva looks down and shakes her head
The schoolteacher stops the carriage, turns to her: What's going on
: Nothing
Please
Now he understands
He smiles although he can't really understand that she's been thinking such a thing of him
Now he talks to her almost as to a child, astonished and reassuringly
:   But     don't  want   anything forbidden from you
just wanted you to enjoy the picnic
She looks up at him
: Please
(astonished): Do you think, might want to bring disgrace on my future wife
She keeps looking at him pleadingly
Finally he gives in, slightly disappointed: All right then
'll turn over there
He drives on
After a few meters, Eva puts her hand on his hands and on the reins
He stops the carriage, she looks at him
: Thanks
He doesn't know what say
They look at each other
Suddenly Eva leans forward and kisses him on the lips very cautiously
They remain that way for a long while without their bodies touching each other
After separating, they forget at first to keep breathing
Then, once the worst of the confusion has abated, they both turn away from each other
The schoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again, and 73 they sit side by side on the bumping vehicle, looking straight ahead, quiet and overwhelmed by the happiness of the moment
62
/ The church is packed
The 8 candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the Communion bench
One after the other, the pastor puts the cup to their lips
: Accept and drink
This is the blood of the New Testament, Shed for the forgiveness of your sins
As he reaches Marie, who is kneeling fifth in line, he hesitates a long moment
For so long, that this causes a few irritated stares from the devout parish
Even more than the other children, Marie is also numb with excitement
It almost looks like she might faint again
But then he holds out the cup to her too, and she drinks: Accept and drink
That is the blood of the new will, spilled for you so that your sins         will   be forgiven
He wipes the cup, where Marie's mouth drank  as he does after each child - and goes on to the next one, repeating the rite
63
/ Distant
At first incomprehensible
Gradually we understand them better: : Hansi
Where are you
Give us a sign
Hansi, where are you
Here and there silhouettes appear in the half-light
Some carry lanterns, other torches
It takes some time before they get nearer and become recognizable: they're men and women from the village
After a while ' (calling): Over here
He's here
We follow those running over: Bound to a tree is a small boy
His whole head is wrapped up in rags
small slit has been left open so the nose can breathe
He
74 paper has been tied around his neck with a white ribbon
The people hurry toward the child, free the child of its fetters
The child slumps down, his head is unwrapped, covered in blood: it's the mongoloid son of the midwife
Astonished, somebody reads the words written in block letters on the paper): , 64
/ Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of other children are waiting at the classroom door
They remain silent
They're listening
:   After    this   intricate  atrocity committed on the retarded boy, even the Baron was finally convinced that it would be more intelligent to call upon the professional help of the county's police force
So a few days later a couple of plainclothes policemen arrived and, after a visit to the several of the crime scenes, started to ask in various homes if anyone had noticed anything suspicious
The two detectives question Liesl in the presence of the schoolteacher and become more and more aggressive
Liesl ends up crying
: After learning of Hansi's torture, didn't think at first of what Liesl had told me
When it came back to my mind,  at first hesitated to tell the authorities about it
Because of such an absurd coincidence,  didn't want to jeopardize the reputation and inner peace of the steward's family
But when  heard that Hansi might loose his eyesight because of his injuries, one afternoon made Liesl come to school and tell the police officers about her dream
:
Thank God, we're not as stupid as you might think
75 (crying, desperate): But  only dreamt it
The officers exchange an impatient look with the schoolteacher, who himself doesn't really know what to think of Liesl's story
He looks at her thoughtfully
The police officer turns to the girl again: : Now listen carefully
'll give you a last chance: you tell me, who told you about the plan to torture the boy, and we won't tell anybody who told us
All right
Liesl shakes her head desperately, crying again
The police officer looks at the schoolteacher
The latter doubts whether he should speak up
He feels sorry for the girl
Finally, he says: :   She's    already   dreamed   of something that has come true
(ironic): Is that so
And what was it, if  may ask
(wanting to spare her      talking about it): Something that happened       in her family
(just as before):  see
Something to do with her family
And have you checked if it was true
(irritated): No
The police officer looks at him, grunts with disdain, and turns to his colleague: (scornfully): Well, all that may be true
Maybe we're really dealing here with an authentic clairvoyant, and we don't realize how lucky we are
Maybe we only need to ask her, who's behind all this
The we send her to bed, she dreams a bit, and tomorrow she tells us who did it
How about that
Everything's possible, isn't it
Suddenly, he yells at the girl: Stop crying
Liesl jumps up with fear
The police officer stands right in front of her: Your deceitful whining won't work with me
've got other ways to make you talk
don't believe in witches and magicians, let alone that a chubby little girl like you has supernatural hallucinations
Therefore you'd better get used to the idea of telling the truth, because you won't bet rid of me until you've come clean
Is that clear
All right, and now we're going to visit your parents to see what they think of your version of the story
76 He pulls the girl to her feet
She's thoroughly intimidated, and sniffles faintly
Then he leads her toward the door, at the same time turning to the schoolteacher: 'd be grateful if you came too
The schoolteacher finds the policeman's behavior toward the child exaggeratedly aggressive, but he follows reluctantly: : Of course
The police officer opens the door to the and almost bumps into a group of pupils that have assembled there
: Oooops
What do we have here
(kindly): Good afternoon
Good afternoon, Sir
(as before): Good afternoon
Good afternoon, Sir
Obviously the schoolteacher didn't expect them, but doesn't want to show it in front of the police
: Good afternoon
: Why are you eavesdropping
(politely): We saw from outside that the schoolteacher was having visitors
We didn't want to intrude
We were just waiting to talk to the schoolteacher
The police officer looks at the schoolteacher: : What do you want
(as if she was too shy to talk in front of strangers: We wanted to ask you something about Hansi
Again, the police officer looks at the schoolteacher
: What is it
(hesitates a moment, then "screws up her courage" and asks): We heard he isn't well
We just wanted to ask if we could be of any help
77 65
'  / The doctor carefully examines Hansi's wounds
Especially the areas around eyes that are badly affected
The boy moans softly
The midwife stands beside him, trying to stay calm, but she is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still in a state of shock
It's very quiet
The doctor speaks with a soothing, almost tender voice to the child, who keeps on moaning: (softly): All right
Everything's all right, Hansi
know, it hurts
You've got to be patient
everything will be fine again
everything
He has finished his treatment (and has bandaged the boy's eyes again), and wants get up
But Hansi's hand clings to his, and holds him back
He hesitates a moment
The doctor and the midwife exchange a brief glance
Then, the doctor cautiously frees his hand from the child's
have to go now, Hansi
Don't worry, 'll be back tomorrow
The boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the hand of the doctor, who he can't see
Brief exchange of glances between the doctor and the midwife, who ends up sitting on Hansi's bed, taking the boy's hands
: It's all right, Hansi
Don't be afraid
The Doctor will be back
The doctor motions to the midwife that she should stay with the child, and leaves the room silently and almost hastily

/ Sitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cut willow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carving whistles out of them
Their feet dangle in the water, they're concentrated on their work
Georg is the first to have finished
Proudly he tries it out, but the little whistle doesn't sound very good
He hides his disappointment, and keeps on carving to improve the sound
Then Sigi's whistle is ready and it sounds very good
Sigi is delighted
After a short and proud look over to his rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps on whistling
Georg looks with irritation at the "braggart", and keeps on carving
Then he gives it another try, but the whistle doesn't sound much better than before
Sigi's   whistling   makes   Georg's  seem   ridiculous
Ferdinand looks at Georg with a gloating grin
78 Suddenly Georg pounces on Sigi and tries to grab his whistle
Sigi fights back and refuses to let go
Ferdinand also gets up and watches the two, grinning
Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his whistle away
The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing water
Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust behavior
For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and defiant grin on his face
But Ferdinand has already jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his head to fully come to his senses
Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the bank, still holding the whistle in his hand
Then Georg points his finger at him, and says furiously and guiltily
(threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be sorry

/ The pastor sits at his desk, working
is heard
: Come in
Florian comes in, hesitantly
In his hand, he carries a birdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy's bedroom at night)
In the cage is the bird that Florian had found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered in the meantime
: Yes
The boy looks embarrassed
He glances at his father, then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on his father's desk
As Florian approaches, the pastor looked on, amazed
After putting down the cage, Florian steps back a little, then stops, his head slightly bowed
(not really understanding): What is it
What do you want
(softly): For Pipsi
(
Then even more softly): Because Father is sad
The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react
Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  look indifferent, he says: : Thank you
79 (as apprehensive in front of his father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome, Father
For a moment, neither of them knows what to do
Then the boy leaves the room
The pastor follows him with his eyes
Then, he sits down
He tries to keep his composure, but in the end he bursts into tears
He sobs haltingly, trying hard not let it be heard

'  // '
Georg stands at the window and looks down at the Coming from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   over briskly
'
Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table, doing his homework
We hear the   opening downstairs, then the father's hasty  on the stairs
Finally, the father appears in the door
He's out of breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly : Give me that whistle
Georg looks at his father, "not understanding"
:  beg your pardon
(forcedly, with threatening calm): Give me that whistle
: What whistle
At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him so hard that he falls out of his chair
Give it to me
(on the ground): What whistle
The steward yanks him up and shoves him against the wall
Georg stumbles over the table which is standing in the way, and lies back on the table top, trying to protect his face with his hands
: Give away it to me, or 'll kill you
(half moaning):  have no whistle
The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                him furiously
80 (screaming): Ouch
Ouch
(beat): You bastard, you wretch
(scream): Ouch
Ouch
Please don't At that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, the mother, appears: : For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing
What has the boy done
The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of his blind rage
He glances at her, then turns to the boy again, breathless with excitement, but forcing himself to be calm: : For the last time: give it to me
(almost crying with pain): But  don't know what you mean, Father
The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the other, then turns pleadingly to her husband: : What's going on
What are you talking about
(to Georg): You know exactly what mean
Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying to save the situation: : But if he says so
Georg
What's going on
The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence, looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again and turns on his heels and leaves the room
The steward runs down the stairs
The mother follows him
(excited): Georg
Please wait
What did the boy do
Please, tell me
Why are you so furious
She reaches the steward as he is just about to open the front door and places herself in front of him
(imploring, "reasonable"): Georg
Please
Calm down
If you could tell me
(also "reasonable", in order to get rid of her): Please don't interfere
Leave me alone now
have to go back to the Baron
He
At that moment we hear from upstairs the full  of Sigi's whistle s from above, wild and lasting
For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizes the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and dashes upstairs
We hear him thrashing the boy in the 81 room, and soon the  is replaced by Georg's After a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs after her husband, and we now hear her trying in vain trying to control her husband
: Georg
Please
Stop it
Don't kill him
69
// The meal is over
The Baroness watches the maid clearing the table and putting everything away on a tray
The Baron has stood up, standing with his back to his wife
He pours himself a glass of brandy
:
with the birches over there in Aigen that should make about six-thousand cubic meters
Working steadily, they should have finished it within three weeks
If until the end of the month we
The maid has left with the tray
(interrupts him):  won't stay here
(doesn't understand): What did you say
:  won't stay here
(turns around to her): What do you mean : What  mean is that  shall leave with the children
: What do you mean: you're leaving with the children
:   Come  on,   Armin
It's   not   that difficult to understand, is it
: May  ask you how you plan to do that
(quiet):  don't know yet
But in any case, we're leaving this place
(sarcastic): We
Look of the Baroness (" don't need that kind of irony")
: Yes
The maid enters to clear the rest of the table
It leads to a longer
The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to the window, waits
As the maid leaves the room, she looks at the Baroness inquiringly: 82 (to the maid):  don't need you any longer
Thank you
: Good night, Baroness
Good night, Baron
: Good night
Even after the maid has left, they remain  for quite a long while
Finally, she says :  returned from Italy only out of deceny toward you
wanted to give us a chance
(turns around): You wanted me "to give me a chance"
: Yes
: Well, that's brilliant
And did  miss my chance
Or what
(quietly): Do you think that will help us solve the problem
: What
: Your sarcasm
: Actually, what is the problem that has to be solved
The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to leave the room
(suddenly yelling): You stay here
She turns around, looks at him
(softer): You only leave this room if tell you to do so
She looks at him
: Fine
She goes back to her chair and sits down
:  wanted to spare you this, but you force me to do it: During our stay with Uncle Edoardo  fell in love with a man
He's from Lombardy, he works in the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in a financial matter
He courted me and was also very fond of the children
If Sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to him
Despite all this, we came back
Because  feel committed to you
But  can't stand this place any longer
Not so much for me personally, though  can't say that life with you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age
But if  leave this place, it's because  don't 83 want Sigi, and later the twins, to grow up in surroundings dominated by malice, envy, apathy and brutality
What happened with Sigi's whistle was the last straw
'm sick and tired of persecutions, threats and perverse acts of revenge
: Did you sleep with him
(laughing   scornfully):   You   don't understand anything
: Did you sleep with him
(quietly): No
didn't sleep with him
: You're lying, aren't you
The Baroness looks at him
Then she gets up, about to leave the room again
At the same moment, somebody at the door
After a short gesture of irritation (irked): Come in
The steward appears
: Good evening
Could  talk to you for a moment, Baron
(annoyed): Can't it wait until tomorrow
:   It's  really   urgent
Normally, wouldn't have disturbed you so late
Annoyed, the Baron leaves the room with him
As he goes out, the steward greets the Baroness with a nod
Once the door is closed, she stops for a moment, goes to the window, and looks out pensive
She ends up going to the small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy
Her hands are shaking a little
She drinks from the glass, goes back to the window and looks out waiting, taking a sip from now and then
Below in the a few people walk around nervously
But it doesn't look particularly unusual
saddled horse is led into the stable
Finally, the door of the opens again
The Baron comes back inside
He looks distressed
The Baroness doesn't know whether this is the result of her conversation, or of the message brought by the steward
The Baron paces a few steps, pondering, then glances at his wife
Finally, she asks : What's going on
84 : They've shot the heir to the throne of Austria
In Sarajevo
70
/ The same setting as in Scene 57
The countryside in all its summer splendor
: The news spread around the village like wildfire
What would the consequences be
The first person who spoke the word , was severely contradicted
But once it had been uttered, it remained at the center of all our thoughts in a curiously stubborn way
wanted to go to the town as quickly as possible, in order to discuss it with Eva, what we should do if war broke out
Perhaps her father would now agree to an earlier marriage
asked the Baroness for the bicycle, with which Eva had visited her parents some time ago
The following weekend  planned use it to ride to town and see her
71
/ The schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of the manor house
He says good-bye to a maid, who closes the door behind him
Some  o
s
makes him look toward the steward's house: the steward comes out with the midwife, and it looks like he's throwing her out with a flood of angry insults
: When  went to the estate on Friday evening to pick up the bicycle, so  could take it with me to the school, and get going early, as the trip was a quite long one,  witnessed a strange confrontation: :
completely mad
Go if you want
He'll throw you out on your ear
Slandering other people and creating trouble
That's all we need now
Get out and never come back again
This is unbelievable
Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do
You're hysterical
(simultaneously):
'll go to the Baron
We'll see what he says
You won't silence me
Who do you think you are
You'll see
'll 85 tell him that you tried to prevent me from giving the police a statement
Angrily the steward slams the door behind him
At first the midwife doesn't know what to do
Finally she turns away from the door and starts to cross the yard
There, she sees the schoolteacher
She comes over to him
: Good afternoon, Mrs
Wagner
What's happening
(very excited): Good afternoon
Can borrow your bicycle
: It's not mine
: Could  borrow it just the same
:  just borrowed it myself going to ride to town, to see my fiancee
: Please
Lend it to me
: Why do you need it
Where do you want to go
:  must go to town
: What for
:  asked the steward for a carriage, but that stubborn fool won't agree to anything
Please
Lend me the bicycle
: Why
What is going on
After hesitating a while :  have to go to the police in town now know who committed all these crimes
(flabbergasted): Who
: Will you let me have the bicycle
: Why don't you tell me
: From now on  shall only talk to the police
won't let them insult me (turning to the steward's house): As you just saw
: Can't the doctor can lend you his horse
:  don't know how to ride
The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she doesn't respond, and says: 86 : Please
Believe me
(She hesitates and adds, now quietly and imploringly): My son told me who did it to him
He may loose his eyesight
Please, you let me have the bicycle
The schoolteacher looks at her
The midwife looks pitiful: she tries to smile at him pleadingly, tears are streaming down her face
Finally, he gives the bicycle to her
She grabs it quickly, says Thanks
and rides away
The schoolteacher remains behind, alone
He stands pensive, then he goes slowly back to the village
: The state that woman was in, who knew was level-headed, had deeply impressed me
What had her son told her, that she didn't dare tell anybody
72
/ The schoolteacher goes home
: With each step  took from the estate back to the school,  felt more foolish for having given away the bicycle
As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind the fence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes, Marie and a few other children
The shutters of the house are closed
As  passed the midwife's house,  saw Marie, Martin, and a few other children in the garden
The schoolteacher stops, watches the children
After a few moments, they notice that somebody is watching them
: Good evening, Sir
: Good evening, Marie
: Good evening, Sir
: What are you doing here
: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing
: But can't       you   see   that   the shutters are closed
87 : Yes
We were worried
We saw Mrs
Wagner riding off on a bicycle
So we wondered what had happened to Hansi
: Go home now
Nobody said you could come in here
The children go out slowly
They open the wooden gate in the fence, and go out into the street
They're visibly embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when they were doing something wrong
Some avoid the schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away
The schoolteacher looks annoyed
As Marie steps out of the garden door, he says: : You better go back home now, hurry
Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all
Again she greets him politely
: Good evening, Teacher
(reluctantly): Good evening
The children go away
The schoolteacher also goes on his way
After a few steps he turns around and looks at the children, then walks on
: Then  thought of Liesl's dream again
What if Liesl hadn't dreamt, but had known, that Hansi was going to be tortured
Whose crimes did she know of
Whose name had she refused to reveal
The strong interest of the children in Hansi seemed strange to me, considering that they had usually refused to have any contact with him because of his disability, or only dealt with him in a rather disdainful manner
The schoolteacher stops
He ponders about this
Then he goes back to the midwife's house
Suddenly  wondered why the midwife had closed the shutters of the house
Nobody in the village ever shut their house
Why had the midwife locked her boy in
He has reached the front of the house again
Indeed, with its closed shutters, it looks uninhabited
Only because of the tidy little front garden, could one tell that somebody lived there
The schoolteacher opens the garden gate and goes up to the house
He tries to open the door and then the shutters
Everything is well shut
He peers through the cracks in the wooden shutters
: Hansi
Can you hear me
Hansi
88 Nobody seems to answer
For a short moment the schoolteacher disappears behind the house, apparently looking for another way to get inside
But he soon comes back without having found anything
: If the midwife couldn't take care of him, she would have entrusted the boy to me, or to the doctor
But since the night he was mistreated,  hadn't seen him again
He leaves the midwife's house and hurries to the neighboring house, the doctor's
decided to ask the doctor directly
He enters the property, goes up to the entrance and rings
Nobody answers
He rings again, then he sees a note tacked up: The doctor's practice is closed until further notice 73
/ The pastor's wife and the schoolteacher stand before the closed front door
' : His daughter
Wasn't she with you at your school
: Yes, she was
' : And she didn't say anything
The schoolteacher shakes his head
They both remain silent and pensive
:  have a request
' : Yes
: Could  ask Marie and Martin
' : Don't you want to wait for my husband
He's at the church
The service will be over in a quarter of an hour
But if you insist
Please, come in
She opens the door and points to a chair
Please be seated
Please
'll fetch the kids for you
89 She leaves the room
The schoolteacher remains standing
Waiting
Finally, the pastor's wife comes back with the two children
and : Good evening, Sir
: Good evening
' : Don't you want to sit down
(who hasn't thought of it): Yes
Perhaps
With pleasure
They   sit   down
The  children   sit  opposite   the schoolteacher
' : Can  offer you something
, (smiling faintly):  cup of coffee
Like during the piano lessons First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone with the children
: Yes, with pleasure
That's very kind of you
' : 'll be back in a minute
The schoolteacher turns to the children: : Did you know that the Doctor was leaving Eichwald
Short
: No
: But you don't seem surprised at my question
: Our mother told us when she came to fetch us
:   And   Xenia   didn't    tell    you anything about it
: No
She looks at Martin who confirms it: : No
(incredulously): Not a word
It's very unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a trip
(unimpressed):   Xenia   never    talks   much about home
: Well, that's something completely different
90 Apparently Marie doesn't take it as a further question, and remains silent
:  get the feeling you're hiding something from me
: What
: That's what 'd really like to know
Then the schoolteacher turns to Martin: : When you were looking for Hansi a while ago, what did you want from him
Short
: We were worried
He's ill
: 'm asking Martin
: Yes
He isn't well
And since his mother is gone
we thought, we should go and pay him a visit
The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further this way
: Did you ever ask yourselves who could have treated Hansi that way
Then the schoolteacher adds: And Sigi
And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden
And who set fire to the barn
Well
: Yes, of course we wondered
: Well
: We discussed it with Father
He said it must be a sick person
The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on
:    Sigi   was    with    you at Thanksgiving
And so was Hansi
:  don't understand
With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders
: What did they do to you
(doesn't seem to understand): Who
91 : Sigi and Hansi
(as above): Why
:   They    obviously   were   being punished
For what
(as above):  don't know
: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be punished
What for
(as above):  don't know
Why do you ask us
:   You're  an   intelligent   girl, Marie
Don't try and play dumb
:  don't understand you, Sir
You should talk with Father about this or with Mother
Shall  go get her
The schoolteacher looks at her
: Martin, would you please get her
Martin gets up and is about to go to the door
: Stay here, Martin: 'll talk to your parents when  consider it's the right time
Now, 'm talking to you
And  expect you tell me the truth
Martin sits down after exchanging a glance with Marie again
Where were you on the evening Hansi was found
(doesn't seem to understand): At home
:  mean after the confirmation
At that moment, the pastor's wife enters with the coffee cups on a tray
' : There we are
The coffee will be ready in a minute
She puts the tray on the table
Turns to the schoolteacher, friendly as ever: Were the children able to help you
The schoolteacher looks at Marie, then he answers: : 'm afraid not
They don't know anything, either
' : That's really odd
doctor can't vanish into thin air
What about his patients
92 (to the children) Didn't his daughter tell you anything at school
The schoolteacher gets up, ready to leave
: No
'm sorry if  disturbed you
' : Why don't you stay
My husband will be back any moment, and the coffee is almost ready
: That's very kind of you, but 'm really worried about the midwife's son
' : And she didn't say when she'd be back
:  didn't ask her
She caught me off guard
She was completely panicked
The pastor's wife shakes her head thoughtfully
' : Strange
Wait a second
think that's my husband
And indeed, outside one can hear the   and then the  of the pastor
The wife goes to the door to open it
The pastor appears
(surprised to see the schoolteacher): Good evening
' : Good evening
The schoolteacher has been anxiously waiting for you
(to the schoolteacher): Yes
: Yes
'd like to have a quick chat with you
The pastor doesn't really understand what can be so urgent, and why the schoolteacher, which was unusual for him, came to see him in the evening
But he remains friendly: : Please
We'd better go to my study
It's quieter there
The schoolteacher nods to the pastor's wife, who is glad that the required meeting can now take place, while the pastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture
As the pastor opens the door of the , he asks: : Well, how can  help you
They enter the room and the pastor offers the schoolteacher a chair
Then he realizes that the windows are open and closes them, as the schoolteacher starts to speak
:  spoke to the midwife today: she said she now knew who tortured her son
("who"
): She does
93 : She'll only     tell   the   police
That's why she went to town
(doesn't quite understand        what    the schoolteacher is getting at): Well
: She left the boy behind alone and has locked the whole house
: Locked it
(nods):  went to the doctor's next door to ask him what was going on, whether he was taking care of the child or
But there's a piece of paper saying that the practice is closed until further notice
The doctor and his children have disappeared
The pastor has almost finished closing the windows
He pauses and turns to the schoolteacher: (stunned): What do you mean
(shrugs):  don't know
thought you might have been informed
That's why 'm here
After a startled  the pastor shakes his head: :  have no idea
He   finishes  closing   the  windows
Then   he  goes thoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down in front of him
: Xenia
Wasn't his daughter in school
: Yes, she was
She never mentioned anything
The pastor ponders
Then, after a while :  asked Marie and Martin
They both know nothing either
(looks   up   to    the  schoolteacher, "stunned"): Why should they
The schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further: :  don't know
When  went to the midwife's place, they were there with a few others in the garden
("doesn't understand"): To do what
: They were looking for the boy
(as before): Why
: They wanted to help him
: So what 94 (hesitates, then says):  don't know how to say it
have the feeling they're hiding something
(refuses): What
(keeps on searching hesitantly for his words):  don't know
(finally he dares to come out with his suspicion): When the doctor had his accident
last year, you remember, Suddenly the children were in his garden
Supposedly, in order to help Xenia
(doesn't understand): Yes
and
The schoolteacher, uneasy, breathes hard
He knows that his suspicions will seem odd, and senses that the pastor won't go along with then
: Nothing
had forgotten it
Today, it came back to my mind again
(as before):  don't understand
: When they found the Baron's son
the last time he had been seen, he was with the children
The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face slowly freezes to a mask of refusal: : What are you getting at
Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction
But he has already gone too far to backtrack
After a he goes on: :  couple of days before Hansi was almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter had predicted precisely that to me
Supposedly, she had dreamed it
The police thinks she's lying
Who told her about it
Who announced it to her
Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few steps, then, after another , turns again to the schoolteacher
His face is ashen, and he can hardly speak: : If  understand you correctly, you're saying that your pupils, my children included, committed these crimes
Is that right
The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful gesture
He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role
Another
Then, the pastor continues: Do you realize what you're saying
He breathes heavily, tries to control his emotions
Do you know
95 His voice fails
His chin starts to shake, tears flood his eyes, and he suddenly turns away
The schoolteacher who has been looking at him, now looks down and stays where he is without saying a word
After a while, the pastor has regained enough control of himself to turn back to the schoolteacher: assume that 'm the first person to whom you've uttered this monstrosity
Mute reaction of the schoolteacher ("of course")
If you ever dare to bother other people with it, if you publicly denounce respectable families and their children in this abject way,  shall make sure -- and you can take my word for it -- that you will go to prison
The schoolteacher wants to reply something, but the pastor continues: 've seen quite a lot during my work as a pastor, but 've never come across anything as repulsive as this
He looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain: One can tell that you have no children
Otherwise,   you    wouldn't   stoop   to   such viciousness
You have a sick mind
wonder how the school authorities could let you loose among those poor creatures
'll have a word with the authorities at the proper time
And now please leave my house
never want to see you here again
74
'  / The steward, his wife and the schoolteacher try to break into the house
First the steward tries several keys
As this doesn't work, they break down a door at the rear of the house and go in
: The midwife never came back
waited until the morning, two days later
Then,  went to the manor house to inform the Baron
He referred me to the steward and said to open the house immediately and to look after the disabled boy
75
'  / 96 The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife search through the house
Because of the closed shutters, its rooms are veiled in half-light
Several times they call "Hansi"
, "Hello, Hansi, where are you"
, which can faintly be heard under the narrator's voice
In the midwife's bedroom, the schoolteacher notices a photo: it shows the doctor, an unknown woman, and Xenia as a small girl
The boy is nowhere to be found
:  had never come to the midwife's house and felt uncomfortable at the idea of barging into somebody else's house without asking
It was strange, but we were still seeking and calling out anxiously Hansi's name, and  already knew, that we were searching in vain
Anyone who knew the midwife also knew how devoted she was to her disabled child, and that she would never have left her wounded Hansi all alone
The three searchers, who have found nothing, meet again in the stairwell
76
'  / The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come out from behind the house, leave the property and go their separate ways on the street
All that is left is the empty house with its closed shutters
: During the next few weeks, the village gossip-factory worked overtime
Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father
He and the midwife had tried to abort the child so that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be found out, and that's how the child became disabled
Others even went as far as to claim that there was something fishy about the death of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be surprised, if the two weren't responsible for it
77
: / The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the street before the school, the estate's administrative buildings and the manor house
There is nobody to be seen
: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously knew about the hidden crimes of his parents
97 Suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor and the midwife, as potential murderers, were also the perpetrators of all the other crimes
It was suspected, that the doctor had wanted to spare his legitimate children and himself public disclosure of his guilt, and had therefore fled with them
Apparently he had taken the disabled boy with him out of guilt
Understandably enough, he had left behind his accomplice and the mother of the disgraced child
The fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried to catch up with the man who had happily escaped, was the cause of a great deal of laughter
The deserted estate is decorated with flags
On July 28th Austria declared war on Serbia
It was followed on Saturday, August 1rst, by the German declaration of war on Russia, and on France the following Monday
78
/ : The villagers are about to take their seats
The smaller children are sitting with their parents on the pews
All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia are in uniform
Flags are planted
Joyful excitement reigns everywhere
Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and their son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the front row
: On the Sunday between those dates, the whole village came to the festive service
An atmosphere of expectation and departure was in the air
From now on nothing would be the same
Only a few days ago everybody would have called the life they lived as God's will, worthy of being lived, and would have shunned any change
The strange joy with which the coming war was greeted, showed that this certainty of order and security was based on very shaky foundations
-: Of all the adult leading characters of the film, aside from the doctor and the midwife
Also of Eva and her father
98 In the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was flaring up, the events that had shaken Eichwald, had become an irrelevant
In the face of the coming war, Eva's father had taken his daughter back and, at her pleading, had come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place where his future son-in-law was living and working
The prospect, that  might soon call this beloved creature my wife, turned this day also into a solemn day for me
The pastor never mentioned our conversation again
Our relationship was limited to what was required professionally
He apparently never went through with his threat to denounce me to the school-authorities
-
The schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands and cues them to begin
They start
We see them one after the other
At the end we see Marie: she wears the white ribbon in her hair
Today, more than a quarter of a century later, toward the end of my life, and several years after the end of a second war that was to change this world in a more cruel and radical way than the first one, the one we faced at the time, wonder if the events of those days and our silence about them, weren't the germ of the tragedy toward which we were heading
Didn't we all know secretly what had happened in our midst
Hadn't we, in a way, made it possible by closing our eyes
Didn't we keep our mouths shut because otherwise we would have had to wonder if the misdeeds of these children, of our children, weren't actually the result of what we'd been teaching them
The image of Marie singing with the shining white ribbon freezes
was drafted at the start of the third year of the war
After the war,  sold the house in Grundbach that  had inherited from my father, who had died in the meantime, and with the money opened a tailor's shop in the town, where still live now
never saw anybody from the village again
Over the   the   begin
Once the narrator's  has gone silent, we listen to Bach's solemn chorale
The children sing beautifully
