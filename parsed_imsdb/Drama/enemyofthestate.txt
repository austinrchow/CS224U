(into the phone) This is Sam Albert
Put me through to Langley
Dick Marshal's office
- place packed with , computers and
sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's really watching is-- -  at the counter, his back to , ordering a cup of coffee
The  glances at  off the mirror behind the counter
walks in and joins
Albert's primed
We'll let him stew for a day and then drop the tape
looks over at the -
He came in four minutes ago
(pause) 'mon
They're about to start for the front door when an unmarked police car pulls up in front
rowdy group of   flood in, loud and busy
By the time they pass,  and  are gone
The -  scans the coffee shop and sees the back door swinging shut
- and  run down the street, through an alley and over a fence to another street
They slow as they approach the parked Taurus
takes the wheel with beside him
They pull into traffic
Things look good, but then the and a   scream up behind, lights flashing
- dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes alive
- picks up the radio-mic
One-Lincoln-Nine
In pursuit of two suspects, one matching description of Robert Dean, wanted in connection with a homicide
Suspects northbound on-- - Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront
's at his best, putting distance between himself and the cops at every turn
Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end
slams into reverse
They screech backward, tires smoking
Too late
The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing them in
hits the brakes
He looks back at the dead-end and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp gives it everything
If they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing wall
Feeling lucky
Not particularly, no
They hit the ramp full speed
The front end bottoms at the Taurus bounces skyward
Tires clip the wall as the car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled with coal
They aren't going anywhere
Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop
climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his gun and nears
Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered
Steam hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere
shimmies out through a broken side window
He barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so
His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal, which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him
Shit
(to ) 'm stuck
Help me out
He looks back to see that  is hanging out the driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas
(on waist radio) One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects 'd into a coal car at the Fullbright rail-yards
Requesting back-up, fire and ambulance
An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail- yard and stops
The  turns as  and  hop out
(flashing ) What do you got
Two murder suspects
One's wounded, the other's maybe dead
Thank you
draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly shoots the  dead
(to ) Check inside
is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to dig himself out of the coal
inspects the Taurus interior for anything of interest
scans the area
(to  as he searches
) hate doin' cops,  really do
You won't mind
Didn't mind that Rachel Banks
Didn't mind doin' her one bit
(seeing 's shoe) Your lawyer friend buried over there
can only gurgle blood
pops the Taurus's trunk had looks inside
digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for Dean
Then  sees him-- 's :  down off the side of the coal-car, lodged in the coal pile
He's safe, but not once discovers he's not in the car
pushes in the cigarette lighter
dumps everything from the Taurus into the unmarked car
suddenly fade in
digs faster, looking for , as  approaches with his pistol, clambering around for
Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes
Find Dean
starts to back out, just as the Taurus's cigarette lighter pops out
grabs it
eyes the glowing lighter
Then he eyes
Shit
ignites the gas
-
fireball explodes, consuming all - the car, ,
is blown off his feet from the concussion
(scrambling away) Fuck-- wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach
watches from the shadows as flames incinerate everything

) just came from my office at Langley
Senator Albert called me there
- and  dine with  at a restaurant overlooking the Potomac

He's upset

You have any idea what kind of position this-- He's carrying the damn flag We're not doing anything with Sam Albert
He thinks we're stupid
He found an   tracker on his motor home today
It's not ours
It was pulsing on your  frequencies

It's ending at your doorstep
(
) Brill's dead
- rides in the back of the car, a cellular to his ear
What about-- (
) We don't know
Explain that
: - The room is crammed with people as  talks over the phone
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body
What about the tape
We think it was on Brill

And if it wasn't

) Robert, is it safe to be talking on the phone like this
- sits on a bed while talking into a modified cellular computer
The screen shows his current call signal re-routing between relay stations
(into phone) 've re-routed the call
They can't trace it

) can tell you this: That anti- terrorism bill you were so worked up about
don't think it's gonna pass
phone number locks on the screen-- Got it
- The phone on the nightstand begins to wakes as his wife rolls to the other side of the bed
He grabs his scrambler phone and goes into-- - closes the door and waits as scrambled lines connect
Finally, a confirming tone
Yeah

The needle snaps on
He looks at  and
They're ready
All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the staircase
One flight, two
Then  stops
The needle says they're close
motions
Their target's on two
They move down the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a drifting from an apartment
Someone's up at this hour
They move on
watches the needle as it moves
He motions  and  to a door
puts a reverse-viewer against the peep-hole
's :  view of an entryway and living room light bleeds from an
source
Beyond that there's no sign of life
puts a contact-mic against the door and listens to   somewhere inside, possibly the phone call
nods to  who quickly picks the lock while  eyes the hall
After a nervous moment, the door opens and , and  enter
- They spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for the target
They near the room with light
Using a mini-mirror, looks around the bend to see-- There's a briefcase on the bed
They enter
From the bathroom they hear sounds of
They slowly approach
Wood again  beneath them

signals "on three"
He counts, and they  the door open to see-- --a cellular phone taped to a Baby-Monitor

An  immediately displays the caller's name; , , along with his social-security number and date of birth

Over the phone's mouthpiece, he holds an electronic Voice-Mask which alters his voice into an old man's

is trying to pry the door open with his fingers
No use
(over radio) Get outa there, guys
While  continues on the door,  runs to the window
Throughout this,  will stand in the middle of the room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the fireplace
God damit smiles
and now he starts laughing a little
What's so fuckin' funny

It's over
We've been fucked with our pants on
The framed picture is of Senator   and (') We broke into her condo

The   roll in crouched positions, weapons drawn
#1 doesn't move,  freezes like a deer in headlights,  stares with cold, dead eyes
#2 Two more  arrive
and  drop their guns
#1 They do so
and  go room to room making sure no one else is lurking
In the bedroom, they find the briefcase
Inside the briefcase-- --listening bugs, installation equipment and compromising photos of the Senator with Christa

) Oh my God
What's going on
Back in the living room,  has walked through the broken-in apartment door to see ,  and lying on the floor at gun point

She turns

Who are you
My name's Robert Dean

Two inexpensive cars that don't seem to belong there sit in front of a large home

Across from him are and
They sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before enters in bathrobe and pajamas

Senator-- Senator, there were some things couldn't tell you over the phone
What kinds of things
Mr
Dean has a video tape from the hotel room in Boston
(pause) see
It's actually -1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator

Me neither, but the upshot is 've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good
So
how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life
don't want any money
And believe me,  have no interest in ruining your life
'm not interested in this tape
You're not
Then what do you want from the Senator
want him to look at a different tape
People have been killed
Lives have been ruined

And  want you to bring the fury of God himself upon this man

Once again, he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into the bathroom
After waiting for the signal that the line's clear

These guys are always making speeches
It's an important speech, Eric
There's gonna be a vote today
(on ) Today we face a threat to that creed
Certain individuals in our intelligence community believe they're entitled to examine lives in minute detail, and claim to do it in the name of the common good
If they're voting today, hasn't everyone pretty much made up their minds
Actually, this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically
Why

) He saw the light, my son
and  whip around-- Dad

They head upstairs as  continues on

Some of you may say, "Fine

God forbid George Orwell's version of America becomes a reality
We are that close
