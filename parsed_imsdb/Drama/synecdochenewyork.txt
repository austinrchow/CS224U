Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout

faucet explodes and smacks him in the forehead
He is sent staggering backwards with a yelp, into the far wall, his razor flying and blood pouring from a jagged cut above his right eyebrow
Off-screen, we hear the pounding footsteps of someone running toward us
Half of Caden's face is covered with shaving cream
Rivulets of blood intermingle with it
Water shoots out where the tap was, spraying the mirror, which is spattered with blood
Adele, dressed in heavily paint-splattered clothes, hurries in and takes in the scene: the wet, the mess, the blood

Probably
It looks like a mudflap

neurologist
Yes, a brain expert

Fine
just thought from the way you asked -- thought maybe you said urologist
Why do  need to see a neurologist
For a look-see
The eyes are part of the brain, after all
That's not true, is it
Why would  say it if it weren't true
It just doesn't seem right

Claire primps in the bureau mirror

Tammy takes down the note
Sammy's explaining too much
Feels expository
Needs to be shorthand, like, "Jeremy big
" Hazel writes that down
They all continue down the hall
Caden
Can we stop for a second
Sure
If Hazel's in love with Sammy and Caden's in love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden turns to me and says, "It's obvious he's a substitute for me
"  think then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry

He defecates on the sidewalk
wild- eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden
As he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's show
It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like the one Caden's in
In the painting, a man in a white t- shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden
The flower petals blow away
Caden tries to limp after them

Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor
The scene in the play is dull
People walk back and forth aimlessly
Various passersby on the street have hacking coughs
Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to the director's table
Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair- back

Millicent looks over at the funeral scene

You don't move around
You don't talk to people
It's not -- Okay, folks, let's run it
The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite minister addresses the mourners
Everything is more complicated than you think
You only see a tenth of what is true
There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose
But maybe you won't know for twenty years
And you'll never ever trace it to its source
And you only get one chance to play it out
Just try and figure out your own divorce
And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create
Even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second
Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born
But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right
And it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really
And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along
Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved

He hates me
Oh God have disappointed him and he hates me
The one person who should be able to see me and he won't look
He will never look again

No note from Adele
He gets out of bed, glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection

She's a slut, anyway
He sticks a bookmark in the book, puts it on the night table, turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes open
'  (') Maybe  can ask Adele for a raise
It's been three years
do a good job
God, 'm so tired tonight
'm getting old
'm lonely here

Look at the night table for a note from Adele
Caden gets up and glances at the night table
type-written : Adele died of lung cancer last night
You may stay on if you like
' Look shocked
Weep
Caden looks shocked, then weeps
'  (') Go into the kitchen and -- The voice stops
Caden stops
He waits
Nothing
He takes out the earpiece and looks at it, shakes it, then slips it back in his ear
Nothing
He waits
In the distance he hears wailing and gun shots

Caden exits apartment 31Y
Old person #2 (actor) stands in the hallway and faces away, unmoving

197INT
- 31Y   - 2055 -  197 Dark
The unfinished, back-of-a-facade of the set is apparent
Caden walks down endless plywood stairs
The bowels of the building: fake water pipes, electrical cords
198EXT
(
) - 2055 - MORNING198 No lights
Vague daylight drifts in from high warehouse windows, from which cardboard has fallen
Deadly quiet, abandoned
Caden passes the occasional body on the street
Fires smolder in buildings
The streets are flooded with sewer water
Buildings are draped with massive tarps
Behind a fence are piles of bodies

He gets in a golf cart and drives through the deserted street sets
202EXT
(

He sees footprints
He gets out and follows them, spots a woman ahead walking with a suitcase
He hurries as much as he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to catch up with her
Hello
The woman turns
She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness
(') Where is everybody
Mostly dead
Some have left
Would you sit with me for a moment
'm very tired
And lonely
The woman smiles at Caden
They sit on a log
(') feel like  know you
was the mother in Ellen's dream
Perhaps from there
Yes
That's it
Yes
You seem a bit older than  remember
() That dream was quite a while ago
He's silent
The woman touches his hand
didn't mean to say you look old

Everyone's dreams in all those apartments
All those secrets we'll never know
That's the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know
It's true
'm sorry the experiment didn't work
wanted it to with all my heart
wanted to do that picnic with my daughter
feel 've disappointed you terribly
No
No
am so proud of you
Caden starts to tear up
All  want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness
For me to be the most special person in the world to just one person
know, baby
know
He looks at her tentatively
She's looking into his eyes directly, clearly, kindly
She smiles
(') You're going to be fine
Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes
Strings of snot pour from his nose
The woman holds him, gently takes off his wig, and strokes his sparse hair
He looks out over her shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the warehouse
His rheumy eyes light up
know what to do with this play now
have an idea
think -- The screen goes black fast
