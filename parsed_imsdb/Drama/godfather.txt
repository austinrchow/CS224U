There is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering: While this remains, we hear: " believe in America
" Suddenly we are watching in  ,  , a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion
America has made my fortune
As he speaks,   imperceptibly begins to loosen
raised my daughter in the American fashion;  gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family
She found a boy friend, not an Italian
She went to the movies with him, stayed out late
Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend
They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her
She resisted; she kept her honor
So they beat her like an animal
When  went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain
He can barely speak; he is weeping now
went to the Police like a good American
These two boys were arrested and brought to trial
The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence
Suspended sentence
They went free that very day stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me
Then  said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather
By now,   is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home
The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows
We are watching  over the shoulder of
sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and   stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine
We can  music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help
don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee
even though our wives are friends
What do you want of me
'll give you anything you want, but do what ask
And what is that Bonasera
whispers into the 's ear
No
You ask for too much
ask for Justice
The Court gave you justice
An eye for an eye
But your daughter is still alive
Then make them suffer as she suffers
How much shall  pay you
Both  and  react
You never think to protect yourself with real friends
You think it's enough to be an American
All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me
But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice
And you don't ask in respect or friendship
And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder
for money
America has been good to me
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera
But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you
Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs
Be my friend
Good
From me you'll get Justice
Godfather
Some day, and that day may never come,  would like to call upon you to do me a service in return
:  ( 1945) of the   in bright daylight
There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens
There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine
stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son:  and , all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party
He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome
They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies
The entire family poses for a family portrait:  , , , his wife, , and their children, and his wife, , and their ; , the bride, and her bridegroom,
As they move into the pose,   seems preoccupied
Where's Michael
He'll be here Pop, it's still early
Then the picture will wait for him
Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the  moves back to the house
gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor,
She returns it
Then he moves to his wife
Sandra, watch the kids
They're running wild
You watch yourself
kisses his , and follows  , passing the wine barrels, where a group of   nervously wait crooks a finger at , who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows
:   ( 1945) Outside the main gate of the Mall,   in suits, working together with a  in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks
We  the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance
stops at a limousine and copies down the number
, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of   as he makes his way to embrace   in the courtyard
The  walk down another row of parked cars
Put another number in the notebook
shiney new Cadillac with wooden bumpers
, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies
Paulie
wine
He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief
hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him
You look terrif on the floor
What are you, a dance judge
Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood
see everything is okay
nods and leaves;  takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance
The  walk down another row of parked cars
Put another number in the notebook
, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a -- , her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes
The  move on to other parked cars, when  storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by and
Buddy, this is a private party
The  doesn't answer, but points to the  of the sedan
menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him
The  merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word
steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by , , and another
He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to
Goddamn
don't respect nothing
: '  ( 1945) sits quietly behind his massive desk in the dark study
a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what can do
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy
And you see, Godfather
(he wrings his hands, unable to express himself) He
my daughter
they
You want him to stay in this country
Godfather, you understand everything
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen
(impressed) An Act of Congress
(nodding) It will cost
The  shrugs; such are the way with those things; nods
Is that all
Godfather, thank you
(backing out, enthusiastically) Oh, wait till you see the cake made for your beautiful daughter
backs out, all smiles, and nods to the
rises and moves to the Venetian blinds
Who do  give this job to
The  moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds
Not to one of our paisans
give it to a Jew Congressman in another district
Who else is on the list for today
The  is peeking out to the  around the barrel, waiting to see him
Francesco Nippi
His nephew has been refused parole
bad case
:  ( 1945) : waits nervously by the barrel
(
) His father worked with you in the freight yards when you were young
sitting alone, grotesque and quiet
(
) He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you
: '  ( 1945) The  turns to
Is it necessary
You understand him better than anyone
The  nods to this
Turns back to the blinds and peeks out
:  ( 1945) : , dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain, leads   through the wedding crowd, occasionally stopped and greeted by  of the family
: '  ( 1945) The , inside the office, peering through the blinds, following them
:  ( 1945) moves through the crowd, embraces  and introduces her to his
:   ( 1945) The 's eyes peering through the blinds
:   ( 1945) and  settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine
She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality
've never seen anything like it
told you  had a lot of relatives
looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop
We see what she sees: Her interest is caught by   standing by the wine barrels
(amused) Michael, what are those men doing
They're waiting to see my father
They're talking to themselves
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right
Why do they bother him on a day like this
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day
:   ( 1945) , the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom,
He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples
She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various  for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds
In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest
, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold
Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin
(whispered) Cut it out, Connie
The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around 's arm, is fat with money
(
) What do you think
Twenty grand
little distance away, a young man,  , catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse
Who knows
Maybe more
Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse
Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding
is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to , the Maid of Honor
Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his  is talking with some
He bends over and whispers something into 's ear
and the  are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh
Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra
's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter
Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais
and  are gone
: '  &  ( 1945) The empty hallway
The bathroom door opens and surreptitiously steps out
She looks up where  is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up
She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs
:   ( 1945) and
(in a spooky low tone) Michael, that scarey guy
Is he a relative
She has picked out
No
His name is Luca Brasi
You wouldn't like him
(Excited) Who is he
(Sizing her up) You really want to know
Yes
Tell me
You like spaghetti
You know  love spaghetti
Then eat your spaghetti and 'll tell you a Luca Brasi story
She starts to eat her spaghetti
She begins eating, looking at him eagerly
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business
They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did
Al Capone
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them
He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths
Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off
Michael
Then the legs at the knees
Michael you're trying to scare me
Then the thighs where they joined the torso
Michael,  don't want to hear anymore
Then Luca turned to the other man
Michael,  love you
who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated
The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story
never know when you're telling me the truth
told you you wouldn't like him
He's coming over here
comes toward them to meet   halfway, just near their table
Tom
Tom, 'd like you to meet Kay Adams
(having survived ) How do you do
My brother, Tom Hagen
Hello Kay
Your father's inside, doing some business
(privately) He's been asking for you
Thanks Tom
smiles and moves back to the house,  ominously following
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in
He's a good lawyer
: '  ( 1945) at the window
He has seen the intimacy of the (
) Don Corleone
turns to the stiffly formal , and he moves forward to kiss his hand
He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech
(with difficulty) Don Corleone
am honored, and grateful
that you invited me to your home
on the wedding day of your
daughter
May their first child
be a masculine child
pledge my never ending loyalty
(he offers the envelope) For your daughter's bridal purse
Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend
takes it, and then 's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful
Let me leave you, Don Corleone know you are busy
He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with
breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to
'm sure it's the most generous gift today
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand
Also, some of the Judges
they've all sent gifts
And another call from Virgil Sollozzo
is not pleased
The action is narcotics
Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin
Also he has access to this country
He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law
For that we get a piece of the action, couldn't find out how much
Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action
They call Sollozzo the Turk
He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids
He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger
Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint
Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man
nods
He's his own boss, and very competent
And with prison record
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States
He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man
That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify
When did he call
This morning
On a day like this
Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now
Write that down before you forget it
The Turk will wait
We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside
In Italian, with unmistakable style
What that
It sounds like Johnny
He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light
It is Johnny
He came all the way from California to be at the wedding
Should  bring him in
No
Let the people enjoy him
You see
He is a good godson
It's been two years
He's probably in trouble again
:  ( 1945) on the bandstand, singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding
didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane
Sure
used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career
finishes the song and the  screams with delight
They call out for another when   appears
My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat
At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to , who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his
kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy
When  got the Wedding invitation  knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather
Can  do something for you still
You're not too rich, or too famous that  can't help you
'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and
my career, 'm almost washed up
He's very disturbed
The  indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice
He turns to Tell Santino to come in with us
He should hear some things
They go, leaving  scanning the party looking for
: '  ( 1945) glances up the staircase
Sonny
Then he goes up
: '   ( 1945) and  are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing against the door
Her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy
Sonnyeeeeeeee
Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body
But there is a knocking as well
They stop, freeze in that position
(
) Sonny
Sonny, you in there
: '   ( 1945) Outside,  by the door
The old man wants you; Johnny's here
he's got a problem
(
) Okay
One minute
hesitates
We  's head bouncing against the door again
leaves
: '  ( 1945) By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio
Both  and  cannot refrain from laughing
The smiles
enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes
All right, Hollywood
Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work
He owns the studio
Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller
And the main character is a guy just like me
wouldn't even have to act, just be myself
The  is silent, stern
You take care of your family
Sure
He glances at , who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can
You look terrible
want you to eat well, to rest
And spend time with your family
And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want
It's too late
All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot
'll make him an offer he can't refuse
He takes  to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt
Now go back to the party and leave it to me
He closes the door, smiling to himself
Turns to
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes
leave right after that
Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important
No, give him a living
But never let him know the family's business
What else, Tom
've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait
He won't last out the night
This saddens the
He sighs
Genco will wait for me
Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco
Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us
And Michael
All my sons
(to ) Tom,  want you to go to California tonight
Make the arrangements
But don't leave until  come back from the hospital and speak to you
Understood
Understood
:  ( 1945) Now all the wedding  excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake:  is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude
The  is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom
Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses
:  ( 1945) Silence
, late day
The  are gone single black car is in the courtyard
is behind the driver's seat: the  enters the car, looks at , who sits between  and  in the rear seat
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right
Tom said he'd take care of it
The  pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through the gate of the great Corleone Mall
:   ( 1945) long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can see a grouping of  , some old and some young, but all plump and dressed in black
and his  move toward the end
But then the slows, putting his hand on 's shoulder stops and turns toward his
The two looks at one another for some time
then lifts his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on 's uniform
What was this for
For bravery
And this
For killing a man
What miracles you do for strangers
fought for my country
It was my choice
And now, what do you choose to do
'm going to finish school
Good
When you are finished, come and talk to me
have hopes for you
Again they regard each other without a word
turns, and continues on
watches a moment, and then follows
:   ( 1945) enters the hospital room, moving closest to He is followed by his ,  and the
(whispered) Genco, 've brought my sons to pay their respects
And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from Hollywood
is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn
Godfather, Godfather, it's your daughter's wedding day, you cannot refuse me
Cure me, you have the power
have no such power
but Genco, don't fear death
(with a sly wink) It's been arranged, then
You blaspheme
Resign yourself
You need your old Consigliere
Who will replace me
(suddenly) Stay with me Godfather
Help me meet death
If he sees you, he will be frightened and leave me in peace
You can say a word, pull a few strings, eh
We'll outwit that bastard as we outwitted all those others
(clutching his hand) Godfather, don't betray me
The  motions all the others to leave the room
They do
He returns his attention to , holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death
:  ( 1945) : The interior of a non-stop Constellation
is one of the very few passengers on this late flight
He looks like any young lawyer on a business trip
He is tired from the difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed during the wedding
On the seat next to him is an enormous, bulging briefcase
He closes his eyes
:   ( 1945) The honeymoon hotel:  and
is in his undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the contents
prepares herself in the large marble bathroom
She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and tries to get his interest
: '  ( 1945) in his office
sitting near to him
Luca,  am worried about this man Sollozzo
Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias
Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made
Learn what he has under his fingernails
:
( 1945) The hallway of an apartment building
enters, climbs two steps at a time
He knocks, and then whispers
It's me, Sonny
The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling him into the apartment
: '  ( 1945) 's tiny room
He is partly dressed
He kneels and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked trunk
He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof vest
He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then puts on his shirt and jacket
He takes his gun, quickly disassembles, checks, and reassembles it
And leaves
: '  ( 1945) of   thinking quietly
:   ( 1945) and  on a train, speeding on their way to New Hampshire
:  ( 1945) , in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty subway train
:  ( 1945) on the Constellation
He reaches into his briefcase, and takes out several pictures and papers
One photograph is of a smiling man,  , linked arm in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a lovely young child star to his immediate right
considers other papers
: '  ( 1945) looks, and then moves  into an embrace
He straightens his arms and looks at  deeply
Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns
:    ( 1945) stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase
opens the gate, and  enters
:   ( 1945) and  comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand
You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom,  had to check you out
thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me
(a piece of statuary) Florence, thirteenth century
Decorated the garden of a king
They cross the garden and head toward the stables
'm going to show you something beautiful
They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "
" are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as  approaches
You like horses
like horses, love 'em
Beautiful, expensive Racehorses
The animal inside is truly beautiful
whispers to him with true love in his voice
Khartoum
Kartoum
You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs
bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse
But 'm not going to race him 'm going to put him out to Stud
:    ( 1945) and  sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by
Great paintings hang on the walls
The meal is elaborate and sumptuous
Mr
Corleone is Johnny's Godfather
That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor  can't give
But he should try me again on anything else
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first
Understood
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie
don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork
'm German-Irish
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because hate that pinko punk and 'm going to run him out of the Movies
And 'll tell you why
He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges
For five years  had this girl under training; singing lessons
Acting lessons
Dancing lessons
We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars-- was going to make her a star
'll be even more frank, just to show you that 'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents
That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass 've ever ad and 've had them all over the world
Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off
She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous :
( 1945) An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: "   , " next to an open-faced fruit market
dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building
This is
:    ( 1945) Looking toward the staircase we can hear 's footsteps before he actually rises into view
He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair
But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous
He is greeted at the head of the stairs by , who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself
For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions
Finally,  is taken into the 's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced
They are very respectful of one another
Folding chairs are brought in by , and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the , , , , , and
The  is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas  has brought no one
Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men:  and
My business is heroin,  have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production
My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss
The risk is nothing, the profits enormous
Why do you come to me
Why do deserve your generosity
need two million dollars in cash
more important,  need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences
Be my friend
What percentages for my family
Thirty per cent
In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family
nods toward
My compliments
'll take care of them from my share
So
receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection
No worries about operations, is that what you tell me
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance,  congratulate you Don Corleone
There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension
The  is about to give his answer
said  would see you because 've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect
(pause) But 'll say no to you
We feel this around the room
'll give you my reasons
have many, many friends in Politics
But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling
They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice
and they think narcotics is dirty business
takes a breath
No
how a man makes his living is none of my business
But this proposition of yours is too risky
All the people in my family lived well the last ten years,  won't risk that out of greed
Are you worried about security for your million
No
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also
This startles ; he blurts out
The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment
hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him
Everyone is the room knows that  has stepped out of line
Young people are greedy, and they have no manners
They speak when they should listen
But  have a sentimental weakness for my children, and 've spoiled them, as you see
But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final
nods, understands that this is the dismissal
He glances one last time at
He rises; all the others do as well
He bows to the , shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave
When the footsteps can no longer be heard: The  turns to
Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking
think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl
are carrying an enormous floral display with the word " " spelled out in flowers
What is this nonsense
It's from Johnny
It was announced this morning
He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film
: '  ( 1945) It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably , is sleeping
Soft light bathes the room from the large windows
We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize
He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets
Something wet
He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet
He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood
He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas
He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed
He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed
Just blood from the hacked neck
White reedy tendons show
He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly
Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood
tries to scream; but cannot
No sound comes out
Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from , who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him

Nodding
Send Johnny my congratulations
---------------------------------------- -------- ( 12 & 12 ) : :   ( 1945) Fifth Avenue in the snow
Christmas week
People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents
and  exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen
And what do you want for Christmas
Just you
They kiss
:   ( 1945) a wooden radio, playing quiet Music the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight
(
) We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses
The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together
What will your father say
As long as  tell him beforehand he won't object
He'll be hurt, but he won't object
What time do they expect us
For dinner
Unless  call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire
Michael
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night
He moves to the telephone

There's something important  want to tell the old man before Christmas
Will he be home tomorrow night
:    ( 1945) in the Olive Oil Company office
In the background, through the glass partitions, we can see the , at work in his office
is tired, and steeped in paperwork
(
) Sure
Anything  can do for you
(
) No
guess 'll see you Christmas
Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right
Right
He smiles
has hung up
He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it
He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out
He peeks into the 's office
Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning
've got to go,  promised Theresa 'd pick up some toys for the kids
The  smiles and nods
smiles, and leaves;   remaining with
is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper
He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to , raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper
Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; 'll be ready to go home in a few minutes
'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning
That's the third time this month
think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me
Tell Tom
(going) Paulie's a good kid
If he's sick, he's sick
don't mind getting the car
leaves
He slowly puts on his jacket
Looks out his window
:
( 1945) crosses the street
:    ( 1945) Buon Watale, Don Corleone
The  helps him on with his overcoat
Once again, the glances out his window
The black car pulls up;  driving
Merry Christmas
(handing the an envelope) And he starts down the stairs
:
( 1945) The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail
When sees his  coming, he moves back into the driver's seat
The  moves to the car, and is about to get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit stand near the corner
The  springs to serve him
The  walks among the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece of fruit
As he selects, the  gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag
The pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns back to the car
:    ( 1945) exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift wrapped
He continues past the windows
As he walks, someone walks right in his way
He looks up
It is
He takes  by the arm and walks along with him
(quietly) Don't be frightened
just want to talk to you
car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open
(urgently) Get in;  want to talk to you
pulls his arm free
He is frightened
haven't got time
suddenly appear on either side of him
Get in the car
If  wanted to kill you you'd be dead already
Trust me
, sick to his stomach, moves with his , leaving our  on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel
We  the car doors shut, and the car drive off
:   -   ( 1945) during the Christmas show
and exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk arm in arm
Would you like me better if  were a nun
No
Would you like me better if  were Ingrid Bergman
They have passed a little enclosed newsstand
sees something that terrifies her
She doesn't know what to do
still walks, thinking about her question
(a little voice) Michael
'm thinking about it
Michael
No,  would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman
She cannot answer him
Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points
His face goes grave
The headlines read: "  , " is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them knows to remain silent
(desperately) They don't say if he's dead or alive
:
( 1945) by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when   step from the corner
Suddenly, the drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car
Fredo, Fredo
The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we  gunshots
Five bullets catch the  in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car
The  of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit
The   move in quickly, anxious to finish him off
Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit
There are more
is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door
He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open
He actually drops the gun
The gun falls amid the rolling fruit
The  are panicked
They fire once more at the downed His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form
The  are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came
The  about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows
But the street itself is now empty
is in shock; he looks at his ; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the  is lifeless and face down in them
falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand
He begins to weep profusely
:  ( 1945) riding alone on a subway car, late at night
He gets off
He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out
:    ( 1945) walks down the late night street
He approaches an elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still winking this late at night
He waits and watches
Then the sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club
:  ( 1945) The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless glistening wooden floors
Now, at this late time, the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a is waxing them
single -  is counting her receipts
moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar
, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar
Luca
'm Bruno Tattaglia
know
looks up; and out of the shadows emerges
Do you know who  am
Nods
You've been talking to the Tattaglias
They thought we could do business
listens
need somebody strong to protect my operation, physically
've heard you're not happy with your family, you might make a switch
If the money is good enough
On the first shipment,  can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars
looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good
extends his hand, but  pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth
, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to 's cigarette
Then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on 's, almost patting it
: '   ( 1945) The telephone in 's house is ringing
He approaches it, obviously fresh from a nap
Yeah
(
) Do you recognize my voice
think so
Detective squad
(
) Right
Don't say my name, just listen
Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago
Is he alive
(
) think so, but  can't get close enough
There's a lot of blood
'll try to find out more
Find out anything you can
you got a Grand coming
(click) cradles the phone
An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red
He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands
Then he controls it
Quickly, he dials another number
Theresa, let me talk to Tom
Not yet
Have him call me as soon as he gets home
He hangs up
(
) Sonny
Sonny, who is it
(she enters the room) What is it
(calmly) They shot the old man
Oh God
Honey
don't worry
Nothing else is going to happen
There is a  on the door
starts crying
(really frightened) reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and moves quickly
He opens the front door quickly
It is He enters,  closes the door
goes to look after the baby
(excited) You heard about your father
Yeah
The word is out in the streets that he's dead
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don
Paulie's been a little sick all winter
he was home
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months
Maybe three, four times
always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no
Things have been so smooth the last ten years
Go get Paulie,  don't care how sick he is
Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house
That's all
Don't you want me to send some people over here
No, just you and Paulie
leaves;  moves to , who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her
couple of our people will come to stay here
Do whatever they say; 'm going over to the main house
If you want me, use Pop's special phone
The telephone rings again
answers it
Hello
(
) Santino Corleone
moves behind him, anxious to know who it is indicates that she be quiet
Yeah
(
) We have Tom Hagen
In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition
Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say
You can only cause a lot of trouble
What's done is done
(a pause) Don't lose that famous temper of yours
(quietly) 'll wait
:  ( 1945) It is night, but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses
It is very cold
We see the figure of  cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house
: '  ( 1945) walks into the empty, darkened house
Then he calls out
Ma
Ma, where are you
The kitchen door swings open
He moves quickly and takes her by the arm
He is deliberately calm
Ma,  just got a call
Pop's hurt
don't know how bad
(quietly) Santino
Have they killed him
(almost in tears) We don't know yet, Ma
'll get dressed
In case we can see him
She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying
He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office
: '  ( 1945) He switches the lights on in the 's office
The massive desk dominates the room
moves quickly to the telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a number
Tessio
This is Santino Corleone
want fifty reliable men out here
(
) heard, Sonny
but what about Clemenza's regime
don't want to use Clemenza's people right now
Understood
He hangs up
He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook
He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger
We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: dials the number
There is no answer
Luca
:  ( 1945) The interior of an abandoned building
in suits and ties sit around in the booths
sits in one:  sits across from him
know you're not in the muscle end of the family--so  don't want you to be afraid
want you to help the Corleones and  want you to help me
's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth
of the   brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup
sips gratefully
Your boss is dead
is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes
pauses respectfully
(pushing the bottle) Have some more
We got him outside his office, just before  picked you up
You have to make the peace between me and Santino
still is focused on the grief of losing the old man
Sonny was hot for my deal, right
You know it's the smart thing to do, too
want you to talk Sonny into it
(pulling himself together) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got
rises, impatiently
That's going to be his first reaction
You have to talk some sense into him
The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people
The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war
He leans close to
The Don was slipping; in the old days  could never have gotten to him
Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back
Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio
it's good business
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi
'll worry about Luca
You take care of Sonny and the other two kids
'll try
It's what the Don would want us to do
(lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness) Good
then you can go
(he escorts him to the door) don't like violence
'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense
He opens the door; they step out together
: ,  exit
But a car pulls up, and  of '  rushes out
He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to in private
Then  moves with a grave expression
He opens the door, indicating that  should be led back in
The old man is still alive
Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive
(he gives a fatalistic shrug) Bad luck for me, bad luck for you
:  ( 1945) driving during the night
There is a little fog in the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making it difficult to see well
The wipers move across the view, as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still decorated for Christmas
The courtyard is bathed with white floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look
The narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link chain
There are strange cars parked along the curving cement walk
are congregated about the gate and chain;  of them approaches 's car
Who're you
peeks his ugly face almost right up to , and then turns
2 It's the Don's kid; take the car, 'll bring him inside
The   opens the car door, and  steps out
:  ( 1945) The Hallway of the main house is filled with doesn't recognize
They pay little attention to him
Most of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking
: '   ( 1945) moves into the living room; there is a Christmas tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls
is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey
On the other side of the sofa sits ; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva
sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room
sees , looks up at him
Your mother's at the hospital with the old man: He's gonna pull through
nods his relief
Thanks
He moves to
(gently) You heard from Tom yet
Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles
Occasionally,   will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper
(taking her hand) 'mon
He leads her into his father's office without knocking
: '  ( 1945) and  are huddled around a yellow pad
They look up, startled
Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose
He reassuringly hugs , and then to 's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek
was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town
How's Mom
Good
She's been through it before
Me too
You were too young to know about it
You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear
can help you out
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if  let you get mixed up in this
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny
Theresa
She understands, and leaves them alone
All right, Mikey
who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie
What
One of them fingered the old man
didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives
Clemenza
No,  don't believe it
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay
It was Paulie
How can you be sure
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building
We got people in the phone company
(he shrugs) Thank God it was Paulie
we'll need Clemenza bad
is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time
Until the old man tells me different
Then wait, Sonny
Talk to Pop
Sollozzo is a dead man,  don't care what it costs
don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York
The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt don't care if we all go down together
(softly) That's not how Pop would have played it
know 'm not the man he was
But 'll tell you this and he'll tell you too
When it comes to real action,  can operate as good as anybody short range
(calmly) All right, Sonny
All right
Christ, if  could only contact Luca
Is it like they say
Is he that good
Outside, we   cry out, almost a scream of relief
Then open the door and rush out
Everyone is standing: in the doorway,   is wrapped in a tight embrace with his
If  plead before the Supreme Court, 'll never do better than did tonight with that Turk
: ,  '  ( 1945) The windows of the main house are dark except for the 's study
It stands out against the cold, dark night
: '   ( 1945) The living room is empty, save for   sitting on the edge of the sofa
The clock reads: 4:00 a
m
: '  ( 1945) , , ,  and ; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep
It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks
They can barely talk anymore
Is the hospital covered
The cops have it locked in and got my people there visiting Pop all the time
What about the hit list
widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad
Too much, too far, too personal
The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line
don't have to go after the Tattaglias
nods
What about Luca
Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca
That worries me
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him
No, and 've been calling all night
Maybe he's shacked up
Luca never sleeps over with a broad
He always goes home when he's through
Mike, keep ringing Luca's number
, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again
He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers
Then hangs up
Keep trying every fifteen minutes
(exhausted) Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength
Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war
The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore
If your father dies
make the deal, Sonny
(angry) That's easy to say; it's not your father
(quietly) was as good a son to him as you or Mike
Oh Christ Tom,  didn't mean it that way
We're all tired
, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead
But Tom, want you to stay inside the Mall
You too, Mike, no chances
Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city
The hospital is yours; want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day
There is a timid knock on the door
What is it
looks in
tol' you to stay put, Paulie
The guy at the gate's outside
says there's a package
Tessio, see what it is
gets up, leaves
You want me to hang around
Yeah
Hang around
Outside
Outside
Sure
He closes the door
Clemenza
You take care of Paulie
don't ever want to see him again
Understood
Understood
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people
Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show
That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly
You know the old man doesn't want that
forget it, just stay on the phone
is embarrassed to be so protected
He dials Luca Brasi's number once again
The ring repeats, but no one answers
comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand
He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside
Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes
:  ( 1945) sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we remember him
had just patted his hand
looks up at him
Then  pats the other hand, almost affectionately
is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can
Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight
His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could
His eyes bulge
of the  looks down at him in disgust as 's strength leaves him
(making an ugly face) Oh Christ
all over the floor
lets 's hand go with a victorious smile on his face
falls to the floor
The Godfather is next
---------------------------------------- -------- : : '  ( 1945) Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb
There are rows of pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell
This is
The woman of the house,
, talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the side of the house
moves to the garage, which is specially heated, and in which  is busy at work washing a shiny brand new Lincoln
admires the car
Nice
Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper
They're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months
waited two years for this car to come with wooden bumpers
He scrubs and polishes with great affection
Today you make your bones on Paulie
You understand everything
Sure
As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, unwraps a gun and gives it to
22 soft-nosed load
Accurate up to five feet
expertly puts the gun away
's car pulls into the driveway, and he sounds the horn
The two men walk to the car
is driving, a bit nervous, like he doesn't know what is up
gets in the rear seat;  in the front, making a grunt of recognition
He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide  for being late
flinches a little when he sees  will ride behind him; he half turns: Rocco, sit on the other side big guy like you blocks my rearview mirror
turns sourly to
Goddamn Sonny
He's running scared
He's already thinking of going to the mattresses
We have to find a place on the West Side
Paulie, you know a good location
relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on
Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location
'll think about it
(grunting) Drive while you thinking;  wanna get to the City this month
The car pulls out
: '  -   ( 1945) Inside  drives; and  sits in a grump does not show  in the rear seat
: '    ( 1945) The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter light
: '    ( 1945) Inside the tunnel;  doesn't like not seeing
He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of him
Pay attention
: '    ( 1945) The car is parked in the City
comes down from an available apartment and gets back into the car
Good for ten men
, go to Arthur Avenue; 'm suppose to call when  found somethin'
The car pulls off
:  ( 1945) New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot
get outs, glances at , then to
You wait; 'll call
He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner and enters the Luna Restaurant
:  ( 1945) enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table
The  know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some bread--and then a plate of veal on his table
He eats
:  ( 1945) exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; he is well fed
We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to expect has happened to Paulie
There is the car;  is still sitting behind the wheel, in the rear seat
steps in
He talked my ear off
Want us to go back to Long Beach; have another job for us
Rocco, you live in the City, can we drop you off
(
) Ah,  left my car at your place
, then you gotta come back
The car pulls out
By now,  is completely relaxed and secure
You think we'll go for that last place
Maybe, or you gotta know now
Holy cow,  don't gotta know nothing
: '    ( 1945) The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway
Inside,  turns to
Paulie, pull over
gotta take a leak
The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds steps out of the car,    with him
He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground
We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two
finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car
is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered
Leave the gun
gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car
They get in, and drive off
--------------------------------------- --------- :  ( 1945) It is late afternoon
Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets
We can see the group of  , stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons
walks along in the rear yard
He is bundled in a warm marine coat
He looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe
They look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position
He is like an exile Prince
He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard
rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment
The basketball ring now half coming off
This is where he was a child
Then a shout
(
) Mike
Hey Mikey; telephone
had shouted from the kitchen window hurries into the house
: '  ( 1945) is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot
He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook
Some dame
picks it up
Hello
Kay
(
) How is your father
He'll be
(
) (pause) love you
He glances at the  in the kitchen
Tries to shield the phone
(
) Yeah Kay, 'm here
(
) Can you say it
Huh
(
) Tell me you love me
glances at the  at the kitchen table
He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice: can't
(
) Please say it
Look
'll see you tonight,
(
) (click) is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house
How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her
here, learn something
you may have to feed fifty guys some day
You start with olive oil
fry some garlic, see
And then fry some sausage
or meat balls if you like
then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste
some basil; and a little red wine
that's my trick
peeks into the kitchen; sees
You take care of Paulie
You won't see Paulie anymore
He's sick for good this winter
starts to leave
Where are you going
To the city
(to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce) Send some bodyguards
don't need them, Sonny
'm just going to see Pop in the hospital
Also,  got other things
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian
, but be careful
: sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven into the city
are crowded into the front seat
: crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying to book rooms
: and  eating a quiet dinner at the hotel
He is preoccupied, she's concerned
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty
'll just sit with him;  want to show respect
Can  go to the hospital with you
don't think so
You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News
My parents don't read the Daily News
All right, if you think shouldn't
can't believe the things the papers are printing
'm sure most of it's not true
don't think so either
(silence) better go
When will  see you again
want you to go back to New Hampshire

He leans over her; kisses her
When will  see you again
Goodbye
Quietly, he moves out the door
lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself: Goodbye
: '  ( 1945) taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with a neon sign "--
"   steps out, pays the fare
and then stops dead in his tracks
looks
He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted
He is the only one on the street
There are gay, twinkling Christmas decorations all over the building
He walks, slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps
He hesitates, looks around
This area is empty
He checks the address on a scrap of paper
It is correct
He tries the door, it is empty
He walks in
:   ( 1945) stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby
He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor
To the left: the same
, as  walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting
All we hear are his sole footsteps
He walks up to a desk marked ""
No one is there
He moves quickly to a door marked ""; swings into it; no one is there
He looks onto the desk:  There is half a sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke
Hello
Hello
Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly
walking down the hospital corridors; all alone
The floors have just been mopped
They are still wet
: Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several flights
: 4TH He steps out onto the fourth floor
He looks
There are merely empty corridors
He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it
"Room 4A
"  Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and quicker they flash by him
Now he stops, looks up "4A-- Corleone"
There is a special card table set up there with some magazines
and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards
: '  4A Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he will find
He looks
Lit by the moonlight through the window, he can see a  in the hospital bed alone in the room, and under a transparent oxygen tent
All that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing
Slowly walks up to it, and is relieved to see his , securely asleep
Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to his nose and mouth
(
) What are you doing here
This startles ; who almost jumps around
It is a lit from the light behind her in the hallway
You're not supposed to be here now
calms himself, and moves to her
'm Michael Corleone--this is my father
What happened to the detectives who were guarding him
Oh your father just had too many visitors
It interfered with the hospital service
The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago
(comfortingly) But don't worry
look in on him
You just stand here one minute
Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number
Sonny
Sonny--Jesus Christ, 'm down at the hospital
came down late
There's no one here
None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one
The old man is completely unprotected
(
) All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside
'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes
Sit tight, and don't panic
(furiously, but kept inside) won't panic
He hangs up; returns to the
You cannot stay here
'm sorry
(coldly) You and  are going to move my father right now
to another room on another floor
Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out
Absolutely not
We have to get permission from the Doctor
You've read about my father in the papers
You've seen that no one's here to guard him
Now 've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him
Believe me and help me
(frightened) We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed
She does so
and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room
: 4TH   ( 1945) They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently down the corridor
We hear  coming up the stairs
hears them, stops
Hurry, into there
They push it into the first available room
peeks out from the door
The footsteps are louder; then they emerge
It is , 's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers
(stepping out) Who is it
Michael
do you remember me, Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine, now his son-in-law
Enzo, get out of here
There's going to be trouble
look of fear sweeps through 's face
If there
will be trouble
stay with you, to help
owe it to the Godfather
thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get
Go outside; stand in front
'll be out in a minute

(frightened) He's awake
looks at the  , his eyes are open, though he cannot speak
touches his face tenderly
Pop
Pop, it's me Michael
Shhhh, don't try to speak
There are men who are coming to try to kill you
But 'm with you
'm with you now
The   tries to speak
but cannot
tenderly puts his finger to his 's lips
: '   ( 1945) Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous , pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon
exits the hospital and moves to him
They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night
They are both frightened;  gives  a cigarette, lights it
's hands are trembling, 's are not
Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket
The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations
Listen
We  the sound of a single automobile coming and  look with fear in their eyes
Then  takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket
They stand, hands in their pockets
long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them
's and 's faces are tough, impassive
The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates
and  are relieved
looks down; the 's hands are shaking
He looks at his own, and they are not
Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens
They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder
heaves a sigh of relief
In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed and
He smiles his relief and starts toward them

This is McCLUSKEY

Who the hell are you and what are you doing here
standing nearby: He's clean, Captain
studies McCLUSKEY closely
(quietly) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father
(furious) You punk-hood
Who the hell are you to tell me my business pulled them off
don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other
wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off
Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital
stands quiet
'll stay until you put guards around my father's room
Phil, lock this punk up
The Kid's clean, Captain
He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets
(furious) Goddam it,  said lock him up
Put the cuffs on him
(deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain
Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength
groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw
He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his  and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see  and ' arrive
--------------------------------------- --------- :  ( 1945) of
The gateway now has a long black car blocking it
There are more stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have standing by open windows
It is clear that the war is escalating
car pulls up and out get , , and
's jaw is wired and bandaged
He stops and looks up at the open window
We can see holding rifles
Christ, Sonny really means business
They continue walking
joins them
The various make no acknowledgment
How come all the new men
We'll need them now
After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad
We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning
: ' They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces
: '  ( 1945) is in the 's office; he is excited and exuberant
've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day
If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead
He sees , and holds his bandaged face in his hand, kiddingly
Mikey, you look beautiful
Cut it out
The Turk wants to talk
The nerve of that son of a bitch
After he craps out last night he wants a meet
Was there a definite proposal
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition
The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse
What about that Tattaglias
What will they do about Bruno
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father
We should hear what they have to say
No, no Consiglere
Not this time
No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks
Give them one message: If not, it's all out war
We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street
The other families won't sit still for all out war
Then  hand me Sollozzo
Come  Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this
This is not a personal thing, this is Business
And when they shot me father
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom
You just help me win
Understood
bows his head; he is deeply concerned
found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money
McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard
What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain
Never
It would be disastrous
All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover
So just
take that into consideration
(still fuming) McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever
We'll wait
We can't wait
No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop
You have to get Sollozzo now
The kid's right
What about McCluskey
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey
We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later
Go on Mike
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo
Set up the meeting for two days from now
Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held
Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour
So 'll feel safe
They'll check me when  meet them so  won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me
(pause) Then 'll kill them both
Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at
Silence
suddenly breaks out in laughter
He points a finger at , trying to speak
You
You, the high-class college kid
You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business
Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face
You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal
Now  and  are also smiling; only  keeps his face serious
(angrily, but cold) Sonny, it's all personal, and learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather
He took my joining the Marines personal
take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know 'll kill them Sonny
radiates danger
stops laughing
: '  ( 1945) on a revolver
(
) It's as cold as they come, impossible to trace
(he turns it upside down) Don't worry about prints Mike, put a special tape on the trigger and butt
Here
(he hands the gun to another pair of hands) Whatsamatter
Trigger too tight
(it fires: very ) left it noisy, so it'll scare any pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander away
is alone with  in a cellar workshop
Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out
Everybody will still think you got it
They'll be starin' at your face, see
Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run
Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither
Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me
Nobody's gonna bother with you
Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go
, put your hat on, let's see how you look
Helps with identification
They put the hat on;  adjusts it
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light
Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell
How bad will it be
Probably all the other families will line up against us
But, it's alright
These things have to happen once every ten years or so
gets rid of the bad blood
You gotta stop 'em at the beginning
Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble
: '  &   ( 1945) steps into the foyer of the main house
card table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the Corleone buttonmen
He continues into the living room
It's a mess asleep on the sofa
On the coffee table are the remains of a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of whisky
The radio is playing
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up
What are you, inspecting the barracks
( sits up with his head in his hands) You ready
Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away
million times
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign
We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny
It's okay
the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men
The phone rings in the 's office
That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place
: '  ( 1945) has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the move in
's on the phone; he writes something down
One of Tattaglia's people
No
Our informer in McCluskey's precinct
Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx
Anyone know it
Sure,  do
It's perfect for us
small family place with big booths where people can talk in private
Good food
Everybody minds their business
Perfect
(he moves to the desk and makes a crude drawing) This is the entrance, Mike
When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner
Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun
They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall
We can tape the gun behind there
Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car
You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing
In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go
See
Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down
you come out blasting
And don't take chances
In the head, two shots apiece
And out as fast as your legs can move
want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun
don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand
The gun will be there
(to , warmly) You're on, kid
'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left
And 'll get a message to your girl friend when  think the time is right
We gotta move
How long do you think before can come back
Probably a year
(starting to crack) Jesus,  don't know
Can you do it Mike
moves out

long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him
The , leaning over, open the front door
Get in, Mike
He does, the car drives off
: '  ( 1945) Inside the car,  reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes 's hand
'm glad you came, Mike
hope we can straighten everything out
All this is terrible, it's not the way wanted things to happen at all
It should never have happened
want to settle things tonight want my father left alone
He won't be;  swear to you be my children he won't be
Just keep an open mind when we talk
hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny
It's impossible to talk business with him
McCLUSKEY grunts
He's a good kid
He's all right
Turn around, up on your knees, facing me
He gives  a thorough frisk
'm sorry about the other night Mike
'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy
Can't stand the aggravation
You know how it is
He's clean

The car takes the George Washington Bridge

We're going to New Jersey
(sly) Maybe
closes his eyes
: '
( 1945) The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey
Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going back to New York
It then hits it very fast, on the way back to the city
: '  ( 1945) checks to see the cars that had been following, and then leans to the
Nice work; 'll remember it
is relieved
:    ( 1945) The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the Bronx:  The " "
There is no one on the street
looks to see if the  is going to get out with them
He gets out, and opens the door
, McCLUSKEY and  get out; the  remains leaning against the car
They enter the restaurant
:   ( 1945) very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor
,  and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room
There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of , and  or
It is very quiet
Is the Italian food good here
Try the veal; it's the finest in New York
The solitary  brings a bottle of wine to the table
They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses
Then, when he leaves,  turns to McCLUSKEY: am going to talk Italian to Mike
Sure, you two go right ahead; 'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti
now begins in rapid Sicilian
listening carefully and nodding every so often
Then  answers in Sicilian, and  goes on
The  occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on
Then , having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, accidentally lapses into English
(using English for emphasis) Most important
want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life
What guarantees can  give you am the hunted one
've missed my chance
You think too highly of me, my friend
am not so clever
all  want if a truce
looks long and hard at , who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: " have no tricks up my sleeve"
Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face
What is it
Is it all right if  go to the bathroom
is intuitively suspicious
He studies  with his dark eyes
Then he thrusts his hand onto 's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon
frisked him; 've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean
He looks at a  sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes
The  nods, indicating no one is there
Don't take too long
gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside
:    ( 1945) steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard
He actually uses the urinal
Then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly
Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet
Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun
We see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun
he gropes searchingly
finally coming to rest on the gun
; the feel of it reassures him
Then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband
For some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them
Then he goes out
:   ( 1945) He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table
McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at looks back
Then he smiles and continues back to the table
He sits down
Now  can talk
feel much better
The  by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes
leans toward  who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket
begins to speak in Sicilian once again but 's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him
The  comes to ask about the order,  turns to speak, and without warning,  shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against 's head, just touching his temple
He pulls the trigger, and we see part of 's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area
The  looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood
seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended
pivots, and looks: There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth
fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat
He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound
Then coolly, and deliberately,  fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull
The air is filled with pink mist
swings toward the  standing by the bathroom wall
He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed
Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty
The  steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face
looks at his two victims: still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table
McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table
is wildly at a peak
He starts to move out
His hand: is frozen by his side,
He moves, not letting the gun go
's face; frozen in its expression
His hand: still holding the gun
His face: finally he closes his eyes
His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud
He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back
He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax
Then he leaves

little distance away,   sit around a crude table, quietly eating
They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there is an occasional laugh
stands by a window, which has been covered with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out
large bowl of pasta is passed, and the  eat heartily
The sentimental tune is continued over the following: :    ( 1945) and a , blood coming out of their noses, lie still together in a bullet-riddled automobile

An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table

Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets
Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays

Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette
The   nods appreciatively
Nice Augie

:
( '46) Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building
We recognize a couple of 's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb
Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile
Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette
One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain
We  the sound of a door opening; they look up
The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks
backs out of an apartment, the arms of wrapped around him
She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes
He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car
The men quickly take up their positions
As he gets in his car: Pick up your sister
Yeah
The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars
: '  ( '46) He knocks on the door
No answer
Then again
' Who is it
It's me, Sonny
We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open enters, but  has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him
(tenderly) Connie, what is it
He turns her around in his arms
Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time
As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage
She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment
(desperately) It was my fault
started a fight with him and  tried to hit him so he hit me
He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny,  walked into it
Sonny listens, and calms himself
He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe
'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you
He starts to leave
Oh Sonny, please don't do anything
Please don't
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly
Hey
Con
What'm  goin' to do
Make your kid a orphan before he's born
She laughs with him
He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves
: ' settles down on the front steps of the 112th St
"Book" with   and , who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner
The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball
has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store
The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed
It is a moment before we recognize that it is
His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has  by the throat
He pulls  away from the others, trying to get him down into the street
But  reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders
His shirt is ripped away in 's hand
and , merely sit, watching, stunned
is pounding the cowered  with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing
His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood
The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination
's hands are clenched tight around the railing

Now 's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators
's tight fists are going down like hammers, into 's face and body
's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing
grabs hold of 's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort
Then he tries loosening 's locked hands; even biting them
screams but he does not let go
It's clear that  is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved
knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted
Totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding
You
bastard
You
hurt my sister
again
and 'll kill
you
He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly
and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion
We notice with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested
finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands
He slumps onto the stoop

It is a gray, rainy day
Young   in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound
Things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built
Security measures that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress
We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt
The house nearest the crater is damaged by fire
taxi arrives;   steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house
They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house
looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still runs down onto her face
She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the
exits the Main House, and hurries toward her
Kay, we weren't expecting you
You should call
've tried calling and writing want to reach Michael
Nobody knows where he is
We know he's all right, but that's all
looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater
What was that
An accident
No one was hurt
Listen Tom,  let my cab go; can come in to call another one
is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to
Sure
'm sorry
They hurry through the rain and into the Main House

Will you give this to him

Will you give this letter to Michael
Mama, no

She takes the letter from , who is grateful and relieved
Why did they blame Michael
You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married

) (giggle) 'm a friend of Carlo's
just wanted to tell him  can't see him tonight;  have to go out of town
's face turns red
You lousy tramp bitch

What was that
Your girl friend
She says she can't make it tonight
You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number
'll kill you, you bastard
She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip
(defending himself) You're crazy
She was kidding around;  don't know, some nut
He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing
You're staying home
You're not going out

You gonna make me something to eat at least
That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties

The food is on the table

She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen

You filthy guinea spoiled brat
Clean it up or 'll kick your head in
Like hell  will
She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again
Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand
Clean it up
He swings the belt against her heavy hips
She moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it ready
Even the female Corleones are murderers
He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her
She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids
He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process
She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face
She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom
The baby
The baby

She moves into a corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under the bed
He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair
He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he throws her on the bed, contemptuously
He grabs part of her thigh, pinching it very hard
You're fat as a pig
Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving her in tears
She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom phone, and in a whisper: Mama
mama, it's Connie
Mama, can't talk any louder
No,  don't want to talk to Sonny
We can tell that the phone has been passed to

Send , please Sonny, it's nothing;  just want to come home

You just wait there
He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment

Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car
His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car

:   ( 1946) Day in Manhattan
An impressive Bank Building in the financial center of New York
Many limousines are parked, uniforms and plain-clothed  waiting quietly
:   ( 1946) The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows
, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man, sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar,   moves to a sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles on  , a moon-faced amiable-looking man; as the view continues, around the table, we : (
) want to thank you all for coming
consider it a service done to me personally and  am in the debt of each and every one of you
Especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as California, St
Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans
The   to   and  , both younger than any of the others; then on to  , short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the table to   , who is whispering to his ; the   on to  , an older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; , in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then , a delicate older man with dyed hair and a pencil mustache; and finally,  , in his early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at 's Wedding
Ah well, let's get down to business
We are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers
(he sits, gazes out at them, and sighs) How did things ever go so far
Well, no matter
lot of foolishness has come to pass
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary
The  examines the room once again, as the  speaks large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above
pauses; and   hands him a cold drink
Tattaglia has lost a son;  have lost a son
We are quits
Let there be a peace
(he gestures expressively, submissively, with his hands) That is all  want
Don Corleone is too modest
He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them
His refusal is not the act of a friend
He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families
Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them
Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all
But he has to let us draw water from the well
It's that simple
My friends,  didn't refuse out of malice
You all know me
When have  ever refused an accommodation
But why, this time
Because think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come
It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government
But drugs
No
Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs
But
am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary
don't believe in drugs
For years  paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business
$200 a week
But it didn't matter
Somebody comes to them and says, " have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing
"  Who can resist such a profit
There's no way to control it, as a business
to keep it respectable
(rapping the table) don't want it near schools don't want it sold to children
That is an infamita
(thinking) In my city  would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored
They are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway
They have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves
Let them lose their souls with drugs
But something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists
Then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East
nods
That's the whole matter then, we have the peace, and let me pay my respects to Don Corleone, whom we have all known over the years as a man of his word
(noticing is uneasy) Don Philip
agree to everything here, 'm willing to forget my own misfortune
But  must hear strict assurance from Corleone
When time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vengeance
They all look at the ; especially , who feels that has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind
Slowly the  rises
forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good
But have selfish reasons
My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and  must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges
That is my affair, and  will make those arrangements
(with strength) But  am a superstitious man
and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then  will blame some of the people here
That,  could never forgive, but
aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that  will never be the one to break the peace we have made
: '  ( 1946) The 's black limousine
He sits quietly in the padded rear seat;   next to him
It is night
Lights flash by them every so often
When  meet with Tattaglia's people; should  insist that all his drug middle-men be clean
Mention it, don't insist
Barzini is a man who will know that without being told
You mean Tattaglia
(shaking his head) Barzini
(a revelation) He was the one behind Sollozzo
Tattaglia is a pimp
He could never have outfought Santino
But wasn't sure until this day
No, it was Barzini all along
The black limousine speeds away from us in the night

You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo

Where are you going
Corleone
There is nothing there
Not anymore

Long ago
Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas
the others escaped to America
Don Tommassino

thinks a moment, then concedes
That is your birthright
but Michael, use this car
No
would like to walk to Corleone

Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name
The old car sputters off;  watches, and then continues on his journey
: The  pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees, in bloom and bursting with life
: They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty streets
Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass
And there are many  evident, most of them carrying machine guns
The  pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road " "
: They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them
: Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men carrying billowing red banners
: They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees is a deep, tall field of wild flowers

Yes

drivers, as they move by

Hey America
Take me with you
Hey, take me to America
: They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until they hesitate, and look down
Corleone
They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people
: and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of the village
They walk behind him, and spread to either side about fifteen feet away from him
They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain

They go on
They move up a very narrow old street
looks at the doorways that they pass
: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower

The names of the dead
hesitates in the center of the main street
He looks
The street is empty, barren
Occasionally, an old woman will pass
turns his head
The other side of the street: empty and deathly
of  standing in the center of the old street, the shepherds a respectful distance away
------------------------------------- ----------- : green ribboned field of a baronial Estate
Further ahead is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii
There is a group of young village  accompanied by two stocky , dressed in black
They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms
They are singing, off in the distance as they work
,  and  are silent as they watch this Fantasy-like scene
(calling out to them) Hey, beautiful girls
(sternly) Shhhhh
He settles down to watch
The  are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies
They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly
They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove
Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove
The  being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing
They come closer and closer
Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the
She stands there on her toes about to run
sees her; now face to face
He looks
Her face
Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth
(murmuring) Jesus Christ, take my soul
'm dying
Quickly, she turns, and runs away
stands up never taking his eyes from her
We hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the laughing
Then he turns to them
You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh
pats him on the shoulder
Easy man
What are you talking about
You can't hide it when you're hit by the thunderbolt
: The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking
, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe
The proprietor of the cafe, , is a short burly man; he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table
You know all the girls in this town, eh
We saw some beauties coming down the road
One in particular got our friend hit with the Thunderbolt
(he indicates ) gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at  with new interest
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight
(he laughs) This one could seduce the devil body
and eyes as big and black as olives
(laughing with them
pouring more wine) know about what you mean
This was a beauty
Right, Calo
(laughing) Beautiful all over, eh
And hair
Black and curly, like a doll
And such a mouth
does not laugh quite so much
Yes, we have beautiful girls here
but virtuous
is no longer drinking with them
She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair
She looks more Greek than Italian
Do you know a beauty like that
As  describes her,  laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl
No
Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room
God in Heaven,  think understand
He goes into the back room after the innkeeper
Then he returns
Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief
It's his daughter
They start to leave; but  doesn't move
Come quickly
Innkeeper
More wine
(whispered) The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up
turns to  with his cold authority
Tell him to come to me
The two  shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry between them
(quietly) understand 've offended you by talking about your daughter offer you my apologies, 'm a stranger in this country,  don't know the customs very well
Let me say this,  meant no disrespect to you or her
and  are impressed
(shrugs) Who are you and what do you want from my daughter

My name is Michael
You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband
In any case,  want to meet your daughter
With your permission and under the supervision of your family
With all decorum
With all respect

and  are stupefied;  pauses, and then asks: Are you a friend of the friends
When the proper time comes, 'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know
It's the real Thunderbolt, then

She unwraps it
Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace
She looks at him

They go up to the cafe

She wears the gold necklace around her neck

As the   with them, we notice that her  and a half dozen  are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are  and , their luparas on their shoulders
Further up the hill,  stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto 's arm
She modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking
Behind them, her  giggles to herself

Music, old and dissonant, plays
There is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago
Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police
We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in Sicily
is radiant as the Bride;  is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief
------------------------------------------------ : and  dance wildly through the night of the great wedding celebration
It is held in the Village Square; under the watchful eyes of  above on the tops of buildings, carrying luparas
------------------------------------------------ : ' opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight fills the room
He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is little frightened; but lovely
He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her, looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body
Slowly and tenderly he kisses her
Her tiny hands come up to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him
She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor
-------------------------------------- ---------- : ' Morning
sits on the window ledge, gazing into the room
is asleep; she is naked, and only partially covered by the bedsheets
He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light
: ' We  girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost hitting th inner court wall
is laughing, driving
pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive
Outside the walls, we notice  with luparas, walking guard duty
The car stops and a laughing  gets out
It's safer to teach you English
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
See,  learned it
Now teach me to drive
enters the Courtyard
He seems tired and concerned
Ciao, Don Tommassino
kisses him
Things went badly in Palermo
The younger men have no respect
Things are changing;  don't know what will happen
Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name
Is that why there are more men on the walls
Even so,  don't think it is safe here anymore
've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse
You must go right away
What is it
Bad news from America
Your brother, Santino
He has been killed
For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the Five Family War, all comes back to
: Morning
leans out of the bedroom window
Below,  is sitting in one of the garden chairs, combing his thick hair
whistles and  looks up to his window
Get the car
'll be leaving in ten minutes
Where's Calo
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen
Is your wife coming with you
No, she's going home to her family
She'll join me in a few weeks
: , dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the kitchen
is just finishing a bite
He rises when he sees
Should  get your bag
No, 'll get it
Where's Appolonia
(smiling) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas
She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America
smiles
Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car
He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee
He looks out from the opening in the doorway
: There is the car, with  sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child
moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat
Then  seems disturbed
Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees disappear through the gate
(muttering to himself) Where the hell is he going
goes down the hallway, and outside
steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes
sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is
(calling out) 'll drive to you
He smiles affectionately
stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side
There is no sight of
Suddenly the smile fades from 's face
He steps forward and holds out his hand
No
No
His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous , as she switched on the ignition
Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia
is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious
: is unconscious in a darkened room
We hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out
soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open is there, close to him
He looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead
Fabrizzio
Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily
-------------------------------------- ---------- : :  ( 1951) Easter
in the springtime
Hordes of little  including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs
The  himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants
Suddenly, he stops and looks
stands there, still holding his suitcase
Great emotion comes over the , who takes a few steps in 's direction
leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him
Be my son
: leads  through the corridors of the building
This old building has seen its day
No way to do business
too small, too old
They enter the 's glass-panelled office
Have you thought about a wife family
(pained) No
understand, Michael
But you must make a family, you know
want children,  want a family
But  don't know when
Accept what's happened, Michael
could accept everything that's happened;  could accept it, but that  never had a choice
From the time  was born, you had laid this all out for me
No,  wanted other things for you
You wanted me to be your son
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians
and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America
Then why have  become a man like you
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over
That was my misfortune
That was your misfortune
was hunted on the streets of Corleone when  was twelve years old because of who my father was
had no choice
man has to choose what he will be
believe that
What else do you believe in
doesn't answer
Believe in a family
Can you believe in your country
Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives
Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own
Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them
Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate
Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible
can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to
listens
Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race
Make a family, Michael, and protect it
These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power
Be one of those men
you have the choice
-------------------------------------- ---------- :     (1955) , driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955
(
) There's a new one
Construction going on everywhere
, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the bill marquees read: "  ", " ", etc
(
) That's one of the family's new ones
Not bad, eh
:  (1955) The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel
Inside the car: , ,   and a new man, , quiet and sinister
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner
From the expression on 's face we know this is a discourtesy
:    (1955) whole entourage precedes  and his
party of ,  and
Great fuss is made
They are being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful
That doctor did some job on your face
You look good, too
They enter the suite
Nice, eh
is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the bellboys, waiters and maids
(hurrying into the bedroom) Kid, take a look-see
gives a look to , and continues into the bedroom
There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform, mirrors to each side
points upward
into a large  mirror
Ever seen anything like that before
(dryly) No
:    (1955) is alone in the bedroom
He is just finishing dressing; he puts on his jacket
From the window, with the lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night passes into the other room
He stops, looks
He is disturbed
:   (1955) magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite; a lavish table setting for eight
Standing by the table are ,  , looking wonderful, a little heavier, beautifully dressed; , a dandy, and
stands quietly by the door
Mike
The party starting
Come here a minute, Fredo
goes to him, a big smile all over his face
Who are those girls
(jokingly) That's for you to find out
Give them some money and send them home
Mike
Get rid of them
:   (1955) They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite
is speaking to
Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here
Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family
seems anxious
Mike, you sure about Moe selling
He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business
'll make him an offer he can't refuse
turns to
Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started
We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers
We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement
We hope your friends in the movies will do the same
We count on you to convince them
Sure, 'll do anything for my Godfather
You know that, Mike
There is knock on the door
rises, looks at , who nods
opens the door, and   enters, followed by
He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style
His  are more West Coast style
Mike, good to see you
Got everything you want
Thanks
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good
(to his ) Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house
Is my credit good enough to buy you out
laughs
Buy me out
The hotel, the casino
The Corleone family wants to buy you out
stops laughing; the room becomes tense
eyes the
(furious) The Corleone family wants to buy me out
buy you out
You don't buy me out
Your casino loses money
Maybe we can do better
You think  scam
(the worst insult) You're unlucky
You goddamn dagos
do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino
You and the Corleone family are evened out
This is for business; name your price
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore
The Godfather is sick
You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here
've talked to Barzini; can make a deal with him and keep my hotel
(quietly, deadly) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public
(his face turns red) Ah Mike, that was nothing
Moe didn't mean anything
He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends
Right, Moe
Yeah sure
Sometimes  gotta kick asses to make this place run right
Freddie and  had a little argument and  had to straighten him out
You straightened my brother out
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time
Players couldn't get a drink
rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal: have to go back to New York tomorrow
Think of your price
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that
made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders
(frightened) Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him
The Don has semi-retired
'm running the Family business now
So anything you have to say, say it to me
Nobody answers
nods to , who opens the door
exits angrily
Freddie, you're my older brother
love you
But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again
:
(1955) sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark is leaning against it
She has a little three year old boy; 's son, who plays with a cardboard bird on a string
Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards
,  and  exit the airport with carrying luggage
sees something, and taps  on the shoulder
turns, and sees
opens the car door;  steps out with the , and embraces her, and kisses his son
Automatically, the luggage is put in
replaces  as the driver; and  joins the other men
gets into one of the other cars
And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other sedans
:  (1955) The little  looks out the window as they drive
have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall
Oh Michael
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets
Don't you want dinner first
No, you eat
don't wait up for me
Wake me up when you come to bed
The little  flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window
:  (1955) The limousine arrives at the Mall
We are inside
Your sister wants to ask you something
Let  ask
opens the door
wants to talk just a little more
She's afraid to
Michael
nods to ; who gives them their privacy a moment longer
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo
They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them
'm busy
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy
opens the door;  starts to get out;  too
He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad
Will you
Let me think about it,
She smiles;  goes with  to the Main House; and the little  move to the house that was Sonny's
: '  (1955) , much older, much smaller in size
He wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt
He sits in a chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden
(
) Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it
Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn  can hang my hat
(
) Just be patient
'm not asking you for help, Mike
Just take off the handcuffs
(
) Be patient
(
) We gotta fight sometime
Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength
(
) No,  don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting
(
) Mike, you're wrong
(
) Don Corleone
Don Corleone
The   looks up
stand before him in the Den
Beside him is an anxious
stands by the door; is seated;  sits behind the big desk
You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form our own Families
Only with your benediction, of course
ask permission
My son is head of the Family now
If you have his permission, you have my good will
In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own
Carlo, 'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there
Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere
Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see 's reaction
He remains inexpressive
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas
Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute
No reflection on Tom; that's the way  want it
Besides, if  ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it
Maybe less
Let us fill up our Regimes
No
want things very calm for another six months
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse
How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up
The two  go hand in hand
And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us
And  don't like Barzini
say the Corleone Family has to move from strength, not weakness
We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least
Do you have faith in my judgement
Yes, Godfather
Then do what Michael says
All  can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets
Understood
There are uneasy looks all around
Understood
just wish  was doing more to help out
'll come to you when  need you
He looks at ,  and
They all nod, reluctantly
All right, then it's resolved
knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door
and  pay their respects to the  and leave, then
watches  as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man
Then  closes the door
relaxes
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man
What could be more important than that
'm not talking about that
'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime
Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime
told you that it wouldn't escape his eye
How did you find out
Bookkeepers know everything
Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing
They get a little more money than the job's worth
(pause) Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly
Not so perfectly if you noticed
Mike, why am  out
You're not a wartime Consigliere
Things may get tough with the move we're trying
, but then  agree with Tessio
You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness
Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones
Tom,  never thought you were a bad Consigliere,  thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace
He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when  had my misfortune
Michael has all my confidence, as you do
For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen
Maybe  can help
(coldly) You're out, Tom
pauses, thinks
and then he nods in acquiescence leaves
looks at
'm going to talk to my father
nods, and then leaves
The  opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside
:   (1955) see you have your Luca Brasi
'll need him
There are men in this world who demand to be killed
They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender
These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me
"  Luca Brasi was like that
And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it
made him my weapon
Because was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him
think you have done the same with this man
They walk through the 's vegetable garden
Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting
follows; the  turns and looks at him
Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over
Barzini will move against you first
How
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust
That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety
He rises, and looks at Michael
and at that meeting you will be assassinated
The  walks on further
Your wife and children
you're happy with them
Yes
Good
wants to express something
hesitates, then: 've always respected you
long silence
The  smiles at
And
you
:  (1955) and  walking from the black car that has just left them off
How is your husband feeling
He's not the same since they shot him
He lets Michael do all the work
He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still
But men are like that
She stops toward the Church
You come in, too
shakes her head
The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause you're not Catholic
(whispered) He's in the back drinkin' his wine
laughs and follows  up the steps of the Church
They enter
:  (1955) Inside the Church,  watches as  blesses herself from the holy water
You can
Tentatively,  dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself
Then  follows  down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar
stops by the impressive tiers of candles
There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles
fumbles in her purse for change;  gives her some
drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles
She finishes, and bows her head
: ' Very few people in the streets
But black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks
An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous
Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King
Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration
We show these in detail; and the flowered messages: " Benefactor to Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"
"Our Don Our Leader"
"The Sacred Heart"
:  (1955) Silence
The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence
Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful
, ,  and  stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin
We cannot see the remains of Don Corleone

One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on

Then , who merely passes by the Coffin
Then  in a black homburg, standing a long time
watches the scene
crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men
As  leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone

He embraces and comforts her
Everywhere  goes,  is a few feet away--watching all who come close to him

She's about 18

No
We danced together at Connie's wedding

He finds him
Mike, could  have a minute
; nods; and they move to a private place

Says we can straighten any of our problems out
He talked to you

He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform
He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently
Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it
Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress

Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone
(dignity) swear 'm innocent
swear on the head of my children, 'm innocent
Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me
(quietly) Barzini is dead
So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene
want to square all the family accounts tonight
So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did
is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified
(almost kindly) Don't be frightened
Do you think 'd make my sister a widow
Do you think 'd make your children fatherless
After all, 'm Godfather to your son
No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business
'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and  want you to stay there
'll send Connie an allowance, that's all
But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry
Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini
(sees his way out) Barzini
(softly) Good, good
Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport
moves to the door; opens it
There is a car waiting; with a group of  around it
He looks back at , who reassures him

: moves out to the Mall; the  are putting his things in the trunk
opens the front door for him
is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who
gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man
It is , who nods cordially
The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, suddenly throws the garrote around 's neck
He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet
The garrote is pulled tighter; 's face turns color
His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield
Then the body goes slack
makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off
: '  (1955) and his party
They watch
Then he turns and walks off, and they follow
--------------------------------------- --------- : : '    (1955) sits alone in the back of his car;  is driving
They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights flash by
turns back
You know  would never question anything you say
(smiles) Speak your mind
'll do this for you; you know should
No
This  have to do
:   (1955) 's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an Italian Pizzeria
opens the door
Sit in the car
:   (1955) He walks alone into the restaurant
is tossing pizza dough in the air
Where's the boss
In the back
Hey Frank, someone wants you
comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent
What is it
He stops, frozen in fear
It is
Gunfire from under his coat
is cut down
throws the gun down; turns and exits
:  (1955) Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs indicating that the property is for sale are evident
black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, the rear door flies open, and  attempts to run out, restrained by
She manages to break free and runs across the Mall into Michael's house
: '   (1955) Inside the Corleone house
Big boxes have been packed; furniture prepared for shipping
Michael
She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon and
(comforting) Connie
But  avoids her, and moves directly to is watchful
You lousy bastard; you killed my husband
Connie
You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him
You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, everybody did
But you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me
(crying) What am  going to do now, what am going to do
of Michael's  move closer, ready for orders from him
But he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish
Connie, how could you say such things
Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall
All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband
But he didn't dare while my father was alive
And then he stood Godfather to our child
That coldhearted bastard
(to ) And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo
Just read the papers
That's your husband
She tries to spit into 's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva
Get her home and get a doctor
The   immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly
is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from He feels her look
She's hysterical
But  won't let him avoid her eyes
Michael, it's not true
Please tell me
Don't ask me
Tell me
All right, this one time 'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time
Is it true
She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth
(after a very long pause) No
is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him
Then she kisses him
(through her tears) We both need a drink
: '  (1955) She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the drinks
From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the drinks, she sees ,  and   enter the house with their
She watches with curiosity, as  stands to receive them
He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other
One hand on his hip, like a Roman Emperor
The  stand before him
takes 's hand, kissing it
Don Corleone
The smile fades from 's face, as she looks at what her husband has become
:  (1955) wears a shawl over her hand
She drops many coins in the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles
