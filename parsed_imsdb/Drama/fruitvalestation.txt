Sophina doesn't answer
The phone rings again
Oscar's hand quickly picks it up and flips it open
We follow the phone to his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old Black man with a warm smile
(') (into phone) Aye bruh it's bad tonight

He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond
He takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with , a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman
(') Look, 'm not going out, you happy now
Sophina nods
Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her neck
She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away
Oscar kisses her again
Puts his hand in her hair
Osc
Osc, hold up
Oscar stops
Sophina scoots away even further

Oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser and hides it in the closet
He rushes over and opens the door where we see  , a cute 4 year old girl, standing wearing footie pajamas
can't sleep
Before Tatiana can even finish, Oscar has her in his arms
He brings her over to the bed and places her next to Sophina
You want to sleep in here with Mommy and Daddy
Tatiana nods
You know better than that
(to Oscar) What time is it
Oscar picks up his phone and looks at it
Damn, it's after midnight
He opens his phone up
Presses compose text message (as he types the message, the words appear as graphics across the screen like Sub Titles) : Oscar sends the text off
He hooks his phone up to the charger and hits the light switch, leaving us in darkness
Daddy
Wussup, baby
don't want to move to Livermore
Oscar and Sophina laugh at this

There looks to be a lot on his mind

' - -                          4 Sophina and Oscar move around the small kitchen like a well oiled machine
Sophina, wearing a WalMart uniform, makes two lunches
Oscar wipes milk from Tatiana's face and fixes her hair
Mommy can  have two of the fruit snacks today
No,
You can take an extra apple if you want
But mommy - Don't argue
Tatiana pouts
Sophina downs a cup full of orange juice, grabs both lunch bags, Tatiana, and heads for the door
(') Com'on Osc
We gotta stop and get gas too
We got enough to get yall there
Sophina shoots Oscar a look
(') Go start the car up

picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door
Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair
He looks back at the car
We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror
Oscar turns to Tatiana
He then takes her hand, and places something inside of it
Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks
She looks up at Oscar with a bright eyed expression
But Oscar quickly places his finger over his lips
Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile
She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek
He stands up and knocks on the front door
a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens the door
Good morning Tatiana

The fuel gage sits almost under , but the light still isn't on
She stares at the store entrance
You gonna go home and sleep, right
Naw, Imma go up to the job

Ugh

Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead
Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car

He comes to a red light
He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58
He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied
He turns his music up for a beat and listens to it
He looks around, still not at ease
He turns off his music and pulls out his cellphone
He takes a quick look around to see what cars are around, before dialing numbers
flashes on the screen
He holds the phone to his ear

She walks towards the entrance of her store, when her cellphone rings in her purse
She pulls it out, stressed
Answers it without looking

You still got time to catch a cold
Wanda's face brightens up with a familiar looking smile

Okay

Oscar hesitates for a beat
Yeah

He looks around for his earpiece for beat- no luck
He takes his cellphone, and slides it into the elastic of his beanie- a poor man's Bluetooth
He pulls off
(') Hello

We follow him into- 11

Oscar walks over to the seafood section where Cato , a 22 year old charismatic Black male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron
Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly
He takes a pile of fish off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older
He takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the counter
Sup Osc, bruh
Shit

You lookin for Emi

Bruh  wish  could, but  gotta bust a couple moves tonight
What's good for the countdown though
Frisco
Fireworks and the whole shit- Oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye
He motions his head for Cato to look
Cato turns and sees- , a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone while waiting for help
Cato quickly makes his way over
You ready
Uh, yeah
want to get a pound of, wait
Can  see what your sole looks like
Sole
Cato takes a sidestep over to his left and motions to a pile of fish
Yeah, no, wait
Your catfish
Let me see what that looks like
Cato points to the catfish
Katie looks at it, then looks down to her phone
(') Okay but,  want to fry it
Like a fish fry
Are these the ones you can fry

Okay, let me have a second
She looks back down at her iPhone, and takes a step back
Cato turns to Oscar
What you need for moms, bruh
Let me get three Dungeness
Cato nods and walks over to the crab
(') Fat ones too, bruh
Bet
Oscar turns to Katie
Your family having a fish fry for New Years or something
Katie looks up from her phone, a bit caught off guard
Ahh, yeah
Something like that
It's cool
work here
She looks at Oscar suspiciously
(') It's my day off
Katie smiles nervously
Looks at Cato who nods at Katie in approval

And he really likes fried fish, like southern style
And maybe lied a bit, and said that know how to cook like that

Is he black

He's white
But he knows a lot of black people
He's not my boyfriend either

She uses her fingers to zoom in on something
(') 'm not sure what type of fish he wants
And most of these recipes are different on this site

Suddenly, an idea flashes before his eyes

Oscar looks over and sees, , a thirtysomething Hispanic man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag
He checks the shelves with a barcode scanning device
Oscar slowly heads over
Good morning, Emi
Oscar, what's going on
Had to grab some stuff for my Mom's birthday

He neatens up the room a bit, and takes off
18
-                                    18 The store is small and brightly lit
Oscar is reading a card from off the    rack
We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her son's hand
Inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous
Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before
Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat
He looks up, moved by the words
He stares off into space

-    -     19 We look through a foggy window at Wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them
There are a few  already sitting at tables with inmates
Several Corrections Officers stand by
We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking through the glass window of the search room
Corrections Officer is conducting a search
Oscar's face is bruised under his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face
He turns around, bends over and coughs
He turns back around, and the officer hands him his Blue shirt and pants
Oscar puts them on and- The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room to Wanda's table
As he approaches she stands up
Hey Ma
Oscar gives her a hug, leaning across the table

Oscar smiles and notices Wanda is smiling about something on her mind
(') What
Do you remember that microwave popcorn you bought a while back
Yeah, the kettle corn
Hella good
Yes, kettle corn
popped some of that for us, and  was putting it into a bowl
Tatiana's looking up at me, like she wants something
Wanda starts to chuckle a bit again
'mon
What she say
She looks up at me and says,"Grandma, do we have any dark butter
" Oscar looks at Wanda with a confused look
Dark butter
Yeah, 'm thinking she saw "Food Network" or something
So  say, "what's dark butter sweetheart
" She says, "When Daddy took me to see
he asked for light butter, so  want to try some dark butter this time
" Oscar looks at Wanda with a bright eyed expression
She is gettin way too smart
Another  from the door is heard

He has a large, square bandage under his left eye
(just loud enough for Oscar to hear) This moms right here
Anger flashes over Oscar's eyes
(') She a snitch to
What
What the Fuck you say about my Mom bruh
Oscar
Fuck you and that bitch
You tough in here with these guards huh
Two Corrections Officers move quickly over to Oscar's table
Cale, continues to walk towards a the table with the Woman and the Frizzy Haired Girl
1 Is there a problem here
Naw, we good
That's my best friend right there
Cale flashes a mischievous smile
The Corrections Officer comes over and stands between the two
Oscar watches as Cale sits down across from the woman, who holds the baby
Cale smiles at the woman, and makes coochie coo faces at the baby

Oscar looks on with malice
Oscar, Calm down
Wanda's voice snaps the anger off of his face
He looks back to Wanda, and his anger subsides
(') What happened to your face
Dark butter huh
She always listening
Wanda stares at Oscar
(') She too smart for her own good man
The preschool said we should think about starting her in school early
Phina tell you that
Wanda doesn't respond
(') Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school
was lookin at St
Bede the other day
It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish, then it gradually gets them back going on English
It's like a new thing- 'm not coming to see you anymore

You want to keep putting Sophina through this

But Tatiana doesn't deserve this
She didn't have a choice
Oscar takes this in
She too young to know what's going on right now

Oscar cut his eyes from Wanda
She aint say that
So 'm the liar now
Oscar takes a beat to think about this
Tell her that  love her more than anything in the world
And that - () Green (7/5/2012)                                          32

Or better yet, just let her come visit you

In a box
But this is how you are right now

You've already exposed her to it
Wanda leans back in her chair- she's done
So you really not gonna visit me no more

He pulls out his phone

It looks to be maybe 3 or 4 years old
Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over
Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes
He feels around the dog's neck- no collar
Oscar looks around for an owner for a beat while the dog licks his hand
- Oscar's gas tank is full
He turns away from the dog, places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap back in
He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see him
He scans the block and panic strikes his face
He takes off running towards the street
Shit
No, No, No Stop
We hear it before we see it
sickening sound
An animal , a car
Oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see
(') (at the car) Hey
Stop you bitch ass Muthafucka

It's the dog, and he's in bad shape

Sophina turns into the den, where Tatiana and her cousins are still asleep
She steps over them to get to Tatiana

Sophina turns the water on, helps Tatiana with her clothes, and puts her in
She takes off her own clothes and steps in as well
Is the water okay
Yeah
Where's daddy
Is he on vacation again
No
Sophina tries to find her words
Lets the water run on her face for a bit, then rubs down the friz in Tatiana's hair
(') Remember when  told you about God
and the angels
Yeah
And about how when we die we go to heaven
Yeah
Well, God needed another angel, so he took Daddy to come and live in heaven with him
Tatiana looks at Sophina for a long beat

He can't
Once you go to heaven, you can't come back
Tatiana thinks about this

Maybe if  call him and talk to him, he will come back
No
Daddy doesn't have his cellphone baby
You can't call him where he is
