Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back

That woman can take care of her own goddamn -- Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and goes down
Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel
The look on his face isn't anger
It's
He pulls at the flaps of his Elmer Fudd hat
then calmly walks away
The camera pans until we discover : in his trademark black Mariani suit
He's been watching the whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea

He places his cup daintily back on the saucer

He glances back over at the murder scene
(') Apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young man's tale that Henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation
He shrugs: `Who would've thought it
' (') Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous
and we wouldn't have our little movie
Instead, we'd have more nice, safe, predictable ones like these

Alma manages a polite smile as Lew helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment to sign his autograph for the blond fan

We move past chrome fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and arrive at that same pudgy hand pouring    '53 into a cut crystal glass
soaks in the tub

Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor
At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes shift to the -  on the bathroom door
We catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and matching bra
She takes out some  and holds them up to the light
Hitchcock watches enthralled
He puts down his glass and shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against the sides
- Alma pauses when she hears the small splashes
Neither upset nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt from the drawer
() : Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows
Hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd been reading the whole time
Talking of arrows, did you read Mr
Weiler's review in the New York Times
Apparently, he found "the climax" to be -- and  quote -- "overdrawn
" doubt whether Mr
Weiler has had a climax in years
Alma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times
And how about this little grenade
() North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers
" () And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense
Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs
They're all young
Thinner
And with hair

Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me
He catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly
Alma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side

And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one
She comes over and kisses the top of his head
You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you
Right between the shoulder blades learned it from your pictures
She moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again
Where are you off to

Why don't you join us
We've just established that 'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight
You'll feel better as soon as you find a project
Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet
Sleeping pills with dust jackets
Alma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length mirror
Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear
Well
Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article
Very presentable

He pours Alma another glass of wine, not remotely insulted

Alma turns to look at the menu again
All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion

Alma notices

He drains it playfully

Everyone in town's already passed

The story department finished the coverage this morning
Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer
He takes the coverage and reads for himself
(') "Graphic elements of brutal violence, voyeurism, transvestitism and incest
" Certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase, is he
He gives a grunt of approval
You're kidding

This is the boy who dug up his own mother

He takes another gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view

Hungry

There are calories in that, you know
But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his imagination starting to turn
, , 1945 - Ed enters the bedroom
His mother, Augusta, is in the bed, faced away from him
Aren't you cold, ma
She doesn't answer
We follow him to the dresser where he lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side
He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her
Still wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and crawls up next to her

As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face

She hands him back the book

Killing off your leading lady halfway through
Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response
Clearly he isn't going to let this one go
(') You're intrigued
Admit it
She butters her toast, casually taunts him by adding a large spoon of marmalade
Actually,  think it's a huge mistake
Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy
(') You shouldn't wait till halfway through
Kill her off after 30 minutes
( 17) ' ,  - Hitch enters with purpose, carrying a stack of photos and articles
Peggy,  want you to summon your minions
Minions
Certainly
And who might they be
Hitch heads for his office, in no mood for wise cracks
He spreads out the articles on the desk
Photos and magazine articles about Ed Gein
Get them started buying copies of "Psycho
" Peggy stands in the doorway, watching -- How many do you need
All of them
want every copy, nationwide
() () : (') Have them scour every book shop and library
"Psycho" is my next picture, and don't want anyone to find out the ending until they see it in the theater
Peggy shakes her head
All that celery's affecting your brain
She walks over, notices the   headline : " " Stark black and white photographs expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house

Hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions
Is this really going to be you're next picture, Mr

That is my intention, madam
Yes
Hitch taps the photo of

The other columnists scribble down the quote
Am  the only one who finds this offensive

Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen
(') Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real fingers
He snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it
(') Peggy
'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old secretary from Phoenix, Arizona
He looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door, putting food onto trays
() : (2) (') Her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers
Hitch sees  lean into view and innocently whisper something into Alma's ear making her laugh
How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off
Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke
He now only has eyes on the pantry ahead
He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew
It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat -- (re: the faces of the ) told you, Hitch
This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd
Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests -- ,  - Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen
Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying
You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know
'm a big boy

Well,  loved it
What terrific fun it must have been to research
Certainly more fun than reading those reviews

Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming in the doorway
Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and turns
(') Speak of the devil
Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush
(') have to admit, Hitch,  ran all over town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but couldn't find a single one
wonder how that could have happened
Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence
Then leans in to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into Alma's ear a moment earlier
(') Don't stop looking on my behalf
Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry back into the living room

Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them
Audiences want to be shocked, Barney
They want something different
And this is it
He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of Balaban
The truth is, Hitch, every time you want to do something "different" like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money
Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away
So we should stop trying to give them something new
You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch
Can't you do something like North by Northwest but for us this time instead of for
Hitch's stare remains inscrutable
(') We've offered you dozens of perfectly good properties
() "Psycho
" Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare
The Paramount executives shift uncomfortably
No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount
But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse
() : Are you telling me "no
" Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front
think you know me better than that, Hitch
would never say "no" to you
Hitch's suppressed rage is building
but Balaban says nothing
- Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy courtyard past Hitch's office
What a putz
You know what his family did before they built those movie palaces
Ran a grocery store
My father ran a grocery store
Exactly
That's what 'm saying
He should show some respect
Hitch turns to Lew
They think 've lost my touch, Lew
My association with television has cheapened me
Are you referring to that deal  got you where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine grand an episode and you own the negative
That's my kind of cheap
They just want the same thing over and over
They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid
Lew puts a comforting hand on him
Hitch,  will never let that happen

Eight hundred thousand
Give or take

contemplative Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black sunglasses and a business suit
He watches Alma a moment
Finally she notices him
You're back early
He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade
Alma gets out and towels herself off
(') 'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance
What about him
He knows you well enough
She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit
It's starting to look a little threadbare
Enjoy the pool now
We might not have it for that much longer
He looks off cryptically
Why
() : Paramount refuses to finance the movie
Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful
He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair
(') Lew can't find the money
Not quickly enough at least
Why not wait
He doesn't reply
She knows him well enough too and doesn't question him further
We're going to have to go it alone, old girl

Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool
She looks at Hitch but he's not joking
She turns to survey their beloved home and gardens

Why this one, Hitch
It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it

Someone even his wife doesn't see that often
- The famous gates and the executive building beyond it
(-) Barney, we're about to propose a restructured deal for "Psycho"
'  ,  - Balaban watches Hitchcock and Lew closely
Hitchcock again is like a waxworks Buddha, revealing nothing
We finance it
Independently
Paramount only distributes it
in exchange for 40 percent of the profits
Interesting
But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing
Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress
What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock
No-one's arguing that
Barney, it's very simple
This is Mr
Hitchcock's next film
Are you in or are you out
long silence
Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project
Let me talk it over with a few people internally and 'll get back to you
() : No
Now
Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares
Not unimpressed by their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his head, a king in his counting room
Fine
We'll take that deal
If you can get the money
Finally, Hitchcock speaks up : We've already got it, Barney
He pulls out his   and opens it on the desk
Barney watches as Hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its mount
(') Who do  make it out to

All traces of his bravado are gone
If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow- eating
The movie will be splendid
Are you sure
Of the movie
Not in the least
But of you
Unquestionably

Hitch stares out hoping for some human moment to spy on
He's restless
Peggy ushers  , 30s, into Hitch's office
Joe Stefano
Good to meet you

(') Sorry  was late
My shrink session ran overtime

thought only director's assistants needed psychiatrists, not writers
Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips out
The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely intimidated
Do you see a shrink, Mr
Hitchcock
Hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the ceiling
No
His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling

The usual: sex
Rage

Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued

She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen
There's still the federal income tax payments
the property taxes
Not to mention the absence of any salary while he's actually making the film
Stop waffling, Donald
Give it to me straight
() : The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage to look his favorite client in the eye
Hitch wasn't exaggerating
If the film's a flop, you're going to have to sell the house
Alma digests this
Where do you suggest we cut
Anywhere you can
,  - Alma's moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the accounts herself, the dogs at her feet
Her face is now properly filled with concern
Hitch enters, holding out some typed pages
Alma covers her worry
He puts the pages on the table next to her

Why don't you take a look
Alma takes Stefano's pages and starts to read
Hitch goes to the fridge and opens the door
We're about to have dinner
You don't need anything else
He shuts the door
Leans against the fridge door
Hitch waits but she gives nothing away

Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower
She won't be nude
She'll be wearing a shower cap
Shurlock makes a note
man utterly devoid of any sense of humor
() : We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted
Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt
Shurlock turns the page
Then -- this scene with the toilet
It's completely necessary
Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister
It's a clue to the girl's disappearance
No American movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it
Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive
Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead
No response from Shurlock's end of the room
Peggy stares down at the table
Mr
Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country
Will you be making jokes then
Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug
(') Good
Now why don't we go all the way back to page two
boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages -- ' ,   - Sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock trying his best to recline on an '

It's just that, more and more lately, 've been having these

Finally Hitchcock is still
He stares up at the ceiling
Strong ones

He's in his pajamas
His hand trembles next to a stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned at the back of the shelf

Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots
Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over '
The Lazar Office tells me he's crazy to work with you
() : Well, tell "Swifty" he shouldn't have overexposed his client on television
Unlike certain people we could mention
Hitch ignores the barb
Undeterred, Alma pushes her ace card: a photo of  , radiating offbeat sensitivity and teen idol looks
(') Think of the duality he could bring to Norman
The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin
The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out
Why, Alma, you're not suggesting that Mr
Perkins is --
She raises her pinky finger just slightly
Alma nods without judgement
Pondering
' ,  - Anthony Perkins now sits across from Hitchcock
can't count how many times 've seen Strangers On a Train and Rope
Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies
Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not
Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins
My only worry is that playing Norman might cut too close to home
How so
() : Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor
was incredibly close to my mother
So close  remember wishing my father would drop dead
And then when  was five, he did just that
He keeled over from a heart attack
( ) You see 've been guilty my whole life, Mr
Hitchcock
Hitch is enthralled
Try to remember this is all just make believe
Perkins wishes he could be more reassured
Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother
Further than you can possibly imagine
On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself in for
,  - Hitchcock's    as he grunts and heaves
He's dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the rose garden
Alma pushes a  filled with manure
She shovels the manure around the rosebushes
'm getting blisters just looking at you
Stop grumbling
bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need
He holds his   menacingly over a deep red Sydonie rose
() : If  could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything
Well you can't
She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable
Hitchcock beheads the , muttering to himself
And all the more desirable
His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen
Lew suggested Deborah Kerr
Too
Scottish
Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose
What about Janet Leigh
She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil
Lew mentioned her name
Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties
As the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut
: '  - as she elegantly enters the dining room of Chasen's
Hitch stands to greet her, his eyes follow her across the room in some private rapture
Alma watches as Janet removes her glove and shakes Hitch's hand
before he guides her to the spot to his left, across from Alma
'  - Hitch finishes telling his story
() : Of course the real secret of Mrs
Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar
He's so deadpan
it takes a moment before she laughs
You know, 've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion 'd almost forgotten how to laugh
Hitch summons the waiter with a snap
Now, you must try the banana shortcake
Nothing for me, thank you
'm watching my figure
Alma watches all this with a fixed smile
You're not the only one
(to the waiter) We're fine, thank you
Hitchcock ignores Alma, gesturing to the waiter again
Bring her the banana shortcake, George
In fact make it two large portions
He pointedly shifts to face Janet
(') So do tell me, how else have you've prepared to play Marion
Janet hesitates
've written a complete history for her
It seems silly, but it helps me
She turns to pull a   from her handbag, Hitch's gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair, tied immaculately into the classic `Hitchcock bun'
() : (2) It doesn't sound silly at all
Tell me one of her deepest secrets
quick look to Alma, as if to ask for permission before : She leads a double life
For instance, when she works at the Lowery office, she wears Tweed perfume
But, when she and Sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin" by Lanvin
She notices Alma's expression
(') But
do have a concern or two
'm an actress but 'm also a wife and mother first, so 'm wondering just how you'll do that shower scene
You and the Shurlock Office
It's just
mean even if you shoot me from here -- (she indicates a spot just above her bosom) -- well it's not as if my figure is boyish
Hitchcock looks down at her torso, as if noting it for the first time
Allow me to put your mind at rest
Alma reacts as Hitch reaches over and gives Janet's hand a reassuring squeeze
(') May  show you some of Mr
Saul Bass's marvellous story boards
Hitch pulls out his folio case and shows Janet the storyboards (which we don't see)
(') plan to shoot quick bits of film from various angles
() () : (3) (') Cut together, this montage will suggest nudity and violence but nothing will actually be shown
Janet studies them, deeply impressed
And relieved
(') And having you in the shower will make it all the more tit-illating -- If you'll excuse me
Alma's had enough
Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma get up and head to the restroom
She's unsure of what just happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely oblivious or not caring at all
' ,   - Alma enters and looks in the mirror, quietly devastated
She looks up to find another reflection in a mirror behind her
Alma is   into a Technicolor Hitchcock blonde
In a beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet perfection, her hair blonde and impeccable
Oh, come off it, old girl
bitchy  '  snaps Alma out of her reverie, joining her at the sink to powder her face
Alma, dear, how lovely to see you
Hello Lillian
You're looking a little pale
No wonder with that thing your husband's working on now
You can't possibly approve
She's had a drink too many but the throwaway comment still hits Alma hard
(') Why are you letting him do something so tasteless
() : Don't upset yourself, darling
It's only a bloody movie
,  - Like in a Douglas Sirk movie
The same roses that are the `color' of Janet Leigh
Alma hovers with her secateurs for a moment and then starts  off their heads with a Caligula-like lack of mercy
,  - vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the table
Hitch  into a refrigerator filled with boring tasteless health-conscious food
Alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten
've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt
She places the list on the table
(') It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint
Hitch goes over and picks it up, and reads
The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver
No
Absolutely not
We'll find other places to cut
There aren't any other places
And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either
We can't afford it
She snatches the list out of his hand
(') The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate
But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles
() : She turns back to him
We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred
She leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the fridge
but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling hunger
He  the fridge and -- '  - Suddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling, just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear , then move over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags  ' , feet-first up the stairs
The clunking is from her head on the steps, which is wrapped in her dress
' ,  - Ed approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a He pushes the body into the tub
Pulls the dress off her head and drops it on the floor
Stay here
'm going to get the knives
We pan to   standing in the corner
He looks terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist creeping forward for a thorough inspection
Hitch's  as he steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood- spattered   and
Suddenly --   the rim of the tub
Help me
Hitch recoils but she   and  his throat
Ed
Ed
: ,  - Hitchcock bolts upright in bed, face beaded with sweat in the moonlight
Ed
Ed
() : It takes a moment to get his bearings
(') Am  making a mistake
Alma stirs in her bed
(') What if it's another Vertigo
Oh, shut up
Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine
But Hitch isn't looking convinced
,   - sign posted outside the soundstage reads, " 9401
" It only makes passing    more curious
,   - Inside, it's a hive of quiet purposeful activity escorts   across the far side of the stage
She's 30, a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the Grace Kelly mold
still can't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister
Hitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the London Times
've still got her under contract
may as well get something out of it
Rather a thankless role, don't you think
For an utterly thankless girl
But he still watches  over the top of his newspaper as the
leads her through the maze of hazardous cables and light stands towards the fitting room
She passes an actor in a  '  trying on various sunglasses with the prop master
() : Shurlock's office called again
They want to know when you'll be making the changes to the script
Hitch gets up from his chair
The more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane
He goes over to specify the correct sunglasses that should be worn
The Cop puts on the  shades
Hitch nods his approval
- Alma browses through them carefully
They are all perfectly nice, if a little staid
Her eyes suddenly catch a   on the end of the rail
It's striking, even a little risque
She looks at the price tag
It's insanely expensive
She turns to go
stops
then impulsively turns back and grabs it, heading into the changing room and closing the door behind her
light blasts through    in the wall
An positions itself in front of the peephole
'    - We hear the  of two women quietly conversing on the other side
Strains to get a better view
We catch teasing glimpses of golden girl Vera Miles stripping down to bra and panties
- '  fills the frame as he peers through the tiny hole
We reveal Vera with sharp, bohemian costumer , 27, who drapes taupe-colored fabric to Vera's contours
() : Break it to me gently
Am  playing a lesbian librarian
(re: the fabric) He chose it himself and had it imported from Paris
Vera laughs dryly at a  on a dummy head
If  wear that, 'm going to look like George Washington
Wait until you see the undergarments he picked out for you
Vera tosses off her shirt
just have to keep telling myself, one more picture and 'm free as a bird
She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right near the  where we just saw Hitchcock's eye
His eye is gone, only darkness from the other side
Vera feels a chill and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm
(') Is there a fan blowing somewhere
Rita returns with a punitive bra and girdle
(') Wow
The old man really is unhappy with me, isn't he
'  ,   - Hitch knocks at the door
Are you decent my dear
steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and pencil skirt
She does a twirl for him
The effect is stunning
Even the stagehands stop to watch
Am  alright
() : His picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve
Perfect
As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet them
want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr
Hitchcock
It's just "Hitch", Tony
Hold the cock
Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused
Tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek
(') Look at you two
America's favorite boy and girl nextdoor
Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch
And we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood
Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch and Janet's little clique
Hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling
Morning Janet
Morning Tony
Vera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig
(') "Thanks" for the wardrobe, Hitch
(already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier
Don't you approve
You're the genius
She checkmates him with a ravishing smile
(') One thing, though
My script is missing the last ten pages
() : (2) Everyone's is
Until Alma finishes the revisions
Now hurry along, Vera
You're just in time for the oath
The what
He steers her towards a line of laughing   forming a circle with the rest of the cast
He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand
The cast and crew duly follow suit, all except for Vera
solemnly promise
solemnly promise
(ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That  will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho
That  will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho
' Then tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval
Vera pokes her tongue out
To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight
Eisenhower, God bless him
Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him
,  - sits at the desk typing away at the revisions for "Psycho
" -- we see the title page
tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of wilting flowers
() : She pauses, takes off her glasses and pushes aside her corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work
She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the sunlight
then turns to the expensive-looking half-open on the side
We hear a   -- ,  - As Alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new swimsuit
She breaks into a front crawl
Her strokes are vigorous, surprisingly so
She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with rising intensity
harder and harder
faster and faster
,   - Hitch guides Janet and Tony across the sound stage to the set of Norman's parlor
Now, Hitch, explain to me why 'm watching Marion undress
feel like  should take offense at that
She and Tony laugh
Hitch's eyes light up at this display of mischief from her
don't know
Perhaps as a boy, Norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath
Maybe there was a transom over the bathroom door
Yes -- one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy
Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother
() : So
'm reliving the past, repeating a ritual with Marion
You're the actor
You figure it out
Tony flinches at Hitch's brusque response
They arrive at the set wall, where Hitch removes a painting to reveal the
Hitch,  have a question
Why is the hole much larger on this side
All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear
Janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole
Hitch studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity
Tony hangs back, watching Hitch watching her
Wow
You really do your research, don't you
It's just my Jesuit work ethic
He takes a quick peek through the hole now too
then puts the painting carefully back into place over it
(-) (') The truth is
'm only happy when 'm working
' ,   - Hitch lies on his Analyst's couch
and if 'm not working then 'm nothing
'm not even a person
'm just a collection of molecules
useless cylinder of ugly flesh
The Analyst circles one of his notes on a pad with his Montblanc
Again, we notice how rough-hewn his hands are
() : '  (
) What about your mother
Let's go back to her
My mother
Yes
Hitch looks over at the unseen analyst and considers him
(') She was an extraordinary person
She exposed me to Ibsen, Strindberg, Shaw
She hoped  would go into engineering -- carry a lunch pail, gold watch at fifty
'  (
) She didn't approve of your career
To her, movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes
He turns back to look out the window
(') If  misbehaved, she'd make me stand at the foot of her bed and discuss how planned to become a better boy
The Analyst leans forward and we see his dirty, worn-down fingernails
'  (
) Have you ever considered that your deep desire to gain the approval of your industry represents a textbook case of transference
() The Oscar is your mother
It's
In his Sunday best, his shovel leaning against the mahogany-paneled wall in the background
You're a fine one to talk
,   - Hitchcock leads Janet to a row of brassieres, all laid out for inspection
They are all white with recognizable labels: Berlei, Triumph, Marks & Spencer
He picks out one of them
() : You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed
And then after you've stolen the money
They move on to a second row of brassieres - all dark
switch to one of these
He nods, correct
She moves over to a mannequin displaying the iconic jet black brassiere
Are you sure you don't want to look at something a little more elegant
() No
They have to look like they were bought at Sears and Roebuck
want every woman in the audience to look up at Janet having sex with John Gavin and think, `that could be me'
Janet reads the label
It's "Maidenform
" This is the brand  wear
Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita
We're ready for a fitting
As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her
(
-) We travel across the rooftops of downtown Phoenix and finally, through the heat, pick out a certain hotel window
,   - Close on Hitchcock's   as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down
We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself
,   - '  have now become  , recording the scene already underway and now watched by , his and  from across the stage
(
) We pan over and discover John and Janet on the bed
the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed
It's serious stuff
(') She'll be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction
smiles up at John contentedly
watching from his directing chair
Peggy stands next to him
(') Cut
Good luck getting this one past the censor
,   - Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the and pulls up to the production office outside the stage
,   - Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks'
You girls go on ahead
The   stops to make Whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others
,   - Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the production boards
If you ask me, the credits should read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville
" The people who matter know
That's all that counts
As she makes a few more changes to the schedule
Alma turns to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading
Clearly it's strong stuff
'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this
She puts the pages down
(') Alma, you always know the answer
Is this really going to work
candid moment between the two women
but Alma doesn't answer, just leaves
,   - Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there
Hello, stranger
She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac
Whit
Where have you been hiding yourself
've been doing the revisions on
She points to the   on the ridge
() : Psycho
() And how is the old boy
In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set
And you
How are you
Not bad
've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder
He looks at her a moment
've got a better idea
He steps closer
(') Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara
We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy steaks we like at El Encanto
He playfully tugs at her sleeve
(') No shoptalk
No silly magazine articles
just a wonderful meal
Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the of the production office and notice the tell-tale in the blinds
,   - Hitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just like he did with the other couple earlier
Except this little interaction is far from dull
We're ready for you on the set, Mr
Hitchcock
'll be right there
() : But Hitch doesn't move
Mr
Hitchcock

She walks through to - ,  - - and puts the grocery bags down on the counter
She listens
The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind -- Was there a line at the market
Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's cryptic ways
No
Actually, 'm back sooner than expected
She puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner
Would you like a cocktail
He heads for the liquor cabinet
No
(he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either
Hitchcock stops
Pulls out a   from one of the bags and bites it
(') Those haven't been washed yet
() don't care
() was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive
His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture
() : He takes another , searching her face for some tell-tale sign of guilt
(') Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be better in the scene
You should tell Whit that
He'd be flattered
She gets to work preparing a salad
Hitch studies the back of her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as they rise and flex
,  - Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma finishes getting ready
Maybe  was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book
Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it
Alma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so- nonchalantly
(') Lovely woman, Elizabeth
He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder victim
She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she knows she doesn't like it
(') was hoping you could come by the set tomorrow
'll see how my day shapes up
She turns onto her side away from him
Pulls the blankets around her, her eyes still
(-) You think you can get away with it but you can't
Alma's eyes become ' , staring ahead intently
,   -   - You think they can't tell
but they can
They know
It's all closing in on you
The noose is tightening
As he continues, we pull back and see: - Janet emotes for Hitchcock's  while "driving" a , being rocked by
Peggy and other  time and mark the takes turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's worried face like car headlights
(') You could return the money secretly, but what would be the point
He wipes his brow, getting more intense
(') You, Marion Crane
The prim and proper girl who's always been so tight and respectable
So perfect and untouchable
Well, they know all about your dirty little secret, don't they
Your messy, sticky lunchtime trysts
Yes, your boss Mr
Lowery could even smell the sex on -- film breaks and a frame burns
It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny
As technicians yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy -- (') Circle that
'   - As Janet gets changed, Vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a rack, looking over a little enviously at Janet's good girl/bad girl underwear hanging nearby
Have you talked to him much about your personal life
() : Not really
'd keep it that way if  were you
(Off Janet's look) He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have
Janet finds this a little hard to believe
Vera leans in, lowering her voice
(') That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo
That's Hitch, only younger, slimmer and better-looking
That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet
Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart
They both turn, sensing something -- and see ' in the hallway
The shadow lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story
() See
He's always watching
They laugh nervously
,   - Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea, a circled copy of  Guide next to her
On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright
The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook, Adaptation by Alma Reville
" Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's together
The words "   " overwhelm the small screen
Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry
,  - heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk
,  - Hitch's personal collection
Alma enters and starts to go through them
Each photo is turned over a little more roughly than the last
It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left for her to find
Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to dial
,   - As the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides over to  who's dialing a phone
What's the hold up
It's still engaged
He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from her dressing room, script in hand
Hitch, 'm stuck on Lila's first scene don't know how strongly  should confront Sam and the detective and  -- () Fake it
He turns his back on her and dials
The   blares in his ear
His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with bits of  and
(') Does it really require two men to carry a light stand
'll take care of it right away, Mr
Hitchcock

Off Peggy's questioning look
It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket
He raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and redials
,  - But Alma's still on the phone to Whit, basking in his charm
Her feet are up
There's a drink in her hand
( ) Well,  think that sounds like a fabulous idea
We'll have a late lunch
'll make the reservation for one thirty
What would  do without you
Till then, bye
She hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already when the  rings again very quickly
She picks up without even thinking -- () What did you forget now
,   - Pudgy fingers clench the coiled   as we move up to Hitch's face
He's silent as a burglar, not even daring to breathe
( ) Whit
Is that you
The blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and carefully replaces the receiver
His mind starts to spin
He's got to get out of there
Hitch lurches towards the production office, starting to sweat, but his path is blocked by  laying cables
The set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos
appears -- () : Mr
Hitchcock, every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos -- Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips are moving a ladder
He turns, kicks a platter of healthy snacks out of the way, only for an  to swivel in his face and blind him
Are you okay
You've gone very pale
Peggy's face suddenly comes into focus
Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet
It's not even three
Give me the key
He snatches it and pushes past her, leaving her flat
,   -  - exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless face of   blocking his office door
Hello, Hitch
How's the picture
'm hearing interesting things
It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office
Balaban offers up his handkerchief
Hitchcock waves it away even though he's now covered in sweat
shouldn't be in a position of just hearing things, Hitch
It's time you showed me some footage
Why
() : To see if you're making a picture Paramount can actually release
As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut
Your contract also says Paramount isn't required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment
Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of
He slams the door in Balaban's startled face
' ,   - Hitchcock loosens his collar and catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror
He's unraveling and it shows

Hitch lowers the window blinds over Balaban's face and fumbles for the phone
Connect me to Maxim's of Paris

Alma wears white- rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf

Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they
It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two
She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past
(') Whit, where are we going
You still haven't told me

How fun
Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car off down the highway

Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her After a moment she toots her horn and drives up
What happened to your driver
've been asking myself the same thing
She smiles

Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door
-  - Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden
didn't
She turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat
It's only now that  truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was
She notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of   on the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout "Psycho"

He takes one and chews it curiously
So this is what they eat at the drive- ins
He takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one after the other
thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate
Needs must when the devil drives, my dear
He's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking or not
She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair

Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf
The water laps over their toes
don't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art
just don't like it when he uses it against me
He's like any great artist
Impossible to live with but worth the effort

Did you know when we started out  was his boss
He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director
Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through her fingers
What do you think of that place over there
He nods to a    up the way
Looks nice
Terrific location
Why
It's mine
She looks at him askance

Why on earth didn't she tell me
She doesn't know about it
- The sun is setting on the Hitchcocks' driveway
The  pulls to a stop in front of the front door
() : Janet looks over -- decides to risk it
So what did happen between you and Vera
was going to make her star
But she chose the life of a housewife
He stops chewing
We push in as his features turn reflective
(') cast her as the lead in Vertigo
Then two weeks before filming she told me was pregnant
He screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet
Then, almost like a child -- (') Why do they do it
Why do they always betray me
As she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy just sitting there
- Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around
It is old and falling apart with only a few functional furnishings
'm just leasing it for the offseason place to get away from the wife and kid and write
Very Bohemian
You might find that room interesting
Alma looks
The door is partially open -- she sees the one conspicuously new item of furniture
double bed
Whit
hope you haven't got the wrong idea
() : He gives her a rakish grin, then pushes the door open further to reveal the deck beyond
Sit on a table facing each other
If you were serious about helping me adapt my book,  thought it would be the perfect hideaway
She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and the crashing surf
Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the typewriters
Gives the key an approving
,  - Hitch enters the empty house at dusk
The dogs greet him
He listens a moment
then walks through to the study
,  - Hitch pours himself a brandy and downs it in one
He goes to pour himself a second, when he notices something on the desk
It's his collection of  by the
They're all neatly stacked
With a    on top
,  - Hitch lies in bed, his thoughts racing as he waits for Alma to come home
Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway
He turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening to the sound of the front door
and Alma's footsteps down the hall
She quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before turning the light on
He watches her shadow through the strip of light at the bottom of door
When the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly closes his eyes
() : Alma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside, peering down on him
She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but she suspects
,  -  () Hitch eases himself up and looms over Alma to make sure she is safely asleep
He silently picks up her  and takes it to the window
Using the moonlight he searches its contents
Car keys
Lipstick
Purse
And the first few pages of a story outline: "  " The pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal the rest of the  : " &

Hitch stands in the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave, shoving in mouthful after mouthful
It's almost pornographic in its indulgence
steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on Hitch's shoulder
We hear the civilized  of cutlery against china
,   - Hitch and Alma sit at the table having lunch
Alma eats a pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad
He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores
So  read your finished treatment
"Taxi to -- " Where was it
Dubrovnik
That's it
Dubrovnik
Care to hear my opinion
Yes
Naturally
() : There's no other way of saying it
It's stillborn
Dead in the water
Alma blinks, unable to hide her shock
How so
(with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle
Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes
And your villain is weak
But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine
He picks up a radish and bites into it
(') If you weren't so smitten with your friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see that
Alma is entirely stunned
Hitchcock has delivered the killer blow he intended
He gets up and goes over to the garden door
(') Women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they
As he steps out into the garden -- How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman
,  - Hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it
His annoyance only increases when he notices the `contaminating` the surface of the pool
Look at this mess
He grabs the net and starts scooping them out
(') Bloody belt-tightening
() : He can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down on his hands and knees and starts   the leaves with his hands
watches from the window
then turns away
Pulls out handful after handful of wet leaves, clawing away at them like a madman

The   gives the thumbs up
Tell the boss we're ready
,   - Peggy and
Hilton Green exchange a glance as Hitchcock paces up and down in the corridor, eager to get to work
What's the hold-up
Call time was two hours ago
Peggy nervously knocks on Janet's door and peers inside -- '   - Rita Riggs is hard at work molding   to Janet's nipples
And you're sure this moleskin will stay put
Mr
Hitchcock promised
() : Neither woman looks convinced but they proceed with blind faith
It better
'm going to be taking a shower all week
As Janet slips on her robe, a    onto the floor
Rita and Janet share a worried look
,   - Alma sits at her typewriter while Whit stares off, looking a little uncertain
Forget what Hitch said
He's just feeling his age
He'll come around
But he's right
It does need more feeling
Alma ponders the problem
Finally -- So why don't we put some in
She gets to her feet and starts to pace
(') All we need is a better catalyst
Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire
The soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless of   -- ,   -    - Janet nervously removes her bathrobe and heads toward the Good morning
He takes her hand and guides her into position
(') As  explained earlier, this scene will be made up of many shots from Mr
Bass's boards
series of looks - actions
() () : (') Well, you're the professional
You'll know how to do it
Around them, the crew frantically finalize the  and look uncomfortable and excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie star
Saul Bass comes over with his boards and Hitch and he discuss the planned shot a moment
Tony's stunt double is ready
Ah
There's our murderess
Into frame steps Anthony Perkins'   , , wearing a gingham dress, silver wig and She wields a large   and almost blocks our view of Janet in the white-tiled stall
(') ( ) Are you ready for our little bloodbath
My mother always said, "Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything
" Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity : My mother used to say the same thing
() Let's go for a take
Quiet everyone
Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body
(') Cut
More intensely
Let's go again
Margo's  comes at Janet uncertainly and every which way
Naked and exposed, Janet defends against the knife blows as they come at her but Margo's still pulling her punches-- (') No
More angry
You are possessed with unbridled homicidal rage
( ) Cut
Cut camera
() : (2) He charges over to Margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing gesture he demands
(') Does no one understand what 'm trying to accomplish here
'm older than anyone on this stage and 'm still standing
Everyone falls silent, unsure how to respond
Hitchcock (') Give me the knife
Margo places the knife in Hitchcock's palm
(') Props
Bring in more blood
squirts more "blood" onto Janet from a
(') Roll camera
As the scene is marked, we see Hitchcock's anxiety
There is except Hitchcock's ragged breathing
Ready, sir
Hitchcock nods
The camera whirs
Hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence
-- We see in the shower from Hitchcock's  not Janet but Hitchcock  the censor a killer blow that sends him reeling
-- Shurlock is replaced by
Hitchcock stabs him with unleashed fury and hate
-- turns, he's naked and smiling
Hitch plunges the knife into his back, and he drops, revealing , arms around his waist
-- We're back in the real moment --    as she gives the `performance' of a lifetime
Hitchcock stops stabbing
His heart pounds
He's soaked with sweat
The only sound is the drip-drip-drip of the shower
As he realizes  is staring at him
He straightens his tie, attempting to regain some semblance of control
Print
We've got it
He exits quickly
Rita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing Vera who's witnessed the whole thing
She's wearing a bathrobe
Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now understand
' '  -   - Hitch shuts his office door and leans back against it
He closes his eyes, nauseated and dizzy
He doesn't even need to open them to know who's there, waiting for him
Not now, Ed
It's really not a good time
He staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup
Ed steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder
You just can't keep this stuff bottled up
But before Hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor
'  -   - Peggy and Perkins to react to the noise
'  -   - They come through the door to see Hitch lying on the floor
He looks like he's dead
Oh God
() : Peggy rushes forward to help
Perkins just stands and stares, as if paralysed in some Freudian nightmare
starts to ring
,   - It is inside the beach house, and partially drowned out by the sound of the crashing waves
Alma and Whit are on the deck, acting out the scene as they write, too engrossed to notice
What if Helen and Michael try and get into the cab at the same time
Even better, what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time
Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch
(') That way, we could start close on the hands
(tracking the movement) and then tilt up to the eyes
They stare into each other's eyes, lips just inches apart
That feels better already
Finally, the phone intrudes
Are you going to get that
With some effort, Whit goes inside and picks it up
(
) Hullo
Yes
Hold on
He comes outside, holding out the receiver for Alma
(') It's for you
' ,   - Peggy grips the phone, her face full of concern
() : know you told me only to call in an emergency, but 'm not sure how else to describe this
Hitch lies slumped on the floor
compress over his forehead
His head lolls to one side as he slips in and out of consciousness
,   - Disarray on the set
watches as  , cameraman and
argue about the best way to proceed with the staircase sequence
Hitch is conspicuous by his absence
As they bicker we find Tony Perkins off to one side, sitting in his Mrs
Bates costume, unable to cope
He puts the wig back on his head
There, that feels better
Balsam's finally had it with all the arguing
He walks off past Peggy who's arriving with the
It's official
The inmates are running the asylum
Peggy hands Hilton the phone
Hilton
have Mr
Hitchcock for you
She gives him a warning look
"Watch out
He's in a terrible mood
" He waves away her concern
It can't be that bad
Hey there, Hitch
We're still working on it
(looking over at the ) Everyone misses you
,  - Hitch, in bed and sick as a dog, has the script, notes and boards on a bed tray
The phone receiver is pressed to his ears
() : 've told Peggy and now 'm going to tell you
You have to get this sequence shot today
What's the hold up
We tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible
Why don't we use inserts
No
It has to be a high angle
You'll tip off the big surprise
Just get the process shot
Hitch slams down the phone
,   - Still clutching the phone, a little nonplussed
Peggy gives him a look: "What did  tell you
" ,  - Alma removes the phone from Hitch's grasp
Touches his forehead
No more phone calls
You're burning up
Burning up our money
We're two days behind and 'm stuck in bed
Hitch swings his legs out of the bed
Where do you think you're going
To the set
We can't afford to lose any more time
Two more days of this and the whole production goes under
He shakily tries to get to his feet
You stay in bed
'll deal with it
'd hate to take you away from your writing partner
() : She pushes him back against the pillows
He's too weak to resist
Under the blankets
Now
,   - Crew members sit around eating donuts
Assistant director Hilton Green and cameraman Jack Russell are still arguing over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining in
It's near pandemonium
Then Alma steps in the door, and everything stops
Every crew member snaps to attention as Alma passes by
It's like the school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has lost control
Don't stop work because of me
'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries
Alma takes a seat in Hitch's ' chair
As her eyes dart around the set, it's clear that she Peggy flanks her
(') Scene
One seventy three
Storyboards
Peggy hands the boards to Alma
She and Hilton quickly review the boards
(') Start with the overhead
We'll cut before the fall
Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera
Hilton looks at Russell
Perfect
He sets   in his dress into place
(') (to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five
Peggy mouths Alma a silent " " for restoring order
,  - Hitchcock lies in bed, tossing and turning, the fever only making his thoughts darker and more obsessive
(
) You forgot to look in the bathroom
Hitch notices the   standing at the end of his bed
(') man like you
Missing the vital clue like that
He blearily sits up and sees Gein's impassive rustic face
What do you mean
Gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door
My mother always said if you're going to do a job, do it right
,  - Hitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and inspects it
but nothing seems out of place
Check the floor
He looks down but again, nothing
(') Closer
Hitch gets down on his hands and knees
He runs his fingertips across the smooth white tiles
They start to -- Sprinkled all over the floor
(') You still think they're just writing together
Hitchcock's face hardens
His lip trembles
() : (') So what are you going to do about it
Hitch gets up, opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a He empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully, sweeps the  into the aspirin bottle
He caps it, slips it into his robe pocket and turns off the light
,   - Alma spots the towering figure of Balaban stride onto the stage accompanied by a  in a cardigan
Barney
He sees her and bristles, clearly surprised to see her there
Alma
Alma takes in Balaban's companion, and the viewfinder round his neck
You know David Kirkpatrick
He's working on Jerry Lewis' next picture
She does
They nod politely -- then stand there
(') So he's free to help
(a sly smile) if you need it
Silence
Just the bustle of crew members in the background
That won't be necessary
But you're nearly three days behind
He takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves to block his path
It may be a small gesture, but it's highly charged
Barney stares down at her
() : Alma
We both know what kind of film this is
(then, closer) The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it
Thank you for your concern, Barney
She moves closer to him, holding his gaze, not bending one bit
(') But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director
The anger flashes on his face as she faces him down, the entire crew behind her now, holding firm
,   - Balaban, incensed, leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick
Alma steps out into the sunlight not far behind them
As she watches them leave, she lets out a breath
voice calls out to her -- ' Mrs
Hitchcock
She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a sleeveless top
She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package
hope you don't mind
heard Hitch was sick so  got him a little something
She hands Alma the gift
bag of candy corn tied with a ribbon
That's kind of you
Well, he's been very considerate with me
( ) haven't always had that from my directors
Janet, you've been very
professional
It hasn't gone unappreciated
() : Alma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her sincerity
She can't help but notice the second glances Janet is provoking from passers-by now
She's an impossible rival for any woman
' 3RD , `' Blares deafeningly
,  - On the stereo
Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a blanket and eating
May  turn that down
She silences the stereo
Hitch doesn't react
(') You'll be pleased to know order has been restored
He still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly
(') thank you would be nice
We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget
already cancelled the wrap party
That'll save us two thousand right there
And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake
She pulls at the bowl of ice cream
He refuses to let go
Beware -- all men are potential murderers
She yanks it from his grip
(') With good reason
() : Alright, what's this about
He slowly pulls the   from his robe pocket, building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours  into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him
Spending a lot of time at the beach
He puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction
That's where Whit and  are writing
He's rented a place
Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions
Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration
already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time
Didn't everyone say the same thing about "Psycho"
She reaches for the   to throw it away but Hitch grabs it first -- Are you and Whit having an affair
Don't be absurd
He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all
What a coincidence
'm working on something new and  could use a little help too
What do you think 've been doing
() : (2) Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy
Because it's fun
He quivers, livid
am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support
Full support
We've mortgaged our house
My house
Alma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury
(') Might  remind you that  have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades
And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want
celebrate with you if the reviews are good and  cry for you if they are not
host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies
And when you're out promoting this film around the world, will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when 'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if  were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock
" Hitchcock is stunned and silent
(') Now, for the first time in years,  dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and 'm met with accusation and criticisms
This work 'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose
() () : (3) (') And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder:  am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction
She turns and, with great dignity, leaves Hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom
He's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow
,   - with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features
dangles from the ceiling as prepare the film's climactic scene in the cellar
Hitch watches as  reaches out to touch the shoulder of Mrs
Bates
We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror, her  flying up to hit the light bulb, throwing crazy shadows all over the set
We push in on Hitchcock's face as the strobing light briefly illuminates the image of - at the foot of his mother's bed
'   - on a stand
frumpy woman's outfit on a hangar
Vera sits in front of the mirror and unties her own hair
Free at last
Rita collects Vera's detested wardrobe to take back to wardrobe
(') Thanks Rita
Vera rubs cold cream into her face to remove her make-up
In the mirror, she sees Hitch in the doorway as Rita squeezes past him on her way out
() : (') (wiping off her make-up with a Kleenex) Hello Hitch
Well, Vera
You always make it look so easy
Oh, it was nothing, Hitch
just faked it
She gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous Miss America smile
(') Well,  guess this is au revoir
Hitch comes and stands behind her chair, gazing at her in the mirror
Why didn't you stay with me
would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly
She considers the question and the man asking it, sensing something different about him now
She continues wiping off her make-up
Unlike Grace Kelly,  can pick up my dry cleaning
've got a family, Hitch home
That will always mean more to me than all of this
() That blonde woman of mystery you're after
She's a fantasy
She doesn't exist
He studies her a moment
There was a time when  thought understood you so completely -- understood women
Hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder, then leaves
Vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of vulnerability
,   - Wind blows sand off the dunes
Alma sits in the parked car outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the seat next to her
An inkling that they may not be as magical as she had hoped
No matter
She checks her reflection in the rearview and applies some lipstick, readying herself
She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck
She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit
Something doesn't feel right
She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the pretty  from the studio lot
Alma and Whit's eyes meet
Whit is horrified at being caught
Alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock
' She yanks open the door and gets in
Whit runs half dressed from the house
Alma,  thought you were coming later tonight
thought you rented this place so we could write
did
swear -- this just happened
She struggles to get the key in the ignition
He puts his hand desperately on the car door
(') You won't say anything, will you
Don't worry
won't tell Elizabeth
mean to Hitch
Whit smiles feebly
(') We can't all be geniuses
() : Alma tries to hide what a body blow this is
(') Alma -- you're incredibly talented
But, after all
we want him to read the script with an open mind
Oh,  wouldn't worry about that, Whit
She starts the car and drives off
Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light
,   - -- Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives
Lew discreetly checks his watch out of boredom
Shurlock and his two Assistants look appalled
Composer  , late 40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal
He glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room door looking worse, if that could be possible
,   - Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the foyer
You're going to have to cut all that nudity
What nudity
It was suggested
definitely saw that knife jabbing her
We did no such shot
'd stake my reputation on it
'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely
Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue
() : 'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening
But Shurlock is already walking away
Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with Hitch searches their expressions for some indication but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him
(') What's the verdict
Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't `good'
The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock
(') Screw him
It's too late for Paramount to back out no matter what Balaban says
Hitch just stands there
(') The other route is to recut it as a two- parter for the  series
Because of the budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a good chance of breaking even
Still, Hitch doesn't say a word
(') Look,  made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire of Winchester 73 and that was a dog
At least  could sit through your picture
Hitch stares bleakly off
He can't help noticing the - he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and kissing her date
(') More importantly, what does Alma think
,  - Alma sits with the Hitchcocks'  going over the books again, looking at the revised figures
They close the books and sit back and look at each other
Is there anything else we can do
() : Silence
This time he can't bring himself to look her in the eye
We'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out
Alma gets up and crosses to the window
Stares out at the pool reflecting a leaden sky
and the clumps of dead leaves floating across its surface
Well, it is only a house
,  - The dogs,  and , lap away at a water bowl in the study
splash or two of something is added to the bowl from above
It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass
pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand
There's a bank of silver-framed  on top
He pauses to take a proper look at them
His and Alma's life together in movies
Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly
On vacation with Jimmy and Gloria Stewart
At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck
But it's the  tucked away at the back that he wants to see most
taken on the set of The Mountain Eagle in 1926
He picks it up and looks at it: The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling "Action
" on his first film
His eyes don't have to move far to find , standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face
They look so young
Hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful -- Hitch's It's  outside
,  - We pull back to discover the window is now in a basement lit by a single oil lamp
() : We find Gein sitting at his workbench
Hitchcock is perched on a stool nearby watching him
Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere
There is grime and dark stains on the cabinets and counters
This is my favorite place
just shut the doors and leave the world behind
Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching something expertly together
He notices there's no hint of a tremble in Gein's hands
(') Pass me that bag, will you
Hitch passes over the shopping bag
then pulls up his coat, feeling a chill
Don't you get lonely out here sometimes
can always talk to my mother
As we hear  pull up -- a lot of them
The sound of , shouting
Flashing

It's more profound and horrible than he could ever have imagined
lush   starts to , mercifully drowning it all out
,   - Titles from a dark 1946 romantic melodrama fill the screen
"  " "
" Alma sits watching the afternoon movie alone, brushing the dogs on the sofa next to her
Hitchcock reads Alma's fragile emotional state and enters
He sits down beside her and studies the screen for a moment
An odd little movie
Of course, Colbert is wonderful
Alma nods
They watch for a beat longer
(') How was the beach
Cold and miserable
() : Just like Barney Balaban's face
He indicates the over-ripe dialogue coming from the
(') Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you
() And neither am
Alma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing
(') didn't pull off the picture this time
It just sits there, refusing to come to life
() There's no other way to say it
It's stillborn
turns away
Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence
(') let you down, my love
He moves closer and takes her hand
Gives it a small squeeze
(') You deserved better
She still doesn't move
After a moment Hitch gets to his feet
(') 'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley, shall
He exits with the dogs padding after him
She turns back to the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue
Tears well in her eyes
- full moon
The   from inside the house is the one in the kitchen
We glimpse the figure in the window
corpulent man in profile, like a Hopper painting
,  - Hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some  around his plate -- his healthy midnight snack
Alma enters in her robe
Hitch watches her
She goes to the fridge, opens the   and from under the brussel sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of
She gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at the table next to him
don't think  can stand both of us being maudlin
She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle
(') There is one solution to all this, you know
She offers him one of the crackers
(') We could both get to work -- together
Tentatively, Hitch accepts it
(') That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation 've been helping Whit finish is done
Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker
(') So  suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow
You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone
Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar
Except for you
- series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life : , , and editor   wait quietly like schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola
You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead
We've seen the footage a thousand times
She doesn't blink
Alma gives him a look
- are working on
Alma and Hitch work their way down the line, inspecting each new assembly
( ) Take thirty frames off the head
No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands
( ) Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving
Cut it tighter
The minute  lose one person 've lost the whole audience
Hitchcock's and Alma's
They work like a pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of  cutting the picture
-- to reveal George Tomasini has dozed off, exhausted
() : You imp
You got nudity in there
Her breasts are very large, dear
It was a challenge not to show them
- Editor   works at the Moviola, sleeves rolled up
'll be damned
She did blink
,  - Peggy stands with a pestering
How's it going in there with Mr
Herrmann
Swimmingly
Everyone's saying it's a dog with fleas
Before Peggy can deny it the argument flares through the wall
(
) Absolutely not
- Bernard Herrmann is pressing his point hard with Hitchcock
don't want music in the shower murder
() But what Alma and  talked about is really going to play
No
This isn't Vertigo, Bernie
This is different
The images have to work on their own
() : You can't scare people just by going, "Boo
" You have to tell them what's coming, make them anticipate it -- The  Flack shares a despairing look with Peggy
Thank God we've got Cinderfella for the holidays
'    as - We move across , ,  and ' faces as they watch the Moviola
The impact of the music is instant and unimaginably powerful
They are all moved
Gripped
Stunned
Hitchcock looks down
Peggy is gripping his arm tightly
What do you think
think 'm never going to take a shower again
Hitch
They look at him
It's getting there
Alma turns to him and Hitch nods slightly
Was that the tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been right
- ' Hitchcock sits opposite him at the big conference table
() : told you,  distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity
We're denying your seal, Mr
Hitchcock
take your opinion very seriously
But what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion assure you that once you view the final version with Mr
Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score
"lyrical score" won't change my opinion
All that innuendo and half-naked groping -- really, Hitch
Would you mind if we had a word in private, Geoffrey
Shurlock gestures his staff out
Hitch moves closer
(') have a modest proposal to make
If you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is,  will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications
Shurlock reacts with surprise
(') In fact, 'd welcome your personal supervision on the set
Shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit
My specifications
If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency
Shurlock studies Hitchcock's sphinx-like expression
,   - Hitchcock and Peggy confer
John Gavin and Janet Leigh, wearing robes, chat while lying on a bed
Crew members wait impatiently
Peggy checks her watch
He's been harassing you since you announced this project, you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up
What did you tell him
That  respected him
Deeply
Peggy laughs
Now she understands
(') Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap
Thank you all
The crew starts breaking things down
The actors are baffled
Janet walks over to him
thought we were reshooting the scene
No need
The charade is over
Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the dressing room
(') See,  wasn't that much of a monster to work with, was
Not at all
He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be professional to the end
(') just hope  was sufficiently loyal to the cause
Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear
She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek
moment of unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless
() : She walks away to her dressing room
Hitch watches as she steps inside and closes the door
After a moment we hear a   -- '   - Janet recoils at the sight of
" " grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of Janet's brassieres
Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running
hope you don't mind,  told Mrs
Bates she could have your dressing room
She can't believe she's been caught out
She closes the door on everyone
and then after a moment
but this time not out of shock
' ,   - Hitch sweeps in
Lew is waiting for him
We have our seal from Shurlock's office
() Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter
Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news
The front office confirmed
They're only opening the movie in two theatres, as we suspected
And no premiere
If we don't get word of mouth we're dead
Then we'd better get started
Peggy, take a memo
Peggy whips out her steno pad
(') We're going to write a manual on exactly how to sell Psycho
- make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption
As the booklets are bound by swift-moving , we see Hitchcock's photo on a cover and his "advice" to theater owners
(
) My first instruction to Theater Owners: Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce our unique admission policies
- opens up his    and starts to read, totally baffled
(
) Furthermore, because Psycho is so terrifying and unique, the guards can help you deal with customers who run amok
- The manager introduces the   to his equally bemused
(
) Post our special lobby clocks to remind audiences of the starting times for Psycho
He oversees as they hang a ridiculously large   in the lobby
- Hitch's voice booms from (
) The manager of this fine motion picture theater has been advised not to allow anyone to enter the theater once Psycho begins
We   to the  and  as they test out the message that will be played for the ticket holders line
couple of  listen, perplexed
() : (
) (') Should you be so foolish as to attempt to slip in by a side entrance
- a fire escape or through a skylight, you will be ejected by brute force
Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while Alma watches from the recording desk
More playful, darling
- row of life-size   are carried in through the door one by one
Posters are hung in the theatre lobby
The letters hoisted up and hung on the marquee outside
(
) "To further emphasize the sheer, unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho, right after the closing title " ," we strongly recommend that you close your house curtains over the screen for a full thirty seconds
" Inside the theatre, the manager makes sure the  open and close correctly then turns to face the vast, empty auditorium
' "By doing so, the horror of Psycho will be indelibly etched in the mind and heart of your audience
" He anxiously surveys the hundreds of seats that will have to be filled
,   - Now Barney Balaban is reading Hitchcock's publicity manual to the board
() : "Absolutely never, ever will  allow anything to follow Psycho -- no previews of coming attractions, no newsreel, no short subject and certainly no double- feature
Sincerely, and, emphatically, Alfred Hitchcock
" Balaban shuts the pamphlet
Silence
Then turns to the stone- faced board members : (') At the end of the day, it's a minor Hitchcock movie
One week, and it'll be gone
He tosses the pamphlet into the trash
(') Like a bad dream
138 - '    as they drive through the frenetic madness that typifies Times Square, 1960
-  () for " '
" The car pulls up
Hitch and Alma step out
There's a long line of people outside the theatre
Well, at least there are some people here
But Hitch's nerves are hardly soothed
The people in line start to notice the Hitchcocks
is it really them
Comes over to greet them with the
We can go through the side entrance
As the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley -- () : Right this way, Mr
and Mrs
Hitchcock
Hitchcock turns to Alma
Ready for the gallows
,  - The atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats
Lew greets them
We've roped off some seats for you
You go on ahead
Are you sure
'll join you in a minute
Off Alma's look
(') want to double check the print
Fine, darling
'll save you a seat
Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium
,   - The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next to it
but the sound of the audience below is anything but reassuring
(under his breath) But they're laughing too much
He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing
,   - Hitch inches open the door and     at the audience but now he can't read them
Are they gripped with suspense -- or do they just hate it
From the lobby we see as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor
scared, lonely, corpulent figure
Totally powerless
There's nothing for him to do but wait
And wait
And wait
Across the foyer, a spotty young   sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious
' As he grips the railing
This is taking far too long
And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world -
Soon the
then breaks into again
nervous laughter this time, the best kind
As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience right on cue As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out
leaving only relief and satisfaction
and making way for a smile
the largest of his whole career
- Hitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the theatre manager
There are still  in the theatre as the show continues
() : Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to the front doors
There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks
Mr
Hitchcock, how does it end
promised Mother  wouldn't tell
He gets a laugh
Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment with the crowd
Mr
Hitchcock, what do  do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie
Have her dry-cleaned
Laughter as Lew appears
just got off the phone with Balaban couldn't resist telling him we're sold out for the next two weeks
What did he say
He said "Tell Hitch congratulations well deserved triumph as we always knew
" "As we always knew
" The two friends a look
Does this mean  can take the weekend off now
Hitch playfully shrugs, "we'll see"
'm sorry, Mr
Hithcock but there are photographers outside
They heard you were here
() : (2) The theatre manager ushers them towards the exit doors
-  () few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car
Hitchcock gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of behind him
She shyly waves him away but eventually, and appreciatively, relents
As the flashbulbs start to  -- This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred
Our career, Alma
He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense gratitude and joy
As more flashbulbs pop -- (') 've realized 'll never be able to find a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you
You do realize 've been waiting decades to hear you say that
He gives her a gentle peck
And that, madame, is why they call me "The Master of Suspense"
He helps her into the car

Several nonviolent  eat at different round tables around the room
An  watches, and an  mops the floor (there are  female patients nor staff members

Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen
(to the Attendant) Guess what 'm doing this weekend
What
Claudine and  are driving to Chicago with her folks to see that Psycho movie
The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him, nodding toward Ed
The Orderly's jaw drops
It is the coolest thing he's ever heard
He looks at Ed like he's a movie star
Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content
Utterly oblivious
think you're the happiest guy 've ever known, Ed
How you do it
'll tell you
You live your life, and it's unbearable sometimes but there's this secret, Chet; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell
(he leans a little closer) there is a God and he's so big and powerful, he doesn't always remember you're there
He takes a huge bite blueberry pie
(') but if you can get his attention and he sees you're suffering, he'll notice and he'll take care of you
My mother used to tell me -- she's passed, God bless her -- the one thing God truly loves and understands is suffering
He takes a long drink of milk
(') After all, he invented it
We pan to discover  has been watching all this
He turns to the camera
() : (2) And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and  got to
Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool
And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements
He produces a  and wanders towards the exit doors
(') Of course for me, it was just another "moo-vie
" As he strolls through the door -- ,  - -- and seamlessly appears in the beautifully tended gardens, as if having walked through a portal
But you know what they say in Hollywood: "You're only as good as your last picture
" So, now, if you'll excuse me, must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project
He holds out his cigar towards something we don't yet see
(') Unfortunately  find myself once again bereft of all inspiration
do hope something comes along soon
Alights on his cigar tip and  its wings
Hitchcock can't resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which promptly flies away
He gives the camera a final characteristically deadpan look
(') Good evening
The distinctive   to his  show starts up and Hitch toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch
