"" Screenplay by Gregory Widen 17 -   - 20 Darkness
Then the  of a flashlight
Its beam rocks crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room as we hear two children arguing
You're doing it wrong
Shut up
You're doing it wrong
It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light
Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons
Bent, stained helmets hung like African masks
Beneath them , 7, and , 12, are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas
It doesn't go like that
Who asked you
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire
Then you'll get burned and The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in
It's a fire station storage room full of fire gear
fireman stands in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; McCAFFREY
Who's going to die
Brian
He's not doing it right, dad
He never does it right
(gestures for them to come out) Well, let's have a look
17 - The two boys tromp out of the closet
The rubber turn-out boots are as high as their thighs
The ends of the coats drag on the floor
They salute, Brian's arm just an empty sleeve
Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat
Your brother's right
If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned
And
You wouldn't let me die, would you, Dad
McCaffreys are smarter than fire, Brian
(playfully slaps their shoulders) How 'bout lunch, huh
Fireman shit
Hey, what's with the mouth
Where'd you grow up, a barn
Firehouse
Cute
-- The station suddenly fills with the  of an (sighs) Never fails
young fireman, , appears with the dispatch card
Big deal
Medium deal
Want to come along, Brian
Watch the old man earn his keep
(pissed) Dad
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance
We'll be back in a few minutes
(to Brian) How 'bout it, sport
Sure
Dennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine cab
The other three firemen climb aboard and take their places
17 - There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine is pulling out of the station
Hit the button, Brian
Brian stamps his foot on the siren button
The red light snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down the street
Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older brother
They stick their tongues out
-  - 20 The engine howls its way through the city
Brian, sandwiched between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows
-  - 20 Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block
Medium deal
The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping off like ship rats
Dennis opens his door, hops down, and pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his son
Stay near the truck
(winks) And keep an eye out for us, huh
We're short handed today
Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously
Dennis smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward a doorway they disappear into
Brian climbs down from the cab
Don't stray too far, little man
Brian smiles to the pumper operator
He just wants a better look
And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking on purpose
-  - 20 There's a level of apartments above the storefronts
As Brian watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox onto a small fire escape
Their attention's on the next window over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke
Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and  across to the next metal balcony
ballsy, dangerous move
He kicks in the window, breaks out the frame with his axe, and dives in
beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl
He hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a ladder
Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than life, invincible
He winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling darkness
As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof
The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat
Shhh, don't tell anyone
Brian is transfixed, his little head staring up in astonishment
Nobody else has noticed it
Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; probing, looking for the flame lurking just above
Brian starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice, Dad
He tries to call louder
But suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion: -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as -- Dennis suddenly  his body against Adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame   from the ceiling fully against him as -- All the building's windows and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him
Plaster, wood, and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly
fire helmet
And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face
Get us some backup
We need some goddamn backup
And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him
And the helmet spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we read the printing on the neck guard
And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian doesn't see him
He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his father's helmet, And puts it on
The scene  with a flash as a photographer captures the instant
- Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Hold on the freeze-frame
Let it become an aged cover of The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat of an aging
There's plenty of other boxes here, a live on the move, and in the driver's seat,  McCAFFREY, now 27
There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "McCaffrey High-End Stereo Sales"
-  - Brian and his battered  shoot past prairie, cow country, nervous suburbs and finally a sign:
- Wind tugging at his bangs, Brian stares down at the graves of Dennis and Mary Elizabeth McCaffrey
- In a crusty sink he combs his hair, knots a tie around his neck
- Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his tie
He comes to a door,
He takes a deep breath, steadies his gaze, and enters
'  - The   sits at his desk going over a file
Out the window can be heard a    in action
Is this a joke
Brian's sitting in the seat opposite
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing
You walked out on this academy six years ago
One week to graduation
You think we forgot that
You think did
want another shot, Sir
(beat) Look, everybody remembers your old man
Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here
Dead Hero Father Rule
But you blew us off
Why should  take you back
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top -- --  don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot
need another one, sir
Sorry, but it's out of my hands
Try again next year
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me
If push you have to let me back in
Dead Hero Father Rule
Sir
(simmers) Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation
That's hard duty, son
If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you
(rises) See you Monday
Sir
As we hear the : - And everybody lined up at attention in dress blues
(at podium) Though the world changes every day, some things are truly forever: Courage, devotion, and honor in what we do
This class is a special one, for we dedicate it to the three firefighters that have fallen this year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter and Michael Petzold
(silent beat) Ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure that  certify that Candidate Class number 322, having successfully completed all academy requirements, are hereby graduated to the Chicago Fire Department
Candidates and their relatives  and leap to their feet
Something struggles inside of Brian
He doesn't stand at first
Another Candidate, , 20, looks at him strangely
So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's
And Brian's standing slowly now, joining them
- An expensive one
We hear a window
- Through the dimness a file cabinet
An into it,  it apart
Files crash to the floor
And a picture
1970
Four young guys marlin fishing
Time of their lives
- And a   being  along the edges of a door
- split-level firemen's dive; complete with mounted axes and personalized -shirts from various engine companies proudly declaring "
6 --  ,  " and " , 150      "
Tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of recently graduated candidates
few on the back patio have hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat
Brian and Tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street
Survey the scene
Completely out of control
What the hell are we waiting for
As they shoulder their way inside, another  appears holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes
Hot off the presses, guys
Station assignments
Tim and everyone else but Brian eagerly tear into them
Brian nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar
beer, Willy
The barkeep turns and smiles
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey
(to candidates with hose) Hey
You break anything with that you buy it
(to Brian) Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes
keep thinking that's a fire department uniform
It's in my blood, Willy
The candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming to each other: "All right
Engine 117
That's a slum
They get cookers every day
"
"Oh no, Engine 10, that's a nice neighborhood"
Willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a stack of business cards
Really
Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood" always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar
"Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours
" Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge  need
Uh huh
And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins"
That was in your blood about six months wasn't it
Management were pin heads
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"
Coffee sucked
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum"
Your own company even
Big step
was ahead of my time
You know, 've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"
Tim holds an envelope marked McCAFFREY out to Brian
Aren't you even curious
Engine 115, right
(opens it, surprised) How'd you know
These are supposed to be sealed
Lucky guess
(winks) And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
You crooked son of a bitch
Why 115
Lots of fires
They promote faster there
Take a look at the last Lt
's list, half the guys on it came from that battalion
Gotta think about your future, Timmy
115's the station
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother
On Brian's reaction : - Porsche knifes through darkened streets
The , 50, is dressed for success
Pulling up to the brownstone we saw earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes
Another day in the salt mines
Climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock and opens the door
It is the last thing he will ever do
the stoop
- The place is packed now with girls flirting with the candidates, putting their helmets on, etc
The horseplay around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a
- Everyone steps outside, cocks an ear
And here it comes, the real thing,  past in a full-tilt rush
Shouts and raised toasts
Hey, that's my cousin's company
'mon
Let's go
As Brian turns, he suddenly confronted by an elderly (surprised) Mrs
Viatkus
She grabs his cheeks and rattles off in Lithuanian
Brian can only smile
Then two attractive jean-clad legs step up
Brian
(surprised) Jennifer
You're back
You look great
Thanks for calling
Uh
've been sorta keeping a low profile
the academy
graduated today
Huh
So
see you're still in the neighborhood
Not quite
Just visiting
live in Lincoln Park now
Yeah
What have you been up to
work for city hall
Really
No kidding
What, you think  just dried up and blew away when you left
The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission
Just then, Tim   the hoseline,  Brian
Don't want you overheating, Brian
Brian ducks the stream and  a length of hose near his feet,  Tim
Brian  him, shuts off the hose and pins him to the pavement
Okay okay
Uncle
Brian walks back toward Jennifer You've certainly matured
She turns to leave
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends
don't want to be your friend, Brian
Another in a series of fire engines  past
Tim grabs Brian by the shoulder
Let's go, man
- Brian and Tim jump into Brian's car
They shoot blindly down the street looking for the fire engine, running down red lights or anything else that gets in their way
Brian suddenly hits the brakes,  to a stop
They roll down their windows
Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren
(points) That way
-   - They fly around a corner, down a block, and there it is, lights flashing up ahead
Brian  it, roars up alongside the fire engine
Tim leans out the window, shakes a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the truck driver's face
Tim
You crazy motherfucker
But he's laughing
What'cha got
Box alarm
Walton Ave
We'll meet ya
-   - As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode earlier
Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie
Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination
Embers whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him
One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now
He watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person would run for their life from
Jesus Christ
-- Brian turns at the blinding snap of a camera
Several locals are gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures
Brian notices that right away
It takes a beat longer to notice the   stuffed head-first through the windshield
It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy angles
dog barks furiously at it
(also looking at body) Man
Something sure put a crimp in his evening
Backdraft
The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy clouds of dirty white steam
And one of the firemen is coming back out now, walking toward Brian
When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a dead ringer for
Well, look what we have here
Nice costume
Rent it
want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen
It was a great inspiration to me
So you're going to fight fires now, huh
He pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears
(re smears) Doesn't work on you
(turns to leave) See ya around, little brother
Not likely
(turns) Well, see you're wrong already
Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town
So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17
My company
(Brian's color drops a hue) One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian
And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts
-    - flame  up into the foreground
Touches a cigarette
The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the mouth of , fifty-five years old and six and a half feet of solid granite
Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another slow drag
Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield
It's twenty yards away from the brownstone
Stephen looks up as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, and crosses the street to the building
- Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness
Rimgale is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight
He crouches down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard
If you stare any longer Stevie, 'll start charging you admission
Stephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him
Got a cause
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work may have a stroke
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home
Rimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose and holds up to the light
He lowers it, takes in the walls, the room
They're gonna have to wait a few days on this one
- Tim's talking to his cousin
Brian hangs back, watches the body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon
There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs circling and barking
Brian walks up, looks inside the car, and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a
(to coroner crew) Hey, you forgot
this
They're already climbing into the wagon
The driver smiles creepily
We always leave something for the dogs
Brian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking back to the fire engine
They share a brief, edgy glance
- modest one
South-side Irish old fashioned
Brian walks up
There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy fire truck on the drive
Hey, Sean
What's goin' on, man
The kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition
It's Uncle Brian
'know
He makes his hand into a talking puppet
(bandito accent) "Spinach
We don't need no stinking spinach"
Remember
The kid drops his toy truck and flees inside
Mom
Mom
' Brian follows, sticks his head in the door
Hellooo
warm looking woman, 30's, , comes around the corner
Brian
Hi, Helen
Man, you look great
You look like
Brian
She gives him a tentative hug
'Bout written you off
How long have you been in town
Four months
Four months
know,  know, Should'a called
've been really busy
joined the fire department
Helen's expression suddenly saddens
Oh Brian
(beat) You guys
you really know how to put each other through it, don't you
The little kid is peeking fearfully from the kitchen doorway
That's Sean
Jeez, he's a giant
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
Sean, come on out, man
What, you forget your favorite uncle
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
(intense) Dad was kidding, Mom
And the kid runs unexpectedly away, angry
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for
Where is he, anyway
(beat) Stephen's not staying here now, Brian
He moved out last April
An embarrassed sting
Oh, man, 'm sorry
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
'  -  - small one on the river
Several boats bob peacefully
Except one
Raised high in dry-dock, it's an ancient fishing trawler
Bachman-Turner-Overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly fuzzed speakers as Brian climbs the ladder
Hey
Stripped to the waist, Stephen's bent-over cleaning out the guts of the inboard motor
He looks confused to see Brian
talked to Helen
Wrong thing to say
Stephen turns back to his work
Man,  thought dad's boat was finally retired to the family graveyard
Don't you worry about falling out of this thing
Stephen straightens up, his forearms smudged with grease
Brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck paint
like what you've done with the place
It's comin' along
want a beer
Stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge
As Brian pops it, he sees the small pile of city-issue gallon size cans in the corner
Armorall, solvent, extinguisher foam
Been ripping off fire stations
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway
Still good enough though for this tub
Brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers
Bachman Turner Overdrive
(looks through music rack) Buffalo Springfield
Stephen Bishop
Oh man
Brian lifts one of the tapes -- an 8-track -- and holds it carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic
My God, an actual operating 8-track
What, you've never seen one before
In the Field Museum once
It works
It worked when you were in sixth grade
'  - Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Brian opens the trunk of his old
It's full of stereo boxes marked ' " "
'  -  - Brian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them
People actually used to pay you for this
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors
Sheep don't count
Yeah
What about Laura -- That was never proved
Brian moves over to another speaker
Why'd you come here, Brian
wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment
mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my  Joe and 'm still pissed" games
(sighs) What is it with you, man, huh
How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up
That scotch bullshit
Am  really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz
You were bankrupt, man
Hey
You don't know me -- know you cold, Brian
The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile
But you see, in this job there's no place to hide
Isn't like selling log cabins
You have a bad day here -- someone dies
And that's not fucking good enough
Want another beer
So that's it
Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till  cough blood
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that don't think is going to make it
Brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches on the tape player
The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear -- Stephen Bishop
There's only so much technology can do
(picks up his tool box) Thanks for the beer
Thanks for the speakers
'  - Brian climbs down off the boat
Looks up at Stephen
'know,  told myself a million times didn't want to be a fireman said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy
know split, and  know how you felt
Yeah, you know
You know what it felt like
gotta do this, Stephen
gotta know
think you're gonna find out, Brian
Don't be late tomorrow
'  - simple one-room walk-up
stereo blares Chicago blues as Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror
He steps back, looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am  doing
'  -  - Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing
He gets out, looks under the hood, then  it down in frustration
- pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the morning snap, passes by Brian's window
Tough Midwestern brick
Tough Midwesterners
Heads-down in their 150 year war with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into Lake Michigan
- The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the sidewalk carrying his fire equipment
He turns a corner and comes on
17 - Brian stands there
It's his dad's station
Turn of the century abused
Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly   as Brian comes up the drive
Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights flashing, pull out onto the apron
The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is Stephen
One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire
McCaffrey
You're too late, probie
Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs begin heading down the street
(chasing) Goddamn it, Stephen
Brian bolts full-out for the engine
At the last instant before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags him aboard
/
17 - It's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran
Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'
The Pumper driver, , pops in a howling   as they zoom off
(re Brian to Adcox) You know this rug rat
Know him
practically raised him
(Jewish mom) And he never calls, he never writes
Brian shouts over the noise to , 35, one more seat down
'm Brian
'm sorry
Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins buckling up his coat
Boys,  do believe we have a barbecue
As Brian and Adcox fasten up their own equipment -- - Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up
(staring at confusing smoke) hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it
(to Schmidt) Call in another alarm
We're gonna need some back-up
Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks
Adcox drags the rig's suction line to the hydrant
beautiful illegally parked Mercedes is blocking the way
(to Stephen) Oh these moments do try me
(admiring car) Be gentle
Whistling to himself, Adcox  the brass coupling through the passenger window, runs the line through and  it out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant
Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out
Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right
Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear
It's only rock 'n roll, kid
Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready to go
Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at him in
Hey, probie
How 'bout it, huh
Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the hose line
Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air tank strap
You're doing it wrong
Stephen eases the door open
Thick smoke rolls sickly out over their heads
(to Brian) Stay beside me
And in they go
- Inside the smoke is like liquid lead
Going by feel, they hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on their hands and knees toward a dull red glow
Turning a corner, they enter -    - Totally ablaze
Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting waves of flame in the ceiling, at the  timbers crumbling to the white-hot floor
At the walls  in bestial agony
It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing he has ever seen
Wash it to the windows
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on
It's gonna flash, Stevie
We gotta get behind it
Nah, listen to it
It's a pussy
It'll just steam on us
It won't flash
Go high in the ceiling
Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, expecting the worst
Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose a high pressure    into the ceiling
The fire in manic anger and  a cloud of  steam that  back and  them like lobsters
Brian gasps for air as swirling ash batters his facemask
window somewhere
Somebody shouts
Christ, you can't see anything
Stephen  in victory
(to fire) knew you were a pussy
'mon
Steam us
(to firemen) Let's go
The chase is on
Going for the throat while the fire's confused and defensive, the firemen  through the boiling cloud
They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, forcing it back and back
It  and  in anger, furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces
The walls  with its  as it retreats to a corner
Ya love it, probie
'm in heaven, Lt
Hook us up to a stand-pipe
Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the building water system
He goes to unscrew the cap with his hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut
Jesus, how 'bout man, huh
We're gonna loose this
Brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back
-   - Tim and three guys from his ladder company, come up an extended aerial ladder,  through a window and - begin  their way toward Brian's company as --
It's a sudden, shattering vibration that shakes the building to its foundations
Then, a sucking sound: --
Stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset
Hey Otis, is it
(into radio) Yeah
Goddamn it, where's our backup
Where's the second-in companies
' Sorry, man
John Wayne time
(to firemen) Dig in
The firemen hesitate
, the Truck Company Lt
, looks at Stephen with concern
Dig in, goddamn it
The crews immediately gather in the center of the floor
They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier circling of the wagons
--
rush-rush-rush --
Each louder than the last
Stephen and Brian are ducked behind an overturned desk
Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines like frontiersmen's Winchesters
You're gonna love this
-- rush-rush-rush --
On an instant the world comes apart as all four walls of factory windows  in a hail of glass
wave of     after it, and
At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing machine   and a ladderman, ,  , grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames from underneath
He  as his grip loosens
Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and coat
Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen  him out of the way to back up Grindle
Help
Oh God
Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire
Water and flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling It's a thrashing, murderous standoff
Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad
Blow it now and all three could take a header
Santos is panicking, losing his grip
Grindle bores his eyes into the man's with the calm and conviction of Moses
You go, we go
They may all die, but they won't leave him
He calms a little, hangs on till they  him out of harm's way
Adcox continues with the hose as suddenly, everyone  the deck as the fire  over them,  their coats into flame
Tim's company opens up their line,  everybody down before  after the fire
ladderman, , steps on Brian's back
Hey
Sorry man,  thought you were dead
Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking
Stephen seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a corner
The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its furious anger
But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying
(ladder co
captain) Stephen
's on the radio
Says they think a civilian got left behind downstairs
Adcox
Take Tim and do a search
Adcox leads Tim downstairs
Brian looks shaken up
Stephen helps him roughly to his feet
Don't you fold on me now, man
Brian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off
Clear the hose for me
Brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it
small voice
Faint
"Help me
" Hey,  think it's coming from a different staircase
Nobody hears
-- Brian takes off down the other steps on his own
- It's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow
Off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines
Brian enters one and drops to his knees
Looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand
Nothing
He turns to backtrack his way out when suddenly  up through the floor in front of him, cutting off the door
Brian lands on his ass as it hisses and giggles and dances unreally in front of him
never forget a face, kid
-- That fire from childhood
He could maybe force his way through but Jesus, the way it looks at him -- -- Brian  away from it
Looks for another doorway -- And ends up in thick smoke
He drops to a crawl, stays on his belly where the air's clear
When he sees it
Behind some furniture
Something flesh-colored
Shit
It's a body
He crawls up closer
It's a woman
Adrenalin pounding the top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down the hall, makes a turn -- got one
- -- And now he's bursting from the building onto a short fire escape, shouting at the top of his lungs
got somebody
got somebody
sea of media flashbulbs  in his face
The press have arrived in force, crowding the street
Brian pushes through them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine
Two fire paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure
Is she
Is she alive
The paramedics suddenly stop their efforts
Turn to Brian
'm afraid you're a little too late with this one
They step aside
Brian looks down
The woman looks strange
Mostly because she's a heavy store
The paramedics burst into laughter
Brian, looking pale and shaken, turns and walks away
He passes Grindle and Tim, sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the  woman that was found inside
Sorry to hear about the mannequin heard you two were close
Photographers have appeared and are flashing the woman
Dizzy, Brian wanders off, tries to help out with the choking clog of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly into -    - Where he barfs his guts out in private
Doubled-over, one arm on the brick wall for support, we see the raw terror
The demons rushing out of him
Shit
Someone else does too
Jennifer
Dressed now in a long expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with a clipboard
Brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face, spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her
(appearing beside him) You all right
Stephen isn't pale
He's flushed and buoyant
All this hasn't taken anything from him
It's made his day
Yeah
Fine
'm a little busy right now
Stephen leans against the wall
Folds his arms
'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders
told you to stay beside me
-- 'mon, Stephen
-- You split the team, man
And what was that crap with the standpipe
You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before
Stephen turns to leave
Brian yells after him
Goddamn it Stephen
--  told you to stay next to me
--  was doin' it
was up there fucking doin' it
You don't know, man, you don't know what  did
What you did was drop the ball, Probie
Get that right
(from end of alley) Hey
Stevie
They're callin' for ya
Stephen turns to walk away
Pauses
Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty two days a month off sounded pretty good twelve weeks ago, huh
As Stephen leaves, we see that Jennifer's been standing at the end of the alley, listening to them
She's turns and walks as Brian looks up
We register his surprise
He watches her head toward a dynamic-looking guy in his 40s, , surrounded by reporters
-  - (to reporters) Roger, Paul
How's it going, guys
Another fire in this district
Getting to be Cinder Alley up here
(walking up) You used that last week
She hands Swayzak a clipboard
(yelling down from window) (to Brian) Hey
Probie
We're still workin' here, man
Brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks
The moment the smoke clears just a fraction, cigarettes appear in everyone's mouth
Was it good for you
The talk is easy and obscene, the intense camaraderie of shared danger
Ash clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one more time
(to Adcox) Stephen man, what's going through that guy's head
Takin' it on in the first room
this shit's happening too often
It could've flashed
Should've flashed
But it didn't
Guy knows
Guy's lucky
Adcox sees Brian
Smiles
Hey, baby McCaffrey
First one's the clincher
You did okay
My Lt
might have something to say about that
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian
You're working for the toughest Lt
on the job
Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building
It's just bad luck you're family
(beat) John, when you're in there
in the fire
do you ever see
(from across room, interrupting) 'mon ladies, let's roll some hose
(to Adcox) -- Never mind
Brian turns and sees out the window Jennifer and Swayzak standing near Rimgale's red fire dept
sedan
- Rimgale walks up to his sedan
Alderman Swayzak
Investigator Rimgale
need to get in the trunk
Swayzak's leaning on it
We sense the dislike between them
Swayzak steps aside
Rimgale pops the trunk
Awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, Alderman
But then guess you haven't been to too many fires
wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death
We still haven't gotten a fire report from your office
You'll have an answer as soon as do
People are asking how a prominent taxpayer got stuffed through the windshield of his own car
They're asking me
--The point is, Investigator, you haven't even told us yet if the fire was accidental
We're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case to embarrass the Alderman because of his fire dept
reorganization program -- -- You mean his firehouse closing program, -- Don't you
We'd just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics
-- Because 'm not
care about this city, and  care about this department -- Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid
(calm of a monk) Alderman,  have a remarkably uncomplicated job
To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it
But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, well,  guess  can't say  sleep any less peacefully
And he walks back to the burned building
wish  could just fire the son of a bitch
Hey
Swayzak
Stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window
As the  cameras turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin
We almost lost a whole company up there, Swayzee buddy
Isn't any back- up since you closed '33
And we really appreciate it, the guys and me
Honest
know you've got my vote for mayor
Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen
Brian's there, following after them
Look Lt
, 'm on your side
If there's a problem, please, work with our task force to fix it
Oh yeah, your famous task force
three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your "task force"
Stevie, c'mon man
Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand
Swayzak leans close, out of earshot of the cameras
You see that funny glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye, Lt
That's your career dissipation light -- and it just went into overtime
If anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours
Swayzak holds his ground
It's a tense, out of control moment between them
Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen with concern
Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred
You're in firemanland now, Swayzak
Do yourself a favor and just walk away
Swayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car
Brian watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss
This is your city job
Jennifer shrugs as they pull away
/
17 - Brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway
Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the balcony of her apartment
That's Franny
She likes firemen
Tim, fill out the alarm card
(to Brian) Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose
Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks
Tim shrugs
Brian sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor before freezing suddenly at a murderous
Brian turns and sees a
Sort of
It has the rib cage of a wild beast, fangs, long greasy hair
It blocks his way,  with hate
That's The Thing
You can't stay unless he likes you
Slobber drools out of its mouth as it
Have you guys got something against dalmatians
Brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs
17 - Sequence omitted from original script
17 - Brian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens his locker
The mannequin from the fire  , legs spread
sign taped to its mouth says: "  , ' " 17 - Brian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies in the station shower
Tim keeps filling his mouth full of water and launching it upward in a stream
Do you have to do that
(pumped) Could you believe that fire
Man
First day
There  was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat
love it here -- No surround and drown for this company
Fighting 17th
Goddamn Stephen's amazing
You see how he took that fire by the balls
'm gonna be that good some day, you watch
Brian compares himself to the praise heaped on Stephen
'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard
"You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it"
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you
What, you think he made that little gem up
Jesus Christ,  used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning
Brian shuts off his shower and walks out
17 - Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained and ruined back
He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee
On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia through the years
There's a two battered fire helmets there, set reverently on velvet
Beside it is a photograph of his father
Grinning
Top of the world
He's wearing a -shirt proudly stenciled  17th
Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting
In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man
The   suddenly sounds
Brian, just in a towel and Tim, in boxers covered with little dinosaurs, dash for the fire pole
17 - Tim and Brian slide down and bounce off the floor
-- 'mon
'mon
Go
Go
Brian and Tim rush for their equipment
Grindle grabs their arms
No
'mon
This way
He hustles them across the apparatus floor, through a doorway, and into the kitchen
17 - / The makings of a meal are laid out on the counter
Brian and Tim come to a screeching halt
The rest of the station is sitting calmly at the kitchen table, watching
What's going on
Dinner, Probies
Get started
: 17 - Tim and Brian, still in their boxers, set down plates of food
Better be good
Or we feed you to The Thing
Everybody digs in
The table is a craze of half a dozen different conversations
On the  mounted above on the wall are news shots of Seagrave's body sticking out of the windshield
Adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence
Gentlemen, please
As 17's official toastmaster -- And bullshitter
Thank you, Santos
Did  happen to mention that you were cut out of my will
(company laughs) think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes --  mean probationary firemen -- among us who today were baptized officially into the world of Old Man Fire
First to Tim, who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears, not only took on the beast but pulled from its clutches -- assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter -- me -- a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail
(laughs) And to Brian, who's own contribution was both more beautiful and less likely to sue
Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin, seated with honor at the head of the table
Right beside The Thing
'know, when  heard that both McCaffrey brothers were going to be assigned together here, well, my heart was filled with
a sudden desire to transfer
(laughs) So raise a glass, lads
To funny- looking Tim, and the McCaffrey brothers, who despite years of getting on each other's nerves have managed with great effort
to still be pissed off at each other
Gentlemen
(together, a toast) Fuck you
The klaxon suddenly rings
Two bells
The ladder guys groan and get up
Bye, boys
(winks) We'll keep it warm for you
: 17 - Dawn lightens the room as Brian slowly opens his eyes and sees in extreme, fish-eyes close-up:    at him
Brian turns the other direction and sees Stephen, fully dressed, standing over his bunk
Clean the toilets
Bleary-eyed, the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of their rigs, dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps they wear only at this moment
Stephen stands before them, does a quick glance up and down the line
Okay, company dismissed
-- See ya guys tonight at Fitzgerald's retirement party
They shuffle for the door
As Brian passes, You want a ride
'   - Stephen pulls up
Brian opens the door
Thanks
Brian -- (a beat that hangs there) -- See ya tonight
-   - That's been cleared out for a huge  in full swing
An Irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat
City brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen and their families all mix together for this is a for the Captain Fitzgerald
Brian enters, seeks out a beer at the bar
Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly not his first drink of the evening
Hey
Hey
as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief
Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man
He turns away
gotta change the view
Santos and Grindle walk up
Heard you didn't make the list for captain, man
'm sorry
Stephen just shrugs
Brian sees Jennifer across the room
She looks great
Refined as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and calling various politicos by their first name
As she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink
As she accepts, a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red syrup
(holding bottle, interrupting) With grenadine, right
When  was twenty
Oooh, very sophisticated
Having fun
Her attention broken, the politico has slipped away
Annoyed, Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at him
Look, 'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night
This isn't about fun
'm working here
Carrying Swayzak's notebook
Let me tell you something
Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor
Yeah
Swayzak
Humanity's last hope
How can you work for that guy
Why do you think Marty came here tonight
Because he cares about your department
You don't know how hard he works
You don't know about his programs helping West Side -- -- All  know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
Bullshit
Marty's plan is only about efficiency
've got two cousins on the job, you think 'd work for him if  didn't believe in it
Jennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed  passes and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode
(to man) -- Tom, how nice to see you
know Marty'll be very happy you came
Thanks so much for the donation
(to woman) Marie
how's little Kevin
Really
Seen the polls
This is the year
They move away
Jennifer turns to Brian and switches just as fast back to their argument
-- The thing that really makes me angry is the way your union has -- Brian can't help it
He cracks up
What was that
Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul Boulevard
Yeah, well  like to think 'm just a little past hanging out on watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters
seem to remember some pretty good nights on
Brian turns and walks away
Adcox is talking with another knot of firemen
He's brought a date, , a hot little number that has a habit of standing on her tip-toes when she talks
(looking at Swayzak across room) Yuck, what a scumbag
(to Santos) Fuckin' city transferred Sally three months ago out of parking violations into Swayzak's office
Now  gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and she's stuck with an asshole
Pay more
(shrugs) No, but there's more exercise -- being chased around a desk
There's a commotion at the other end of the bar
group of firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine
Aw,  don't believe this shit
Somebody get a shovel
You seen this, Stephen
As they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread titled The first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning building with seemingly a woman in his arms
The second photo shows the backs of Adcox and Tim's helmets as they administered aid to the real woman they saved
The implication is it's the same woman
What
(reads) "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company
McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death
" The old photo is there too
Brian and his dad's helmet
Whadda we gonna do about this
Stephen glances over the headlines
'know,  think it's a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper -- especially if it's bullshit -- he owes the company a drink
In fact
(motions to waiter) 'll have a double
On the hero
The other firemen jump in with drink orders
Dozens of them
(confused) What's going on
Tim shows him the magazine
Brian reads with horror as Alderman Swayzak appears beside him
Brian McCaffrey, right
Brian, this is my boss, Alderman Swayzak
(to Swayzak) Brian's a big fan of yours
Yeah
Big fan
And 'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian
Uh,  think there's been a mistake
didn't save that woman
No need to be modest, Brian
No, you don't understand,  saved a mannequin
-- That really was incredibly work you did
You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it
You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
Every little boy's fantasy
Brian, let me come to the point
'd like to offer you a job
have a job
This one's still with the fire department
One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now
We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy  want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian
This could be a great opportunity to move
beyond a fire engine
Brian looks at Jennifer, then smiles at Swayzak
Thanks anyway, Mr
Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family
Politics don't
--  man suddenly steps between them to pump Swayzak's hand
Brian shakes his head and walks away
Swayzak shoots a concerned glance at Jennifer
She catches up with him at the buffet table
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid
Think about your future for once
So now you suddenly care about my future
Look,  didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there,  just thought you'd call when you came back
You didn't and
(beat) Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us
Hey, sorry if  made you look bad in front of your boss
But 'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, 'm trying to do something here
There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day
Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them
Across the room, Stephen's at the buffet, watching Helen dance with her fireman date, the drinks hammering him hard
Aw man, how can she dance with that guy
hate that guy
He's a dispatcher
hate his voice
Whatever
mean,  know women have gotta bang somebody, but why that son of a bitch
Stephen gives Pengelly an icy, sideways look
Hey Stevie, he's an asshole
Stephen smiles and pushes off the bar -- right for Helen as she dances
Uh, Helen,  wanted to talk to you a second about Sean
Stephen, 'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later
How ya doin', Stephen
Jackson
Jackson steers her away but Stephen isn't done yet
He dogs them
(to Helen) What's wrong with right now
He's your son for christ's sake
He's -- Hey, Stephen, what about that dumb ass brother of yours, huh
Yeah
Savin' a mannequin
How fuckin' stupid can a guy get
Stephen suddenly  Jackson
You can't talk about my brother like that
(sighs) Here we go
And Stephen  into Jackson
Another fireman  to Jackson's aid
And Brian's there, defending his brother, a fireman
The crowd finally pulls the two apart
You're crazy, man
Leave me alone
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off
(Stephen calms a little) You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you
You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet
Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt
for life
No
(beat) need a drink
Stephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and Jackson again
Brian pulls him off and drags him for the door
You don't need a drink, man
You need to get outta here
As Jennifer watches Brian lead Stephen out the door
(to Swayzak) Ah those McCaffreys
just hate leaving a party with anyone left standing
- Brian leads Stephen toward his car
'm okay
leave me alone
Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the sidewalk
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what
Nah, he's nothin'
It's just sometimes
sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know
Brian stands there and folds his arms
don't think  can get up
Brian lends an arm
Look, Brian, a photographer
Maybe can get on the cover of  magazine, too
'mon, let's crawl home
'  - Stephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him up onto the boat
Adcox, those guys
they don't get it
it isn't the goddamn promotion
or dad
'm not my old man, y'know
No fire's gonna get me
don't give a shit about being a captain
it's just
it's just they don't trust me anymore
(blows out painful breath) they don't trust me anymore
' Brian's flops his brother on the bed
Unties his shoes
If you'd get out of my fuckin' way
could take my own goddamn shoes off
He clearly can't
Brian slips them off
You're such a pain in the ass
You've always been a pain in the ass
There's just a grim wall lamp above Stephen's face
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here
Like a goddamn spotlight
'm goin' blind
(touching light) This
Yeah
too bright
Brian turns off the dim light
Stephen's breathing deepens
They don't know
they don't know what  hear in there
Brian tucks the blanket around him
This boat could be okay, huh
Take it out weekends
Sean 'n me
Stephen's voice drifts off into sleep
Brian watches a moment, the rare look of peace on his brother's face, then leaves
- Dark and still
Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the chain link
-   - Is a practice stand-pipe
Brian counts down to himself, then rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant wrench and attaching the hose coupling
He does it again, over and over
- The sky's gone pink and blue as Brian climbs back over the fence
Adcox, coming out of a donut shop across the street, sees him
: -   - truck has  across the avenue and  its contents -- several  baby chicks
They're scurrying everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up
It's hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats
There's ghetto kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the fire engine
(at kids) Hey
Knock it off
Brian stops a beat
Rubs his eyes
(smiles) Maybe you should have gotten more sleep last night
Brian looks at him
Does he mean what he thinks he means
Tim is coming out of a small store across the street
He hands a small bag of groceries to Adcox
This everything you wanted
Everyone grows suddenly silent
'  - fireman's without even saying so, "Petzold" on the mailbox, Engine 17 parked out front
Brian's alone outside, cleaning the diesel fuel off his arms
Watching a small kid playing with a toy fire truck in the drive
' Tim and Brian are loading the groceries into the fridge
Stephen and Grindle are fixing a loose cabinet door as Adcox sits caulking a faucet fitting at the kitchen table with a young
(to Stephen) Can  help you guys at all
Nah, we just about got it
(noticing Adcox's shirt) Sally must be finally ironing your shirts
It's just new
Couple'a shifts and it'll be as thrashed as the rest
The sight of uniform is too much for her
Her eyes cloud
'm sorry
Adcox reaches out and lets her weep on his shoulder
It's okay
miss him
just miss him, y'know
'  - Adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette, lost in himself, watching the little boy play with his toy fire truck
Stephen's followed him out
This job
This fuckin' job sometimes
To buy it trying to go the extra yard, man, that's one thing, but to buy it just because there wasn't any back-up
it's bullshit
Stephen leans down close
Yeah, it's bullshit
So what
Fuck Swayzak
Fuck 'em all
We don't go into fires for them
You know that
Christ, you taught me that
beat of understanding between them
Stephen looks back at the house
You know Knowlton pretty well
Yeah
(beat) Kind of an asshole, wasn't he
Adcox can't help but smile
Biggest in two battalions
(beat, smiles) We're gonna be okay, man
17 - As Brian and Tim scrub down the fire engine, the rest of the company lies sprawled in Watching a weepy soap
Schmidt walks through and is snared by the 's glow
He hesitates
Shares the moment
Is she going to get the divorce
(sighs with honest concern) Hell if  know, man
ladderman, , walks in with a memo
Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's list
Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder
"Way to go"
"All right, man"
Brian turns and sees Stephen out on the apparatus floor, watching
Watches
Pengelly's younger than him
17 -  /  - An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station
Built in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each level
Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready beside a pile of coiled hose rolls
(looking at watch) Alright
Go
Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building
There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags the other end inside and up a flight of stairs
Go
Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the building
That isn't a football, probie
Get it on your shoulder
Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end
Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another two flights
It's a bitch
Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming up with another roll
Having fun, fireman
Tim flips him off
Brian laughs and sprints for another roll
You're not breaking any records, Brian
Brian holds it under his arm and takes off
Stephen grabs a roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside
Your shoulder
Like this
Brian lifts it to his shoulder
Come on
Pick it up
They come to the doorway
Instead of stopping, Stephen follows Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs
Without a word spoken it's become a race between them
Brian's face explodes in sweat
His heart pounds as they go up flight after flight
The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds thousand
Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen  and his leg
Brian pauses
Stephen's already back on his feet
Run, damn you
Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, Brian the "winner" by a nose
Stephen drops his hose roll, sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs
Unsure, Brian starts to join in
Stephen stops suddenly
Roll the hose
What, are you kidding
By myself
Adcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back into the station
You heard me
We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't
He was scraped badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood
What, is it the stairs
Christ, 'll let you win next time
(in Brian's face) You got a problem with drilling, probie
No, Lt
,  don't have a problem with drilling
But let's just have one drill
Not one for the company and one for me
Roll the hose
Stephen turns and walks away
Brian stands there watching him in blind fury, finally exploding
Goddamn you Stephen, 'm not gonna quit
You hear me
An awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by the station alarm klaxon
Stephen smiles
Well, thank God for fires
17 -   -  - Sequence omitted from original script
: - Sequence omitted from original script
- Sequence omitted from original script
- Sequence omitted from original script
: - Smoke and confusion
is screaming hysterically at Stephen as he jumps down from the engine
(grabbing his coat) My baby
My baby's still up there
Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a hoseline coming
Stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building
Brian hesitates a beat, then follows
- Where they bomb up a staircase just as a ,  them on their ass
Stephen jumps to his feet with an axe as Brian struggles to get up
Don't take that kind of shit from it
Don't let it know you're scared
Come on
Stephen, with just his axe,  up the stairs at the fire, at the flaming boards
The fire retreats into another room,  the door shut behind it
Brian struggles up the stairs
The two of them slide up on either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe like a  team shotgun
The door breathes in and out and something animal scratches and snarls on the other side
Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat
That thing behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing
It wants out
It wants
him
Ready
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team
Listen to it, Brian
Jump when say
It won't get us
Stephen  the lock with his axe and  the door open
out past their cheeks, then in
Now
Stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield into the flames
Brian tries to follow but the fire , cutting him off
He hesitates
It's that goddamn flame again, leering at him
Daring him
It  suddenly, Brian to his knee
He  in pain
-- And now Adcox and Grindle are coming up the stairs with a hoseline   the room
Clouds of furious steam bellow out and across the ceiling
Nobody could be alive in there
Except Stephen
His entire outfit smoldering, he emerges from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a gasping child
-  - Most of the firemen have gathered together for post-fire coffee and stories
Brian sits off alone on the fire engine bumper, apart from them
Santos walks up
They think she's gonna live
Stephen walks up
Sits down beside him
You okay
waited
would have fucking waited
That's not what it's about, Brian
The point is there was a kid in there
And what if there'd been two
went in because that's what  do
It's my way
It's dad's way
It isn't everybody's way
Dad's way
Where did he tell you that
In a fucking seance
You said you wanted to know something, Brian
What did you learn today
(Brian doesn't answer) What do you say, Brian, huh
Time to move on
Brian lingers only a moment before standing
You're right, Stephen
You win
You're the best, man
Brian hands Stephen his helmet and walks away
'  - There's only six like it in city hall, and this one has a view
' (on intercom) Brian McCaffrey on line two for Jennifer
'll take it in my office
(turns to her and smiles) Go get him
/  - Jennifer comes out of Swayzak's office and walks down to her own
' /
'  - -- It's a tiny, bleak little rat hole
She picks up the receiver
Brian
We see Brian in his apartment
've been thinking about what you said the other night
If the offer's still on the table, 'd like to talk about it
(beat) Okay
'll arrange things with your assignment captain
(beat) Marty's a good man, Brian
Yeah
Brian hangs up
He stares at it a moment, then  it against the wall
Jennifer stares at the phone with something almost like sadness
: - Stephen drives past the burned-out brownstone that fried Alan Seagrave
He parks in the alley behind, walks up the building, and   a plywood sheet covering a blown-out window
- Stephen walks through the creepy, brutalized silence
Back to where Rimgale had focused his investigation that night
He searches the floor, the wall, looking for something
/ - crumbling one in Chinatown
Brian checks the address on his slip of paper
He stands there a beat, hating himself
/ It's a regular station but for the rear that has been converted into arson squad offices
As Brian approaches the office door he can see Rimgale sitting at his desk
Standing nervously beside it is a fresh-faced, uniformed
(to probie) So stop me if  get this wrong
The fire's almost out
You're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat
You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered
But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, 'm a hero
Heroes don't just stand around
So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation
Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline
The kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation
You could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence  use to prove it's arson
You've made my day longer, Probie
Go home and think about that
The kid shuffles off hang-dog
Rimgale's angry gaze falls on Brian
Uh, 'm Brian McCaffrey
Your new assistant
Your Dennis' kid
(beat) work alone
And Rimgale walks into his office, leaving Brian marooned in the doorway
Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale changes his shirt
Brian can just glimpse from where he stands a horrible burn that has consumed most of Rimgale's stomach
Rimgale catches the look
Are you still here
Get used to me, Inspector
'm not going anywhere
Then go find a corner
don't want you in my way
think we should get something straight here
was assigned to this office by the city
Look,  knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job
But that don't mean you get any slack
Swayzak sends you down here, okay, gotta eat you, that's the rules and got nothing to say about that
But Swayzak or no, you live with me
Step out of line, and  don't care who knows you, 'll swing the hammer
(beat) You think you're the first
Rimgale glances at his watch, puts on his coat, and picks up a small paper bag
Where are you going
Pest control
: - And the face of , an unremarkable man in his 40s
Unremarkable but for laser eyes and two heavily bandaged hands
Go wide and find him sitting in an institutional chair -- handcuffed, actually -- in an institutional hall
uniformed guard stands nearby as Brian and Rimgale come down the corridor
Ronald smiles upon seeing Rimgale
Shadow
How ya doin', Ronald
Staying comfortable
Didn't think you'd make it
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal
(looking at Brian) Who's this
He works for me
Is he a fireman
(smiles) like firemen
You like everybody, Ronald
Ronald's eyes pick up Brian's name on his prison  badge
Brian McCaffrey
(eyes light up happily) Oh this is really a treat
Brian McCaffrey
Lost a dad to the animal, huh
(heating up) Hey, do  know you
You don't know him
know you
(to Ronald) What the hell are you talking about my -- Rimgale silences Brian with a threatening hand
Knock it off
Now
Tell him about me, Shadow
Ronald here likes telephones
Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton
Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald
When you got bored, what did you do
You just started making calls
mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it
Did he tell you how we finally met
Nobody cares, Ronald
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow
You're depriving our famous young friend here
Okay
Ronald Bowland
The cop helps Ronald to his feet and all four are marching down the hall
It was on State Street, right
Just your basic warehouse torch for the owner
Cakewalk
But the animal
turned on me
'Ol Shadow here, he shows up -- whole place is going like hell -- my hair, my hands
could've just let the animal take me -- but Shadow, he's a good camper, so he tries to pull 'ol Ronald out
Guess he didn't notice the tub of phosphorous next to me
(smiles) Notice you're still a little shy about rolling your sleeves up, Shadow
Show him your stomach yet
-   - Ronald in the hot seat before a parole board, Rimgale and Brian on the sidelines
All right, the parole board has received Mr
Bowland's fitness report, his -44, endorsement from his section warden
Dr
Norris
As supervising psychiatrist  would describe Mr
Bowland's progress as remarkable
Taking into account his disability and the six years already served,  recommend parole
Mr
Bowland, do you regret your crimes
Yes
understand now the pain caused
If released, will you commit these crimes again
won't
Do you consider yourself ready for society
Yes
The parole board shuffles their papers
It's a done deal
Rimgale suddenly stands and approaches Ronald
Sure Ronald
You're ready alright
Absolutely
(surprised) Excuse me, Mr
Rimgale
Excuse me
(to Ronald) What do you do with little girls
tortured look comes over Ronald's face
He's holding back
From the paper bag, Rimgale suddenly tosses a burned baby doll in his lap
What do you do with them, Ronald
Huh
Rimgale then lights a cigarette lighter in Ronald's face
(smiles) -- Burn them
And old ladies
-- Burn them
And the world -- the whole world
(smiles) -- Burn it all
The parole board stares, stunned
Rimgale stands
See ya next year, Ronald
Gotta go
- pre-war theatre closed with a sign:   -- 1991
, mid-forties, climbs out of his car and walks to the entrance with some rolled-up blueprints
- Benton walks through the vast theatre and up to a beautiful Art Noveau office door:  ,
He goes to insert his key
Drops it
As he reaches down, we see a tiny wisp of smoke  back under the door
Benton sniffs, as if he smells something, then shrugs and inserts his key
It'd have been a good story if he'd lived longer
The moment he pushes the door open It   in a : - Later and engine companies have already knocked down the building fire as Brian climbs out of Rimgale's red sedan
(opens trunk) Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make yourself useful
He starts handing Brian handfuls of equipment cases
Loaded down, Brian follows Rimgale into the building
Fire crews are at work in here, including Engine 17 at the other end of the theatre
Brian's surprised to see them, his eyes locking briefly with Stephen's
An
walks up to Rimgale
We were lucky with this one
Could've taken out the whole complex, but the explosion blew out most of the flame
Good for us
(looks to body) -- Not so good for him
"Him" is our previous owner, David Benton, just his hands and a leg showing from under the collapsed door
Rimgale crouches beside it
Turn this over
Brian does
The corpse's keys are still in the lock
So's Benton
Blown with such force he seems fused with the door
On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, sticky goo
With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals it in a glass vial, stands, and walks into the office
What do you want me to do with -- Rimgale, now inside, silences him with an outstretched arm
-- Shhh
(after a beat) What are you listening to
Rimgale doesn't answer
His eyes drift over the scorched walls as he speaks softly to them
You sneaky little son of a bitch
Hide and seek
Come on, tell me what  want to know
He scratches at some soot
Smiles and lifts a small hand recorder
(business-like into recorder) Heavy smoke stains observed in entry room
Demarkation line high
Fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off
It started somewhere else
(walks down hall) Less soot here
More heat
(they enter back room) And very little soot here
(to Brian) Get that couch out of the way
Brian pulls it aside
The lower third of the wall is completely untouched by soot
(to himself) So you were happy here
Warm and cozy and in no hurry
(into recorder) Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance
(to Brian) Find me some glass
Glass
Do we have a language barrier here
Glass
There's some on the sill of a blown window
Brian hands a shard to Rimgale, who turns it over in his palm
(into recorder) Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion
Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn
Explosion must of come after a slow burn
(shuts recorder off) You little tease
What were you up to you little bastard, huh
What made you that mad
(then, an idea) Or scared
(switches on recorder) It started in this room
Took its time, hung out
but the air ran out
It couldn't breathe
So it was snuffed
But it wasn't dead
still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
-- Another backdraft
Rimgale turns to the wall, a section where the plaster is severely damaged
He probes with a penknife
Finish coat burned away
Severe spawling of rough coat
Rimgale follows the damaged wall down -- down -- to a melted wall socket
That's our ignition point
Dig it out
Carefully
Brian chops it out from the wall
Rimgale crouches down, peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires
The copper tip is severely melted
Rimgale sniffs the plug
(into recorder) Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees
An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
No it couldn't
Rimgale shuts off the recorder
Stares down Brian
mean you'd be right -- with normal wire
But that's gauge ten in that plug -- industrial stuff
Who knows why they put it in here -- but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees
And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot
(Rimgale just stares) In another life  was in high-end electronics
Rimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside
(into recorder) Have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants
Rimgale stands and walks out
Don't mention it
- Brian follows Rimgale down from the office into the vast theatre
Walls hiss and spit
Brian's surprised to see his former engine mates there, tromping and crunching their way through broken glass, their flashlights like dancing fireflies
Tim passes by
Hey, Tim
Everybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills
(distant) Brian
(to Brian) Check the wall for burn patterns
And Rimgale's off to another room
Brian turns and looks at the wall
It's endless
(to Tim) So, you surviving without me
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean
If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed
Swayzak's not my boss
Silence
Brian looks over the wall
dirty puddle separates him from it
(to Brian) Ooooh, like the tie
Love the tie
Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh
would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know
Grindle stares at him a beat, then wordlessly steps into the muck and pulls free a section of wall, dropping it on the ground in front of Brian
Santos and Grindle look at each other
Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for smoke patterns, there's some good ones over here
Yeah
Where
(as Brian walks over) Little to the right
further
further
Right behind there
Hey, could you hand me that pike pole
There's a pike pole leaning against the wall
Brian pulls it aside
-- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys
Nobody laughs
Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after all
Stephen appears around the corner
Sees what's happened
That's just about enough, guys, okay
See ya around, Brian
They leave
Brian stands there, humiliated
(to Brian) What the hell's the matter with you, huh
You're steppin' in the shit again
You could've done it
You don't want this
(the suit 'n tie) Wake up, kid
Brian burns with shame and anger as Adcox walks away
Stephen hands Brian a towel
Here
Dry yourself off
Brian snatches it from him
Glares at his brother
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game
Thanks for the insight
Brian, look -- Just leave me alone, okay
Brian walks away
Stephen calls after him
Hey, Bri
Rimgale's okay
don't get half the shit he's talking about, but then everybody says the same thing about me
Who the hell knows
'  - Helen, Stephen's ex-wife, is sitting at her kitchen when she looks up suddenly at a strange sound coming from the roof
'  -  - On the short, sloping roof, Stephen stands hammering a shingle back into place
Helen sticks her head out the dormer window
Stephen, what are you doing here
Fixing my roof
It's not your roof anymore
He stops and tosses the hammer aside
Looks at his watch
Where's Sean
He's got piano lessons
Oh yeah
How's he doing
He's going to be a fireman
Give up, babe
You can't fight it
Believe me, my mom tried
(beat) Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this
just wanted to,  don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since  don't remember much of it -- -- You remember
Yeah
just thought  should say, don't know, something
The great communicator
Sorry  hit Jackson
He deserved it
He was born deserving it
He treats you okay
Okay
treated you better
You treated me like shit
But she smiles
You want some coffee
Coffee
Nah,  gotta go
What's wrong, Stephen
(looks at her) 'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind
(beat) How's Brian doing
He's out
know he's out, but how's he doing
'know,  treated him better than any other probie  ever had
He probably hates my guts, but  did the best thing for him
made him finally look in the mirror
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it
You always have to be right
Hey, 'm the first one to admit when 'm wrong
Yeah
When was the last time
In a fire
Never
(beat) Look, 'm his brother
care about him, y'know
He was going to get himself killed
Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened
And  couldn't --  just couldn't
You can't keep being his father
Stephen sighs deeply
You know what  realized today can't remember my dad's face anymore
There's pictures of him staring at me everywhere  go, but the guy behind them
he's gone
He sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway
'll see ya around, Helen
She watches him as he walks lonely up the street
- Lab Tech, , leads Brian and Rimgale through the autopsy area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered in plastic
Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald Cosgrove
If you say so
Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's confronted by two hideously charred bodies
Both deaths due to close encounters with stationary objects; office door for Mr
Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for Mr
Seagrave
No non-relevant traumas
No significant blood toxicology
Attitude of both trajectories consistent with explosions
Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors
It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum
Burns almost completely away when you light it
Putty
On both doors
There's something else kinda interesting
Ricco lifts Benton's charred shoulder
Underneath we see some of his clothes that have melted and co-mingled with his flesh
See this
credit card has been fried right into Cosgrove's skin about where his back pocket should have been
Guess he didn't leave home without it
Ricco erupts in a honking laugh, then switches instantly back to a business tone
Anyway, down here, take a look
McCaffrey, hold this for us
Uh,  don't think that's in my contract
just re-wrote your contract
'mere
With supreme reluctance Brian pulls the crisper's head and shoulder away from the table
Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to sell you insurance, lift him
Brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher
(to Rimgale) See that patch of shirt
We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro
On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate
Nobody around here had ever heard of it
Trychticholorate
Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents
It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire
What the hell was it doing in the fire
That's your job
At that instant, Cosgrove's eyes  and his body
Brian  the body in shock and backs away, stunned
asked you to hold him, not feel him up
'  - Rimgale's  sedan
Brian is still wringing imaginary guts off his hands
Rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in his lap
Read
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --" -- Go to the bottom
Under heat properties
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates
Will consume magnesium"
Ever burned magnesium
It's so hot it takes water molecules and
Rimgale  his hands next to Brian's head,  him
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen
Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire
Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue
Trychticholorate
Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder
Rimgale looks at Brian
He's getting tired of this
Look, it isn't proof, okay
Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes
And the putty around the door
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft
gun's a helluva lot easier But the right guess on this is arson
don't guess
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case
don't work for them, either
- Brian's sitting at a desk
He's finishing up a huge paper clip Tyrannosaurus
The phone
Arson
Straightest answer your department's given me all week
We see Jennifer's calling from her office, she's busy signing papers brought to her and okaying campaign posters as she talks
Hey
How's it going
Boss and  are up to about three words an hour
(to secretary) Green committed to a thousand
(to Brian) There's another fund-raising party tonight
Marty'd really like you to come
don't know, 'm kinda swamped here
He tosses a paper airplane
could use a date
Yeah
Well, maybe  can fit it in
' McCaffrey
Come here
(into phone) Call ya back
Brian hangs up quickly and walks back into -   - Rimgale's there, crouched excitedly beside a trash can that's lid's been sealed closed
He tamps a piece of putty on the rim and backs away
Take the top off
Go ahead
Take it off
Brian walks over and   the lid
-- Instantly a tongue of flame  straight up past his head and  out
Jesus
Rimgale's grinning like a little kid
That's it
Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it
You see what this tells us, huh
Our killer doesn't love fire
What
(pulls out file) got it after we talked to Ronald
Torches
Want to fry the whole goddamn world
But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much
-- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls
And he made his burns backdrafts
([p
78]) But he killed these guys
But he could have killed everybody there
The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall
The backdraft blew out the flame
That's it
That's the reason
What reason
Why backdrafts
Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out
That's why the sealant on the doors
So what have we got, a torch with a conscience
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point
Are you going public with this
No
Do that and  guarantee you'll scare him off
don't want him running away
- Latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against a beautiful Chicago skyline
An   blows, and suddenly the skyline is
We're on a huge, private party boat
- Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing parade of rich and beautiful
Across the sea of champagne and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak
He has his hand on her back
Jennifer spots Brian
She smile, detaches herself and walks over
Hi
(eyes on Swayzak) Hey
(beat) So are you dating your boss or what
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, 'd probably be pissed
(beat, sighs) Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes
Sorry
(beat) Are you dating anyone
You think that's really any of your business
Well, you did invite me here
Marty did
(beat, smiles) But  wanted you to come to
Swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage
Mr
McCaffrey
Nice boat
It isn't mine
(to photographer) Let's get a picture
Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's shoulder
Another staffer slaps a    sticker to Brian's lapel
Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian
'm sorry
Snap
(seeing someone else) Larry
(sotto to Jennifer) What does he do again
Swayzak leads her off in pursuit
Left alone, Brian turns to the railing, stares off at the passing city
You can hear the wind-up of a siren
And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker Drive
Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches it disappear
How's the job going
She's appeared again beside him
Okay
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he
No, he's more of a dinosaur
Guy's not a dummy, though
He's juggling alot of balls on this one
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
Jesus, give him a break
There isn't enough proof yet to go public
Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff
Not 'till it's locked
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah
Both of them look up sharply
woman drunk out of her mind has tipped over in her chair
She laughs, her fellow tablemates laugh, everybody laughs
Jennifer takes Brian by the arm in the opposite direction and smiles
Save me
- The band's completely cut loose now
wild percussion rhythm that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen
Brian and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through hair crazily askew
The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful as it slips past
The drums beat faster and harder and the only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked on each other
- Sweaty, flushed with the evening and a few drinks, Brian and Jennifer pull up in her car
Thanks for the invite
Got anything to drink in there
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies
/ The regular engine company's gone to bed and the arson squad's packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter
Brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the rear where Rimgale has his offices
As they walk Jennifer's eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin ceiling
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city
Lotta tradition locked up in here
What do you think
Homey
See that trap door up there
That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines
It was pretty different then
but kinda the same, y'know
Do you miss it
(he doesn't answer) You seem like you do
When  came back,  knew more than anything else that  wanted to be a fireman
Then why did you quit
wanted to be a good one
- They walk into the back arson offices
Brian pokes through a few drawers, one or two shelves
Finally he lifts a squat, specialized fire extinguisher
The bottom has been hollowed out, leaving room for a fifth of bourbon
Old firehouse trick
He pours her a glass
Jennifer takes a generous sip of her's, turns, brushes past him and breathes, So show me your fire truck
- Brian escorts Jennifer along the side of the behemoth
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment
This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose
Uh huh
Brian lifts a narrow, tapered straight-bore nozzle
This is a six inch playpipe, cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows
(picks up another item) This is our pipe extender, used in forward lays
(moves on) This is our hard suction line
Our adjustable insertion nozzle
(comes around back of trunk) And this is the hose bed
Beat
The air cracks between them
And is brushed aside
In an instant they're all over each other
Tangled lips and gulping breaths
Jennifer abruptly breaks it off -- And looks mischievously up at the hose bed, with its long curling rolls of soft cotton
Brian doesn't remember this precise scenario being discussed at the academy, but he improvises admirably, popping up onto the hose bed and offering a gentlemanly hand to Jennifer
As they tumble into the soft folds : - - Engine 17 roars up, lights flashing, to a high-rise
As the crew jumps down Tim trips and falls flat on his face
Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill yourself at least wait till the fire, it's better
-   - Jennifer unbuttons Brian's shirt
Tell me about the playpipe again
She pulls the shirt off his shoulder as we : - -  - Engine 17 walking up to a frazzled security guard in the lobby
Where is it
Don't know
There's alarms going off on three different floors
Wonderful
They climb into the elevator
-  - It's cramped on the way up with the bulky coats, helmets, hose rolls, and the tangible nervousness that always goes with this kind of fire
The elevator Musak plays 101 Strings version of "Tie  Yellow Ribbon 'Round The Old Oak Tree"
How do we know if the floor's going to be on fire
If the doors open and it's hot, don't get out
- Brian pulls off Jennifer's stockings
As she kicks it away
- -   - The elevator stops
The door opens
No howling blaze, not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't see your hand in front of your face
They fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire
Hide and seek in a white fog bank
Everybody stops and listens
Slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the haze
It's here
On cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent
Grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe
These high-rise gigs give me the creeps
Let's wait for a back-up, Stephen
We're early on this one, it hasn't even broke out yet
We're one short as it is with Brian gone
But Stephen's on the hunt now
Obsessed
Want to learn something
Yes sir
Stephen and Tim take the lead, their axes gripped like shotguns
Grindle backs them up with a charged hoseline
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side
It isn't safe, man
Don't go splittin' us up
Not with this one
-- What the hell's the matter with you
You always check the other side
haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay
We got a job here
Let me take the lead, Stephen
Goddamn it Adcox
Just do your fucking job
Adcox folds
With a stricken look on his face he takes his crew down the other way
Stephen and Tim slowly feel their way
Everybody  around in terror
Nothing
Something inhuman giggles down ahead of them
Stephen smiles
(like a mantra) Oh, you're so very sly, but so am (to Tim) Listen to it
you can tell when a wall cracks which way it's gonna jump
you can hear the doors breathe if they're hot
Tim looks confused
He doesn't get it
They come to a side door
Stephen runs his hand down the jam, feels for heat
Then he steps back, takes a deep breath, and  the door down with one
Quiet inside
-   - Brian and Jennifer are into the rhythm now, breathing deeply
On the wall above them are framed photos of dead firemen
Watching
- -   - Stephen concentrates on the sound of the fire above him, -- then abruptly turns and  down another door
-     - Brian and Jennifer lie in a tight embrace, enjoying the moment, the lull, as suddenly the lights   and an alarm klaxon
Firemen are coming down the pole now
What's going on
They frantically climb into their clothes
The firemen haven't noticed them as they climb aboard
They've
What are they doing
-  - And before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly pulling out into the street and  off down the block
The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves it
She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost in the blast of air, and together they hold each other as the night screams past and
- - Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise fire
Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to pull off lengths of hose from the bed
As the folds curl away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come out with it
With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the bed
Excuse us
- - '  - Stephen and Tim creep along the hall
(to Tim) Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling
that means it's hiding
staying sleepy
one of these doors
Tim's come to one
(to himself) Easy
no hurry
you're not going anywhere
Stephen  down another door
Sticks his head in to check
little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water
Tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as Stephen comes out of the room he was checking
Sees Tim lifting his axe
Did you check the door for heat, Tim
Tim doesn't hear
The axe is already up
Tim
Tim's committed now, coming hard at the door
And Stephen sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in
Tim
He rushes for Tim as Tim's axe  the door and a whine behind it builds and roars and howls and Tim's all follow- through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as The door  ,   against the opposite wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror as          and Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams, Oh God
Oh God no
And Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at the monster,  it with his hose as Stephen ignores the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle them both, killing the flames
The monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's face and what's mask and helmet anymore
Grindle looks back where the fire came from
There's a corpse in there, burned and lying between two doors
Adcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end of the goddamn world
- - Brian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus -- it's Tim
Jennifer turns away in horror
They load Tim into the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along
To hold his hand
Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street
Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat and slams it to the ground
He kicks it, kicks it till his strength's gone
He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian
- - Rimgale walks down the smokey corridor
The charred civilian is there, sitting in the short stretch of hall between two blown doors
Through the haze Rimgale sees Stephen crouched in the interior room, picking at the debris
Lost in himself
Hey, Stevie
Stephen stands and looks around the room, seemingly unaware of Rimgale
He walks wordlessly straight out past him, his eyes streaming with tears
-   - Brian shoulders his way through the emergency room
He passes a small alcove full of vending machines
Adcox is there, sipping a paper cup, leaning against the machine in deep anguish
Is he
He's alive
- Further down the hall is
Grindle and Santos are there, sitting outside the room, raw and weary
Grindle nods to Brian
Everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire
Everyone but Brian
Brian looks through a door window into the room
There, surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim
He's been cut out of his uniform
Gauze bandages everywhere
As a pair of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites
He turns away
Do they think he'll pull through
They're not saying
should have been there
None of us should have been there, Brian
Voices rise down the hall
Turn to shouts
It's Adcox and Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another
Brian can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional
Abruptly it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward them upset
You had to do it, didn't you
Stephen's got other things on his mind
Not now, Brian
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh
Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie
Is that what happened
Is it, Stephen
had that fire
He didn't listen
He didn't listen
He was a fucking candidate
He was your responsibility
He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen
(beat) You burned him
Fuck you
Brian grabs his arm
Stephen  and roughly  Brian, knocking him against the wall
Brian comes off it in a flash and is all over Stephen
They go down and it's all thrashing and shouting now
horrible, endless draw
Grindle and Santos are in it, pulling them apart, holding them up against opposite walls
Both brothers glare at one another, tears filling their eyes
Brian shakes Grindle off and walks away
: - '  - Brian sits staring blankly
newspaper drops in front of him
'
Rimgale stands above him
Goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of "chemical traces" and a "behavioral link"
Oh, and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest "any time"
Brian's eyes wince closed
Get your stuff and get out
'  - She's pouring some coffee as Brian bursts in
(surprised) Brian
What's wrong
You told Swayzak about our arson lead
It's all over the fucking news
didn't know it was a secret
There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators -- -- Bullshit
You knew what  told you wasn't ready for the papers -- Will you please keep your voice down, there's people -- -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off
We may never bust him now
All for a couple's political points
was doing my job
(grabs her arm) Yeah
And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"
(shakes it off) Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills
Who the hell are you kidding
was there, remember
saw you and your brother -- Leave Stephen out of this -- Oh yeah, he's the real fireman
(beat) Who are you
Just another probie working for Swayzak -- --  work for the city
You knew what we were asking you to do
Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now
The fit isn't right
Swayzak appears in the doorway
He looks haggard, as if he hasn't slept
There's something haunted in his eyes
Mr
McCaffrey
Keeping busy
Yeah
In fact,  just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office
They loved it
And you know what
You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight
Oh Brian
Brian shoulders his way past Swayzak and walks out
- '  - Brian walks up to Tim's room
Stephen's sitting there, ragged looking
Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and gauze and years of wasted promise
An  beeps, a respirator hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat
He's gonna live
Maybe not much else, but he's gonna live
Stephen walks away
- As Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up
Swayzak opens the rear door from inside
Inspector
Alderman
- Cruising through traffic
Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, fidgety
man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before the one he's pouring now
He offers one to Rimgale
usually have breakfast first
Swayzak apparently doesn't
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don
"Don
" Don't you have any leads at all
No Marty,  don't
For the first time, Rimgale sees real fear on Swayzak's face
We still haven't found a connection between the victims
Jesus, open your eyes
Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise
Holcomb
didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet
The sedan stops back at arson
They'd gone around the block
-   - Rimgale opens the door, climbs out, lingers
Is there a connection between them, Alderman
Just catch the son of a bitch
The door shuts and Swayzak roars away
-   - Rimgale walks back into his offices
He's surprised to see Brian there working at his desk
What the hell are you doing here
'm finished with Swayzak
'll do whatever you want me to do
just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim
You gotta give me another shot
Rimgale stares at Brian, appraises him
: - of Rimgale  the molding around the door frame of Holcomb's burned office
Underneath can be seen traces of the same white residue from the other fires
thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange
And he's right
Rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers
Backdraft
Rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body lied between two doors
The backdraft was set somewhere in there
It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door
But the outer door held
and waited for Tim
Brian steps into the inner office
So find me the fire
Brian begins searching, probing
He finally stands
Defeated
You're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost
Brian's eyes don't understand
From Rimgale's coat comes a plastic flask
He pours out of it a liquid onto the floor and lights a match
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about
Fire
Rimgale drops the match
small flame explodes to life
It's a living thing, Brian
It breathes, it eats, and it hates
The fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner
The only way to beat it is to think like it
To know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to
It darts west
Licks the ceiling
The fire purrs and hisses
Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely
Some guys on this job, fire owns them
It makes them fight on its level
But the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like Ronald
Brian stares at the flame
goblin reaching out for him
-- Woosh
Rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher
In an instant the goblin is gone, the genie in the bottle
What the hell are you guys doin'
young woman's entered
We're the fire department, lady
Well color me stupid,  always thought the fire dept
put out fires
(to woman) You work here
Till yesterday
What do you think the odds are that a non-refundable ticket to Paris survived this
Somewhere between zero and no way
Shit
What a mess
You seem real broken up about Mr
Holcomb
Jeff Holcomb
The Darth Vader of tax accountants
He was a sleezeball
Hopefully a sleezeball that carried some insurance
Go talk to the building owner
He was the building owner
Our book lists the owner as Dekom Trust
She looks at him like he's the dumbest human she's met all week
Don't investigators come in adult size
17 -  '  - Sequence omitted from original script
17 - '   - Stephen's lying sprawled on his bunk, his hands pressed over his eyes
There's a voice outside the door
Stevie
Rimgale's here to see you
'm busy
He just wants to -- -- 'm busy goddamn it, okay
beat, then Rimgale himself enters
What, they don't knock on your planet
Rimgale takes in Stephen's room, the half empty bourbon bottle
Without a word, Rimgale walks over and pours it out
He sits down beside Stephen
still haven't gotten your fire report, Stevie
On Tim
wave of pain rolls through Stephen
'm working on it
deal with this stuff every day
But a fireman
you never get used to it
(beat) What happened up there
He was a candidate
Did he pay attention
Was he listening
He wasn't listening to the right thing
What do you listen to, Stephen
You don't know
nobody knows
might
Stephen's eyes meet Rimgale's and hold
It knows us
This one knows us
(beat) need that report, Lt
Stephen takes Rimgale's notebook out of his lap, rips out a page, and writes angrily in huge block letters
Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he- doesn't-have-a-face
Stephen throws the sheet at Rimgale, stands, and walks out
An Escher drawing of a place, endlessly vast racks spun around an open central core
High up, lost among its rows, Brian is going through rack after rack of dog-eared record books as Rimgale enters down below
(trying to hold it together in his mind) Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois
which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics
which is a division of Windy City Ventures
who's partners are
(beat) Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb
Son of a bitch
They knew each other
: More books
Files
Acres of paper
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants
And Cosgrove
Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate
They weren't very high on Seagrave, either
Nice bunch of guys
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces
(beat) Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow
Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared
beat, then he looks directly at Brian
We need to get a look at his files
- Sequence omitted from original script
- With glowing skyscrapers leaping up in the background, it's an unexpectedly quiet, serene place along the lake
Jennifer sits alone at a bench, watching an ancient fisherman look for dinner, as Brian walks up
Hi
Hi
We still talking
(beat) Look, 'm sorry about the other day -- Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered
want to know why he keeps that hidden
don't know anything about it
You could check
It'd be in his files
(beat) Do you know what you're asking me to do
Yes
'know, four years ago  was working in a bakery
Two years ago  was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name
run that office now
Marty believed in me and believe in him
You want me to just throw that away
Your boss is lying, Jennifer
And it hangs between them, two people lonely on the edge of the lake
'  - Sequence omitted from original script
'  - At a workbench, under a single lamp, Stephen stands amongst a confusion of tools, wire, And a wall socket
With a pair of pliers, he tugs at something within the socket, puts the face-plate back on and screws it down
He stares at it, and we feel the sudden wave of hopelessness cascading through him
He sets the socket back down -- and  everything aside in a single, furious move
'  - Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Stephen's sits quietly against Helen's back door, lost in himself
light comes on
Helen opens the back door
Stephen
She sits down beside him
'm sorry
couldn't sleep
What's wrong
(beat) It used to be, when  was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs
Life and death, right and wrong
When someone called the fire department, we came
Those guys don't know how much  love them
You don't leave people hanging
cause that's what it's all about
It's loyalty
It's 'till death do us part
Isn't that what you heard
It's you go, we go
Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department
and when the fire department stops coming
that's the end of the fucking world
(beat) 'm sorry  came, Helen, it's just
it's just there's nobody  can talk to
(beat) miss you
The moment lingers, grows heavy and grey
'  -  - Stephen and Helen in bed, holding each other
'  -  - Morning, and Stephen dressed, making eggs for three
Sean's there, lending a hand, beaming as Stephen tries to show him how to flip an egg
Helen enters in her robe
He kisses her
Cook and  are almost finished here
Have a seat
Stephen
can  talk to you a second
Stephen musses his son's hair and follows her out into the hall
Look, 'm sorry  -- -- No, that's okay
It's just Sean
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs
And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano
don't want to confuse him, Stephen
The blow's so long and hard and deep you don't even see it
It's
It's just things have changed
you're the same, Stephen, but things are different now
you've got a son
you're the best at what you do Stephen, you always were, but you scare me now
Just then, Sean sticks his head into it
(to Sean) Hey
Sean-man, your dad blew it forgot  had to work this morning
Aw dad, c'mon
Next time, huh
We'll do it up big
Promise
Helen's turned away
Okay
(then sotto) Mom's crying, dad
'  -   - Jennifer enters Swayzak's inner office
His chair's turned away toward the window
(holding print-out) Latest polls came in, Marty
(he doesn't answer) Marty
Finally the chair turns, revealing a haunted man
Polls are far from his mind
Jesus Christ, Marty, what's going on
Leave me alone
She sees a fire department file on the murders open on his desk
We've come a long way together, Marty
've staked my whole career on you
And now you're sneaking around this office, leaking things to the papers behind my back
(beat) Is there something you're not telling me about these deaths
Swayzak's eyes are dead metal
No
And he turns his chair around again
Jennifer stands there a beat
-- Then turns to the filing cabinets
'   - Brian drives up and parks
He's half way to the staircase when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car
Jennifer
She hands him a manila envelope
What is -- Just take it
Silence
'm sorry
That's a dumb thing to say
You're right
She starts her car
Goodbye, Brian
cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on jacks
Rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his head in amazement at the undercarriage
What the hell do you do with this thing
Rimgale's looking through the report Brian's handed him
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released
Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers
They're all airtight
Yeah
Airtight
He dumps three more reports on Rimgale
've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place
Looks like they were just making it up as they went along
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report
They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study
It's not even really a company
No employees, no directors, just a Box
Then who wrote the report
It had to be someone who knows numbers
Some kind of fancy accountant
But what's the connection
Brian hands him something else
photograph
Swayzak and the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970
Time of their lives
think it's time Mr
Swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk
'  - The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home
Rimgale and Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar
They push the door open slowly
'  - It's dark as they enter
Hello
Swayzak
Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls
It's the Brian hears first
Then the  of an electrical socket ice-cold cobalt blue
Suddenly the room's dimensions are there in frantic, strobing shadows
Chairs, a couch -- -- And a figure that  Brian
the light from the burning plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, crashes Brian to the floor
They
The figure  Brian's throat
Brian  him back -- Against the burning wall plug
The figure  in pain, gets his hand on a crowbar and  Brian -- who crumples, dazed
The figure stands -- just as Rimgale  him
The figure  across a gas space heater,  the connection off
The figure  Rimgale  with the crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door
Hissss
Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the wall
baby backdraft wagging its tail
He goes to a dazed Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and - helping him outside
Hissss
The ruptured space heater pumps gas furiously
Rimgale sees that
He also sees a bedroom door ajar on the far side of the house
And through the door a couch
And on the couch,  body
Hissss
- Rimgale rushes back inside
It's Swayzak, unconscious
- Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the gas  and the doors and windows  in a , the shrapnel  Rimgale off his feet
Brian slowly shakes his head clear
He looks around, tries to orient himself
Uh
sorta got a problem here
Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched through his shoulder
-   - Rimgale lies in an emergency room bed
Well Brian,  guess you can say it's arson now
How ya feeling
Rimgale grunts
Did you pull me out
Yeah
Did  say thanks
No
Just wondering
hate hospitals
You're so
so goddamn useless
Rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger
He kicks it over and over with frustration till something finally off
Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration
So what do you want me to do
've been lying here hours
just thinking
We're close
(beat) We're not looking in the right place, Brian
This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place
- Brian's sitting alone in a chair
Finally the opposite door opens and in enters Ronald
Well, Mr
Life magazine
Come all this way just to say hi
Brian hands him a stack of murder files
'm close
but  can't get who it is
So you came to me
(smiles) Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
As Ronald starts to read the files : -  - Brian still sitting there
Watching Ronald devour the statistics
The photos of charred bodies
Ronald finishes, leans back
Okay, here's the deal
'll tell you a story, you tell me one
Fair
Who's doing this
Your first question should be who isn't
It isn't a spark, Brian
Not enough damage
And an insurance pro
Where's the profit margin
Then who -- -- No no, your turn
Tell me a story
don't have a story
Sure you do
Ronald drops on the table a dog-eared copy of that 1972 magazine with Brian on the cover
Famous story even
Straight burn
Just an engine and truck first on scene
What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there
What
You gotta tell a story too, Brian
It's fair
'mon, don't think too hard -- thought it was great
loved it
It was nothing to these guys
medium deal
Right
Light smoke, low roll
Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal
So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across
what were you feeling, Brian
(Brian doesn't answer) 'mon, you promised
Be honest
(Brian just stares) Okay
Guard
--  wanted to be him
Right then wanted to be him more than anything
(smiles) Very good, Brian
-- About your report here
The way to a torch's heart is through his tools
That's how you know him
It's the way he talks to the fire
And to you if you listen
The outlets
That's a probie answer
You're smarter than that, Brian
Trychticholorate
Good
-- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside
Only there's another fire in there nobody sees
And it took your dad, didn't it Brian
Did you see him burn
In a flash, Brian suddenly reaches across and grabs Ronald by the collar
Who the fuck is doing this
After it took your dad
the fire
did it look at you Brian
Did it talk to you
And Ronald sees something in Brian's eyes
He smiles
You see, our world's aren't so different
Brian releases Ronald
(quiet) Who's doing this
The arsonist smiles a creepy, horrible grin
Think, Brian
Who doesn't love fire, but knows it better than anyone else
Who's around trychticholorate 24 hours a day
cold shock rolls through Brian as he slumps back in his chair
Oh Jesus Christ
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian
'  -  - Brian climbs up onto Stephen's boat
Nobody home
He opens the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights
'  - There's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, And a stack of fire department supplies in the corner
His whole body aching with reluctance, Brian begins looking through them
Solvents, Armorall, a small specialty can of fire dept
chemicals
There's a label of ingredients on it
Way down at the bottom, Is trychticholorate
Nausea wracks its way through Brian
Oh goddamn it Stephen
Footsteps
Brian spins around in stone shock as Stephen comes into the cabin
Hey, what are you doing here
Just
Just wanted to say hello
So hello
Brian backs away from the chemicals
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little
've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes
You're selling dad's boat
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now
And  got way too many of them
really should get back
There's
there's something 'm supposed to do
Yeah
What have you got to do
(beat) Look at you
Look at your face
All the things you must be thinking
Man, you must really hate my guts
Well, you know what
It's okay
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other -- -- Okay, so you don't like me
You don't like everything 've done
What, because  wasn't such a genius the way  raised you
Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was  supposed to do
You tell me, what the fuck was supposed to do
He  the bulkhead wall
It's okay, Stephen,  -- --  tried, y'know
Helen's right don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, 've got some
(beat) Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe  shouldn't have gotten in the way
'm your brother, not your father
Go on
You gotta go somewhere
Go
Brian turns to leave
Pauses
saw it
Saw what
When dad died,  saw another fire
Everybody did
saw it before it got them
tried to yell, but
He asked me to look out for him
And  didn't do it let him die
(stunned) Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years
For christ's sake, you were seven years old
You think he could have heard you in there
hate him so much sometimes, Stephen
You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
Maybe  do
(sighs) What a fuckin' mess, huh
(beat) People can change Brian
Sometimes right when you're looking at them
Brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something freezes up inside
Stephen catches the look and there's horrible silence between them
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you
don't know, Brian
don't know
17 - Brian stands before the fire station
His brother's and his
17 - Brian  the lock off Stephen's locker
Starts looking through it
Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, starts shaving in a mirror
He doesn't notice Brian
Adcox turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little
And Brian's universe caves in
An icy claw tears out his stomach
Gulping breaths, he forces himself to look at Adcox's back
On it is a small, rectangular burn
It's fresh and it's the size of a wall socket
At that moment Adcox turns
The two of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks past him
Just then the alarm bells
Brian hesitates a beat, confused, then turns and runs down to 17 - Where firemen are scurrying around, suiting up
Brian looks frantically for Stephen, sees him out back
17 -    - (breathless) -- Stephen, wait a minute
gotta talk to you
It's Adcox, he's -- -- What are you doing here
saw Adcox's back
saw the burn
put it there
Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people
know
How do you know
knew when you came looking for the chemicals
Looking for me
-- What were they doing there
They were for the fucking boat, Brian
Grindles sticks his head out the back door
We gotta roll, Stevie
'll be there
They're waitin' man
'll be there, goddamn it
Grindle goes back in
(to Brian) Anything else
What are we going to do about this
'll handle it
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen
'm his Lt
He's my responsibility
'll handle it
Me
Stephen turns and walks toward the station
Brian's eyes go to a window just above it
There, watching him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox
Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as Brian hears the cough of diesel engines
Oh, Christ
Stephen
He starts running for the station
/
17 - -- It's too late
Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine company pulls out and whistles down the street
The ladder company is just easing onto the drive
Brian hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit
/
17 - As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares at Adcox sitting behind
The glimmer of an understanding

46 - The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them
Suddenly  the truck company off
The driver the brakes,  the truck company into a
The back fishtails, the wheels  the curb,  a mailbox, and then the whole rig  onto its side and  to a stop
It's tangled confusion in the rear cab
Firemen, unhurt, piled atop one another
Brian slides his way out from under them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise six blocks away
He starts running
- Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along the river as Brian, panting, runs up
He searches frantically through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for number 17
There it is but nobody's home
Brian stops a passing captain
Where are they
Where's 17
On the roof
Brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four stories above him, feels the bile of fear in his throat, the desperation, -- And begins strapping on an air tank
- Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an extended aerial ladder
- Tongues of flame  skyward through ragged holes
Black clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as the roof itself  like a comatose dinosaur, reminding you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it
Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks for his company
It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, faces hidden behind helmets and masks
Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen near the edge, "17" on their helmets
Stephen -- The helmets look up
Stephen and Adcox
Facing each other
Adcox cradles an axe
Brian
Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table
hissing black cloud drifts through
They're the only three people on earth
Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh
Burning people
You're a fireman
They were killing firemen, man
When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files
They were my friends,  had to do it
had to do it for the department
Did you do it for Tim
(pain, to Stephen) That was an accident
Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early
Why didn't you listen to me
Brian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge -- sixty feet up
Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a massive stream at the side of the building
You gotta let me finish -- Just come down, John
Just -- -- Shut up
Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department
-- Knock it off
(to Stephen) -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man -- -- He killed people -- -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out
-- -- Stephen, this is bullshit -- -- What he would do to your dad's department
You gotta let me finish it -- And there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on Stephen's face
You're his Lt
, Stephen
(beat) Are you gonna handle it
Are you Stephen
Shut up
What do you want me to do, Stephen
Talk to me
What am  supposed to do
(beat) There's a fire
We've got a job here
Let's get on with it
-    - The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's happening through the smoke on the other side
Grindle and Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them
Shit
It's going
Clear the roof
Now
Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as -
- Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof  and and huge  begin racing along it
And then it goes
The center section , and in rolling waves of steel, the hole spreads outward;
Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole races for them,  roof
Jesus Christ Brian, run
Run goddamn it
And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge
Stephen's made one corner, Brian desperately heads for another
At the last instant -- as the     to his ankles -- Brian   the roof -- -   - -- And falls half a story before  onto an exterior fire escape
Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto a ledge,  out a window, steps through, And falls
-   - Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he into a pool of water at the bottom
He's in a freight elevator shaft, thrashing madly, drowning
Great  of  are through an upper doorway and  down like monsoon rain
- We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream
- The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater
Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water still  , Brian unhooks his air tank
He leans back, tries to float on the rising column of water
-- His coat catches on something --  him underwater
He struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off
The building  in earnest
Flaming chunks of plaster down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater
The place is coming apart
Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks  a gas main, then  it
white-hot from one side of the shaft to the other
Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames
Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to drown or burn -- -- When there's a
And suddenly another door on the shaft is tearing open
There's a glint of an axe flashlight
It's Stephen
Brian has about two seconds left
In that time Stephen sees the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite
It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal curtain of flame
Before we can even assimilate that, Stephen's already jumped
crazy leap over the fire
He the opposite wall,  the shut-off, and into the pool beside Brian
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --" Oh shut up, huh
(grimaces) think  broke my goddamn arm
Brian helps him stay above water
The level continues to rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they scramble through
-  - It leads to a stairwell that's become a   of water spilling down it
No way
They push through to the next doorway and out onto - The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums
The fire has cracked its way into the room as  -- drums begin ,   Roman candle fountains of glittering
Brian helps Stephen as they snake their way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly with desperation
They duck low, round a corner, -  - -- And walk right into an axe handle that  Brian's throat  him gasping flat on his back
It's Adcox
Stephen  Adcox and  him on the edge of a metal platform that extends out from the raised flooring
You stupid son of a bitch
What the fuck are you doing
Stevie
Adcox struggles against him, heaving and sobbing
Let it go
Goddamn it let it go
And Adcox releases the axe
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical drum below , the shock wave  the platform and  it several feet before it
Brian, cut- off, is  with a wall of debris
Adcox and Stephen are  across the platform and the shattered railing
Stephen grabs a piece of broken, dangling strut and hangs on with one hand
In his other hand is Adcox
Hanging below him, his grip loosening
Stephen
Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris
The railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand along it
But he won't let go of Adcox
His eyes bore into his best friend's with absolute conviction
You go, we go
The towering shots of  from below have begun to Adcox's pant leg
He's starting to burn
But Stephen won't let go
Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's back
And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off
Adcox and Stephen
There's a narrow catwalk half-way down
Stephen  with a sickening
Adcox falls past it, down into the flames
There's an exposed -beam running from the ruined platform out over the catwalk
Brian climbs up onto it, balances across over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his brother lies, battered but still alive
You're gonna be all right, man
-  - Brian looks down and across the factory floor
There, coming through the doorway, is Pengelly and Nightengale with a hoseline
- Hey
Over here
They start for him when another drum , them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing arc
The flame has cut them off from the hose
Stephen sees what Brian's thinking
Wait for another hose team
But Brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder
Wait for the goddamn hose team
Brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and down to the factory floor
He's heading for the hoseline when
-- The fire cuts him off
Not just any fire
That same one from so many years ago
Don't fuck with me, kid
'm not in the mood
Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's
Brian stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him
Same old little kid with his finger up his ass
Then something different comes into Brian's eyes
No
No more
There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the pole
Brian lifts it, approaches the fire
You can practically hear the flames laugh at him
Brian suddenly turns and the neck of the extinguisher against the pole,  it off before  the cannister  into the flames where it  -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through and  the hose
The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as Brian spins and  it with the
-- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian now -- -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes fill with tears -- -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying
And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, pulling him away
That's my brother
That's my brother goddamn it
And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as Brian steps up with the hoseline
Another time, friend
And whoosh, it's gone
- Brian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an ambulance
(smiles, weak) You are such a pain in the ass
As Brian jumps in with him : - Paramedics swarm over Stephen as the ambulance screams through the night
Brian's right there, holding his hand
Don't tell them about Adcox
Don't let 'em
'm sorry
'm sorry  thought
won't
His brother squeezes Brian's hand, his eyes never leaving him
(reading ) Oh shit, give him some lidocaine, now
Now
(beat) Who's your brother
Stephen's 's begun to falter
The other paramedic fires off an injection into his
His pressure's fading -- push some adrenalin
The 's become erratic
Stephen's eyes never leave Brian's
Oh man, don't you die
Don't you die
#2 He's going south
He's gonna box damn it
They put an ambo bag over Stephen's face
The eyes never leave Brian's
Goddamn it don't you die now
Not now
They're breathing for him now
The  begins shrieking
-fib
The paramedics begin scrambling to load the defibrillator pads on Stephen's chest
But the fireman's eyes never waver from Brian
They look into his with complete conviction, complete acceptance, And then they don't
: Then,   : - silent, quiet street absolutely empty of traffic
Then over the crest of Chicago's mightiest thoroughfare, creeps slowly a fire engine
It's emergency lights are on but not the siren
This engine isn't in a hurry today
Behind comes another fire engine
And another
Ten, twenty, all of them creeping slowly along
And behind the engines now walk firemen in their dress blues
Hundreds of them
Walking silently in step behind Loaded in the rear of Engine 17
Santos drives as Grindle, Brian, and the men of ladder company 46, walk behind
The silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed like dress swords
Average people stop, take their hats off
- Sequence omitted from original script
- Two coffins, lying side by side, draped in the blue and white of the Chicago flag
single fire helmet rests atop each casket
Brian stands at attention beside Helen
He holds the hand of Stephen's son Sean, his eyes clouded with tears as a fire dept
honor guard plays Taps
Jennifer's there, too far away to touch
Rimgale, still wearing a head bandage, stands stiffly beside a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary
In the Chicago Fire Department the alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the company has returned home to quarters
We will now ring out that code to welcome home John Adcox and Stephen McCaffrey
With a small hammer Rimgale rings out 3-3-5 on the bell
The honor guard folds the flag covering Stephen's casket and hands it to Helen, who holds it to her breast as we : - sea of blue uniforms drifting across green as the funeral breaks up
Brian hugs Helen and Sean
Lets them go
- Rimgale's there, resting against his dept
sedan as Brian walks by, pauses, and leans on it beside him
beat
Your brother was a good man
Yeah
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city
Is that how it's going to read
(Brian doesn't answer) You're the only one that knows
Like it never happened
Rimgale turns to walk back to his sedan
He pauses
Looks back to Brian
Want to help me with something
- An elevator opens as Brian and Rimgale walk quickly out, down a hall, and  into Swayzak's office
'  - The Alderman's there, giving a press conference from his desk
Mr
Swayzak
How ya doin'
(confused) Investigator
Rimgale sits on Swayzak's desk
'm a little busy right now -- This'll only take a minute
There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this -- Rimgale drops the manning report on Swayzak's desk
This is just a guess of course, but think they're gonna want to know why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to create a phony manpower study
(to cameras) You guys'll wait, right
The room explodes with questions
Through the din Brian leans over the desk very close to Swayzak
See that glow flashing in the corner of your eye
That's your career dissipation light
And it just went into high gear
Brian turns and pushes his way out
At the door he pauses and looks back at Rimgale
The investigator nods and smiles just a little
' As Brian walks down it, Rimgale appears and calls to him
-- Brian
Brian hesitates
Don't keep looking over your shoulder for the ghost
It's gone now
And there's just a beat between the investigator and his probie before Brian nods and walks away
Brian walks down the hall
He passes Jennifer's small office
She's in there, surrounded by packing boxes
think your boss is going to need some spin control
quit two days ago, Brian
(beat) What'll you do
don't have the slightest idea
'll see ya around, huh
It's a small town
: 17 - And morning breaking across the avenues and up against the tired brick of firehouse 17
17 - Brian sits staring into his locker, lost in thought, his equipment stacked up on the bench beside him 17 - And firemen scurrying to their equipment on the apparatus floor
They're climbing aboard their rigs now and the pumper's diesel is coughing to life
At the last moment, as it begins to pull out, Brian comes sliding down the pole in his turn-out gear, bounces off the floor, and climbs aboard as the engine  away
17 - There's a new fireman beside him on the bench
He can't get his coat buckled right
Brian leans over does it for him
You're doing it wrong
