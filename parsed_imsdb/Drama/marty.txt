Written by Paddy Chayefsky 1955 , 187TH : Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue of the neighborhood
Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish
It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market day
, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, baby carriages
at their improvised street stands, hawking their wares, disputing with their , roaring salutations to
In the midst of all this,    on a typical neighborhood
Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of garlic
, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty- year-old
There are three or four other  in the shop, all talking to one another
four-year-old  lazily chases a cat
The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, , comes out carrying a large leg of lamb
Marty is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four
His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor
He drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb
He sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts as he chats with his customer,
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty
(sawing away) That's right, Missus Fusari
It was a very nice affair
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache
(still sawing) No, that's my other brother, Freddie
My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already
He lives down on Webb Avenue
The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie
thought he was a big tall fat fellow
Didn't  meet him here one time
Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance
Marty sets the five chops on the scale, watches its weight register
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank
My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor
They moved to Detroit last year
And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue
Oh, that was a big affair
Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine
How's that with you
Well
Mrs
Fusari produces an old leather change purse from her pocketbook and painfully extracts one single dollar bill and seventy-nine cents to the penny and lays the money piece by piece on the counter
From the rear of the shop a woman's rings out
' (off-screen) Hey, Marty, 'm inna hurry
You're next right now, Missus Canduso
When you gonna get married, Marty
You should be ashamed of yourself
All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children
just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty
" Watsa matter with you
That's no way
Now you get married
(amiably) Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and
Mrs
Fusari takes her parcel of meat, but apparently she feels she still hasn't quite made her point
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old
Watsa matter with you
That's swell, Missus Fusari
You should be ashamed of yourself
She takes her package of meat
Marty gathers up the money on the counter, turns to the cash register behind him to ring up the sale
Mrs
Canduso sidles up to the counter
Marty,  want a nice, big fat pullet, about four pounds
hear your kid brother got married last Sunday
Yeah, it was a very nice affair
Marty, you oughta be ashamed
All your kid brothers and sisters married and have children
When you gonna get married
set on the wall
Mel Allen, smoking a White Owl cigar, is recapping the baseball game that has just finished as Marty comes in
(to two leaving) What happened
The Yanks took two
Any homers
The Young Men exit without answering
Marty moves further into the bar, which is crowded with locals, smoky, noisy
at bar with Marty in the background approaching, we see a group consisting of , who wears a suit and tie, the only man in the room who isn't in shirtsleeves or a Basque shirt; , thirty-two, hunched over a girlie magazine; a , twenty-two, studying the magazine over Joe's shoulder
(to the Kid) Angie come in yet
The Kid indicates a booth where a small wasp of a man, mid- thirties, is sitting, bent over the sports pages of the Daily News
So these two girls come over to the bar
Hey, Ang'
and they sit down right next to me
You want a beer, Ang'
look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty
Hiya, Ralph
been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street
(to Bartender) Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty
(to Joe studying his magazine) Waddaya read there, Joe
(off-screen) Hey, Lou, turn the television off
Turns out these two girls are nurses in some hospital on a Hundred and Fourth Street
They shouldn't sell magazines like this on a public newsstand
That's the truth
(turning a page) Can you imagine the effect this has on adolescents
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses
(reaching for two bottles of beer proffered by the Bartender) What nurses
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night
We got a date with them tonight
(moving off to Angie's booth) You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to
Joe turns another page in the girlie magazine
Now that's something, eh
used to go out with a girl like that
You should live so long
Marty joins his friend Angie and pushes a bottle of beer at him, pulling one of the pages loose from the paper Angie is reading
For a moment, the two men sit quietly, each poring over his separate piece of newspaper
(without looking up) So waddaya feel like doing tonight
don't know, Ang'
Wadda you feel like doing
Well, we oughta do something
It's Saturday night
don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday
How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the  Chester
(not very interested) Which one was that
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend
Oh, yeah
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn
Her name was Mary Feeney
What do you say
You think  oughta give her a ring
'll take the skinny one
She probably got a date by now, Angie
Well, let's call her up
What can we lose
didn't like her, Angie
don't feel like calling her up
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight
don't know
What do you feel like doing
Well, we're back to that, huh
say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight
" And you say to me, " don't know, what do you feel like doing
" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television
Well,  tell you what  feel like doing
feel like calling up this Mary Feeney
She likes you
What makes you say that
could see she likes you
Yeah, sure
(half-rising in his seat) 'll call her up
You call her up for yourself, Angie
don't feel like calling her up
Angie sits down again
They both return to their papers for a moment
Then Angie looks up again
How about going downa Seventy-Second Street, see what we can find
Ralph says you have to beat them off with clubs
Marty makes a wry face at the suggestion
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that
Angie, 'm thirty-four years old been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life
'm tired of looking
Everybody's always telling me to get married
Get married
Get married
Don't you think  wanna get married
wanna get married
They drive me crazy
Now,  don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie
You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead
don't wanna go
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy
Angie leans back in his seat, scowls at the paper napkin container on the booth table
Marty returns to the sports page
For a moment, a silence hangs between them
So what do you feel like doing tonight
(without looking up) don't know
What do you feel like doing
(from phone booth in background) Marty, your mother wants you onna phone
(rising in response; to Angie) Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something
(settles into the phone booth, picks up the receiver) Hello, Ma, what's the matter
,
It's a typical lower-middle-class Italian home, and
is on the phone, a round, dark woman
Beyond her, in the dining room, we can see a young couple -- , Marty's cousin, and his wife , seated at the dining room table
(voice lowered) Hello, Marty, when you coming home
Where you now
Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here
They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine
don't know
(in the phone booth) 'm coming home right now, Ma
'll be home in about two minutes
Tell Thomas stick around,  wanna see him about something
,
Mrs
Pilletti is on the phone
Okay, you come on home, okay
She hangs up, braces herself, turns and starts back to Thomas and Virginia in the dining room
He coming home right now
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how waste money and how  can't cook, and how 'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous,  spilled some milk  was making for the baby
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and  said, "Catherine, my sister
" So she say, "You're spilling the milk
" So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk  spilled, so she got me so mad, so  said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk
" So  took the bottle, and  threw it against the door didn't throw it at her
That's just something she made up
She goes around telling everybody  threw the bottla milk at her
didn't throw it anywheres near her
Well,  was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house
Well,  don't know what you want me to do, Virginia
If you want me, 'll go talk to her tonight
Thomas and Virginia suddenly frown and look down at their hands as if of one mind
Well, 'll tell you, Aunt Theresa
Lemme tell it, Tommy
Okay
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa
Sure
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here
mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty
And  thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty
Well
Because  called up Tommy's brother Joe, and  said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy
Why don't you take her for a couple of years
" And he said, "Oh no
"  know  sound like a terrible woman
No, Virginia,  know how you feel
(on the verge of tears) just can't stand it any more
Every minute of the day
Do this
Do that
don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband
We can't even have a fight
We don't have no privacy
Everybody's miserable in our house
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited
She's right
She's right
Young husband and wife, they should have their own home
And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but gotta admit, she's an old goat
And plenty-a times in my life,  feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself
And  tell you now, as far as 'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me
Virginia promptly bursts into tears
(not far from tears himself, lowers his face) That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa
We gotta ask Marty, of course
Sure
(rises) You just sit here,  gotta turn the fire on under the cooking
(exits into the kitchen) (having mastered her tears) That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa
(calling to his aunt in the kitchen) How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa
(off-screen) Oh, he's fine
You know a nice girl he can marry
She comes back into the dining room, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa
(sitting down again) Well,  don't know
He sits arounna house alla time
You know a place he can go where he can find a bride
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom
That's a kind of a big dance hall
Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls
It's a nice place to go
You pay seventy-seven cents
It used to be seventy-seven cents
It must be about a buck and half now
And you go in and you ask some girl to dance
That's how  met Virginia
Nice, respectable place to meet girls
You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom
It's loaded with tomatoes
" (committing the line to memory) The Stardust Ballroom
It's loaded with tomatoes
Right
This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa, what you're doing for us, and don't think we don't appreciate
The  of the    in the kitchen can be heard
Mrs
Pilletti promptly rises
He's here
She hurries into
Marty comes into the kitchen from the rear porch
Hello, Ma
(whispers) Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here
They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine
So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us
So  said, all right with me, but we have to ask you
Marty, she's a lonely old lady
Nobody wants her
Everybody's throwing her outta their house
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me
You gotta good heart
She turns and leads the way back into the dining room
Marty follows
Thomas has risen
Mrs
Pilletti and Marty come in
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot
That really takes a load offa my mind
Oh, we got plenny-a room here

Sure
It's gonna be nice
It's gonna be nice
'll come over tonight to your house, and  talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right
just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible
Siddown, Thomas, siddown
She exits into the kitchen
Virginia follows her to the kitchen door, where the two women ad-lib the following lines over the ensuing scene between Marty and Thomas
'm sorry we gotta rush like this
That's all right, that's all right
On accounta
'm gonna see you tonight
Over this, Thomas talks to Marty
Marty,  don't know how to tell you how much  appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby
So my mother comes in
Tommy,  promised the babysitter six o'clock
Tommy, before you go,  wonder if you gimme a little advice
Sure, what
You're the accountant inna family, and  figure you might know about these things
My boss wantsa sell his shop to me
His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop
He wants five thousand dollars down, although  think  can knock him downa four

All right, 'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday
Sure
Thanks a lot about my mother
We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally  want to pay
Don't worry about it
No, listen, that's my mother, 'm gonna pay for her
(off-screen) Goodby, Marty
Goodby, Virginia
See you soon
Thomas has moved off to join his wife in the kitchen where we can hear them exchanging final protestations and goodbys with Mrs
Pilletti
Marty sits at the table, hands folded in front of him, stolid, pensive
Mrs
Pilletti bends over her steaming kettles
Through the window we see evening is gathering
'
It's a small room with bed, chest of drawers, religious pictures, etc
Marty sits squatly on the edge of the bed, absorbed in thought
He stands, moves out into
and down that into
now lit by the overhead neo-Tiffany lampshade and the beaded old-fashioned lamps
He crosses to the kitchen door, looks in on his mother, cooking away, turns, crosses back to
He closes the sliding doors that separate the living and dining rooms
He extracts a small black address book from his hip pocket, flips through it, finds the page he wants, studies it intently
He sits on the chair by the phone, dials
(with a vague pretense at good diction) Hello, is this Mary Feeney
Could speak to Miss Mary Feeney
Just tell her an old friend
He waits again
With his free hand he wipes the gathering sweat on his brow
Oh, hello there, is this Mary Feeney
Hello there, this is Marty Pilletti
wonder if you recall me
Well, 'm kind of a stocky guy
The last time we met was in a movie, the  Chester
You was with another girl, and  was with a friend of mine named Angie
This was about a month ago
The girl apparently doesn't remember him
sort of panic begins to seize Marty
His voice rises a little
The  Chester in Westchester Square
You was sitting in front of us, and we was annoying you, and you got mad, and
'm the fellow who works in a butcher shop
Come on, you know who  am
That's right, we went to Howard Johnson's and we had hamburgers
You hadda milkshake
Yeah, that's right
'm the stocky one, the heavy-set feller
Well, 'm glad you recall me, because hadda swell time that night, and was just wondering how everything was with you
How's everything
That's swell
Yeah, well, 'll tell you why  called
was figuring on taking in a movie tonight, and was wondering if you and your friend would care to see a movie tonight with me and my friend
(his eyes are closed now) Yeah, tonight
know it's pretty late to call for a date, but  didn't know myself, till
Yeah,  know, well how about
Yeah,  know, well maybe next Saturday night
You free next Saturday night
Well, how about the Saturday after that
Yeah,  know
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, understand,  mean
He hangs up, sits for a moment, then rises, opens the sliding doors, enters
He sits at the heavy, wooden table with its white-on-white table cloth
Mrs
Pilletti ladles portions of food from the steaming kettles onto a plate that she brings into
and sets it down before her son
Without a word, he picks up his fork and spoon and plunges into the mountain of spaghetti, adds cheese, eats away
Mrs
Pilletti takes her seat, folds her hands on the table, and sits watching Marty eat
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty
don't know, Ma
'm all knocked out
may just hang arounna house
Mrs
Pilletti nods a couple of times
moment of silence
Why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom
This gives Marty pause
He looks up
What
say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom
It's loaded with tomatoes
Marty regards his mother for a moment
It's loaded with what
Tomatoes
Ha
Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom
Thomas
He told me it was a very nice place
Oh, Thomas
Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is
been there a hundred times
Loaded with tomatoes
Boy, you're funny, Ma
Marty,  don't want you hang arounna house tonight
want you to go take a shave and go out and dance
Ma, when are you gonna give up
You gotta bachelor on your hands
ain't never gonna get married
You gonna get married
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact  gotta face is that whatever it is that women like,  ain't got it
chased enough girls in my life
went to enough dances
got hurt enough don't wanna get hurt no more
just called a girl just now, and  got a real brush-off, boy
figured  was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt
Some stupid woman who didn't even wanna call up
She gave me the brush
don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like  was a bug
got feelings, you know
had enough pain
No, thank you
Marty
Ma, 'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason
You gonna die without a son
So 'll die without a son
Put on your blue suit
Blue suit, gray suit, 'm still a fat man
fat ugly man
You not ugly
(his voice rising) 'm ugly
'm ugly
'm
Marty
Ma
Leave me alone
He stands abruptly, his face pained and drawn
He makes half- formed gestures to his mother, but he can't find words at the moment
He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to his mother again
Ma, waddaya want from me
Waddaya want from me
'm miserable enough as it is
Leave me alone
'll go to the Stardust Ballroom
'll put onna blue suit and 'll go
And you know what 'm gonna get for my trouble
Heartache
big night of heartache
Sullenly, he marches back to his seat, sits down, picks up his fork, plunges it into the spaghetti, stuffs a mouthful into his mouth, and chews vigorously for a moment
It is impossible for him to remain angry long
After a while, he is shaking his head
Loaded with tomatoes
boy, that's rich
He plunges his fork in again, starts to eat
Mrs
Pilletti watches Marty anxiously as we
, West Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with stores, bowling alleys and bars
Cars push along between the pillars of the elevated subway structure
The  of the subway trains  by overhead every few moments
and  the Stardust Ballroom
It occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story building
It is a hot June night, and the windows are open for ventilation purposes
manufactured by Dave Greenglass and His Band blends with the  of the street
/
plays in the background
views , a plain girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, , prettier; Millie's fiance , 30; and a second young man , also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital
They are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street door
(in a low voice) told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl
(extracting cigarettes from the machine) She's all right, Andy
It's just that  get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and  was expecting something better, that's all
told you she wasn't attractive
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so
All right, 'm having a fair time
It's just that  get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and  wanted to wind up with something tonight
They join the two girls waiting for them and start up the broad stairway to the second floor
They are halfway up, when two  come in at the top of the stairs and start down
Dr
Keegan, who is holding Clara's arm, looks up, nods
,
This is a small, carpeted lobby with   in booth, a cloak room and rest rooms
Painted posters on the walls announce coming events and caution against smoking
There are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things
About six or seven  congregate in the lobby, engaged in various indifferent activities
include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy, Millie and Dr
Keegan come in
As they enter, the doors to the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a  in a black dress, quite pretty, comes in
She starts across the anteroom toward the cloak room, when Dr
Keegan calls out suddenly to her
Hey
The girl turns
Recognition floods her face
Herbie
Wadda you doing here
came up to dance, wadda you think
You here with somebody
'm just here with another girl
Where you going now
'm just gonna get my cigarettes left them in my coat
'll see you around
'll see you
She turns and continues on to the cloak room
Dr
Keegan turns to Clara
That's a girl used to know
,
fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the other by cheap leatherette booths
It is brightly lit and crowded
There is a constant movement in and out of the lounge
At the far end of the lounge, there are two large iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out
Dance from dance floor
Clara, Dr
Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and form a little group in the midst of moving  around them
kind of strange excitement has begun to enter Dr
Keegan
He stands with the others, but his attention is devoted to ogling the passing , occasionally looking back to the doors leading to the anteroom
Boy, it's packed in here
(to Clara) Some of these kids are awful young
Aren't you afraid you'll bump into one of your students
(nervously looking at Dr
Keegan) wouldn't think so
teach out in Brooklyn
You been up here before, Clara
Yeah, twice
Shall we try to get a table and get something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing
Hey, Herbie
Dr
Keegan doesn't seem to hear
(continues) Hey, Herbie
What
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing
Listen
You people go grab a table
'll be back inna minute
'll be right back
He turns and moves quickly through the crowded lounge, back to the swinging doors leading into the anteroom with Clara, Millie and Andy staring after him
So what do you say, Clara
Wanna see if we can get a table
All right
They turn and move toward the booths
The dance floor is fairly dark
romantic effect is achieved by papier-mache over the chandeliers
Around the walls are the stag lines -- the  and waiting
They stand singly or in small uneasy groups
There is constant flux and movement
slowly past the stag line, moving past faces, short, fat, tall, thin stags
Some pretend indifference
Some exhibit patent hunger
to include Marty, Angie near the end of the stag line
They are freshly shaved and groomed
They are leaning against the wall smoking, watching their more fortunate brethren on the floor in the background
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now
(looking off-screen) There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now
(following his gaze) Where
Down there
That little one there
Marty and Angie across the dance floor toward the wall opposite, where three  are standing
Two are leaning against the wall
The third is facing them with her back to the dance floor
This last girl is the one Angie has in mind
She is a cute little kid about twenty and wears a bright smile
They stare off toward the three girls across the room
Yeah, she looks all right from here
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them
'll take the one inna green dress
think this number is a little fast
Wait a minute
He tries a few tentative steps, testing for tempo
It's all right,  think
They still there
The two cavaliers turn their heads and look off-screen in the direction of the three girls
Apparently, the girls are still there
Marty and Angie relinquish their lounging positions against the wall and slouch along past the line of stags with a show of determined unconcern
They edge through the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the dance floor and slowly push their way toward the
Marty and Angie come in and start to approach the three girls
The girls, aware of the boys' presence, stiffen and their chatter comes to a halt
Angie advances to one of the girls
Waddaya say, you wanna dance
The girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her hand languidly to dancing position and awaits Angie with ineffable boredom
Marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the Excuse me, would you care for this dance
The Short Girl gives Marty a quick glance of appraisal, then looks quickly at her remaining friend
(but not unpleasantly) don't feel like dancing just yet
Sure
He turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the stag line
follows Marty, as he moves past the line of stags, all of whom are watching him
as he finds his old niche by the wall, leans there
moment later, he glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend are
'
: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper young  who asks her to dance
She smiles, excuses herself to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor
Marty stares at the Short Girl
He shrugs, he's used to this kind of thing, then turns his attention bleakly back to watching
The band starts up again and the  blares
It's a Lindy Hop number
Couples swirl past; the  comes up
Marty leans against the wall, smoking and watching the dancers swirl past
Dr
Keegan's  is heard
(off-screen) You here stag or with a girl
Marty's attention is on the passing couples, so he doesn't seem to hear
to include the Doctor standing on Marty's right
Suddenly aware of the Doctor, Marty turns his head
You say something
Yeah
was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl
'm stag
Well, 'll tell you
got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and  just met an old girl  used to know, and was wondering how 'm gonna get rid of the girl 'm with
Somebody to take her home, you know what mean
'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me
(confused) What
'll take you over, and 'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then 'll cut out
Because  got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and 'll pay you five bucks
(stares at the man) Are you kidding
No, 'm not kidding
You can't just walk off onna girl like that
Dr
Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys
Marty turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition
The Doctor approaches   and obviously broaches the subject with one of them
This  seems more receptive to the idea
Dr
Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a five dollar bill
The Stag detaches himself from the wall and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor
Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the Stag, who come in and move past him
Concerned and curious, Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning position, following in their general direction
Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the area around the dance floor
As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the booths
Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths
Dr
Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her
She is looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola glass
Dr
Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara and is going through some story about being called away on an emergency
The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who will see to it that she gets home safely
Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying hard not to seem affected
She politely rejects the Stag's company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway
Dr
Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway
From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr
Keegan and the Stag
The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, and he catches their conversation
in that case, as long as she's going home alone, give me the five bucks back
Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks
was willing
It's my five bucks
They move past and away and Marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen
Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the glass of Coca Cola in front of her
Her eyes are closed
Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do
As she glances around,   to include a sign over an exit that reads "Fire Escape
" Clara starts moving toward that door
Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara
He slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape
Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view
Background sounds continue steadily
Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops and stares off-screen
Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape outside
Marty watches
Then he continues on, crossing the threshold of the
It is sizeable, almost a small balcony
It looks out onto the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses
Clara is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her head sunk down
She is crying
Marty watches her for a moment before moving a step or two forward
Clara doesn't turn
Marty tries to think of something to say
(finally) Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance
Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, her lips trembling
Then, in one of those moments of simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and Marty takes her to him
They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed, looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, wondering if anybody is seeing them
He reaches back with one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of the heavy iron doors shut
He returns his hand around the girl's shoulders
He stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on his chest, as we
: , Mrs
Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing
She pauses to catch her breath on the landing
Then she moves down the hallway to
4-
Mrs
Pilletti rings the bell
The  can be heard as she waits
The door is opened by Virginia
Hello, Aunt Theresa
Come in
Mrs
Pilletti enters the apartment
Virginia closes the door after Mrs
Pilletti enters, and they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit
At the far end to the right is the living room in the background
(in a low voice as she pulls off her coat) Is Catherine here
Virginia helps her with her coat
(nods, keeping her voice low) We didn't tell her anything yet
We thought that we'd leave it to you
We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you
Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her
Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you
think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling
Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an anxious smile on his face
Hello, Aunt Theresa
Hello, Thomas
just this minute got the baby to sleep
He comes down to Mrs
Pilletti and Virginia, lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see
And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see
Don't worry
'm gonna take care-a the whole thing
shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered conference in the hallway
' (off-screen) Who's there
Who's there
Mrs
Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed by Virginia and Thomas
(calling back) It's me, Catherine
How you feel
comes in at the end of the foyer
She is a gaunt woman with a face carved out of granite
She is tough, embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work ingrained into her features
Hey
What are you doing here
came to see you
How you feel
The two sisters quickly embrace and release each other
gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum
been getting a pain in my shoulder
gotta pains in my shoulder too have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much  can't sleep
It's a curse to be old
How you feel
feel fine
That's nice
Now that the standard greetings are over, Aunt Catherine abruptly turns and goes back into the living room
Mrs
Pilletti follows
Virginia and Thomas remain in the doorway
Catherine and Mrs
Pilletti enter and Catherine heads straight to a chair -- obviously her chair
It is an old heavy oaken chair with thick armrests
The rest of the apartment is furnished in what is known as "modern
"  piece from House Beautiful here, a piece from American Homes and Gardens there
Aunt Catherine sits erect and forbidding in her chair
Mrs
Pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair
Thomas and Virginia remain off-screen in the hallway for a moment to hang up Mrs
Pilletti's coat
The two old sisters sit for a moment
Well, how's everything with you
Aunt Catherine grimaces to describe how everything is with her
My son Marty's fine
Everybody's fine
Thomas comes in from the hallway, stands in the back of the room, somewhat apprehensively
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride
They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon
Everything is very nice
That's nice
gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi
His mother died
Oh
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi
don't think  remember him
Well, he died
You know who else died
Who
You know the old man upstairs in this house
Old Irishman, always drunk
He got pleurisy
He was inna hospital two weeks
He died yesterday
Well,  always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news
Virginia comes into the living room with Thomas
They remain in the background
(suddenly) Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish
Hey, why don't you go to the movie
Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter
Thomas looks indecisively at his wife
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment
They told us to come down
Sure, sure
Thomas ponders a moment
All right, Ma, we're going downstairs to the Kaplans, if you want us for anything
They exit
The two old sisters sit rigidly until they hear the  of the door closing
Catherine cocks an eyebrow and promptly launches into her statement
wake up this morning,  hear the baby crying
So  wake up
come in their room
That girl is shaking her hand atta baby
said, "You brute
Don't you strike that baby
That's my son's baby
" It's her baby too, you know
That's my son Thomas's baby
Well, it ain't your baby
Did  tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me
You told me
She's a witch, that one
tell you what happen yesterday
What happen
She gave me the evil eye
She demonstrates this by pulling the lower lid of one eye down and staring grotesquely at the ceiling
(scoffing) Ufa
keep one eye open when  sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed
Catherine,  want you come live in my house with Marty and me
Her sister turns, genuinely surprised at this request
Ah
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon
(sharply) Who
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia
When was this
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock
What they say
You know what they say
They say things are no good in this house
Catherine, your son is married
Leave him in peace
He wantsa be alone with his wife
They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony
Now tell you what  think
want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me
In my house, you have your own room
You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here
We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls
You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty
We are pleased for you to come
Catherine surveys her sister coldly
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this
The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms
You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper
She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy
Catherine, you are no fool
You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife
Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down
Catherine stands abruptly
She is deeply hurt
So  am an old garbage bag, put inna street
Oh, Catherine, please
Don't make a tragedy
You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself
It pains that they should do this
know it pains
Catherine turns and meanders a few steps
The stiff edge of mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now
These are the worst years,  tell you
She seats herself on an Eames chair
On her right, a Modern- Age lamp towers slimly
On her left is a Modern-Age endtable with a Modern-Age ashtray on it
The hardened muscles in her face suddenly slacken
(with deep compassion) Catherine, you are very dear to me
We have cried many times together
When my husband died,  would have gone insane if it were not for you
ask you to come to my house, because can make you happy
Please come to my house
These are the worst years
tell you
It's gonna happen to you
'm afraida look inna mirror
'm afraid 'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin
'm fifty- six years old
What am  to do with myself
have strength in my hands
wanna cook
wanna clean
wanna make dinner for my children
Am  an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close
These are the terrible years, Theresa
Terrible years
Catherine, my sister
Catherine stares distraught at Mrs
Pilletti
It's gonna happen to you
It's gonna happen to you
What will you do if Marty gets married
What will you cook
What happen to alla children playing in alla rooms
Where is the noise
It is a curse to be a widow
curse
What will you do if Marty gets married
What will you do
She stares at Mrs
Pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained
Mrs
Pilletti stares back for a moment, then her own eyes close
Catherine has hit home
Catherine sinks back onto her chair, sitting stiffly, her arms on the thick armrests
Mrs
Pilletti sits hunched a little forward, her hands folded nervously in her lap
(continuing quietly) will put my clothes inna bag, and will come to you tomorrow
The two sisters, somber and silent, continue to just stare at one another
the crowd, picking up Marty and Clara dancing cheek-to-cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor
The rides over the top of the scene
You come up here often
was up here twice before
Once with a friend of mine and once came up alone
The last time
do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there
Yeah
Well, the last time  was up here, that's where  sat
sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle
Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind
'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap
Then began to cry, and  had to get up and go home
cry a lot too
'm a big cryer
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing
Oh,  cry all the time, any little thing
My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy  am
Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident
You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain
know exactly how you feel
And  also want you to know 'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself
So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are
'm having a very good time, too
So there you are
So  guess 'm not such a dog as  think  am
You're a very nice guy, and  don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago
don't know either
think 'm a very nice guy
also think 'm a pretty smart guy in my own way
Clara smiles briefly at this
Now  figure, two people get married, and they gonna live together forty, fifty years
So it's just gotta be more than whether they're good looking or not
You tell me you think you're not very good-looking
My father was a really ugly man, but my mother adored him
She told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes, like everybody, you know
And she says my father always tried to understand
used to see them sometimes when  was a kid, sitting in the living room, talking and talking, and  used to adore my old man, because he was so kind
That's one of the most beautiful things have in my life, the way my father and mother were
And my father was a real ugly man
So it doesn't matter if you look like a gorilla
So you see, dogs like us, we ain't such dogs as we think we are
They dance silently for a moment, cheeks pressed against each other
'm twenty-nine years old
How old are you
'm thirty-four
,
Marty and Clara are about halfway down the steps leading to the street entrance to the ballroom
Clara has on a light summer coat
Marty is about two steps ahead of her and has to keep turning his head to talk to her
He is in an elevated mood, intoxicated -- on a talking jag
you teach chemistry
That's funny
Where
What school
Benjamin Franklin High School
Benjamin Franklin, where's that
Brooklyn
went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road
It's right arounna corner from my house
have a cousin who's a teacher
He teaches Latin
He lives in Chicago
He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows
He has reached the street landing and waits for Clara to catch up with him
They stand in front of the glass doors leading to the street
(prattling on) was pretty good in high school sound like a jerk now, but  was pretty good
graduated with an eighty-two average
That ain't bad
was accepted at City College filled out the application and everything, but my old man died, so hadda go to work
My best class was German
That was my first language
Der, die, das -- des, der, des
There you are,  still remember
He pushes the glass door open to
As Marty and Clara emerge onto the sidewalk of West Farms Square, they pause again
It is about nine o'clock, and the busy street is brightly lit from the stores
hurry on their way
The elevated subway over-head intermittently
(chattering on) You know what  was good at in high school
was good in Math
You know how long ago  graduated high school
June, nineteen-thirty-seven
Holy cow
June, nineteen-thirty-seven
What is that
Fifteen, seventeen years ago
Holy cow
Seventeen years ago
Is that right
Seventeen, that's right
Where did it all go
'm getting old
'm gonna be thirty- five November eighth
Thirty-five
Wow
Time goes on, boy
He takes her arm, and they start walking
Nineteen-thirty-seven
that's right
My old man died December, nineteen- thirty-seven
as they stroll toward the corner of Jerome and Burnside Avenues
Two o'clock in the morning he died
The doorbell rings, and  knew something was wrong right away
Because my room is onna ground floor inna front, you see, and  got outta bed, and  answered the door
as Marty, caught in his story, stops and continues intently
There was Mr
Stern
He had a house down about a block from us
He moved out though
My old man, he used to play cards with him and some other old guys
He's a Jewish feller
So he said, "Is your mother home
" So knew right away there was something wrong
was only eighteen, exactly eighteen years old, just the month before
So  said, "Is something wrong, Mr
Stern
"  was in my pajamas, you know
So he said, "Marty, your father died
" My father died right inna middle of playing cards, right at the table
He had a heart attack
He had low blood pressure, my old man
He used to faint a lot
Suddenly he looks at Clara, rather startled
Boy, am  talking,  never talked so much in my life
Usually, everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles
Well, 'm gonna shut up now, and 'm gonna let you get a word in
He takes her arm again, and they continue strolling toward the corner intersection in silence
Seventeen years ago
What  been doing with myself all that time
Well, 'm talking again
must be driving you crazy
Mosta the time 'm with a girl,  can't find a word to say
Well, 'm gonna shut up now
Because 'm not like this usually
Usually,
well, here  go again
They reach the corner intersection
on Marty as he pauses again
He stares at Clara, confused at his strange loquacity
can't shut my mouth
'm on a jag, for Pete's sake
You'd think was loaded
Marty stares at Clara, absolutely aghast at his inability to stop talking
can't stop talking
Isn't this stupid
He stands there in the middle of the sidewalk with moving past, back and forth
Marty continues to stare at Clara, his broad face widened by a foolish, confused smile
Clara regards him affectionately
(with sudden sincerity) You gotta real nice face, you know
It's really a nice face
Thank you
They stroll along farther up the noisy, jangled, trafficked Saturday night avenue
Once a candy store, now a soda fountain where booths have been installed in the rear
One wall of the luncheonette in front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling
It is a nice clean joint, brightly lit
Several  are occupying three of the four booths
They sit opposite each other in the booth
Each has a cup of coffee
Marty is still talking, but now he is apparently telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words out
The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara
Her eyes are burning with suppressed laughter
Every now and then she has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her
so 'm inna kneeling position, and if you ever try shooting a inna kneeling position, you know what  mean
can't holda steady position
'm wavering back and forth
He has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure of giggles
Clara wipes her eyes and catches her breath
so the guy next to me, he's shooting from the prone position, and he's cross-eyed like  told you
He can't go on
He has to stop and cover his face with one hand
So just then
(stops to control himself again) so just then  hear five shots go off from the guy next to me
It's too much for him
He lets out a sudden guffaw and instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders
Clara hides her face in her hands and giggles desperately
Some of the other people turn to look at them
So my target goes down, and a minute later, the flag comes up
got five bulls-eyes
This cross-eyed guy next to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into my target
He stares at the girl, spent from laughter
so  said to the sergeant who was checking my score, "Pretty good, eh, Sarge
Five bulls-eyes
So this sergeant, he don't know what happened, he says, "Say, that's all right, Pilletti"
He closes his eyes, shakes his head
Oh, man
So that's what happened
That's how  got the reputation-a being the best shot inna whole battalion
oh, man
For a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter
They sit, shaking their heads, studying their fingers on the table in front of them
Then slowly, Marty begins to giggle again
It communicates itself to Clara
In a moment they are hiding their faces in their hands, their shoulders shivering with laughter
Angie
His eyes look slowly in every direction
disclosing Angie standing on the fringe of the dance floor, head arched high, looking at the crowded dance floor
He starts back to the archway toward the lounge, looking over his shoulder
Angie comes into the archway, throws one more glance over his shoulder at the dance floor, then turns and enters the
Angie walks down the length of the lounge, looking into the booths and simultaneously at the  moving back and forth in the lounge
At the far end of the lounge, he turns and comes back along the bar side, checking each face at the bar
There are three young  laying out their money for admission
One of them calls to Angie
Anything good in there, Mac
buncha dogs
He crosses to the Men's Room
'
Angie comes into a momentarily empty room
Angie goes the full length of the white tiled room, past the wash bowls, the long mirror, bending to look under the doors of the stalls
Suddenly he calls out
Hey, Marty
Hey, Marty, you in here
He waits for an answer
Marty and Clara still in the booth, but two more cups of coffee have been set down in front of each of them
There are also two pie-plates
Clara has left half of her pie
Also an empty pack of cigarettes, and another pack half- gone
They are both smoking
Marty is still talking, but the mood is no longer laughter
pensive, speculative hush has fallen over them
They have been talking for hours, and they have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in the paper napkins
When  got outta the army, Clara, was lost
didn't know what wanted to do
was twenny-five years old, what was  gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour thought maybe  go to college under the
Biller Rights, you know
But  wouldn't graduate till  was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if  made it in three years
And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and  had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing
And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week
So  just went to pieces used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings
My mother used to be so worried about me
My uncle Mario come over one time
He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift
He got his own cab, you know
And God forgive me for what 'm gonna say now, but used to thinka doing away with myself
used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what 'm going to say,  used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels
(deeply sympathetic) Yes,  know
'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin
Yes,  know
So then Mr
Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it
So that's what happened
didn't wanna be a butcher
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher
Well,  wouldn't call it an elegant profession
It's in a lower social scale
People look down on butchers
don't
Marty looks quickly up at her, then back down
Well, the point is Mr
Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter
Because she's always writing them to come out there
So it's a nice little shop
handle his books for him, so know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week
The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets
There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an & coming in, at least that's the rumor
Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much
mean, you gotta take that into account too
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty
That's true
do
But 'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars
That's a big note to carry, because  have to give Mr
Gazzara a mortgage, and what  have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than  can make onna salary
Clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive
She carefully assembles her words in her mind
Then she looks at the squat butcher across the table from her
Marty,  know you for three hours, but  know you're a good butcher
You're an intelligent, sensitive, decent man
have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another
And some of these kids, Marty, in my classes, they have so much warmth in them, so much capacity
And that's the feeling  get about you
Marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head
If you were one of my students, would say, "Go ahead and buy the butcher shop
You're a good butcher
" Clara pauses
(not quite trusting the timbre of his voice) Well, there's a lotta things  could do with this shop
could organize my own supermarket
Get a buncha neighborhood merchants together
That's what a lotta them are doing
He looks up at her now
Wadda you think
think anything you want to do, you'll do well
Tears begin to flood his eyes again
He quickly looks away
He licks his lips
(still looking down) 'm Catholic
Are you Catholic
Clara looks down at her hands
(also in a low voice) Yes,  am
Marty looks up at her
only got about three bucks on me now, but  just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue
Why don't we walk back to my house
'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere
really should get home
She twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the luncheonette
It's only a quarter of twelve
The clock's right over there
really should get home,  told my father
Well,  suppose a little while longer
wonder if there's any place around here  could put some makeup on
Marty considers this problem for a second, then leans out of the booth and calls out
Hey, Mac
to include the  of the luncheonette
He is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the Sunday Mirror
He looks up toward Marty
You gotta Ladies' Room around here
Inna back
(to Clara) Inna back
Clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of the booth, taking her purse with her
187TH
of Angie meandering down the street on which the neighborhood bar is located
It is near midnight, and the street is empty except for Angie and the  of his leather heels on the pavement
He comes to the bar, opens the door, enters
The  of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood
They are grouped along practically the whole bar
Three or four and a number of shirtsleeved , mostly in their late forties, early fifties
We know they're Irish, because one of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad
disclose the entrance to the bar in the background, showing Angie coming in, looking here and there
He starts toward the bar
, middle-aged, squat heavily on bar stools over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other
so she told me that the doctor told her that if she had any more babies, she would do so at the risk of her life
Angie shuffles in, pausing near the bar and standing behind the two Irish women
She was always a bit thin in the hips
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six
Every time saw the woman, she was either
Hey, Lou
going to the hospital or coming from it
She was hatching them out like eggs
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he
Well,  bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel
(loudly) Hey, Lou
to include Lou, the Bartender
(looking up from opening a batch of beer bottles) What
so  said to her, "Mary
(calling to the Bartender) Marty been in here the last coupla hours or so
"
Mary, for heaven's sakes, didn't you tell me that another one'll kill you
" ain't seen Marty all night
And her husband is a little bit of a man, isn't he
(calling to the Bartender, but even more to himself) Where is everybody
been walking around,  can't find anybody
Well, last week Tuesday, she gave birth to the baby in Saint Elizabeth's hospital
a big healthy boy of nine pounds
Oh, that's nice
So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he
Oh, no
She died right in the hospital
Oh, that's a sad story
And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves
That's the one
Oh, that's a sad story
Angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to the last lines of the story
Perturbed, he turns and leaves
With street  over the scene, Marty and Clara walk along through the intricate understructure of the elevated subway toward Webster Avenue
Marty and Clara walk slowly along a side street in Marty's neighborhood
The streets are almost empty; perhaps an occasional  on the other side of the street
The cars are parked bumper-to-bumper in lines along the curb
The five-story apartment buildings are mostly dark, an occasional window lit
Marty suddenly stops and bends down; his shoe lace has become untied
Clara sits back against the fender of the nearest car and continues talking
It's really a fine opportunity for me
But 'm not sure  want to be a department head
It's mostly executive and administrative work
Well, anyway,  told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and
(still concentrating on his shoelace) Why don't you just move out to Portchester
Well, that's what  was saying
My father is getting old
And we're very close
He's a wonderful man, really
She pauses as he straightens
He looks at her a moment
think you're kidding yourself, Clara
used to think about moving out, you know
And that's what used to say
"My mother needs me
" But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all
Actually, you need your father
You know what mean
You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life
'm afraid of being lonely
Oh, you won't be so lonely
You'll make friends right away
Actually,  don't make friends easily
What're you talking about
You're a real likeable person
You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three
You'll have people visiting you alla time
'll come visit you
'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or 'll call you up
And it's gonna be nice
Don't be so afraid
They have only gone a few paces farther when Marty's shoelace comes loose again
He fidgets self-consciously, bends down and begins to retie it
The  of Ralph, the well-dressed man, established previously, is heard
' (off-screen) Hey, Marty
Marty and Clara both look off
Ralph is leaning out the car window twisting to look back up the street
(yelling) Hey, Marty
Marty and Clara look around to find the source of the voice
Marty
Over here
Marty and Clara again look around trying to find Ralph
Marty spots him leaning out of the window of a '47 Chevy parked in the background
Hello, Ralph
(yelling) Hey, Marty, come over here a minute
Marty and Clara start walking toward the Chevy
Ralph and , a young woman in her early thirties, are seated in front
In the rear seat of the car,  is sandwiched in between a    and a (explaining to girls) You'll like this guy
This guy's a nice guy
Who's this
Marty
Yeah
(confirming Ralph's statement) Oh, this guy's a nice guy
Marty stops and excuses himself from Clara to walk slowly toward the Chevy
It's about five cars down from him
The camera pans with him
Ralph is leaning out of the window again, watching Marty approach
(approaching the car) Hello, Ralph, what's new
(looks through the back window, recognizes Leo) Hiya, Leo
Hiya, Marty
(indicates with his head that he wishes to hold a whispered conference with Marty) Hey, Marty, come here a minute
Marty leans with his elbow on the open front window of the car, his head bowed, waiting for Ralph to speak his piece
He studiously avoids looking at the girls in the car
(lowering his voice) Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel here, you interested
Marty allows his eyes to flicker quickly over the girl in the seat next to Ralph
Waddaya mean, Ralph
(turning his head toward the rear of the car and raising his voice) Hey, Louise,  want you to meet Marty Pilletti
Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there
Hiya
Louise, not an unattractive girl by any means, is a little surly at the moment
She merely nods at the introduction
What are we going to do, just sit around here all night
(addressing Marty's bowed head in a quick mutter) Listen, Marty, these three squirrels are nurses
We're all going over Leo's house later because there's nobody there
These are the squirrels told you about
Money inna bank, man
Wanna get inna car
She's a pretty nice-looking doll
'm with a girl, Ralph
Get ridda her
This is money inna bank
can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight
This is a good deal here, Marty
Marty straightens, looks surreptitiously back to the corner where Clara is standing
Clara stands alone on the corner
She is an angular, awkward, plain girl
Marty brings his attention back around to Ralph who is leaning out of the car window
(bending down to Ralph) can't do it, Ralph
Thanks anyway
(looks toward back seat) Very nice to have met you all
Come on, let's get outta here
Hey, Ralph, we might as well get going
Ralph bends forward and starts the car
'll see you, Leo
'll see you, Marty
Marty takes a step or two back from the car, and Ralph begins the business of wheeling the car from out of its parking place
The car backs and fills once or twice and eventually clears and whisks into the street
Marty stands looking after the departing car, then slowly turns and goes back up the sidewalk
He joins Clara and we
: , Marty and Clara come into the dark house
Nobody is home
Marty and Clara's silhouettes block the doorway momentarily
Wait a minute
Lemme find the light
He finds the lights
The kitchen is suddenly brightly lit
The two of them stand squinting to adjust to the sudden glare
guess my mother ain't home yet figure my cousin Thomas and Virginia musta gone to the movies, so they won't get back till one o'clock at least
Clara advances into the kitchen, a little ill at ease, and looks around
Marty closes the porch door
This is the kitchen
Yes,  know
Come on inna dining room
He turns the light on as he enters
Clara follows him into the
Siddown, take off your coat
You want something to eat
We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox
(alighting tentatively on the edge of a chair) No, thank you
don't think  should stay very long
Sure
Just take off your coat a minute
He helps her off with her coat
He remains behind her, looking down at her
Conscious of his scrutiny, she sits uncomfortably, breathing unevenly
Marty takes her coat into the dark living room
Clara is patient but nervous
Marty comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward silence
So  was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday
That was a very nice affair
And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth
never saw anything so grand in my life
(the silence again falls between them
) And watta meal
'm a butcher, so know a good hunka steak when  see one
That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck
buck eighty a pound
Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak
That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed
Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable
You're all tense
Oh, 'm fine
You want me to take you home, 'll take you home
Maybe that would be a good idea
She stands
He stands
He's a little angry
He turns and sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat
Wordlessly, he begins to help her into the coat
Standing behind her, he puts his hands on her shoulders, then suddenly seizes her, and begins kissing her on the neck
As Marty holds Clara, kissing the back of her neck, the dialogue drops to quick, hushed whispers
No, Marty, please
like you
like you
been telling you all night,  like you
Marty
just wanna kiss, that's all
He attempts to turn her face toward him
She resists
No
Please
No
Please
Marty
He releases her and turns away violently
All right
'll take you home
All right
He marches a few paces away, deeply disturbed
He turns back to her
All  wanted was a lousy kiss
What do you think,  was gonna try something serious with my mother coming home any minute
What am , a leper or something
He turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of hot tears threatening to fill his eyes
Clara is also on the verge of tears
(more to herself than to him) just didn't feel like it, that's all
Slowly, she moves to the archway leading to the living room
to include the living room where Marty sits on the couch with his hands in his lap, staring straight ahead
The room is dark except for the slanted light coming from the dining room
Clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him
He doesn't look at her
'm old enough to know better
Comes New Year's Eve, everybody starts arranging parties, 'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for
Let me getta packa cigarettes, and 'll take you home
He starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, looking straight ahead
Clara looks at him, her face peculiarly soft and compassionate
'd like to see you again
Very much
The reason  didn't let you kiss me was because  just didn't know how to handle the situation
You're the kindest man  ever met
The reason tell you this is because  want to see you again very much
know that when you take me home, 'm going to just lie on my bed and think about you
want very much to see you again
Marty stares down at his hands
(without looking over at her) Waddaya doing tomorrow night
Nothing
'll call you up tomorrow morning
Maybe, we'll go see a movie
'd like that very much
The reason  can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and may have to help out
'll wait for your call
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now
All right
She stands
'll just get a packa cigarettes
He rises and goes into his bedroom
to include door to bedroom
Marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts a pack of cigarettes
He comes back out and looks at Clara for the first time
They start to walk to the dining room
In the archway, Marty pauses and turns to her
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve
Nothing
They quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss
Slowly their faces part, and Marty's head sinks down upon her shoulder
He is crying, detectable from the slight shake of his shoulders
The girl presses her cheek against the back of his head
They stand
The  of the kitchen door opening splits them out of their embrace
moment later Mrs
Pilletti's voice is heard
' (off-screen) Hallo
Hallo
Marty
She comes into the dining room, stops at the sight of Marty and Clara
Hello, Marty, when you come home
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago
Ma,  want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder
She's graduate of New York University
She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School
This seems to impress Mrs
Pilletti
Siddown, siddown
You want some chicken
We got some chicken in the ice box
No, Mrs
Pilletti
We were just going home
Thank you very much anyway
Well, siddown a minute
just come inna house
'll take off my coat
Siddown a minute
Mrs
Pilletti pulls her coat off
How'd you come home, Ma
Thomas give you a ride
(nodding) Oh, it's a sad business
(turning to Clara) My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma
Oh, sure
(to Clara) Siddown, siddown
Marty, tell her siddown
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara
Clara smiles and sits
Mrs
Pilletti likewise seats herself, holding her coat in her lap
(to Marty) Did you offer the young lady some fruit
offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing
No, thank you, really, Mrs
Pilletti
(to Clara with a sigh) It's a very sad business,  tell you
woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home
Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch
It's a curse to be a mother,  tell you
Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do
What is a mother's life but her children
It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time
Hobby
What can she do
She cooks and she cleans
You gotta have a house to clean
You gotta have children to cook for
These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law
She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for
Mrs
Pilletti darts a quick, sharp look at Clara
Then she looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist nervously
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house
Well,  don't know the people, of course, but as a rule,  don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go
don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University
In real life, it don't work out that way
You wait till you are a mother
It's silly of me to argue about it
don't know the people involved
Ma, 'm gonna take her home now
It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour
(standing) Sure
(standing) It was very nice meeting you, Mrs
Pilletti
hope 'll see you again
Sure
Marty and Clara move toward the kitchen
All right, Ma
'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half
Sure
Goodnight, Mrs
Pilletti
Goodnight
Marty and Clara go out through the kitchen
on Mrs
Pilletti, who stands expressionlessly by her chair, staring after them
She remains there rigid even after the kitchen door has  and
The biggest intersection in the Bronx is near the Grand Concourse at Fordham Road, which is the biggest boulevard
Despite the hour, the sidewalks are crowded with
The is heavy with buses
We   Angie walking up Fordham Road just about to the Grand Concourse
As he reaches the northeast corner of the intersection and stands, waiting for the light to change, he looks off-screen
Something captures his attention, and he calls out
Hey
In front of Alexander's Department Store, the street is crowded, and a bus queue waits for the downtown Concourse bus
Marty and Clara are part of the queue
(starting toward Marty and Clara, shouting) Hey
Angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights to change
Impatiently, he has to wait until traffic stops for the light
(shouting as he goes) Hey, Marty
Hey
Marty and Clara still stand, seeming not to hear Angie
' (off-screen) Hey, Marty
Marty
Marty and Clara turn and stare off-screen
Angie pushes his way through the  on the sidewalk and manages to join Marty and Clara
Where you been, for Pete sakes been looking all over for you
looked for you, Angie, before cut out, but  couldn't find you
been looking all over for you
Angie is absolutely unaware of, or simply refuses to acknowledge the presence of the girl
He has pushed himself in between Marty and Clara, and addresses himself entirely to Marty
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking
Listen, Angie, want you to meet Clara
(he tries to turn the sullen Angie toward Clara) Clara, this is my best friend, Angie
told you about him
How do you do
Angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod
(completely ignoring Clara now) Waddaya gonna do now
'm gonna take Clara home
It's close to one
You want me to ride down with you
What for
It's early
It must be one o'clock
It's Saturday night
There's still plenty-a action around
Angie, by the time  get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty
By the time  get home, it's gonna be two o'clock
gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow
Angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend
He turns sharply and starts away from Marty and Clara
(as he goes) All right, 'll see you
(calling after him) Where you going
Angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into the other  on Fordham Road
(calling more loudly after him) 'll see you tomorrow after mass
He stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, then turns to Clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, " don't know what's the matter with him
" The long-awaited downtown bus  up to the corner, blocking our view of Marty and Clara
--
Marty and Clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors of an apartment house
Marty and Clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway
They move slowly
You got an elevator in this house
We just live one flight up
So 'll call you tomorrow
Okay
Clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway
Call me about two-thirty, because won't be home from my aunt's till about then
The doors of the  slide open, and a middle-aged comes out
They have obviously been having a heated exchange; but at the sight of Marty and the girl at the stairway, they become silent
They march across the lobby and out to the street in repressed silence
The door  behind them
Marty and Clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, and now they look at each other and smile
Okay, so 'll see you tomorrow night then
Okay
Marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street door
Marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is beginning to stir
He mosies away from the building along the sidewalk,  panning with him
He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he knew where he was going
176TH
of Marty marching along 176th Street
He quickly reaches the Grand Concourse
Here he pauses a moment, a little at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he needs the uptown bus
He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of the boulevard
Again, he seems to lose track of which direction is homeward
He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming
Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into the stiff stride as he approaches
The corner near the bus stop is deserted
Marty stops, leans against the pole of the bus stop sign
Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further
: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves back
The traffic moves by him
He stands in the wide street, then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises his arm and calls out
Taxi
Taxi
Hey, taxi
Taxi
Taxi
- of Marty standing in the street, crying
Taxi
Taxi
, ' Marty is in his trousers and -shirt
He whistles as he assembles his toilet articles for a shave
He starts out toward the living room, still whistling
Bright sunlight pours through the curtains on his window
Marty's whistling accompanies him to the second floor where he turns into the bathroom
to include Mrs
Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning
As Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs
Pilletti turns her head and stares off, listening
'
Catherine, in the living room, is packing her meager but neatly folded belongings into an old European carpet bag
She has regained her stiff, mordant crustiness
The mild of a baby can be heard
The crowded bedroom is furnished in white modern
It is cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items
Virginia sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it
She is half-dressed, wearing her pajama top, a half-slip, no stockings; her hair is still uncombed
Thomas slouches against a chest of drawers, in morning semi-deshabille
He is obviously sick with guilt
Virginia looks anxiously at her husband then to the baby in her arms
(heavy whisper) Don't you think  feel lousy about this too
All right, Ginnie
don't wanna talk anymore about it
(sits on a wooden chair, unrolls a fresh pair of socks he's been holding) don't think  got one hour's sleep the whole night
(raises one leg to put a sock on, pauses with his heel on the edge of his chair) Last night was the first time in my life  ever heard my mother cry, you know that
Tommy
(snapping) don't wanna talk about it
He pulls his sock on angrily, then lets his leg fall back to the floor and just sits, one sock on, one sock in his hand
He looks sullenly in the direction of his wife
(continuing, huffy) know what you're gonna say
man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later
How many times you gonna say it
She's my mother, you know
oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse
(in a furious whisper) Virginia,  don't wanna hear no more about it
He stands, then becomes aware he has to put on his other sock
He sits down again and pulls the second sock on
Virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth, but she forces it back
She rocks the baby a little
Tommy,  love you, and  know you feel lousy right now, but we're never gonna be happy unless we have a chance to work out our own lives
We can't keep talking in whispers like this the resta our lives
We gotta have some privacy
We
Thomas has risen, a slim, dark, unsettled young man in undershirt and trousers, holding his shoes in one hand
He starts toward the
Thomas strides down the little foyer
He turns and looks into the living room
He watches his mother packing strange brown parcels into her bag
(scowling) Can't you wait five minutes
'll drive you over inna car
just gotta put my shirt on, that's all
The old lady nods brusquely
Thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels sweeping into his hot eyes
Then he returns to his bedroom in his stocking-feet, carrying his shoes
Thomas comes in just as Virginia bends over the bassinet, having gotten the baby back to sleep
Thomas cries to her in a furious whisper
All right, get dressed, because we're gonna drive my mother over
Why couldn't you get along with her
Why couldn't you make just a little effort
She's a little hard to get along with
All right
All  asked you was try a little
He turns from her, sits down on the bed miserably angry with the world, his wife, his mother, himself
The baby begins to whimper again
Virginia turns wearily to her husband
Tommy
(roaring out) don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me
' ,
small procession consisting of Thomas carrying his mother's carpet bag, his mother carrying small paper-wrapped bundles, and Virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge
Thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow
They turn up the porch to the front door
Virginia remains in the small front yard
She is miserable
,
Mrs
Pilletti is dressed in hat and coat and all set to go to mass
She is bent over the dining room table piling the breakfast dishes and crumbing the table
She looks up as Thomas comes in carrying his mother's bag
Aunt Catherine is right behind him
Beyond the porch, we can see Virginia walking the baby around outside
Hello, Aunt Theresa
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel
(setting the bag down) Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy
hadda beg her to let me drive her over here
The martyr
She always gotta be the big martyr
Hey, will you go to mass, please
This one, he woke up this morning with salt in his nose
Do this
Do that
Will you leave me in peace, ah
burst of spirited song soars from upstairs
Mrs
Pilletti, Aunt Catherine and even Thomas pause to look up in the direction of the voice
/
Marty descends the stairs whistling
He carries his jacket over his arm
He makes some final adjustments to his tie
Alert to Marty's mood, Mrs
Pilletti, Aunt Catherine and Thomas stand, waiting for him to join them downstairs
(ebulliently) Hello, Aunt Catherine
How are you
Hello, Thomas
You going to mass with us
was at mass two hours ago
Well, make yourself at home
The refrigerator is loaded with food
Go upstairs, take any room you want
Thomas, you going to mass with us
(nods) Yeah, yeah, sure
He abruptly goes out into the living room and onto the front porch
(to Catherine) You wanna cuppa coffee
Marty has followed Thomas out into the living room
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas
Sure, great if you ain't married
Thomas goes out the door onto the porch
Marty stands in the open doorway
He looks out into the warm sunshine in the front yard
Hi, Virginia
He goes out into the yard to Virginia
He is as gay as a bird
He takes the baby from Virginia's arms, holds it high up above him
(to baby) Hey, little boy, you sure getting fat
You weigh more than a side-a beef now
(beams at the baby) Hey, Thomas, so  was telling you yesterday you was over my house -- Mr
Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa sell his shop, go out to California because his kids are all married, and he
Thomas hasn't been listening to Marty and crosses quickly to Virginia
Wadda you so sore about
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor
Marty comes up to them, holding the baby
So Thomas, he does about twelve, thirteen hundred gross
Rent's a hundred and two
The problem, of course, is the supermarkets
That's what  wanna ask you
If  get together with a coupla other merchants, make our own supermarket
Thomas has been trying to listen to Marty, but his thoughts are all with his own problem
He whirls on Virginia
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her
(with her own temper) Waddaya talking about
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen
told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted
You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time
She don't wanna use my pots and pans
So Tommy
Waddaya want me to do, go out and buy a whole new setta pots and pans
The baby in Marty's arms has started to cry a little
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because promised Mr
Gazzara 'd let him know tomorrow
See, what  wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate
On individual mark- ups
You know what  mean
Say 'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about
No,  don't know
That's why 'm asking you
The baby starts to cry again
Thomas turns to his wife
Take the baby, will you
Virginia hurries over and takes the crying baby from Marty's arms, walks around comforting the child
Thomas turns back to Marty
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me
You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities
Boy,  wish  was you, boy
Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop
What's he want
Five thousand down
You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month
mortgage anna note from the bank
For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities
Stay that way, boy
Take my advice
Well, you see, Thomas  figure the big problem is the supermarkets
But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade
The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat
Who buys Italian meat anymore
You think my wife buys Italian meat
(throws a baleful glance at his wife) She goes to the &, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy
Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy stuff your mother makes
Marty is a little taken aback by Thomas's frontal assault
Well,  understand the problem about the supermarkets, but  was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh
Sure
This girl said
What girl, what does she know
(he whirls on his wife again) Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while
Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine
(her temper flaring again) Your mother handles the kid like he was a yoyo
Marty stands, watching the young couple yakking at each other
The little baby starts to cry again
The two old sisters sit at the kitchen table, two untouched cups of coffee in front of them
Hey,  come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl
Who
Marty
Your son Marty
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl
Were the lights on
Oh sure
(frowns at her sister) This girl is a college graduate
They're the worst
College girls are one step from the streets
They smoke like men inna saloon
My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter
One step from the streets, tell you
Mrs
Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house
She seems like a nice girl
think he has a feeling for this girl
You heard him sing
He been singing like that all morning
Catherine nods bleakly
Well, that's all
You will see
Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man
'm tired-a running around
" Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house
Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town
nice little apartment
" don't sell this house,  tell you that
This is my husband's house had six children in this house
You will see
coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom
Wherever you are, the rain follows
Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday
Marty comes in from the living room, a little down after his session with Thomas and Virginia
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late
Sure
Marty goes to the sink to get himself a glass of water
He examines a piece of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling
Boy, this place is really coming to pieces
(turning to his mother) You know, Ma,  think we oughta sell this place
The whole joint's going to pieces
The plumbing is rusty
Everything
'm gonna have to replaster the whole ceiling now
You know what we oughta do
We oughta get one of those new apartments they're building down on Southern Boulevard
nicer parta town, you know
You all set, Ma
Mrs
Pilletti exchanges a brief frightened glance with her sister
'm all set
She sends another frightened look at her sister and follows Marty out into the living room
'
Marty, his mother, Thomas and Virginia with the baby file down the porch to the street on their way to church
Marty and his mother are both troubled
The anger has left both Thomas and Virginia, but they are both silent
At the far end of the alleyway, as they reach the street, Virginia puts her free arm through her husband's elbow
Thomas looks briefly at her and they exchange a look of commiseration
Everyone turns and disappears off into the street
,    of the church establishes that stage of Sunday morning between the nine and ten o'clock masses
People flock around the doors of the church
The parishioners are making their ways to the door
few silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty rows of pews
The large, almost empty church is filled now with organ
Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they stand at the doorway just inside the church, as the nine o'clock mass people flow out, and the first of the ten o'clock mass people file in
That was a nice girl last night, Marty
(Marty nods) She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl
(she pauses, Marty makes no reply) said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl
not very pretty
(still amiable) heard you, Ma
She looks a little old for you
About thirty-five, forty years old
She's twenty-nine, Ma
nearby kneeling penitent looks disapprovingly at Mrs
Pilletti and shushes her
The mother nods briefly
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty
That's what she tells you
What, Ma
She looks thirty-five, forty
She didn't look Italian to me
Marty frowns but remains silent
said, is she Italian girl
don't know
don't think so
It's Mrs
Pilletti's turn to frown
silence
She turns back to Marty
She don't look Italian to me
What kinda family she come from
There was something about her  didn't like
It seems funny, the first time you meet her, she comes to your empty house alone
These college girls, they all one step fromma streets
Marty turns, on the verge of anger with his mother
What are you talking about
She's a nice girl
She didn't look Italian to me
silence hangs between them
don't like her
You don't like her
You only met her for two minutes
Don't bring her to the house no more
What didn't you like about her
don't know
She don't look like Italian to me
Plenny a nice Italian girls around
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma
The kneeling woman shushes them again
By now the nine o'clock worshipers have filed out, and Marty joins the flow of ten o'clock people moving in
His mother turns back to him again
(stopping her before she gets started) What are you getting so worked up about
just met the girl last night
'm probably not gonna see her again
They continue down the aisle of the church
An hour later, the after-mass  is there
It's a little more crowded than weekdays
with a glass of beer in one hand, rocks a baby carriage with the other
Marty enters the bar, moves along, ad-libbing "Hello" to someone at the bar, gets the attention of Lou, the bartender
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet
He was here last night till about two o'clock
hear you really got stuck with a dog last night
(glancing quickly at him) Who told you that
Angie
He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing
She wasn't so bad
He turns away from the bar annoyed, notes Ralph, sitting alone in one of the booths, reading the Sunday comics
Marty ambles over to him
Hello, Ralph
How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph
(looking up) Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty
That one for you was a real lunatic
How'd you make out
The abruptness of the question rather startles Marty
It is not an expression he would normally associate with an evening with Clara
Oh,  hadda nice time
didn't try nothing
She's a nice girl
just met her last night, you know
just talked with her
didn't even try nothing
He feels very ill at ease and a little guilty for defending himself
Listen, you see Angie, tell him went home, 'll meet him after lunch
He moves back down the bar and goes out into the street
: ' , Marty is seated at the dining room table
He has removed his jacket, tie and shirt, even his shoes, and is making himself comfortable over a late Sunday lunch
With him are Angie and Joe, the Critic
Lounging in a chair but not at the table is Leo
so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll
So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer
" So she begins to con him, you know
She tells him how she loves him
And then Bam
He shoots her in the stomach
So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that
" And he says, "It was easy
" (without looking up from his magazine) Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write
Angie reaches over to Marty's plate and filches a piece of rissole, evidently annoying Marty
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen
We give you a plate-a your own
Oh,  couldn't eat nothing
My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws
This doesn't prevent him from filching a second piece of rissole
What  like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women
In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him
And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him
And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write
Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame
It must be after one o'clock by now
Marty looks down at his watch, then stands and starts for the phone, sitting on a chest of drawers at the other end of the room
Who you gonna call
was gonna call that girl from last night
Take her to a movie tonight
Are you kidding
Listen, Angie,  wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off
Now, why did you do that
You got me mad, that's why
Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture
Joe, having finished his dissertation on Mickey Spillane, is now studying another girlie magazine
He proffers an opened page to Marty, who stands over by the phone
Put that away, for Pete's sake
My mother's right out onna porch
wonder where they find those girls that pose for them pictures
Those are Hollywood starlets
Put it away, Joe
My mother'll come walking in
Joe closes the magazine
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight
don't feel like going, Angie thought 'd take this girl to a movie
Boy, you really musta made out good last night
We just talked
Boy, she musta been some talker
She musta been about fifty years old
always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old
never thoughta that
didn't think she was so bad-looking
She musta kept you inna shadows all night
Marty, you don't wanna hang around with dogs
It gives you a bad reputation
Let's go downa Seventy-Second Street
told this dog  was gonna call her today about two-thirty
(angry) Brush her
Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog
Waddaya getting so sore about
looked all over for you last night, you know that
He turns away sulking
Marty doesn't pick up the phone but returns to his seat, upset
Another book that  read by Mickey Spillane,  can't remember the name of it, but it was about this red- headed tramp he finds inna street, and he gives her some dough, because he's sorry for her
Wait a minute, think that's the same book  was telling you about before
(to Angie) You didn't like her at all
nothing
real nothing
Marty lowers his head
Over this, Joe's   on
' (off-screen) You know something
on Marty looking down, as Joe's continues
' (off-screen) can't tell one-a those Mickey Spillane books from the other, but he's a real good writer, though
: television screen
Ed Sullivan is on, indicating the time is a little after half past seven , disclosing Clara, Mr
and Mrs
Snyder in their living room
Apparently the Sullivan show is very funny at the moment, for the television audience roars with laughter
Clara
Another  of from the television that Clara watches, although her eyes are flooded with tears, several of which have already traced wet paths down her cheeks
Another  of laughter
: ,
Marty, Mrs
Pilletti and Catherine are eating silently at the table
Catherine reads an Italian newspaper as she eats
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty
don't know, Ma
'm all knocked out
think 'll just hang arounna house and watch
Suddenly he pauses, sharply aware of the repetition in his life
Mrs
Pilletti is also aware of it
Maybe, 'll go out and see what Angie and the boys are doing
They eat silently a moment
187TH
- of Marty leaning against the wall in front of the bar
group of young men lounge about, killing time
Angie, Leo and Joe are among them
There are perhaps four or five other young , loosely divided into two groups
The group that concerns us has Marty and the others mentioned and , a young man in a sport jacket
What time is it
About eight o'clock
(to George) You don't feel like going downna Seventy-Second Street
It'll take an hour anna hour back, and the whole evening's gone
What's playing on Fordham Road think there's a good picture in the Loew's Paradise
You guys feel like working up a game- a cards
Come on, let's go down Seventy-Second Street, walk around
We're sure to wind up with something
- of Marty, his head down, his eyes closed
The group continues their dialogue back and forth
Their  can be heard as Marty's head slowly comes up
' (off-screen) 'll never forgive LaGuardia for cutting out burlesque outta New York City
' (off-screen) There's a burlesque in Union City
Let's go over to Union City
' (off-screen) Yeah, you're the one who don't even wanna take a ride onna subway for half an hour
Now, you wanna go alla way over to Union City
' (off-screen) feel like playing cards
saw Richie Rizzo, that's what he said he felt like doing
' (off-screen) don't feel like playing cards
Waddaya feel like doing tonight, Angie
' (off-screen) don't know
Wadda you feel like doing
' (off-screen) don't know, Angie
Wadda you feel like doing
fury rises in Marty's face
He cries out at them
"What are you doing tonight
"
" don't know, what are you doing
"
over to the others who, at this outburst, stare at Marty astounded
(continuing) The burlesque
Loew's Paradise
Miserable and lonely
Miserable and lonely and stupid
What am , crazy or something
got something good here
What am  hanging around with you guys for
He has said this in tones so loud that it attracts the attention of the few  on the street
little embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens the door to the bar, and goes into it
After a stunned moment, Angie hurries after him
Marty marches the length of the room toward the phone booths in the rear
to disclose Angie right behind him
Marty is about to enter one of the phone booths, but he stops as Angie hurries up to him
Watsa matter with you
Marty pauses, one foot in the booth
You don't like her
My mother don't like her
She's a dog, and 'm a fat, ugly little man
All  know is hadda good time last night
'm gonna have a good time tonight
If we have enough good times together, 'm gonna go down on my knees and beg that girl to marry me
If we make a party again this New Year's, gotta date for the party
You don't like her, that's too bad
Marty has been fishing in his pocket for his address book
He opens it to its proper page and steps decisively into the phone booth
Nearby, Angie prowls around outside the booth
The booth door is open
Marty starts to dial
hush fills the room except for the  of the telephone dial
The look of fury has drained from Marty's face
He holds the receiver to his ear, glances out toward Angie to include Angie
(his old amiable self) When you gonna get married, Angie
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
You're thirty-three years old
All your kid brothers are married
You oughta be ashamed of yourself
Still smiling at his very private joke, Marty returns to the phone, and after a fraction of a second
Hello
Clara
As Angie looks miserable, and Marty slowly reaches out and pushes the phone booth door shut, and continues to talk into the phone, we very slowly
