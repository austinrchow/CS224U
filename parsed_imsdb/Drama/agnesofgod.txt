: -  - The nuns walking around the courtyard in an anticlockwise direction saying the rosary
: -  - line of nuns kneeling at prayer
Closeups of various individuals
: -  - single shot of the building
-   - is locking up for the night, shutting doors, turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor
Suddenly a terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman
-  - Lights in the windows flick on
-   - The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps, calling    urgently in French
They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room and try    the door
It is blocked
Pushing harder they see the blood stained    figure of
Much alarm and crying
Agnes
Agnes
-  - An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring
It cuts the siren and stops outside the convent gates
The nuns open the gate and the ambulance drives inside
-   - Two  urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the unconscious figure of Sister Agnes
The Mother Superior desperately wipes and kisses her face
'm just going to put something here to stop the bleeding
Excuse me Sister
She'll be fine
They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall
The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into
-  '  - She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and starts to pull them out
Then she freezes, makes the sign of the cross and starts to weep
: -  - An aerial shot of the great cross of Montreal
Superimposed over this are the words ", "
: -   - normal busy day
car pulls up with a woman and a man driving
The woman is
She kisses the man (), gets out of the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of the courthouse
There a group of  there and a sudden bustle of interest
Here they are now
Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and their  come out of the court escorted by police
The reporters leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and French
Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is quickly bustled past
Martha goes on into the courthouse
- '  - Inside , , and   are sitting
Martha is standing by the window smoking furiously
Martha, it's you
What about Roger
He's free
They want a woman
All you have to do is meet with her once or twice
then tell the court she's insane
Are you dictating my position to me
We're getting into some sticky legal territories here
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown
least of all me
Eve, she strangled a baby
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison
We're not telling you what to decide Martha
We're not even telling you to take this
Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it
Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns
Today's my birthday
always make bad decisions on my birthday
The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle
The Judge throws the file down on his desk towards her
Happy birthday
15    - '  - Martha unlocks the door and comes in
She plays her answerphone and moves over to her cat
Hi, Kitty
The answerphone whirs
(
) Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow, okay
Bye bye
Some whirs and clicks
(
) Hi Martha,    it's Roger
Can you call me at the    hospital
'd like your opinion on a case
Oh, bye the way, happy birthday
Bye
(
) Hi, Marty it's Helen again
cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother
Bye bye
(in French) Martha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on the front
: 16    -  - Martha pulls up in her  outside the convent walls and gets out, cigarette in hand
sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites Soeurs de Marie Madeleine"
Martha jangles a bell
After a wait she presses a buzzer
peephole in the door slams open and Sister Marguerite looks out
Bonjour, 'm Doctor Martha Livingston,
The peephole slams shut, but the door does open
Sister Marguerite glares at her
(Cont
) Hello
'm Doctor Martha Living
ston
Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the trouble and hastily     grinds it underfoot
(Cont
) Excuse me
'm
Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt
Martha awkwardly tries to kick it away
(Cont
) the court-appointed psychiatrist
Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and motions for her to    come in
(Cont
) Thank you
um
believe your Mother Superior's expecting me
Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent
17    -   - Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room
Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously
Then the   arrives from behind the grilled door, sees Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight start
(beaming at her own little joke) Doctor Livingston  presume
'm Mother Miriam Ruth
You needn't call Mother if you don't wish
(shaking hands) Most people find it uncomfortable
Well
(carrying right on) 'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age
Yes
You can call me Sister
Thank you
You must have tons of questions
You may smoke if you want to
Just don't tell any of the Sisters
Martha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches
(Cont
) They wouldn't understand, especially Sister Marguerite
She'd scare the pants off Queen Elizabeth
(she lights Martha's cigarette) Besides,  miss them
You were a smoker
Two packs a day
can beat that
Unfiltered
Martha inclines her head impressed
Mother Miriam sits down next to her
(Cont
) Well, you have questions
(checks her watch) Fire away
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy
No-one
How did she hide it from the other nuns
She undressed alone
she bathed alone
Is that normal
Yes
How did she hide it during the day
(indicating her habit) She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time
We're examined once a year
Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits
Who was the father
haven't a clue
What man had access to her
None as far as  know
Was there a priest
Yes, but
What's his name
Father Martineau, but  don't see him as a candidate
Could there have been anyone else
(a pause) Obviously there was
And you didn't try to find out who
(standing) Believe me, 've done everything possible short of asking Agnes
Why haven't you asked her
Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and brings it back to use as an ashtray
(sitting again) She can't even remember the birth
Do you think she'd admit to the conception
Look, someone gave her the baby
Yes, but that was some    ten months ago
fail to see that the    identity of that somebody has anything    to do with this trial
Why do you think that
Don't ask me those questions dear, 'm not the patient
Well 'm the doctor
'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here
Look doctor,  don't know how to tell you this politely, but  don't approve of you
Not you personally
The science of psychiatry
(standing) Exactly
want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible
She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination
(also standing) am not with the Inquisition
And  am not from the Middle Ages know what you are
don't want that mind cut open
Then Mother Miriam walks out
18    -   - little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking enters and indicates that Martha should follow her
They exit out of the grilled room and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs
Faintly the voice of a single young woman can be heard singing in Latin
19      -   - Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing
They stop outside Agnes' room
Martha looks to see
20      - '  - Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily, looking out the window
Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly
She turns to see Martha standing in the doorway
Hello
'm Doctor Livingston
've been asked to talk to you
May
Yes
Martha moves further in the room
An   hovers outside the door
You have a lovely voice
No  don't
just heard you
That wasn't me
Was it Sister Marguerite
Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old nun
(Cont
) You're very pretty Agnes
No 'm not
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before
Let's talk about something else
What would you like to talk about
don't know
Anything
may  sit down
Yes
They both sit
First thing that comes to your mind
God
But there's nothing to say about God
Second thing that comes to your mind
Love
Have you ever loved anyone
Yes
Who
Everyone
Well, who in particular
Right now
Uh huh
love you
(a pause) Agnes, have you ever loved another man
other than, Jesus Christ
Yes
Who
(chuckles) Oh, there are so many
Well do you love
do you love Father Martineau
Oh, yes
Do you think he loves you
Oh,  know he does
He's told you
No
But
when  look into his eyes, can tell
You've been alone together
Yes
Often
At least once a week
And you like that
Oh, yes
Where do you meet
(obviously) In the confessional
slightly awkward pause
Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside the
Agnes suddenly looks exasperated
You want to talk about the baby don't you
Would you like to talk about it
never saw any baby
think they made it up
Why should they
don't know
Do you remember the night they said it came
No
was sick
How were you sick
Something  ate
Did it hurt
Yes
Where
Down
there
And what did you do
went to my room
And what happened
got sicker
And then what
fell asleep
In the middle of all the pain
Yes
Where did the baby come from
What baby
The baby they made up
From their heads
Is that where they say it came from
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket
Where'd it come from before that
From God
After God
before the waste-paper basket
don't understand
Agnes, how are babies born
Don't you know
Yes  do,    but  want you to
(very agitated) don't understand what you're talking about
you want to talk about the baby
everybody wants to talk about    the baby but never saw the    baby so  can't talk about the baby    because
don't believe in the    baby
Then let's talk about something else
(standing) No
no, 'm tired of talking, 've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when  tell them anything
nobody listens to me
(also standing) Agnes
(opens the door) No
no,  don't want to answer any more questions
Would you like to ask them
(pausing in the doorway) What do you mean
Just that
you ask and 'll answer
Anything
(smiles) Anything
21    - '  - The elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where Martha and Agnes are walking, then pulls the curtain across
22    -  - Martha and Agnes are walking together
Martha is smoking
What's your real name
Martha Louise Livingston
Are you married
No
Would you like to be
Not at the moment, no
Do you have any children
No
Would you like some
can't have them any more
Why not
(a pause) 've stopped menstruating Why do you smoke
Does it bother you
No questions
Smoking is an    obsession with me
Maybe one day    'll become obsessed with something    else, then 'll stop smoking
Do    you have any more questions
One
What
They both halt
Where do you think babies come from
From their mothers and fathers of course
Before that,
don't know
Well  think they come from
angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear
That makes good babies start to grow
And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there
don't know where good babies come out
And you can't tell the difference
except bad babies cry a lot
and they make their fathers go away
and their mothers get very ill
die sometimes
Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her
(Cont
) Mummy wasn't very happy when she died and,  think she went to hell because every time  see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot shower, and
'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who tells me things
They fight over me all the time
(staring into space) The Lady
saw when  was ten
was lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and the sun became a cloud, and the cloud became, a Lady
And she told me she would talk to me
And then
her feet began to bleed and  saw there
there were holes in her hands and in her side
And  tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them
And she tells me things like, like
right now she's crying Marie
Marie
but  don't know what that means
Martha stands up, disturbed
Agnes is slightly delirious with happiness
(Cont
) and
she uses me to sing, it's as if she's throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up, and
can't move because Mommy's holding my feet and all  can do is sing in her voice
it's the Lady's voice, God loves you
And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the bell tower
(Cont
) (to Martha) God loves you
Do you know a Marie
No
do you
Why should
don't know
23    -  '  - Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha enters
Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good humour
Well
what do you think
Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre
or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar
What's your opinion
believe Agnes is different
From other nuns
(laughs) Yes
've noticed
From other people
(moving across the room) believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth
Because she's an innocent
She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God
(lights a cigarette) That's ridiculous
(moves to her desk, starts writing) In her case it isn't
She's had very little schooling
Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us
She's never been out there Doctor
She's never seen a movie or a television show
She's never even read a book
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child
She didn't
This is manslaughter, not murder
She didn't consciously kill that baby
She'd lost a lot of blood
She was unconscious by the time we got to her
So, someone else could have done it
No
not in the eyes of the police
And in your eyes
've already told you what  thought
That she was unconscious, yes
So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
You don't really believe something like that happened do you
It's possible isn't it
Who
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and
and wanted to avoid a scandal
Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and bangs it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray
That's absurd
That possibility never occurred to you
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy
No-one
Not even Agnes
24    -  - Martha's car exits out of the convent and heads up the road
25    -  - The car radio is playing light band music
(
) You have been listening to Mostly Music from Montreal
This is  Radio
(and again in French) Martha flicks the radio off and stops the car
She thinks for moment then
26    -   - she turns the car around and heads back in the direction she came
27    -  - Martha drives in through an entrance and pulls up outside the presbytery
28    -  - From inside the house, Martha can be seen knocking on the glass fronted door
Presently a huge, fat  answers
Is Father Martineau in please
(in French) (answers in French) The housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back inside
(halting briefly) Wipe your feet
They move into the next room
The housekeeper goes further calling
Pere Martineau
(in French) Martha stands uncertainly at the doorway
The sound of thumping is heard, and then the figure of a very old priest, appears walking with a stick
29    -    - Father Martineau and Martha are having tea
He pours a slug of whisky from a   flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his own
(French accent) They arise at five in the morning
and they're in bed by nine at night
Even if a man could get to them, he would probably find them praying
That's why  see that the real question is not only how he got in, but when
And you're the only man to see them
promise you Doctor, even if  had the inclination, how could  possibly catch her
She would have to be a very slow and patient nun
(they both laugh) Ah no
they're a very special and rare people those Sisters
Only a few of them left in this modern world, consecrated to the praise of God
30    -  ,  - An elderly  is sitting watching "Spiderman" on cackling with laughter
She is physically alright, but quite senile
Martha enters, goes over to her and kisses her
Hello, Mama (pulls up a chair) brought you something
Shut up, 'm trying to watch this
It's your favourite
Who are you
It's Martha, Mama
(hands over a tub of icecream) There you go
Marie brings me icecream too you know
Chocolate
my favourite
thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite
Not any more
now  like chocolate
(stroking her hair) Did you have a good week Mama
Are they treating you all right
You know Martha never comes to see me
You watch it, she's going straight to hell
after all the things she said to me
Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman
has an abortion knew that one wouldn't work out
Not like you Marie
You got married to God
(lighting up) Marie's dead Mama
remember when you    was a little girl Marie
You come back    from the movies and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so sad
and 'd tell    you they had all the happy endings locked    away in a vault in Hollywood
(chuckles) And you believed me
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me
(a long pause) Who are you
'm Martha, Mama
31    - ,  - It is raining
distant thunder in the background
Martha is standing under an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the chickens
The convent was built for over fifty
Not many of us left
just us and the chickens
How do you survive
Oh, we own the land around here
But we rent it out
We keep a few acres for ourselves, (indicating) some wheat, corn, some vegetables
Well that's a lot of land
You must have help
Do you have field hands that help you
No
We work the land alone
No-one but Sister Marguerite and  are permitted contact with the public
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room
Sister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the convent
Oh that one there, in the corner
The one up on the third floor
Yes
Uh huh
32    - '   - Mother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for Martha
They both      enter the room which is totally plain, stripped of everything
This convent is locked solid
The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too
Maybe Agnes went to him
Oh come on, you've talked to her
She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made
When did you first learn about her
innocence, the way she thinks
Shortly after she came to us
And you weren't shocked
was appalled, just as you are now
And what happened
She stopped eating completely
33    -  - In flashback:   Agnes, all in white is lying face down in the sign of the cross in front of the altar
Mother Miriam enters
(
) This was before her pregnancy
(
) About two years before
Mother Miriam stops in front of Agnes
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating
Why is this
(not looking up) 've been commanded by God
(sighs) He talked to you Himself
No
Through someone else
Yes
Who
can't say
Why
She'd punish me
One of the other Sisters
No
Who
Mother Miriam glances up at an older  who has been in the chapel watching all along
She takes the hint and hobbles out
(Cont
) Why would she tell you to do this
Agnes look at me
(looking up) Because 'm getting fat
Oh, for Heaven's sake
am, there's too much flesh on me
Agnes
'm a blimp
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not
Because
You needn't worry about being attractive here
do,  have to be attractive to God
He loves you the way you are
No he doesn't
He hates fat people
Who told you this
It's a sin to be fat
Why
Look at the statues, they're thin
Agnes
That's because they're suffering
suffering is beautiful,  want to be beautiful
Who tells you these things
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children,  want to suffer like a little child
(genuinely distressed) That's not what he meant
am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon won't    be able to fit in,
won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where
Agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts
No
mean
mean look at these
've got to lose weight, 'm a blimp
Oh my dear child
(standing) God blew up the Hindenburg
He'll blow me up, that's what she said
Who
Mommy 'll get bigger and bigger every day and then 'll pop but
but if  stay little it won't happen
Your mother tells you this
Agnes your mother is dead
But she watches
she listens
Nonsense, 'm your mother now and want you to eat
'm not hungry
You've got to eat something Agnes
No  don't
the host is enough
My dear,  don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything
Of God
(smiles) Yes, of God
Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes' white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto the floor
She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with shock; there is a bleeding hole in the middle of her palm
'm being punished
Why
don't know
Dear Jesus
She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel
It started this morning and  can't get it to stop
34    - '   - Back in the present, as before
Why didn't you take her to a doctor
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
She had a
a hole in the palm of her hand
She could have bled to death
But she didn't
did she
If anyone had seen what 'd seen she'd be public property
newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule
She doesn't deserve that
She has it now
know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple
Not simple, no
saw it
Clean through the palm of her hand
Do you think hysteria could do that
It's being doing it for centuries
She's not unique, she's just another victim
God's victim
That's her innocence
She belongs to God
And  intend to take her away from Him
That's what you're afraid of isn't it
Martha walks out
Mother Miriam yanks the padlock out of the door
You bet  am
35       -  - All the Sisters are present
Mother Miriam leads the chant in Latin and the   rest of the nuns respond at intervals
Agnes is very happy
Their singing continues over, until the end of scene 41
: 36       -   - Martha and Larry are at the top of steps
He hands her an envelope
Here you are
Don't let anyone know where you got them
(kissing him) Thanks
: 37    -  - Agnes is happily swinging on a long swing attached to a tree
: 38    -  - The Sisters go about their tasks
Then all together they move to a corner of the room which is laid out with burning candles and make their devotions
: 39    -  - Agnes is confessing to a rather disinterested Father Martineau
Last Tuesday,  didn't eat all of my lima beans
hid them under my spoon
Yes
(very quietly) thought
thoughts
about
Speak up,  can hardly hear you
(very loudly) thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite
: 40    - '  - Martha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of the sheets and the waste-paper basket
She puts the photos aside and puffs thoughtfully on a cigarette
: 41    -   - Agnes is milking the cow
She pours the milk into a large churn
(The singing finishes at this point)
42    - '  - The same four are in a meeting
This time they are all sitting except for Lyon who is standing by the window
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here
Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to heal and play detective
Who do you think you are
know my job
Don't tell me my job Lyon
My duty as a doctor is to
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law
No
no, excuse me Eve
As quickly as see fit
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us
Why
The bishop is breathing down our necks
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be
(in French) don't believe this
don't bloody believe this
Well the bishop will be very upset about this
'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop
43    -   - It is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very simple
Martha is standing
Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked with the name "Soeur Marie Paul" and the dates she was born, consecrated and died
Agnes places some winter flowers on the grave
You liked Sister Paul
She was kind to me
She told me was beautiful
(crouching down) What else did she tell you
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could
liked that
Agnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start to move off
(Cont
) She lived here for almost seventy years
Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God
She took me to my secret place
Where's that
promise  won't tell, would you take me
So Agnes takes her
44    -   - Martha and Agnes enter the bell-tower
Agnes leads the way up the steep wooden steps
Martha becomes breathless almost immediately
Sister Paul was in her eighties
Did she climb up here often
No, only when she felt like it
She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
(halting, out of breath) No wonder
wait
Agnes
Agnes how do you feel about babies
Oh, they frighten me, 'm afraid 'll drop them
They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid
was dropped on my head, that's why  don't understand things
Like what
(climbing again) Numbers
you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
(following her) don't understand them either
Do you suppose  was dropped on my head
hope not
It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
Oh, 've got to give up smoking
Agnes wait a minute
Agnes slow down
45    -    - Agnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform
She said you could see the whole world from up here
But it looks much better far away than it looks close up
Martha arrives exhausted
Beautiful
Agnes lies down under the bell
And sometimes  get under here
it makes a wonderful sound
She starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings in the bell
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there
Oh, it's even more wonderful then
Agnes sings a little more
It's like hiding from my mother when was a little girl
Where did you go
Oh, no place as wonderful as this
Agnes
have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else
No
There is nothing else
Just being here at night helps me sleep
You have trouble sleeping
get headaches
Mommy did too
oh, but she wasn't stupid
She knew things that nobody else knew
What things
She knew what was going to happen to me
That's why she hid me away
How did she know that
Somebody told her
Who
don't know
Agnes
You'll laugh
promise  won't laugh
Who told her
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches
Did your mother see angels often
No
Do you
No
Do you believe she really saw them
(sitting up) No, but  can never tell her that
Why not
(no answer) Mmm
She'd get angry
Martha moves round close to Agnes
Agnes, did you love your mother
Yes
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself
could never be a mother
Why not
Well  don't think 'm old enough and besides  don't want to have a baby
Why not
Because  don't want one
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one
From someone who didn't want to have a baby
Like you
(suddenly frustrated) No, not like me
How would that person get one if they didn't want one
(jumping to her feet) mistake
Agnes, how did your mother get you
mistake
it was a mistake
Is that what she said
(very upset) If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint
(distorted) Agnes,  don't believe you know nothing about sex
can't help it if 'm stupid
that you don't remember getting pregnant
Not my fault
and that you don't believe you carried a child
was a mistake
What the child
Everything
don't have children
Agnes
Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away
Don't touch me like that
You don't touch me like that,  know what you want from me, you want to take God away
You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you
Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor
Martha throws her cigarette away
46    -  - Mother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes
She sees Martha coming across   the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away
You hate us don't you
What
Nuns
you hate nuns
hate ignorance and stupidity
The Catholic Church
haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church
Catholicism is not on trial here want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else
How dare you tell me to run my affairs
Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows her
It's my affair too
How dare you think 'm in a position to be pressured
'm only interested
or bullied or what ever you're doing
Who    the hell do you think you are
You go    around here expecting applause for the    way you treated this child
Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs
They pause briefly
She is not a child
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God
(Mother Miriams walks on) and aren't any worse off than you Mother
People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody
And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy
She has a right to know that
But you and your
your order and your Church have kept her ignorant
They reach Mother Miriam's study
(distorted) (distorted) virginity, right Mother
Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by
am not a virgin, Doctor
was married for twenty three years, two daughters
even have grandchildren
surprised
It might please you to know that  was a failure as a wife and mother
My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge
think they tell their friends that 've passed on
And don't tell me 'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud
(she sits) Then help her
am
No, you're shielding her
Let her face the world
What good would it do
No matter what you decide it's either the
the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin
There's another choice
What
Aquittal
How
Innocence
Legal innocence
know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court
long pause
The tension between them dissolves
All right, what do you need
Answers
Martha holds her hand
47    -  '  - Same place, but a little later
Martha is smoking
When would Agnes have conceived the child
Oh, some time in January
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time
Earthquakes
Visitors to the convent
Nothing
Do you have a
a diary or a day book
Yes
Take at look at it
Mother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book
There's nothing here
Was the child full term
(reads through the book) Oh, Dear God
What is it
The sheets
What sheets
Oh, Dear God,  should have guessed
48    -    - In flashback: the sisters are sitting around the table at dinner
, the other novice is serving them
Mother Miriam folds up a linen    towel
(
) should have suspected something
In flashback, Mother Miriam addresses Agnes
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister
Is that true
Yes Mother
Why
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins
Sister Marguerite gives a snort of derision
Mother Miriam glances sharply at her, then turns back to Agnes
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister
It made them holy
It made them uncomfortable
And if they didn't sleep well 'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules
Sister where are your sheets
(no answer) Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin
No
Then tell me
Where are your sheets
burnt them
Why
(a long pause) They were stained
How many times have  burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of
Yes, Mother
Say it
and It is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of
Mean it
The two girls start to repeat it but Agnes starts to cry and Genevieve falters into silence
Mother Miriam goes on more kindly
few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children
Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility
It's not that
it's not that
What do you mean
It's not my time of month
Should you see a doctor
don't know
don't know what happened Mother,  woke up
there was blood on the sheets, but  don't know what happened
(starts to weep) don't know what  did wrong,  don't know and  should be punished
For what
don't know
don't know
(
) That was the beginning, the night of the conception
That's why she burnt the sheets
49    -  - Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where lies dying
Father Martineau is there and many of the other nuns singing hymns
(
) When was that
(
) The twenty third of January
On that night one of our elder nuns passed away
(
) Sister Paul
(
) Yes
don't remember where Agnes was
was needed in the sick room
Father Martineau annoints the old woman
Then Agnes quietly slips in   unobserved
Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say a single silent word to her
The smile slips from Agnes' face
Then Sister Paul lies back and dies
50    -  - Martha and the  are walking through the church talking
He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner
(beginning missed) No
Well you're probably right about that
It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time
Why do you call it an investigation
never have
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her
What does this have to do with
And you had a sister who died in the convent
Who told you this
Do you still go to church
What business is it of yours
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
Look, Father, ah
just because don't subscribe to the
to the beliefs you subscribe to
(halting) But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor
But it does make all the difference to Agnes
don't understand
Are you expecting me to
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor
You've got to be merciful and quick
Excuse me
Martha stares at him as he walks away
51    -  - single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower
The bell is ringing
52    -  - Mother Miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a considerable effort
53    -   - Agnes has a wheelbarrow full of straw and manure
She dumps it on a pile
54    -  - Martha is watching Agnes milking a cow
Agnes, 'm here because  want to help you
'm not sick
But you're troubled
aren't you
That's because you keep reminding me
If you go away then 'll forget
And you're unhappy
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you
Agnes
Answer me
You never answer me
Sometimes, yes
Only you think    you're lucky because you didn't have    a mother who said things to you and did    things to you that maybe weren't always    nice but that was because of me, because     was bad, not her
Agnes carries the milk pail round to the churn
What did you do
'm always bad
What did you do
breathed
Agnes falls to her knees
Martha moves round and kneels in front of her
Agnes
What did your mother do to you
(no answer) If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no
Did
did she hit you
(Anges shakes her head: no) Did she make you do something you didn't want to
(yes) Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it
(yes) Did it embarrass you
(yes) Did it
did it hurt you
(yes) What did she make you you do
No
You can tell me
can't
She's dead isn't she
Yes
She can't hurt you any more
She can
How
She watches
she listens
Agnes,  don't believe that
Tell me
'll protect you from her
She
Yes
makes me
Yes
take off my clothes and then
she makes fun of me
She tells you you're ugly
Yes
And that you're stupid
Yes
That you're a mistake
She says my whole body's a mistake
Why
Because she says if  don't watch out 'll have a baby
How does she know that
Her headaches
Oh, yes
And then
What
She touches me down there with a cigarette
(Martha gasps) Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more
'll be good,  won't be a baby any more
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes  want you to do something
want you to pretend that 'm your mother
Oh yes, only this time want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright
'm afraid
Please
want to help you
Let me help you
Alright
Agnes, you're ugly
what do you say
Of course you do
Agnes, you're ugly
what do you say
No 'm not
Are you pretty
Yes
Agnes, you're stupid
No 'm not
Are you intelligent
(more forcefully) Yes  am
You're a mistake
(shouting) 'm not mistake, 'm here aren't
How can  be a mistake if 'm really here
God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake
Agnes is half shouting , half crying
Martha holds on to her
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, love you
Do you really love me or are you just saying that
really love you
As much as Mother Miriam does
As much as God loves you
55    - '   - Martha is in there by herself smoking
The elderly nun appears at the door
've been watching
We were fine 'till she came
She brought the devil here
(makes the sign of the cross) There was blood on her hand that night
Agnes
(the nun shakes her head) Who
Mother Superior
(in French) What
Look into the convent records
Sister
But the nun has gone, walking quickly away down the corridor
56    -   - Sister (
) enters to find Martha going through a cabinet
(slightly guiltily) Oh, Good afternoon Sister,
'm looking for some biographical data on Sister Agnes, and Mother said might find it here
The Sister smiles, goes to another cabinet, extracts a file and hands it to her
Thank you
The Sister nods and without a word leaves the room
Martha waits until she has gone, then opens the cabinet and pulls out another file
Glancing at the    door, she compares the two files
They both have the same surname Burchetti
The the door opens and Mother Miriam is standing there
You lied to me About what
(brandishing the files) Your niece
didn't tell you because  didn't think it was important
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it
never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent
My sister ran away from home
We lost touch with her
And when my husband died and  came here, she wrote to me and asked me if would take care of Agnes in case anything happened
And Agnes' father
Mother Miriam turns out of the room
Martha goes after her
It could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me
57    -  - Continuing, just outside the record room
(Cont
) She was afraid that Agnes would follow in her footsteps
She did everything she could to prevent it
Like keeping her home from school
Yes
Listening to angels
She drank too much
That's what killed her
Do you know what she did to her
don't think  care to know
She molested her
Oh, dear God
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there
Lots of dirty little secrets
(crying) Oh God, if only 'd known
Why didn't you
You knew she was keeping her home from school
You knew she was an alcoholic
knew that after the fact
Why didn't you do anything to stop her
Because  didn't know
(she leaves) Oh, God
: 58    -  , '  - Larry is interviewing a young  in French
Martha appears at the door
Larry
Marty, what are you doing here
Larry there's got to be something missing
gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want
Something they
that they overlooked
What
You think that the girl is innocent
don't know
You got to be crazy
Larry pulls out a pack of cigarettes, gives one to Martha and to the prostitute
Larry
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports
It's a cut and dried case
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be
You're too involved Marty
(lights her cigarette) Jesus look at you
Why don't you turn this case over to someone else
Larry lights his own cigarette and comes over to Martha
(Cont
) 'll ask around, see what  come up with
In the meantime you go home and get some sleep
Thanks
(she leaves) (calling after her) If  find anything 'll call you
59    - '  - Martha takes off her coat, moves across the room turning on lights
She flicks the answerphone on
Her cat meows
(
) Hi Marty, it's Helen
Mrs Davenport called and was very upset that you'd missed her appointment
She wants you to call her at home, oh and a couple of reporters have been trying to get a hold of you about Sister Agnes
They seem persistent and they may try to reach you at home
didn't give them number
Some whirs and beeps
Martha goes into the bathroom
(
) (French accent) Hallo, Doctor Livingston
My name is (
)
'm doing a Sunday article on Sister Agnes for the Gazette
would appreciate it if you would give me a phone call on 942-2424
More beeps and whirs
Martha starts to undress
(
) Hi Marty, it's me
Listen  just talked with Detective Crawley who was at the convent
She said that there was one thing that bothered her that didn't make it into the report
The waste paper basket
The one in Agnes' room
(Martha freezes in the middle of lighting up) None of the other nuns had one
Bye
Martha rushes over to the answerphone and rewinds it
(
) her that didn't make it into the report
The waste paper basket
The one in Agnes' room
None of the other nuns had one
Bye
Martha looks thoughtful and flicks off the desk lamp
60    -   - Father Martineau is saying Mass
All the sisters are there singing together
Father Martineau places the host in the sconce, incences it and raises it up
Close on individual nuns at prayer including Agnes
: 61    -  - Mother Miriam is kneeling in the doorway of the barn, praying when Martha    enters
Mother Miriam pauses
've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her
Mother Miriam makes the sign of the cross and stands up
And my permission
'd like yours too
Mother Miriam grabs a bucket and moves across the barn
Martha follows her
We'll see about that
Don't deny it
haven't decided yet
The woman's health is at stake
Her spiritual health
don't give a damn about her spiritual health
know you don't
Mother Miriam starts shovelling grain into the bucket
Sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and
am saying (distorted) a beautifully simple woman
An unhappy woman
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh
(cont
) Why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it
Because  am a moral person
Bullshit
Bullshit yourself
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality
Who said anything about the Catholic Church
You just said
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you
Nothing
What have we done to hurt you
And don't deny it,  can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away
What did we do
Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences
That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body
We let governments do those things today
So what did we do to you eh
You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin
This time it is Martha who walks away and Mother Miriam who follows her
(Cont
) So instead of questioning that one rule
(halting) It wasn't sex
It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex
You know when  was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said
She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers
Stupid woman
and that's all
That's all
That's enough
She was a beautiful little girl
And what has that to do with it
wasn't
wasn't
She was the pretty one
She died, why not me
never said my morning prayers
And  was ugly,  was scrawny,  had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston
So you left the Church because you had freckles
No, because
yeah, yeah  left the Church cause  had freckles
They both cannot help laughing at this absurdity
62    -  - couple of nuns walk across the courtyard
Another is meditating alone
On a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away
63    -  - It is out the back of the convent near the belltower
Mother Miriam and Martha are sitting there talking
Martha is smoking
When  was a child  used to hear my guardian angel
She sang to me 'till was six years old
That's when  stopped listening
But  remember the voice few years ago  looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing
Not even of Heaven
Not even of God
And then one evening  saw Agnes standing by her window, singing
And all my doubts about myself and God were gone, in that one moment
recognized the voice
Please don't take it away from me again Doctor Livingston
Those years after six were very bleak
My sister died in a convent
And it's her voice  hear
(a long pause) Does my smoking bother you
No, it reminds me
Would you like one
Huh
'd love one
Martha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her
Mother Miriam coughs a lot
Martha pats her on the back
'm out of prac
(cough) practice
(cough) All right
Fine thanks
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then
Undoubtedly
Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More
(chuckles) Long, thin and filtered
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet
(they roar with laughter) And of course (distorted) Hand rolled
Even Christ would partake socially
Saint Peter
Pipe
Right
Mary Magdelen
(imitating) Oh, you've come a long way baby
And Saint John would chew tobacco
More laughter, then the moment because more serious
Right
(a pause) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking
There are no saints today
Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people
those 'm afraid we are sorely lacking
Do you think they ever existed
Yes  do
Do you want to become one
Become
One is born a saint
Well you can try, can't you, to be good
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it
Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy
But
they were still attached to God
Agnes has that birth
(she stands) No more
we're born, we live, we die
No room for miracles
(Martha gets up too) Oh my dear, how  miss the miracles
They start walking back to the convent
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God
Listen to her singing
(a pause) 'd like to begin
Begin what
The hypnotism
Do you still disapprove
Would it stop you if  did
No
They both halt
May  be present
Of course
Then let's begin
64    -   - The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply sloping    ceiling
Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed, already under   hypnosis
Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her
You're listening to a chorus of angels
The music surrounds you like a
warm and, comfortable pool of water
And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember
And when  count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised
Can you hear me
Yes
Who am
Doctor Livingston
And why am  here
To help me
Good
Would you like to tell me why you're here
Because 'm in trouble
What kind of trouble
(no answer) What kind of trouble Agnes
Martha starts to walk around behind Agnes
'm frightened
Of what
Of telling you
But it's easy
It's just a breath with sound
Say it
What kind of trouble
(a pause) had a baby
Both Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of relief
How did you have a baby
It came out of me
Did you know what was going to come out
Yes
Did you want it to come out
No
Why
Because  was afraid
Why were you afraid
Because  wasn't worthy
To be a mother
Yes
Why
May  open my eyes now
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet
How did the baby get into you
It grew
What made it grow
Do you know
Yes
Would you like to tell me
No
Did anyone else know about the baby
can't tell you that
Will she be angry
She made me promise not to
Who
Who made you promise
(no answer) It's    alright Agnes
It's alright
(a pause) Let's    go to your room
It's the night about    six weeks ago when you were very    sick
'm afraid
Oh don't be, 'm here
It's alright
want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed
ate
Hm hmm
What did you have for dinner
Fish
(distastefully) brussel sprouts
You don't like brussel sprouts
hate them
Martha and Mother Miriam can't help smiling
And then what happened
We went to chapel for vespers
Hm hmm
left early because  wasn't feeling very well
Suddenly Agnes leaps up from her chair
What is it
Someone's following me
Who
Sister Marguerite  think
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby
(no answer) Alright Agnes,  want you to see your room as you saw it on that night
(Cont
) Open your eyes
(she opens them) What do you see
My bed
What else
crucifix
Above the bed
Any
anything else
What do you you see, something different
What is it
(puzzled) wastepaper basket
Do you know who put it there
No
What do you think it's there for
For me to get sick in
Are you ill
Yes
What do you feel
feel as if 've eaten glass
What do you do
have to throw up
And she falls to her knees, retching horribly
(Cont
) can't
glass
one of the sisters has fed me glass
Which one
don't know which one (distorted) Of what
Of me
Oh
God
My God
(assumes the birth position and looks between her legs) Water
it's all water
Why isn't anyone coming
(trying to wipe up the water) They can't hear me that's why
(in terrible pain) Oh God
don't wanna
(to Martha) Stop her
Then Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of something
What is it
Please get away from me
Who
Go away,  don't want you here
Is someone in the room with you
No
don't hit me please
Stop this, she'll hurt herself (stepping forward) 'm not going to allow this
(hauling her away) no
said leave her alone
(still screaming) You're trying to take my baby
trying to take my baby
no
(then quietly) It wasn't my fault Mommy
it was a mistake Mommy
Alright Agnes
it's alright
One, two three
(claps her hands; Agnes comes to) It's alright
it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright
Thankyou Agnes, thankyou
How do you feel
Frightened
Do you remember what just happened
(a long pause) Yes
That's good
Do you feel well enough to stand
Yes
Martha helps her to her feet
Agnes clings to her
There you go
It's alright, it's alright, it's all over
It's alright Agnes, that's right, that's right
65       -   - Martha approaches the building and enters it
66       -   - The camera tracks through shelves of ancient records and maps
(off) Ah excuse me
Hallo
'm looking for some ah
ground plans for the ah
Saint Marie Madeleine Convent in (distorted)
(off) (answers in French) Martha and a middle aged official come into view
He stops at a long set of        drawers and starts looking through it
(in French) (replies in French) Oh
very interesting  guess
(he pulls out a folder of plans) Excuse me
He sets the folder down on a table and starts going through it
They both look at the plans
(Cont
) Ah viola
This has everything
Even the secret entrance
They all had that
Usually to get from building to building in the snow
(he indicates on the plan) like that one
(murmurs) That's how he got in
or she got out
Oh excuse me, what did you say
Nothing
May  take some notes
Oh yes, (distorted) Martha starts drawing a rough plan
67    -  - The crypt is deserted but candles are burning in front of a statue of Saint Michael
Martha walks over to it,lights a candle and goes behind it and finds a stairway there leading underground
She goes down into
68    -  - Martha walks through the dimly lit passage
She stops for a moment to look at a cross carved on the stone floor, then continues
Finally she reaches more steps and goes up into the
69    -  - Martha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is full of doves
It    begins to make sense for her
70    -  - Various closeups of famous statues
bell is tolling
Two nuns come out of a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic did not exist and into another building
71    -  - The nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam
In the lift an checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls
The lift stops and the Sisters get off
72    -  - They walk down the modern carpeted corridor into
73    - '  - Mother Miriam addresses the secretary,
Is the Doctor in her office
Ah, who shall  say is calling
(grimly) General MacArthur
She heads onto Martha's office
Helen jumps up after her
Just a minute please, you can't go in there
Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha
(standing) It's
it's alright Helen, just close the door
Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto Martha's desk
've just met with the bishop
We're taking you off the case
(picking up the papers) You're what
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes
we'll find our own, thank you
(starts to leave) One that will ask the questions you want asked
(halting) One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
For the Church
For Agnes
You think she's a saint
She's been touched by God, yes
How
How
She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously
Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched
Give me a miracle
The father
Who is he
Why must he be anybody
(laughs and sits down) My God, you're as crazy as
Stop laughing,  don't say it's the truth, 'm saying
How (distorted)
Don't be ridiculous
Well give me a reasonable explanation miracle is an event without an explanation
If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb
This is insane
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out
You're saying God did it
No, that's as much as saying Father Martineau did it
'm saying God permitted it
But how did it happen
You'll never find the answer for everything God did
thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother
But  want the opportunity to believe
want the choice to believe
But what    you are choosing to believe is a lie    because you won't face the fact that she    was raped
or seduced
or that    she did the seducing
She is an innocent
But she is not an enigma Mother
Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry
One, two, three, right down the line
That's what you believe she is
The sum of her psychological parts
That's what  have to believe
Then why are you so obsessed with her
You're losing sleep over her
(Martha gets up disturbed) You're thinking about her all the time
You're bent on saving her
Why
Martha has no answer
(Cont
) (calmer) 'm not accusing
'm recognizing
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn
Did you know about that
There's an answer Mother
That's how she got out
That's crazy
How could she find out about it
Somebody told her
Who
That tun
that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years
Oh, would you stop lying Mother
Why would  lie
Because it's murder we're talking about
Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room
'm concerned about her health
Who was that person Mother
Was it you
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me
And definitely not Agnes
She goes out and slams the door
74    -  - After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond
They are quite uninhibited, like little children
Their singing (off) from the chapel continues until the end of scene 78
75    -  - Sister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated
She approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle and kneels down
76    -   - Martha and Justice Leveau come up the steps and into the corridor
All  want is one more week
Why
(continues in French, then
) You've done nothing to show any progress
Yes, that's because 'm getting to her
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it
'll have a decision by next week
It's gone on long enough
You're out
Oh Joe
Joe she didn't kill the baby
(halting) You have proof
'll have it
When
Next week
(walking on) No, no, no
can get you new evidence next week
No
Tomorrow
tomorrow, 'll get it by tomorrow
will
They reach the door of Leveau's office
He thinks
Yes, demain (
) 77    -  - The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one another
Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop, Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family (4) watching from behind the grilled gate
Genevieve's hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her, running out to join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this time the nuns singing along from    behind the gate
78    -  - Martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow covered grounds to    the convent
79    -  '  - Mother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun interrupts
Singing   from the party can faintly be heard
(off) Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston is here
Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he door
Martha hands    her a court order
Mother Miriam reads it briefly and hands it back
This is permission to take her apart
Where is she
Hasn't she had enough
have a few more questions to ask her
My God, but you're determined
They move back into the room
Who knew she was pregnant
Why do you insist upon pressing
Was it you
Is it because she's a nun
Did you know she was pregnant
Yes
And you didn't send her to a doctor
didn't guess until it was too late
For what
An abortion
Oh, don't be ridiculous
Too late for what
don't know
too late to stop it
The baby
The scandal
You went to the room to help with the birth
She didn't want any help
You wanted that child out of the way
That's a lie
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room
didn't hide it
put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
And the baby
No
You tied the cord around its neck
wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and  panicked
Before or after you killed the child
left it with her and  went for help
doubt that's what she'd say
Then she's a liar
80    -   - It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and Mother Miriam are      standing
Agnes, can you hear me
Yes
want you to remember if you can a night last January
The night Sister Paul died
Do you remember
There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed
Agnes stirs slightly
(Cont
) What's the matter
There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying that mysterious word that we could not previously understand
She said Michael
What did she mean
There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in the crypt
The statue
She had shown it to me the day before
And the passage to the barn
Yes
Why
So  could go to him
Who
Him
How did she know about him
She'd seen him too
Where
From the belltower the day she before she died
So she sent you
Yes
81    -  - In flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel carrying an oil lamp
(
) What happened
Agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into
82    -  - Still in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn
The doves flap about as Agnes    moves nervously through the barn
(
) He's here
83    -   - Back to the present: Are you frightened
Yes
84    -  - In flashback: the doves continue to make flapping and bumping sounds as they fly around the barn
Hallo
85    -   - In the present: where are you
86    -  - In flashback: Is it you
Then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see nothing except the doves
(Cont
) 'm afraid
yes, yes  do
why me
wait,  want to see you
(
) What do you see
87    -   - In the present: Halos
88    -  - In flashback: Agnes is still in the barn but now she is lying on her back
Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light
(
) dividing and dividing feathers and starts, falling, falling into the iris of God's eye
Oh
oh
it's
it's so lovely
it's so
blue
yellow
blood wings, brown, blood
And she lifts up her hands
89    -   - In the present: as she lifts up her hands, Agnes is horrified to see two holes in her palms weeping blood
His blood
my God
Martha and Mother Miriam are equally shocked
Oh Agnes
Agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her white habit
Mother Miriam rushes after her
It's bleeding
'm bleeding
my God it won't stop,  can't get it to stop
(to Mother Miriam) Let go of me,  wish you were dead
(trying to hold her) Agnes
Agnes
Agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it too with blood
Martha follows her
Stay away from me
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God
He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand
No
He    frightened you and he hurt you
It's not    your fault
It's his fault
Tell us who    he is so we can find him
Stop him    from doing this to other women
Not your fault
Agnes who did you see
hate him
Of course you do
Who was it
hate him for what he did to me
Yes
For what he made me go through
Who
hate him
Agnes, who did this to you
Agnes flings her arms back against the wall
God
It was God
(sinks to her knees) And now 'll burn in hell because hate him
Agnes you won't burn in hell
It's alright to hate him
That's enough
Agnes, what happened to the baby
(shouting) She can't remember
What happened to the baby
It was dead
It was alive wasn't it
don't remember
(screaming) Oh, don't do this
Wasn't it
Somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat
Mother Miriam   is looking utterly resigned
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she
Yes
She took the baby in her arms
Yes
You saw it all didn't you
Yes
And then
what did she do
(no answer) Agnes what did she do
She
left me alone with that little thing, and  looked at it, and  thought this is a mistake
But it's my mistake, not Mommy's
God's mistake
(cont
) thought
can save her
(she raises her hands) can give her back to God
What did you do
put her to sleep
how
tied the cord around her neck
wrapped her in the bloody sheets
and stuffed her in the trash can
Mother Miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the cross and prays
Martha claps her hands lightly together once
90    -  - shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the city
Angle on the courthouse
91    -   - All the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha, Agnes, Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam
Justice Leveau is summing up
In view of the situation as it now stands, and the testimony given here this morning, it seems quite clear that the defendant was in no manner responsible for her actions
It is therefore the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of Marie Madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision by a visiting physician
Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this
Justice Leveau continues to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up
(Cont
) (surprised) Oui
Do you have something to say
(a long pause) stood in the window of my room every night for a week
And one night heard the most beautiful voice imaginable
And when  looked  saw the moon shining down on him
For six nights he sang to me, songs 'd never heard
And on the seventh night he opened his wings and lay on top of me
All the while he sang - (sings) Charlie Sweet
Charlie Sweet
Charlie's a
Please, remove her from the court
Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly
Would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom
(continues in French) The nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the court
: 92    -  - It is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings dissolving into one another
(
) don't know the meaning behind the song she sang
Perhaps it was a song of seduction
And the father was a fieldhand
Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago
And the father was hope and
and love and desire
And a belief in miracles
The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to the convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard
(
) want to believe that she was blessed
And  do miss her, and  hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me
That would be miracle enough wouldn't it
: 93    -    - Where Agnes is singing her song among the doves
She stops singing and the music fades in on the same key
Agnes gently takes on of the doves and lets it fly away across the snowy landscape
