It's Election Day 1997
Up and down the country, the , people of all shapes and sizes and denominations, black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls
Everyone, that is, except the people that live in
- The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world
The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters on the roof
- We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace
plays in the corner
here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield
" , wearing formal robes of the Garter, is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black , (representative, one assumes, of one of the many Charities of which she is patron)
Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford
(proudly dabbing palette) Yes, Ma'am
was there when they opened
First in line
Seven o'clock
If he wins, he'll be the youngest Prime Minister in almost two hundred years
" He straightens
And  don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair
Not a moderniser, then
Certainly not
We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is
"The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be
And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in
" Hmm
The  watches as he paints
rather envy you being able to vote
(a beat) Not the actual ticking of the box, although,  suppose, it would be nice to experience that
(a beat) But the sheer joy of being partial
Yes
The  squints as he scrutinises the canvass
One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote
No
Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you
You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am
(a beat) But it  your Government
Yes
The  raises her eyebrow
suppose that is some consolation

Fast asleep
It's shortly before 8
00 am
Daylight filters through the curtains
As does something else
The stirring sound of bagpipes
-   - The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace
In a ritual unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed , wearing a kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes
t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up wherever she is - anywhere in the world
- '  - Darkness
soft knock at the door
(The strains of bagpipes can still be heard from below)
Her Majesty's  sticks her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey tea and the newspapers
'morning, Ma'am
The  puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table
Shall  draw the curtains
The 's sleepy voice answers
`Please'
The  goes to the window
(
) Did you stay up
Yes, Ma'am
(
) And
Was it as expected
The 's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the newspapers
She puts on her glasses
Yes, Ma'am
Mr Blair, by a landslide
The 's expression changes

She lifts the newspaper up
The front page comes into sharp focus

Long, gilded mirrors
Portraits on the walls
He's a hard one to read, isn't he
Yes
On the one hand his background is quite establishment
Father a Conservative
public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales
Well, we'll try not to hold that against him
5
On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years
Oh
Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think
wouldn't put it past him
He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met
It could best be described as `shallow'
don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin
leave that to my sister
And  spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal
Everyone on first name terms
(a beat) At the Prime Minister's insistence

As in `Call me Tony

The 's face puckers in distaste
Oh

It's `Ma'am' as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm

And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back

Without waiting for a reply, he enters

Eyes widen to herself

Mr Blair, your Majesty

First thing we do,  believe

You obviously know my job better than do
Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr Blair
'd like to think there weren't too many surprises left
My first was Winston Churchill
He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat, and was kind enough to give a shy young girl like me quite an education
can imagine
ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility
(a pointed addition) To advise, guide and warn the government of the day
Advice which  look forward to receiving

Of course
He falls, rather extravagantly, on bended knee

Your Majesty, the country has spoken

It's usual for  to ask the questions

Wishes the ground would swallow him up
Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader
And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name

Lost for words
Then
Generally, this is where you say `yes
' `Yes'
The  extends her hand, which  kisses
She withdraws it again - quite sharply, then     by her chair indicating the ceremony is over
The  opens a door, and  is invited inside
(cont'd) How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair

(cont'd) You must be very proud
Yes
And exhausted,  imagine
Where will you be spending the summer

How lovely

Yes,  can hardly wait
Wonderful place

But  supervised those plans myself
Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different

The  's eyes widen
And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other

Currently they're blocking the path through the main gate, and will make things difficult for the Changing of the Guard

Who, Charles
His people have already been onto us asking for extra protection

She would certainly have taken the boys to Paris

What
And expose them to the media
It would have been a dreadful thing to do
They're much better off here

About
The flag above Buckingham Palace
He thinks it should be flying at half- mast

Then  hope Robin told him there ' a flag above Buckingham Palace

Since you're here, the flag pole is bare

Isn't it possible
that to some people
the Royal Standard is just
a flag
And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal

That's not the point
The point is it's more than four hundred years old

Your grandfather didn't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she wouldn't get it either
Yes

in a situation like this

Most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her
We've managed to look at one or two, yes
In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary
(cont'd) No

and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune
Under normal circumstances  would agree, but (under his breath) Here we go

No, Ma'am

If you're suggesting that  drop everything and come down to London before  attend to two boys that have just lost their mother
you're mistaken
Absurd doubt there are many who know the British more than  do, Mr
Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement
And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press
in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning

The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long forgotten
