"Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome, profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen, quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times
They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high
They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go
" "They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories
They were scarred with battles
They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming
"						Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899) 1
- in a dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets
The year is 1916
2 , a handsome young man from the slums, and his brother sit outside on their lunch break talking with an older man named
By the look of his flashy clothes Blackie is not a worker
Listen, if  ever seen a tit, this here's a tit
You understand
Candy
My kid sister could do this one
Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand
Don't take brains
Just a set of rocks
told you this already
Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, 'd go out and bet against it
You know
(to Bill) There is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea
Okay, all right, fine
Why should  be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors
must be losing my grip
(pause) got to give it to you, though
Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens
You ever get laid
Sure
Without a lot of talk,  mean
'Cause 'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks
It's clean, and you know what you're in for
3 Sam the Collector's  swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant
of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them
wears big suspenders
Sam and Bill appear to know one another
Hey, Billy, you made a mistake
You made somebody mad
Nothing personal, okay
It's just gotta be done
You made a mistake
Happens in the best of families
paid you everything  have
Search me
The rest he gets next week
Listen, what happens if  don't do this
gotta leave town
could do something, you know
You guys wanta do something to me,  know who to tell about it
You guys ought to think about that
You maybe already did something
Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something
haven't done anything
Then you're all right, Billy
You got nothing to worry about
Cut it out, Billy, all right
You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him
You know
So don't give us a lot of trouble
You're liable to get everybody all pissed off
Sam, a busy man, checks his watch
4 Bill puts his hand on the ground
Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang
Bill sobs with pain
5 Bill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill
Blackie walks behind
You know what 'm doing with my end
Buy a boat
Get that
had a boat
had a nice apartment,  had a boat
Margie don't like that
We got to have a house
" can't afford no house,"  said
She says, "Sell the boat
"  didn't want to sell my boat
didn't want to buy the house
sell the boat,  buy the house
Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat
give up
Same as always,  do all the work, you gripe about it
Suddenly   surprise them from ambush
Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run
Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down
Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back
Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel
The  stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve
6 Steve, badly wounded, is about to die
Run
Get out of here
(weeping) love you so much
Why didn't  you run
Don't die
Steve dies
Bullets kick up dust around him
He takes off running
One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder
7 , a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer
Her sister , a reckless girl of14, stands watch
(weeping) They shot the shit out of him
My brother
couldn't believe what  was seeing
Hold still, or  can't do anything
love you, Abby
You're so good to me
Remember how much fun we had, on the roof
8
- Bill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love
The city stretches out behind them
9
- Abby lies shivering with fever
Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth
Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change
(o
s
) (continuing) even when you were sick and  was in the mill
10
-   (    ) Bill works in the glow of a blast furnace
He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers
pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance
He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life
(o
s
) won't let you go back in the mill
People die in there
'm a man, and  can look out for you
11 Along a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders
(o
s
) We're going west
Things gotta be better out there
12 , looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live
Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water
What'd you do
Bill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun
Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline
13 They hop a freight train
14	 (  ) The  run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind
Pigs roam the gutters
Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway
blind man hawks stale bread
Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant
Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes
Police look for a thief under a bridge
Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look
The  end
15 Abby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle
like the sunshine
Everybody does
They laugh
She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap
They are sharing a bottle of wine
never wanted to fall in love with you
Nobody asked you to
He draws her toward him
She pulls away
What's the matter
while ago you said  was irresistible
still am
That was then
She pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around
You playing mousie again
love how nice and hard your shoulders are
And your hair is light
You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night
love it when you've been drinking
You're not greasy, Bill
You have any idea what that means
Kind of
They share the boxcar with a crowd of other
Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man
Bill gestures out at the landscape
Look at all that space
Oweee
We should've done this a long time ago
It's just us and the road now, Abby
We're all still together, though
That's all  care about
16 The train slows down to take on water
The hands jump off
Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas
with ax handles are on hand to greet them
The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish
Only English is rare
Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home
Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps
Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East
They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions
Elbow room
Oweee
Give me a chance and 'm going to dance
Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista
Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle
It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity
He wants it known that he was born to greater things
17 Bill comes upon a   whose face is covered with blood
Good, very good
Where you from,  mister
Cleveland
Like to see the other guy
Bill helps him to his feet and dusts him off
walks up
You doing this shit
(pause) Then keep it moving
Oh yeah
Who're you
The Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle
Name is Morrison
Bill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this
She hasn't
He walks dizzily off down the tracks
18 He takes Abby by the arm
What happened to your ear
Nothing
She is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life
Her costume does not fool the men
Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently
The  of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off
flag pole is planted by each wagon
Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard
, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone
In the background a  to the harvest talks with a
Shockers
Four more and 'm leaving
How much you paying
Man can make three dollars a day, he wants to work
Who're you kidding
Bill mills around
They have no choice but to accept his offer
Sackers
Abby steps up
Benson takes her for a young man
You ever sacked before
She nods
Transcriber's Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the  and the  runs concurrent with the previous six lines of dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby
In the original script they are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page

***** When's that
Last year
He waves her on
Abby nods at Ursula
You're making a mistake, you pass this kid up
Get on
He snaps his fingers at her
Bill climbs up ahead of the women
Anger makes him extremely polite
You don't need to say it like that
Benson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first
20 Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill
21
( ) The wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom
Goats peer down from on top
Bill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows
22 At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall
Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all
Filigrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves
Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front
Peacocks fuss about the yard
There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza
wind generator supplies electric power
white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell
Bison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean
Bill shouts at the nearest one
Yo, Beevo
23 , the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals
24 Benson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists
Ursula sees Chuck watching them
Whose place is that
The owner's
Don't none of you go up around his place
First one that does is fired
'm warning you right now
In the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn
Abby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette
Ursula tags behind
25 Bill lifts a big rock
Abby applauds
Ursula kneels down behind him
Abby pushes him over backwards
26 Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming: Urs
She lands in a straw pile
27 Bill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest
Ready
She giggles her consent
He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go
She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication
28
- Bill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night
They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children
You're all 've got, Abby
No, really, everything  ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you
know
They laugh
He bends to kiss her
She pulls away
Sometimes  think you don't like men
As individuals
Very seldom
She kisses him lovingly
29
- The sun peers over the horizon
The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall
It stretches for as far as the eye can see
has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving
"
that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth
" The harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off
They have slept in their coats
The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer
30 Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest
He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper
He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard
Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness: grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk
He pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth
Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod
The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving
Two  flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix
All repeat the "Amen
" Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm
Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle
This is the moment they have been waiting all year for
31	  - with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill
In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work
Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks
" cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb
Abby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic
Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring
While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off
It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker
The harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes
The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire
Nobody talks
From time to time they raise a chant
Ursula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat
Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy
He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc
The harvesters are city people
Few of them are trained to farming
Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it
Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged
Where the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride
32 Lightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon
Chuck looks concerned
Benson consults a windsock
Should miss us
They must be having trouble over there, though
Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face
As she does her hair falls out of the crown
Women are rare in the harvest fields
One so beautiful is unprecedented
didn't know we had any women on
(surprised) thought she was a boy
Should  get rid of her
No
33 stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole
Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn
Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air
Their faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence
They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble
34
-
The , Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses
The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up
The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp
An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby
Most sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools
The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon
Bill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish   makes a crack
Your sister keep you warm at night
Bill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight
No fists are used, just food
The others pull them apart
Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt
35
-
Bill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon
Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water
Bill inspects them anxiously
They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work
ran a stubble under my nail
Didn't you ever learn how to take care of yourself
told you to keep the gloves on
What can  do if you don't listen
Bill presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can do nothing to shield her from such indignities
In the b
g
a  with a fungo bat hits flies to   with baseball gloves
You can't keep on like this
What else can we do
She nods at the others
Anyway, if they can,  can too
That bunch
Don't compare yourself to them
She flexes her fingers
They seem lame
You drop off this weak
can make enough for us both
It was a crime to bring you out here
Somebody like you
(pause) Right now, what 'm doing, 'm just dragging you down
(pause) Maybe you should go back to Chicago
We've got enough for a ticket, and  can send you what  make
He seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand
Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again
What's the matter
She begins to cry
He takes her in his arms
know how you feel, honey
Things won't always be this way
promise
36	   - ' The men knock out their pipes as Benson's whistle summons them back to their stations
Tick tockl Tick tock
Nothing moving but the clock
Bill pulls Abby to her feet
He sees the Dutchman he fought with and shoots him the finger
You better be careful
Of him
He's just a
sack of shit
Stop it
He's liable to see you
want him to
He's the one better be careful
37 Chuck looks on
Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted
38	 () The work goes on through the afternoon
The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up
series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing
Iany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up
Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds
The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails
The wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet
As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut
Benson fires his pistol
vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky
As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable
Oil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain
39
' Bill helps Abby finish up a row
Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance
Benson comes up behind her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed
You must've passed over a dozen bushels here
'm docking you three dollars
What're you talking about
That's not fair
Then leave
You're fired
Abby is speechless
Bill squeezes the small rubber ball which he carries around to improve his grip and swallows his pride
Wait a minute
You want to stay
(pause) Then shut up and get back to work
Benson leaves
Abby covers Bill's embarrassment
guess he meant it
She turns her back to him and goes about picking up the sheaf Benson threw down
He did
Ask him
If you can't sing or dance, what do you do in this world
You might as well forget it
Ising or dance, what do you do this world
You might as wellu rorget it
40
- Their day's work done, the men swim naked in a stock pond
Their faces are black, their bodies white as a baby's
retriever plunges through the water fetching sticks
41
- Some bowl with their hats on in a dusty road and argue in Italian
42
- '  - physician's wagon stands in front of the Belvedere
Bill hunts nervously through it for medicine to soothe Abby's hands
Not knowing quite what to look for, he sniffs whatever catches his eye
Suddenly the front door opens and Chuck steps out with a , a stooped old man in a black frock coat
Bill, surprised, crouches behind the wheel
As they draw closer their conversation becomes faintly audible
(o
s
) How long you give it
(o
s
) Could be next month
Could be a year
Hard to say
Anyway, 'm sorry
(o
s
) Got to happen sometime
They shake hands 43	  - The Doctor snaps his whip at the horses
Bill grabs holdI The Doctor snaps his whip at the horses
Bill grabs hold of the back of the wagon and lets it drag him away from the Belvedere
the Belvedere
- 44
- Ursula and Abby case the barn for dinner
Abby points at a pair of peacocks strutting by, nods to Ursula and puts a finger over her lips
Ursula, with a giggle, followsone while Abby stalks the other
45
-    - The peacock, a resplendent white, leads Abby through a bright yellow rapeseed field
It keeps just out of reach, as though it were enticing her on
as though it were enticing her on
' All at once she looks up with a start
Chuck is standing in front of her, dressed in his habitual black
The Belvedere rises behind him like a castle in a fairy tale
She remembers Benson's warning that this is forbidden ground
(afraid) forgot where  was
Don't worry
Where you from
Chicago
We hardly ever see a woman on the harvest
There is a small rip in the side of her shirt, which the camera observes with Chuck
She pulls her sweater over it
You like the work
(she shrugs) Where do you go from here
Wyoming and places
've never been up that way
You think 'll like it
He shrugs
Shy at first, she begins to open up
That dog belongs to you that was running around here
That little pointer
(he nods) What's his name Buster
He seems like a good dog
think so
He came over and tried to eat my bread from lunch
Maybe  should keep him penned up
(smiling) You asking me
46
- Bill finds Ursula roasting a peacock on a spit
She has arranged some of its tail feathers in her hair
You're getting prettier every day
Aren't you sweet
Depends how people are with me
Where's Abby
found her something
He holds out a jar of salve
Ursula shrugs
She mention anything to you about going back
(pause) What
Ursula has no idea what he is talking about
47
-  HOURMost of the workers are fast asleep around the strawplU Most of the workers are fast asleep around the strawpile, their bodies radiating out like the spokes of a wheel
few stay up late to shoot dice in the back of a wagon
48
- Abby and Bill have laid their bedrolls out by a stack away from the others
fire burns  nearby
Abby look at the stars
Bill shines his shoes
The straw is fragrant as thyme
've had it
You're tired, that's all
'm going to find you another blanket
No, it's not that
'm not tired
just can't
Don't you want to be with me
You know  do
It's just that, well, 'm not a bum, Bill
know
told you though, this is only for a while
Then we're going to New York
Then we're New York
And after that
Then we're there
Then we get fixed up
You mean spend one night in a flophouse and start looking for work
They are silent for a moment
You should go back
And leave you
couldn't do that
(pause) Someday, when 'm dying, 'd like somebody to ask me if still see life the same way as before--and 'd like them to write down what  say
It might be interesting Suddenly they look around
The chief domestic at the Belvedere, a churlish lady named  , stands above them with a salver of fruit and roast fowl
(suspicious) What's going on
Who sent it
She nods up toward the Belvedere and sets it down What for
She withdraws with a shrug
She does not appear to relish this duty
Bill watches her walk back to the buggy she came down in
Benson waits beside it (to Abby) She's the kind wouldn't tell you if your coat was on fire 49	  - Abby, with the look of a child that has wandered into aI magic world, digs in
Bill looks on, suspicious of the_ motives behind this generosity
50
- '  - bank of clouds moves across the moon
Ursula roams the fields, keen with unsatisfied intelligence
The stubble hisses as a hot wind blows up from the South, driving bits of grain into her face like sleet
From time to time she does a cartwheel
Equipment cools in the fields
Little jets of steam escape the boilers of the tractors
Ursula stops in front of a donkey well
It nods up and down in ceaseless agreement, pumping up riches from deep in the earth
51
- The camera moves through the bedroom window to find Chuck asleep on his pillow
The wind taps the curtain into the room
52
- Chuck dreams of a Biblical figure with a long plaited room
U52EXT
Chuck dreams of a Biblical figure with a long plaited beard, in a frock coat and Astrakhan hat, sitting in a_ chair on the open prairie, guarding his land with a brace of guns
This man will later be identified as his
53
- The next day Benson yells through a megaphone from atop a stool
Hold your horses The huge tractors start up with a bang
Despite Benson's warning a team of Percherons breaks free
Threshing, the separating of the wheat from the chaff, has begun
54
- Sixty foot belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume
Benson tosses bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens belts, chews out a  who's sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc
Bill works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork
Ursula helps stoke the tractor with coal and water
When nothing is required of her she sneaks off to burrow in the straw
Gingerbread on the eaves of the tractors gives them a Victorian appearance
Tall flags mark their position in the field
Abby moves quickly, without a moment's rest, sewing up the sacks of grain as they are measured out at the bottom of the separator
clowning  comes up and smells herU like a flower
55 Fully laden wagons set off toward distant grain elevators 56 Chuck and McLEAN, his accountant, sit on a ridge away from the chaff, in the shade of a beach umbrella
Chuck keeps track of operations through a telescope
Our last view of Abby, we realize, was from his
plush Empire couch has been drawn up for his to rest in
At a table beside it, McLean computes the yield
McLEAN This must be wrong
No, dammit, nineteen bushels an acre
Chuck sails his hat out in the stubble with a whoop
McLean leans over his adding machine, cackling like a thief
McLEAN Say it goes at fifty-five cents a bushel, that means a profit of four dollars and seventy-five cents per acre
Multiply by twenty thousand and you're talking over six figures Big year
McLEAN Your biggest ever
This could make you the richest man in thePanhandle
(pause) You ought to get out while you're this far ahead
You'll never do better
mean it
You have nothing to gain by staying
nothing to gain by staying want to expand
want to run this land clear to the Oklahoma border
Next spring  will
McLEAN And gamble everything (he nods) You're crazy
been out here all my life
Selling this place would be like cutting my heart out
This is the only home  ever had
ThisI is where  belong
Besides,  don't want to live in town
couldn't take my dogs 57	'  - Chuck takes another look at Abby through the telescope
25 58 Bill drinks from the water barrel at the back of Benson'sU buggy, his eyes fixed on Chuck's distan Big place here
The President's going to pay a visit next time he comes West Got a smoke
No Bill puts his hat back on
He keeps wet cottonwood leaves in the crown to cool himself off
Why's that guy dragging an expensive piece of furniture out here
Reason ask is he's going to ruin thefinish and have to strip it Benson hesitates, uncertain whether he might be divulging a confidence
He's not well
What's the matter with him Benson immediately regrets having spoken so freely
He checks his watch to suggest Bill should get back to work
This uneasiness confirms Bill's sense that Chuck is gravely ill
59
- Abby is sewing up her last sacks by the separator that evening when Chuck walks up, still in the flush of McLean's good news
The others have finished and left to wash up
He sits down and helps her
Shy and upright, he does not know quite how to behave with a woman
Probably be all done tomorrow
(pause) You still plan on going North
She nods and draws her last stitch
Chuck musters his courage
It must be now or never
Reason  ask is maybe you'd like to stay on
Be easier than now
There's hardly any work after harvest
The pay is just as good, though
Better in fact
Why're you offering me this
My honest face
Chuck takes a moment to compose his reply
've watched you work
Think about it
Maybe  will
She backs off toward Bill, who is waiting in the distance
Who's that
(hesitant) My brother
Chuck nods
60	  - She joins Bill
He gives her a melon, wanting to pick up her spirits
This is all  could find
You feeling better
(she shrugs) What'd he want
They look at each other
61
- As Bill and Abby bathe in the river that evening, he tells her what he seems to have learned about Chuck's state of health
Down the way Ursula sits under a tree playing a guitar
Otherwise they are alone
They all wear bathing suits, Bill a shirt as well
It must be something wrong with his lungs
(pause) He doesn't have any family, either
his lungs (pause) So what
Bill shrugs
Does he have to draw her a picture
shy, virginal light has descended over the world
Cranes peer at them from the tamarack
Tell him you'll stay
What for
Bill is wondering what might happen if Chuck got interested enough to marry her
Isn't he soon to die, leaving a vast inheritance that will otherwise go to waste
You know  love you, don't  you
Yes
Abby guesses what is going through his mind, and it shocks her
Oh, Bill
He takes her into his arms, full of emotion What else can we really do
know how you feel, but we keepon this way, in five years we'll be washed up
He catches a stick drifting by and throws it further down stream
You ever think about all those ladies parading up and downU Michigan Avenue
Bunch of whores
You're better than anyI of them
You ever think how they got where they are
He wants to breathe hope into her
He thinks of himself as responding to what she needs and secretly wants
When she does not answer he gives up with a sigh
Let's forget it
know what you mean, though
He takes her hand, with fresh hope of convincing her
We weren't meant to end up like this
At least you weren't
You could be something
've heard you sing
You have a lot of fine qualities that need to come out
Ursula, too
What kind of people is she meeting up with, riding the rods
The girl's never had a clean shot-- never will
She oughta be in school
(nodding) You wouldn't say this if you really loved me
But  do
You know  do
This just shows how much
We're shitI out of luck, Abby
People need luck
What're you crying about
Oh, don't tell me
already know
All on account of your unhappy life and all that stuff
Well, we gotta do something about it, honey
We can't expect anybody else to
Abby runs into the woods Always the lady
Well, you don't know how things work in this country
This is why every hunkie  ever met is going nowhere
(pause) Why do you want to make me feel worse than  already do
(') (pause) You people get hold of the guy that's passing out dough, giveI him my name, would you
'd appreciate it
62 Bill skims rocks off the water to calm himself down
HeI feels that somehow he did not get to say what he wanted to 63 Abby is dressing in the cool woven shade of the woods when Ursula, her face caked with a mask of river mud, jumps from the bushes with a shriek, scaring the wits out of her sister
64
- On their way home they pass the Belvedere
single light burns on the second floor
Abby picks cornflowers to put in her hair
Bill runs his hand down her back
Why're you touching me that way
He shrugs
Muffled by the walls of the house, above the cries of the peafowl, they can faintly hear Chuck singing to himself
He's singing
He can't be too sick if he's singing to himself
He might be singing to God
They look at each other and smile
It does not appear that she has held what he said by the river against him
Bill stands for a moment and looks up at the Belvedere before passing on
65
,  , Work goes on the next day
As they near the last sheaves of unthreshed grain, hundreds of rats burst out of hiding
The harvesters go after them with shovels and stones
The dogs chase down the ones that escape
66 Benson and Chuck smile at each other
We should be done around four
They improvise a chat about past harvests
Years of  shared hardship have drawn them close
Chuck trails off in the middle of a reminiscence
Something else weighing on his mind
(shyly) You put her on the slowest machine
Benson nods 67 The threshing is done
bundle is pitched into the separator backwards, snapping it abruptly to a stop
The drive belt whips along the ground like a mad snake
68 All hands line up at the payroll table
McLean gives out their wages in twists of newspaper
Chuck and Benson shake their hands
69 shows Bill a picture of a woman
And  let somebody like that get away from me
Redhead
Lost her to a guy named Ed
Just let it happen
Should've gone out there outside the city limits and shot him
just about did, too
(pause) If you're knocking yourself out like this,  hope it's for a woman
And  hope she's good looking
You understand
70 Abby snatches a cigarette out of Ursula's mouth, takes a drag and throws it away
When Ursula goes to pick it up, she stamps it out
Don't spend a cent of that
Why don't you leave me alone 'm not going to sit around and watch you throw your life away
Nobody's going to look at you twice if you've got nothing to your name
Ursula dislikes meddlesome adults
She takes out a pouch  of tobacco to roll another cigarette
Abby swats it out of her hand and chases her off
You want me to cut a switch
71	   -  - There are feats of strength and prowess as workers from the many fields of the bonanza join to celebrate the harvest home: boxing, wrestling, barrel jumping, rooster bouts, bear hugs, "Crack the Whip" and nut fights
Two tractors, joined by a heavy chain, vie to see which can outpull the other
Chuck lifts the back wheel of the separator off the ground; Benson replies by holding an anvil at arm's length; they tease each other about showing off
does flips
They all seem happy as kids on holiday
72 Bill and Ursula share a cigarette
Ursula tries on his sunglasses
We going to stay
If she wants to
You'd rather go
_ Bill, after a moment's thought, shrugs
She's the one has to say
You put aspirin in this
No
She hands back his sunglasses
Keep them
73
- Two  of harvesters have a tug of war
The losers are dragged through a pit of mud
Cradling handfuls of slime, they chase the winners off into the dusk
74	   - Bill finds Abby sitting off by herself, wanting no part of the festivities
This is the first time since their arrival in Texas we have seen her wearing a dress
Sunny Jim, look at this
My first ice cream in six months
And the lady even asks do  want sprinkles on top, thank you
Big, deep dish of ice cream
You couldn't pay me to leave this place, Got you one, too
You should've heard the line  had to give her, though
Oowee
Good, huh
Great
Now you're trying to coax me
You never used to act like this
Bill throws down the bowls of ice cream
In the distance, some  compete at throwing a sledge hammer
For as long as  can remember, people been giving me a hard time about one thing or another
Don't you start in, too
You want to turn me into a whore
We don't have to decide anything final now
Just if we're going to stay
You never have to touch him if you don't feel like it
Minute you get fed up, we take off
Worst that can happen is we had it soft for a while
Something's made you mean
She walks off, uncertain what Bill really wants
Or else we can forget it
'm not going to spend the whole afternoon on this, though
That 'm not going to do
75 Chuck watches from a distance, fearful that tonight may be the last he will ever see of her 76	  , , , The harvesters shape and dress the final sheaf as a woman
The  of them to finish that day carries the effigy at the end of the pole to the Belvedere
His mates follow behind, jeering and throwing dirt clods at him Aby watches
We sense that anything she sees mightI figure in her decision Mars hangs low and red in the western sky
_ 77 Ursula is looking at her figure in a pocket mirror whenU a  appears behind her See what happens to you
Little shit
Get out there and make that big money and don't spend time dicking around
78
- feast is laid on
rolls a flaming wheel down a hill
sets off a string of firecrackers
pelt each other with spareribs
Ursula  spears hogsheads out of a pit of hot coals
The   tease her
She is too much of a tomboy to interest any of thm seriously
The effigy sits off in a chair by itself
79	     - DUSKChuck awaits Abby's answer There's a problem
have to keep my baby sister with me
Someday_ my baby sister with me
Someday 'm going to save up enough, see, and send her to school
(pause) My brother, too
can't leave him Abby fears she has asked too much
Chuck hesitates, but only to suggest he still has the prudence he long since has abandoned
There's work for them, too
Really
80
-
bonfire burns like a huge eye in the vat of the prairie night
The band strikes up a reel
Chuck and Abby lead the dancing off, as though to celebrate their agreement
Their giant shadows dance with them
Soon the other harvesters join in
81	   - Bill watches Abby dance--it almost seems in farewell to their innocence
After a moment he turns off into the night 82	 - NIGHT_ The effigy is held over the flame at the end of a pole until it catches fire
The harvesters prance around in the dark, trading it from hand to hand
The , drunk and happy, bow their hearts out
83	   - While the others pursue their merriment, Bill walks the fields by himself, trembling with grief and indecision
Dawn is breaking
The eastern sky glows like a forge
Suddenly he comes upon a wolf
He catches his breath
The wolf stares back at him for a moment, then turns and pads off into the stubble
84
-
- Early the next morning the  wander by the hundreds down to the railroad tracks to catch a train for the North, where the crops are just now coming into maturity
subtle feeling of sadness pervades the group
Bill gives his sword cane away to a  who seems to have admired it
The  offers him money, but he declines it
85
-    - Ursula says goodbye to her favorite, a redhead named
She is hoarse, as always
Why don't you come with us
They won't let me
So when am  going to see you again
Maybe in Cheyenne
She nods okay
They both know they will never see each other again
On a sudden impulse she gives him a love note
What's this
She takes it back immediately, but he snatches it away from her and, after a brief, giggling scuffle, hops aboard the train, now picking up speed
Ursula runs along behind, cursing and throwing rocks at him
86 Bill and Abby look on
told her, "none of my business Urs,  just hope you're not rolling around with some redhead is all
" She looks me over
"Why
" she says, "What've you guys got that redheads don't
"  pity that kid
Ursula runs up and throws herself tearfully into Abby's arms
What's the matter
What'd he do
Bill starts off after the train
87
-" " Abby tends a washing machine driven by a sheep on a treadmill
Chuck watches from the front steps of the Belvedere
'm just about done with this
Good
So what's next
Next
There's nothing else you want done
Not that  can think of
Not right now
Miss Carter, the housekeeper, steps out on the porch and pours a bucket of milk into a cream separator
How about the cream
She takes care of that
He nods at Miss Carter, who conspicuously lets the screen door clap shut as she goes back inside
She misses no opportunity to express her disdain for these newcomers
She and Benson are the only employees seen at the Belvedere
Several dozen others have stayed on after the harvest but they keep to their quarters down at the dorm
You mean 'm done for today
(uncomfortably) Something else might come up
In truth, Chuck does not want to see Abby degraded by menial labor, considering her more a guest than an employee
They look at each other
Abby does not know quite what to make of him Well, 'm going back to the dorm
Is everything okay down there
In the way of accommodations,  mean She nods and waves goodbye 88 Down by the barn Bill teaches Chuck how to shoot dice
Chuck feigns interest
like to gamble, and  like to win
make no bones about it
Got to where the guys on Throop Street wouldn't even lag pennies with me on account of  was such a winner
'm starting out level with you, you understand
Have you ever been in trouble with the law
Bill looks around
Abby would think it impolitic of him to speak so openly with Chuck
Nothing they could make stick
My problem has always been not having the education
bullshitted my way into school
They gave me a test
It was ridiculous
got in fights
Ended up paying for a window
They threw me out
Don't blame them either
Still,  wanted to make something of myself
mean, guys look at you across a desk, you know what they're thinking
So  went in the mill
Couldn't wait to get in there
Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face
Didn't work out, though
No matter what you do, sometimes things just don't go right
It gets to you after a while
It gives you that feeling,  "Oh hell, what's the use
" (pause) My dad told me, forget what the people around you are doing
You got enough to worry about without considering what somebody else does
Otherwise you get fouled up
He used to say (tapping his temple) "All you got is this
" Only one day you wake up, find you're not the smartest guy in the world, never going to come up with the big score
really believed when  was growing up that somehow  would
worked like a bastard in that mill
felt all right about it, though
felt that somewhere along the line somebody would see  had that special gleam
"Hey, you, come over here
" So then 'd go
They are silent for a moment
You seem close to your sister
_ Yeah
We've been together since we were kids
You like her, don't you
(pause) She likes you, too
Chuck looks down, feeling transparent in the pleasure he takes at this news
89 The camera moves back to reveal Abby listening in from the other side of the barn
Her eyes are full of tears
How can Bill prize her so lightly
(o
s
) Don't get the wrong idea, though
90	   - Bill sits on the ground reading his Police Gazette
Abby walks up and without a word of explanation, slaps him
He jumps up and protests but quickly tapers off
She turns on her heel and leaves Bill sits down feeling misunderstood and abused
Does she think all this pleases him
91
() Chuck, out for a stroll with Abby and Ursula, shows them a fairy ring--a colony of mushrooms growing in a circle thirty feet across
heard you farmers were big and dumb
You aren't so big
Where do they learn how to
They're so darling
Can you eat them
Chuck nods
Abby snaps the mushrooms off flush at the ground
The music underscores this moment
She smiles at Chuck as she eats the dark earthy flesh
92 They pitch rocks at a post and exchange intimacies
Abby has grown more lively
You know sometimes  think there might have been a mixup at the hospital where
was born and that  could actually be the interesting daughter of some big financier
Nobody would actually know (pause) Are you in love with me, Chuck, or why are you always so nervous
(Stumbling) Maybe  am
must be
Why
On account of something 've done
Because you're so beautiful
What a nice thing to say
Look,  hit it
Did you see
She goes right on with their game, as though she attached no great importance to his momentous declaration
93	     - Chuck takes Abby's hand for the first time
Abby, startled, gives him a gentle smile, then lets go
What about my shoes
Aren't they pretty
U94EXT 94 Bill sits in a swing and plays a clarinet
The music flows out across the fields like a night breeze from the city
Abby, passing by, glowers at him, as though to ask if things are going along to his satisfaction
95	  () Jupiter, the Crab Nebula, the canals of Mars, etc
(o
s
) It turns out that people might have built them
Does that surprise you
(o
s
) No
96
- They are on a ridge opposite the Belvedere looking at the heavens through Chuck's telescope
Abby tingles with a sense of wonder
Chuck has opened a whole new world to her
You know so much
Would you bring my sister up here and tell her some of this stuff
97
'  - Nearby the grave of Chuck's father stands in helpless witness to Abby's deception
cottonwood tree rises against the cold blue sky, still as a statue
98	   - hand turns the pages of a book from Chuck's childhood
The text and  reading it are in Russian, the picture of Russian wood folk and animals
99
- Chuck's father rushes around marking off his property with stakes
100
- Chuck, ten years old, scours up the blade of a scythe
Family effects -- a big green stove, a bird cage, a table stacked with melons and a mirror--stand waiting in front of their half-finished sod house
We see no sign of Chuck's mother
101
- plow folds back the earth
The roots of the prairie grass twang like harp strings
The plowing done, his father sows the seed
Poverty requires that for a harrow he drag a tree branch in back of his ox
Over his shoulder he carries a rifle
Chuck blows a horn to chase the blackbirds off the seed
scarecrow is rigged to his back, to make him more intimidating
102	   - Chuck's father has caught smallpox
His face is covered with sores
Chuck wants to embrace him, but the father wards him off with a long stick as he passes on some last instructions in Russian
103
- The father stands on a ledge above the river, filling his pockets with rocks to weight him down
(

) My father caught smallpox when  was eleven
fished him out of the river and buried him myself
104
- Chuck drags his father's drowned body across a sand bar with a rope
105
'  - Chuck heaps the last bit of earth on his father's grave
The stove stands as a marker
(o

) So who raised you
(o
s
) Nobody
Did it myself
106	   -  ,  - Famished, Chuck eats from the carcass of a coyote
Some  watch him from a ridge
(o
s
) From the time you were a kid
How
Worked hard, didn't fool around
never saw a city
Never had time
All  ever did is work
He digs a post hole with a shovel twice his size
107	  - The camera pans across Chuck's vast domain
(o
s
) gave my life to that land
But what do  really have now
It'll still be here when 'm gone
It won't remember me
(pause) 'd give it all up for you
could make you happy, too,  think-if only you'd trust me
The camera settles on Ursula, playing with a dog on a seesaw Chuck has built her, then begins to move again, to a long shot of Chuck and Abby on the ridge by the telescope
Chuck is proposing
108 Abby has told him of the proposal
Bill broods over an unlit cigarette
Is this a great blessing or a great misfortune which has befallen them
He's asked me to marry him
never really thought he would
thought you wanted me to
Before  did
You cold
Abby is shivering
Bill takes off his jacket and slips it over her shoulders
What're you thinking
We've never done anything like this
Who'd know but you and me
Nobody
That's it, Ab
That's all that matters, isn't it
You talk like it was all right
It would be a crime
But to give him what he wants more than anything
Two, threeI months of sunshine
He'll never get to enjoy his money anyway
What're you talking about
We'd be showing him the first good times of his life
Maybe you're right
At each hint of consent from Abby, Bill feels he must press on
You know what they're going to stick on his tombstone
"Born like a fool, worked like a mule
" Two lines
Abby cannot say the proposal is devoid of principle
The idea of easing Chuck's imminent death gives them just the shade of a good motive
This would be a trade
What makes you think we're just talking about a couple of months Listen, the man's got one foot on a banana peel and the other on a roller skate
What can  say
We'll be gone before theI President shows up
He straightens his coat and smooths back his hair, to make her smile, without success
Hey,  know how you feel Hey,  know how you feel
feel just as bad
Like  was sticking an icepick in my heart
Makes me sick just to think about it
heart
Makes me sick just to held out a long time
could've taken the first guy with a gold watch, but  held out
(pause) told myself that when  found somebody, 'd stick by him
know
We're in quicksand, though
We stand around, it's going to suck us down like everybody else
(pause) Somewhere along the line you have to make a sacrifice
Lots of people want to sit back and take a piece without doing nothing
He waits to see how she will respond
Half of him wants her to turn him down flat
Abby is bewildered
Have  ever complained
Have  said anything that would make you think
You don't have to
hate it when  see you stooped over and them looking at your ass like you were a whore
personally feel ashamed
want to take a
45 and let somebody have it
(pause) We got to look on the bright side of this, Ab
Year from today we got a Chinese butler and no shit from anybody
(pause) Some people need more'n they have, some have more'n they need
It's just a matter of getting us all together
(pause) don't even know if  believe what 'm saying, though feel like we're on the edge of a big cliff
Abby looks at the ground for a moment, then nods
109 Chuck lies in bed, daydreaning
110 Ursula decorates Abby's hair with flowers and tells her how pretty she looks
111 The wedding takes place along the river
The Preacher has come back with his
chest of drawers serves as the altar
Benson is the best man--a joyless one
Ursula bounces around in a beautiful gown, looking for the first time like a young woman
The  practically outnumbers the guests:  from the local Mennonites, the  of a few surrounding towns decked out in sashes and medals, etc
112 Bill kisses the bride on the cheek
Each believes she is going through with this for the other's sake
They whisper back and forth
You know what this means, don't you
(he nods) We won't ever let each other down, will we
love you more than ever
always will
couldn't do this unless  loved you
113 The Acolytes ring an angelus bell
Chuck slips a sapphire on her finger
The Preacher, with outstretched arms, reminds them all that they are witness to a great event
114	 - ' Abby, frightened, looks off at the rolling sky, wondering how all thislooks in the sight of heaven
115
- From her pillow, Abby watches Chuck shyly enter the bedroom He comes over and sits down beside her You're wonderful
She is silent for a moment
The wind moans in the rafter No
But  wish  were
(pause) Listen
It sounds like the ocean
They smile at each other
116
- Bill watches the lights go out in the Belvedere
lump rises to his throat
How exactly did this happen
He sets his jaw, vowing not to give way to weakness or jealousy
This is the price they have to pay for a lasting happiness
117	  , ,
The next morning the newlyweds set off on their honeymoon
Chuck tells Bill to move his things from the dorm into the Belvedere
Abby, a basket of cucumbers under her arm, waves goodbye, angling her wrist so that Bill and Ursula can see the diamond bracelet Chuck has given her
118 They steer out across the prairie in a1912 Overland auto
Ursula runs after them, slaps the back fender and hops around on one foot, pretending the other was run over
Abby laughs
She knows this stunt
When they are gone Ursula turns fiercely on Bill hate you
What for
Don't be any more of a pain in the neck than you gotta be, okay
She swings at him with her fist
He pushes her away
_ You think  like this
'm doing it for her
You scum
Bill slaps her
Still think so
She throws a rock at him and runs off
He catches her, repenting of his meanness
know you can't understand this, but there's nothing  want except good things for Abby and you
Go ahead and hit me back
She hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can
Blood glistens on his lip
He does not say a word in protest
She looks at the wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him
119 Abby and Chuck disembark from a paddleboat steamer at a pier along the river
Chuck looks excited
120 Chuck and Abby have gone to Yellowstone Park for their honeymoon
Abby wades in a pool, wreathed by mists from the underworld
She carries a parasol to protect her from the sun
The trees in the vicinity are bare of leaves
121
- Chuck kneels with a box camera to photograph a large pair of antlers lying on the ground
122	   () This photo becomes the first in a series from their Yellowstone trip: fishermen displaying sensational catches by a river, buggies vying with early autos on rutted roads, the giant Beaupre who stood eight feet tall, etc
Each of the pictures bears a caption
Together they make a little story
(o
s
) We saw grizzly bears and a boar
The bears scared me the most
They eat garbage
(whispering) was so lonesome
missed you
123 Bill and Abby kiss, renewing old ties There was a mountain partly made of glass, too, but we didn't get to see it
And a petrified tree
We'll go back
Can we
Because there's a whole lot  didn't get to see
Bill straightens up
Chuck sits down on Abby's other side
124 They are having dinner on the lawn in front of the Belvedere
fine mesh net is spread above them like a tent to keep the insects out
Ursula sits on Bill's lap
He puts a hand up the back of her shirt and they play as though she were a ventriloquist's dummy
125 Bill displays a rabbit which he trained in their absence to perform a card trick
(o
s
) have you now, Ed
Only thing that can beat me is the ace of spades
(His name's Ed
) Her name's Abigail
Hungarian name
(mumbling) Andrew drew Ann
Ann drew Andrew
From the whole of a spread deck it picks the ace of spades
126 Abby and Chuck applaud
Ursula cranks up the victrola and puts on a record
Bill strokes the rabbit
You know why  like him
He minds his business and isn't full of baloney
Chuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first time, smiles
He's funny
Bill holds a plate up for Abby to see
Limoges china
Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit
They eat like pigs, with no respect for bourgeois manners
You have any talents, Chuck
No, but  admire people who do
That's not so
He can do a duck
Show them
Stand back
Get the women and children someplace safe
Chuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit of the occasion, does his imitation
The likeness is astonishing
Abby wipes a bit of food off his chin with her napkin
Bill drums on the table with his spoon
You saw how modest he was
How'd you get along so long without a woman
Chuck shrugs
Ursula makes a gesture as though to say by masturbating
Chuck does not see it
Billy laughs
Abby slaps her
The rabbit jumps out of the way
Don't you ever behave that way at table
(to Chuck) She's adopted
had nothing to do with her upbringing
'd trade her off for a yellow dog
(to Ursula) Now eat
You want to starve to death
That's what you'd like
Abby, overcome with impatience, throws her food to the dogs
Ursula catches a grasshopper and holds it out to Chuck
You give me a quarter to eat this hopper
Chuck does not reply
She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his look of shock
Bill throws down his fork
All right, okay, nobody's hungry anymore
What's the worst thing you ever did, Chuck
Besides missing church and that kind of stuff
Chuck thinks about this
Once  turned a man out in the middle of winter, without a cent of pay
For  all  know he froze
If you went that far, he must've deserved it
What else
He didn't
fired him out of resentment
Well, you're the boss, right
That's how it works
Got to make decisions on the spot
Anyway, this guy-what's his name
--if  know his kind, which  do, he's probably doing okay for himself, got a hand in somebody else's pocket for a change
Is that all
All  can think of right now
How about yourself
(to Abby) He wants to know
'm not going to count setting Blackie's on fire either
He had it coming
(con't) (pause) Once  punched a guy while he was asleep
Chuck looks surprised
Bill glances at Abby, worried that he might have said too much
was just kidding
Actually a guy  know did, though
Maybe he did it to you
Yeah
think so
Chuck gets up to ring for Miss Carter
Bill looks him up and down
Chuck, though older, is physically more imposing
Can  have the rabbit
Get serious
can win money with him
She licks his ear
He laughs
want that bunny
You still believe in Santa Claus
Bill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit
Ursula looks around to make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill
It bounces off his forehead
He retaliates with a pat of butter
127 Benson watches from another hill
He finds his displacement by these newcomers a humiliating injustice
128 Chuck returns to the table and draws Bill aside
Almost forgot
Here's your pay
Bill takes the envelope Chuck holds out
Then, in a spasm of conscience, he gives it back
hat's the matter
got no right to
Why
Bill is momentarily at a loss for words
haven't worked hard enough to deserve it
been goofing off Don't be silly
Give it to charity or something
(pause) Don't worry
always know to look out for myself, because ifI don't, who will
See what 'm driving at
Chuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here, and though he considers the gesture misguided and a little grand, admires him for it
129 They play a game with big lace pillows for bases
The rules are unintelligible
130 Bill is expert at throwing knives
As the others watch, he goes into a big windup and pins a playing card to the side of the house Everyone seems happy and congenial
They have reached some kind of plateau
Chuck's ignorance of the ruse does not cause the others to treat him with less respect
They seem themselves almost to have forgotten it
131	  '  - Benson collects the bases, a job he doubtless feels is beneath him
The Doctor's wagon, unmistakable even at such a great distance, thunders away from the Belvedere
132 Bill and Abby, waiting for Chuck to join them for a swim, look questioningly at each other 133 Ursula, in her bathing suit, jumps from a ledge above the river
She holds a big umbrella over her to see if it will act as a parachute
Bill and Chuck have a water fight
Abby wades in the shallows with a parasol
134	     - Abby is teaching Ursula how to kiss
Too like a mule
(trying again) What about that
It's got to be--how should  say
-- more relaxed
They laugh and kiss again
135 Farther up the slope Bill and Chuck wring out their bathing suits
Bill, thinking of the Doctor's visit, puts a hand on Chuck's shoulder
This time Chuck does not stiffen or ease it off
You okay
Sure
Why
Bill shrugs, beaming with admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets
appreciate everything you've done for Abby
really do
You've given her all the things she always deserved
got to admit you have
Chuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased
Bill snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them
136 Returning home they portray the movements of the sun, earth and moon relative to each other
Abby is the sun and keeps up a steady pace across the prairie
Chuck, the earth, circles her at a trot, giving instructions
Bill, with the most strenuous role of all--the moon-- runs around Chuck while he circles Abby
137
- They play golf on the infinite fairway of the prairie
Bill and Abby make a team against Chuck and Ursula
Nightingales call out like mermaids from the sea
You liking it here
(she nods) Feel good
(she nods) Feels good to feel good
He smiles, satisfied that he has done well by her, and lets a new ball slip down his pant leg to replace the one he played
138 Ursula, meanwhile, grinds Abby's ball into the dirt with the heel of her boot
She winks at Chuck
Chuck smiles back
What's your mother like
Her
Like somebody that just got hit on the head
She used to pray for me
Rosary, the stations, everything
"Hey, Ma,"  tell her, " ain't crippled
" They don't know, though
They say you're in trouble
They don't know
(pause) My dad, the same way
Thought the world owed him a living
He drowned in Lake Michigan
139 They walk home
Bill stays behind to work on his strokes
Ursula sends the dogs after the balls
You shag them, not those dogs
They might choke or run off with them
Who made you the boss
Shag them yourself
Listen, some day all this is going to be mine
Or half is
Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not give him a lot of gas
You want to do what he says
He steps off a few paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath
This reminds me of where  came from
left when  was six
That's when  met your sister
He looks at the land with a new sense of reverence
He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it between his palms
can't wait to go back to Chicago, bring them down for a visit
Blackie and them
There's a lot of satisfaction in showing up people who thought you'd never amount to anything
(pause) 'd really like to see this place run right
got a lot of ideas 'd like to try out
140	' In the distance he sees Chuck put his arm on Abby's waist and whisper something in her ear
This intimacy rubs him the wrong way
He gives his clubs to Ursula and starts after them
141 Bill finds them in the kitchen
Chuck goes into the other room to look for something
Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale
Bill kisses her
Nobody's all bad, are they
met a few  was wrong on, then
Suddenly they hear Chuck's footsteps
They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back
They chat as though nothing had happened
have a headache
probably should've worn a hat
Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation
No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast
He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back
Together they walk into the living room
You ever see anybody out here
Not after harvest
How often do you get into town
Once or twice a year
You're kidding
He must be kidding
Why do  need to
Bill catches Abby's eyes
He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter
Relaxation
Look at the girls
Opportunity to see how other folks live
Chuck looks at him blankly
None of these reasons seems to carry much weight for him
Bill turns to Abby
Somebody is nuts
don't know whether it's him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts
Why don't  fix tea
Maybe  should help you
He follows her back into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her
She pushes him away and turns to making the tea
You're worse than an Airedale
(raising her voice) You want jasmine or mint
(o
s
) Mint
Bill lifts up the back of her dress and looks under it, testing the breadth of his license
She slaps it back down
He lifts it again, standing on his right to
She glowers at him
Don't do that
(calling to Chuck) How much sugar
Why not
'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of
(o
s
) One spoonful
Bill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy
book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for
His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins
As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick
Where's the candlestick
Chuck shrugs
Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside
He's a strange one
(nodding) Once he named his shoes like they were pets
It was a joke,  guess
142 Bill drops the candlestick down the well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist
He looks up
Benson has seen him
143
- Outside the saplings thrash in the wind
144
- Abby wakes up with a gasp
What's the matter
had a dream
What about
(pause) Was something after you
forgot it already
145	  () The camera falls through the clouds as though in a lost fragment of Abby's dreams
146 Benson sulks by the barn
Chuck approaches him
You come down here a lot, don't you
Always when you're mad
You never change
It might not be my place to say this, sir, but  don't think they're honest people
He gets on your nerves, doesn't he
He always has
(cutting in) Now don't say something you're going to regret
Why should  regret it
think they're a pair of scam artists, sir
Let me tell you what 've seen, and you judge for yourself
Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him
Maybe you'd be happier taking over the north end till spring
don't say this in anger
We've been together a long time, and 've always felt about you like, well, close
It just might work out better is all
Less friction
Don't believe me, then
You shouldn't
But why not check it out, sir
Hire a detective in Chicago
It won't cost much
What's there to lose
Chuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on
For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up
Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it
You're talking about my wife
And so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme
Maybe  better pack my things
Benson turns and walks off
Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself
What has this man done but a friend's duty
147 Abby sits at the dresser in the master bedroom
Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck's hat on for size
What're you doing in here
Just walked in through the door, like any other white man
On the bureau he finds a pistol
He aims it out the window
All this will soon be theirs
Smith and Wesson
You ought to see one of these plow into a watermelon
She holds a hairbrush out for him to see
He looks it over and  gives it back without comment
He finds a stain on the tabletop
Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass
Actually  don't blame them
He walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances
Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror
She blows a kiss at herself
Don't say  did that
The bed should be over next to the window
Where the view is
Bill is already making plans for life after Chuck's demise
Maybe we build on a balcony
(pause) First the birds go
The peacocks are crowing outside
They burst out laughing
Bill checks the mussed bedsheets
That doesn't concern you
Why not
(no reply) Look,  know you've got urges
It wouldn't be right if you didn't
Abby stands up, angry
You think  enjoy it
Lower your voice
You act like it's harder on you than me
never want to talk about this again
Bill, consoled, holds an eyelet blouse against the light
bet he enjoys looking at you in this
thought you liked it
He likes it, too, is what 'm saying
Well, it's the style
see
What do you want me to wear in this heat
blanket
That's your problem
Abby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it
Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned
told you someday we'd be living in style
When this whole thing is over 'm going to buy you a necklace with diamonds as big as that
He holds out the tip of his little finger
They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe
You're cute
Maybe a shade too cute
She touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him
This is terrible for us both
(o
s
) Abby
They jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs
Down in a minute
She kisses Bill
148 Bill sneaks out the back door of' the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well
They look at each other in silence for a moment
Benson's horse stands beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle
know what you're doing
What're you talking about
That boy's like a son to me
Don't you forget it
know what you're doing
Benson gets on his horse, turns and rides off
Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house
She and Bill exchange a look
149 Bill finds the others around front
Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a peach
Ursula plays the guitar
Little by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was
Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child
Goats sleep on the divan
Archery targets hang from the side of the house
The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting
Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease prevails
Nice fall day
Wish 'd said that
(to Abby) Watcha doing
Eating a green peach
'Spect to die any minute
Listen,  had a great idea
Let's spend Christmas in Chicago
Break up the old routine
Rhino's never been to a baseball game or a horse race
know guys one month off the boat that have
Don't even speak the English language, but they eat it right up
(pause) You're just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around raising hell
No offense to the little woman
He bows apologetically to Abby
She pinches a dead leaf off a plant
Abby says that in the poor section people eat cats
Did you, sis
Well, there's always something doing
can't begin to tell you
State and Madison
Mmmm
Lights everywhere
You'd love it
It can be rough, though
Rough
Listen, you can't walk down the street without somebody reaching in your pocket
You've got to keep your coat like this and poke them away
Bill got shot once
The bullet's still in him
Really
Doctor said he took it out, but  never saw it
Hurt like a bastard
You got no idea how it hurt
Suddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going
They won't mess with you, though
Big fella like you
can see it now
He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners
"Hey, hey, hey
Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle, moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step and making all the virgins run for cover
Why, it's Big Rhino, the King of Beasts
He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk
" Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is
You are big, aren't you
Sunny Jim
You must've had a real moose for an old lady
Take it easy
But Chuck holds none of this against him
He knows it comes from respect
So what do you say
(pause) What a sorry outfit
Bunch of old ladies
You better stay behind
Your mammas'd probably get upset
But when the time comes, 'm out of here
Hit the road, Toad
Ursula passes the sandwiches around until there is just one left, Miss Carter's
While the others are talking, she scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle
Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's
Ever seen a match burn twice
No
Bill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with the hot ember, causing him to yank it away
That's old
Chuck starts to cough
Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs
Miss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich
She jumps up and rushes back into the house
Chuck frowns
Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues: You ever thought of putting in some fescue here
Some fescue grass
Of course, it might not take in this soil
Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck
You ready
still have a little of this sore throat
Where you going, though
To kill a hog
What's the necktie for
(pause) Or does it just come in handy
Keeps the stain of guilt off
Chuck nods goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him
Bill sighs with admiration
try and try
What a splendid person
've never met anybody like him
Splendid people make you nervous
They do
breathe a sigh of relief when they step outside the room
Bill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the Police Gazette
They are silent for a moment
guy ate a brick on a bet
Must of busted it up first with a hammer
Guy in New York City
Where else
(Jumping up) Anybody want to bet me  can't stick this knife in that post
Nobody takes him up on this
Abby leafs through the Sears catalogue, her mind dancing with visions of splendor
150 Pictured
in the catalogue are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats
grasshopper is perched on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb
151 Bill watches her run her finger slowly around the closed heart of a rose
Suddenly they both look at each other
They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a hog being led to slaughter
152	   - Chuck has tied the hog's feet to the inverted legs of  the stool
153 Ursula, off by herself, skips rope
flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze
From the branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a barrel
154
- ' Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags
Fed up, she is leaving the bonanza
Chuck tries in vain to appease her
She keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight course for the railroad tracks
Chuck will now be alone at the Belvedere with the newcomers and no other point of reference
155 Later that afternoon, Bill catches sight of Abby's underthings rustling on the clothes line
156 That evening he watches her from behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door
She nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him
157 Chuck looks impatiently through a drawer
can't find anything around here
Last week it was my gloves; this week my talc
What's going on
He stands and watches Abby get ready for bed
She fills him with a deep adoration
He feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven
You're beautiful
You don't think my skin's too fair
He comes up behind her and touches her long hair
You're smart, too, aren't you
know what the Magna Carta is
Can  help you brush it out
Not right now
She is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this
Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own
His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects the conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more
What makes you so distant with me
Distant
don't mean to be
You know what 'm talking about,  though
You aren't that way with your brother
158 Bill, eavesdropping in the attic above them, surveys Chuck's dusty heirlooms
(o
s
) It must be something 'm doing
wish you'd tell me what, though
159 These gentle endearments, so rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply
She throws herself in his arms
Oh, Chuck  Please forgive me
Does it mean anything that 'm sorry
(pleased) But  don't blame you
Did  make it sound that way
You should
You have a right to
It's just that sometimes  feel  don't know you well
You don't
It's true
think you love me better than before, though
She rubs her cheek against his hands
Daily she feels warmer toward him
How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even she cannot say
160	   -  - The night throbs with crickets
Bill cracks open the bedroom door
Chuck lies asleep in a shaft of moonlight next to Abby
He hesitates a moment, but a strange compulsion drives him on
He has never done anything so dangerous, or had so little idea why
161
- Abby wakes up to find him staring her in the face
He kisses her
Chuck stirs
Abby signals they should go outside
162
- They sneak out of the Belvedere
The night is warm
You're no good
Mmmm
But  love you
can't stand it any more
This is just so cruel
We're both no good
've got to get drunk with you, Bill
You know what  mean
Drunk
Bill wags a bottle
The dogs, awakened, bay from the kennel
They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the house, then dart off toward the fields
plaster lawn dwarf seems to watch them go
163
- They run through the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting
The moon makes Abby's nightgown a ghostly white
We can never do this again, though
Okay
It really is too dangerous
This one night
He toes a sodden old shoe
Hey,  found a shoe
164	, ,  - The shoe gleams in the moonlight
Coyotes yelp from the hilltops
scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky
The waving fields of wheat have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with purple morning glories
Odd, large stakes are planted among them
165	  - You want me to spin you around
She nods okay
He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to--until they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand
166
- They lie by the river looking at the great dome of stars
Bill wants to believe things are the same between them as before
So does Abby--but she knows better
Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a thousand years ago mean, with all we know
Electricity, the telephone, radio, that kind of stuff
They'd never figure out how we came up with it all
Maybe they'd kill us
She looks at him, and they laugh
You sleepy
This is the first time we slept together in a while, Bill
You like it
Of course
Kiss me, then
It's so sweet to be able to kiss you when  want to
167 Before the marriage his lovemaking was gentle and soft
Now it has a brutal air, as though he were asserting his right to her for the last time
168	   - Dawn is breaking
Abby jumps to her feet, alarmed
They have slept too long
169
- They have run back to the Belvedere
It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch, yawning and stretching
Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead
Abby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the other
Luckily, they have come up from the back
Abby
've been looking all over for you
Where have you been
While she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the house
It has been a close call
Watching the ducks
Didn't you sleep well
No
170	   (  ,   ) Abby looks sympathetically at Chuck
Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip
(o
s
) Chuck saw Ursula balance an egg
He begged her to repeat this trick, but she wouldn't
171 Chuck tries to reduplicate Ursula's feat
Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face
We wonder if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him
172 Bill watches the Doctor walk out the front door and down the steps to his wagon
Chuck follows, smiling
(o
s
) The Doctor came
Chuck looked pleased for a change
173
- ' The Doctor's wagon rolls off across the prairie
(o
s
) Tomorrow the President passes through
Plans have changed, and he can't stop
174
- They have come down to the railroad tracks to watch the President pass through
We should have brought a flag
Does she have time to ride back and get it
Abby and Bill hold hands
Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays
They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable
175	  - The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye
Bill's heart pounds with excitement
Chuck holds Abby by the waist
Ursula waves a handkerchief
They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate
Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a  in a frock coat salutes them with his cane
The train has quickly vanished into the declining sun
Everything is quiet again
Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks
Did you see him wave
He was shorter than  expected
How do you know it was him
saw
He had a hat on
You didn't understand my question
They walk back to the buggy
Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks
You know what 'm going to do with this
Take it home and put it in vinegar
That was the President, shortie
Wake up
Bill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy
She is laughing about something or other
His hand lingers for a moment on hers
She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses it against her breast
Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to
176 Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite
Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony
Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill
He sits by himself observing a spear of grass
Abby drops off
Ursula rides off over the hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill
You look deep in thought
She touches his cheek
He brushes her hand away
What's the matter
Nothing
There's nothing wrong
No
What're you so mad about then
Who said  was mad
Can't  be alone once in a while without everybody getting all worked up
You're the only person getting worked up
Some buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill
Abby looks at them
They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs
Chuck says they're good for the grass
(pause) Stop giving me that look
You can't keep your hands off him these days
What're you talking about
You know
haven't touched him
How about the other night
saw you, Abby
The other night by the tracks
If only you wouldn't lie
Really, there's some things about you 'm never going to understand
forgot
Anyway it doesn't matter
What are you doing, always trying to trap me
Bill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation
can't stand it any more
It's just too degrading
(pause) You and him
Why do  have to spell it out
thought it would be all over in a month or two
Guy might go another five years
We've got to clear out, Abby
They stare at each other in silence for a moment
Why stop now
(pause) We've come this far
What
You heard me
Why stay
Go ahead and tell me
'm standing here
Bill trembles with shock and anger
The buffalo cast aware glances at them
You want us to lose everything
'm telling you  can't stand it
You're weak then
What about all 've been through
(pause) And what about him
It would be the worst thing we could do
Worse than anything so far
It would break his heart
Bill is silent for a moment
You're getting to like him, aren't you
It would kill him
Leaving now would be just cruel
Would it
So what's it matter to somebody in his shape
(pause) In fact you're just leaving us one way out
What're you talking about
Murdering him
Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite
You watch and see
had to let it go
One of them started following me, and  threw a rock at him
had a bunch stored in my pocket
They take off running after her
177 As they approach the Belvedere, Bill sees Chuck standing on the front steps
Suddenly angry, he draws Abby to him and in plain view kisses her on the lips
He can see you
Bill nods; he knows
Abby runs ahead, angry and alarmed
Don't you believe in being honest
178 Abby bounds up the steps
Chuck has bent his mind to understand all this as mere sibling love, but here is the greatest test so far
Aren't you going to kiss me
Why
Today's my birthday
Chuck gives her a kiss, glad to put aside his suspicions
179	  , Tails level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in a rope
Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with fear
180 Chuck has taken Bill out bird-hunting
They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns
Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep up the grass
think so
Why
Bill shrugs
Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife
He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters
want to get her something nice for Christmas
Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice
(thoughtfully) She likes to draw
Maybe some paints
Nothing too expensive-- she might want to exchange it
Maybe a coat
She likes to show off sometimes
She's sweet that way
wish  knew how to make her happy
Nothing  do really seems to
That's how they are
They like to make you work for it
couldn't ever figure out why
(pause) Sometimes you can't go wrong, though
You know that one Abby showed you a picture of
Elizabeth
took her cherry
know
You told me
Actually,  didn't, but  could have
The point 'm making is you've got to understand how they operate
Get them thinking you can take it or leave it, you're usually okay
Suddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point
At Chuck's hiss they sink into the  grass
Bill looks at Chuck's exposed back
Nobody would know
It could be made to seem like a hunting accident
He cocks the hammer of his shotgun
His heart pounds wildly
Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs
(o
s
) All right, put them up, girl
The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock
All at once the quail explode out of hiding
Bill jumps at the noise
Chuck fires twice
Two birds fall
The retriever notes where
Chuck turns around
Why aren't you shooting
left you those two on the left
They caught me off guard
You have to keep your gun up
Chuck walks ahead
The music builds a mood of tension
Bill takes a practice shot into the ground
Bill looks around
There is nobody in sight
He turns the sights on Chuck's back
It would be simple enough
Though only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss
Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey
"Pheo
Pheo
" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass
The mother bird utters a low "all is well
" One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return
Bill holds his breath
His finger moves inside the trigger guard
He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch
Three more birds shoot out of the grass
Chuck fires
At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low
He does not have the heart
Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground
Both barrels go off
Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned
Bill is shaking like a leaf
What's the matter
What are you so upset about
They surprised me again
Chuck sends a retriever after the fallen birds, then--in an unprecedented gesture-he puts his arm over Bill's shoulder to comfort him, like an older brother
181 They return home, the day's kill slung over the back of a Shetland pony
182 They sit on stools in the back yard plucking the birds
You like to box
never have
Just wondering
got a pair of gloves  brought with me
Bill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed down
Abby bought me this at Yellowstone
Chuck shows Bill his knife
Bill reads a name off the handle
That's what she calls you
'Chickie
' He gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger
Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf
Doesn't bother me
Should it
Bill throws down the pheasant he was plucking
What's the matter
Don't let her fool you, too
She warms up to whoever says please and thank you
What's the matter
Bill, still angry at himself, considers telling him
You really want to know
He would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it
He must find out by accident
Luckily they are interrupted as Ursula runs up, pointing over her shoulder
pair of three-wing airplanes sputters into view low overhead
One seems to be having engine trouble
183 The planes set down in a nearby field
"Toto's Flying Circus" is emblazoned on the wings
184 Five  clamber out, members of a seedy vaudeville troupe
They swagger around, filthy with oil from the backwash of the props, looking more like convicts than entertainers
Their  is an excitable Levantine
How long it take to fix
Very mooch time
Now look where you hab stuck us
Salaupe
You forget who  aim
Bill, Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like the Indians at Cortez's ships
185
- and a   perform first separately, then jointly as a slap act
weaves sentences of absolute nonsense
After a moment a black and white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight
The troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper
of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand
silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early cinema
Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this
(o
s
) How'd they do that
Where'd he go
There must be a wire
Etc
He steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind
Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago
186
- Ursula serves dinner
She is excited by the visitors' city ways
They are bored with her, all except the youngest, , a young pilot in a white scarf
We never hear a thing out here
It's like being on a boat in the middle of a lake
You see things going on, but way far away, with no voices
Maybe time to clear out
George puts his hand on hers
She snatches it away
What's the matter
Aren't  your type or something
The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding
balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight
Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader
You do not understand, sir
am saddled with asses, yaays
, who once played the Albert Hall You
hear that
He called me 'sir
' In their gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby's leg
187	   - Chuck looks on from the shadows, no longer just puzzled but angry
He has watched them behave this way a dozen times before, but tonight, with other people around, he must see it more directly
188
- George tells Ursula a joke
She dissolves in giggles before he can finish, as though amazed at his power to dispense illusion
189
- Chuck, alone in the darkened living room, calms himself down by breathing through a rubber mask into a respirator
Joyful noises reach him from outside
190	'  - The next morning Chuck looks down out his bedroom window
The troupe is packing to leave
Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby
What's going on, Abby
She does not respond
He yanks the sheet off
She is wearing a nightgown
She looks up and frowns
This is the first time she has ever seen him this way
You know what  mean
Between you and Bill
have no idea
(interrupting) Something's not right, and  want to know what
Abby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive
She has no other choice
Say it out loud
What're you worried about
(pause) Incest
It just doesn't look right
don't know how brothers and sisters carry on where you come from, but
(interrupting) Did you ever have a brother
Then who are you to judge
Maybe if you had, you'd understand
Anyway, times have changed while you've been stuck out in this weed patch
We're ************************line missing**************** She puts on a robe and walks out
Her last argument has worked best
Chuck never imagined he was in step with the times
191 Abby slips out the front door
She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads off to find Bill
The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night's leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds, etc
sits off by himself, playing a French horn
192 She finds Bill by the dorm throwing a switchblade in the ground, a toothbrush in his mouth
have to talk to you
Look what  traded off those clowns
For a bushel of corn
She draws him by the arm behind a wall
She is trembling with fear
Chuck is suspicious
Chickie you mean
So what
Really
This is the first time he's ever been like this
'm scared
All this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not like
What for
Why're you so worried what he thinks
He could kill us
want to live a long time, okay
just got started and  like it
Bill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more
You might take a little responsibility here
You got us into all this
Did
Well, it never would've come up if you hadn't led him on
Led Chickie on
Is that the best you can do
Knowing you it probably is
You've made a mess of our lives, okay
Don't pretend it was my fault
Bill combs his hair to calm himself down
Why's this guy still hanging on like a goddamn snapping turtle
Because of you
Boy, this was a great idea
Right up there with Lincoln going down to the theater, see what's on
Keep your voice down
Don't give me that
When a guy's getting screwed, he's got a right to holler
You're such a fool
What
Nothing
heard what you said
Then why'd you ask
Oh, how did  ever get mixed up with you
Abby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little
You've gone sweet on him
You have, haven't you
Abby hesitates
Bill throws his knife away
admire him
He's a good man
Broad shoulders
know
Very high morals
Why can't he talk faster
It's like waiting for a hen to lay an egg
You wouldn't understand, though
He's not like you
You don't know how people feel
You only think of yourself
What's going on between us, Abby
Think about that
If you figure it out, tell me, will you
'd appreciate it
(pause) Lord, but you do come on
You talking like this, used to play around right under his nose
Somebody  met in a bar, remember
Or maybe you walked in, thought it was a church
Well, 've had it
'm clearing out
You understand
They look at each other for a moment
Go ahead
This is not what he expected to hear
But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down
Okay
He looks at her for a moment
He cannot be dealt with this way
He turns and walks off
193 Ursula flirts with George
He slips a hand inside her blouse
She bats it away
194 Bill stands on the ground below the master bedroom
Chuck leans out the window above him
Peacocks roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope
The vaudevillians are loading up their planes
Abby watches from the porch
'm going away for a while
They're giving me a lift
What for
He shrugs
'm wearing one of your shirts
Let me take it off for you
Never mind
got my own
Just wasn't any clean today
Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity
Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time
One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder
195 Bill gives Ursula his money
We get split up for any reason, you spend that on school
196 The vaudevillians are ready to take off
Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if today's break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture
With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit
Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on
What's eating him
Abby shrugs and walks down to Ursula
Why aren't we going with him
What for
To sleep in boxcars
197 The planes set their wheels in the furrows, rev their engines and wobble off into the sky
Ursula waves goodbye to George
198
- Winter has come
Snow falls across the breadth of the plains, on the river and the dark sleeping fields
199
(  ) - Chuck and Abby skim over the snow in a gaily painted sleigh (or ice boat)
She is wrapped up snug in a buffalo robe, her feet on a hot brick
Pigs forage along the fences
200 They inspect a cave with a kerosene lantern
Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of preserves
Abby drops a stone into a dark pit
Two seconds pass before it hits the bottom
Probably that's the first noise down there for thousands of years
She speaks as though she had done it a favor
He puts his hand on hers
She presses it against her chest
You ever wish you could turn your heart off for a second and see what happened
201 Views of backlit gems, stalactites, salamanders in their cold dark pools, hidden springs and other mysteries of nature
(o
s
) Maybe nothing would
They round a corner and come upon an underground waterfall
It flows out of darkness back into darkness
202 Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of panting, sweating
On their shoulders they carry the huge barrel of a cannon
With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a forge
203 Bill stands on the corner of a big city street, stamping his feet against the cold
He tries to catch a pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts out of the way
204 Bill has an improvised conversation with a   who has run away from home
He asks her where she comes from, whom she belongs to, etc
She tells him of her hopes, then passes on
Bill gives her all the money in his pocket
205 Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of Babylon and Nineveh in a book about the Near East
Ursula sits with a world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling
No doubt this was Abby's idea
Abby copies from a small plaster model of a Roman bust
She wants painfully to improve herself
206
- Abby and Chuck skate around a bonfire on a frozen prairie lake, carrying torches to guide them through the dark
207 Bill sits in a cold flophouse trying to write a letter
After a moment he wads it up and throws it away
208 Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a walk outside the Belvedere
The snow is gone
Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff
All at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party
It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop
Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look
Prairie chickens
That means winter's broken
Really
Where are they
You hardly ever see them
They stand and listen to the birds
There is a sense of the earth stirring back to life
Abby breathes in with a wild joy and hugs Chuck tightly by the waist
209 Bill is talking with a  in the hallway of a tenement
can't seem to get my mind on anything
thought, when  came off that place, boy, they'd better get all the women out of town that day, you know
Somewhere safe
But you know what  do
sleep, nothing but sleep
approaches them with a hard-luck story
Okay, here's a quarter, but give me some entertainment, okay
Not this old song and dance
While the Panhandler performs, Bill looks around
Two  have appeared in the entryway talking with the
Bill edges out the back door and down the steps, as though they might be after him
He walks briskly down the alley without looking back
210	   (  ) Chuck holds a handful of seed under his nose
His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell
Into this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary
211 Chuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather
Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea
Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them
Each tows a fourteen-gang plow
third tractor follows, putting in the seed
Ursula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle
Every acre of ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation
(o
s
) They put in the wheat the other day
This will be the biggest year ever
There was a scare when a locust turned up
Luckily it wasn't the bad kind
212 The plows have turned up a hibernating locust
Chuck stands by the tractor, inspecting it under a magnifying glass
The creature nestles like a fossil in the black earth
(o
s
) They sleep in the ground for seventeen years, then crawl up around the end of May and spend a week flying around before they die
Chuck kicks up the dirt around the plow, looking for others
Benson, back from exile, looks concerned
Nothing to worry about
Just shows the land is good
213 Various wonders of the prairie:  a charred tree, a huge mastodon bone, a flowering bush, a pelican, the rusted hulk of an ancient machine, etc
(o
s
) How strange this new world is
You walk out in the morning sometimes to find a lake rippling where the day before solid land was
214 Chuck has laid out the outline of a 50-foot boat in whitewashed stones
He walks around the imaginary deck showing Abby where the cabins will be
(o
s
) Chuck wants to build a boat and take us off to Java, which he's never seen
215 Ursula goes out to the fields with an organist named whom Chuck has hired to play for the crops
He and Ursula seem to hit it off
(o
s
) Last month he brought in a kid to play the organ
He claims it helps the crops grow
Personally  doubt it
216 They have brought an organ out into the middle of the fields
Ursula pumps up the bellows
Joey sits in front of the keyboard and shoots his cuffs
His fingers strike the keys
217	,    -    () Clouds build in huge toadstools
Thunder rolls across the plains
rain begins to fall
The music seems to work a magic on the crops, to draw them forth
The seeds germinate in the darkness of the soil
Water finds its way down
Roots, tiny hairs at first, spread and grow
218	, Rude dolls fixed at the ends of pointed sticks--agricultural fetishes that Chuck's father brought with him from the Old World--stand around the field to join in aiding the crops
219 Flags and bunting adorn the porch for Independence Day
Ursula sets off some fireworks
(o
s
) Time has flown, and once again harvest is near
220
() The bald earth has, as though by a mystery, become a sheet of grain, its green already fading to gold
The music dies away, replaced by the whirr of summer crickets
(o
s
) It will be a year that we have been here
The camera holds and holds on the fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute
Seagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers
221
- Ursula takes curling irons from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and applies them to Abby hair
Suppose  never fall in love, Abby
Don't be silly
Everybody does
What do you think all those songs are about
You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away
Throw what away
You know, your chances
It's too hard to explain to a little squirrel like you
That sounded just like Bill
Don't you miss him
Sometimes
From her tone, however, we sense that she finds it easier with him gone
222 Abby whispers something to Chuck in bed that evening
You ever said that to anybody else
She giggles
You're lying, aren't you
Well, go right on lying
The camera moves to the window, beneath the eave
Outside, peacocks strut back and forth
223 Bill rides an Indian motorcycle along a muddy road back to the bonanza
His rabbit is strapped to the back
He stops for a moment to look at the new fields
224
- ' Abby sings to herself as she beats out a carpet
Bill appears on the ridge behind her
Hope leaves him like a ghost
She looks happily settled into a new life with Chuck
All at once she turns around
Bill
She rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill
She is different
She looks different
The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish
Her hair is nicely coiffed
Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now
How's everybody been
Including me
Okay
Gee, you look good
Thanks
And Chuck
Still the same
Actually  didn't mean it that way
(pause) came back to help out with the harvest
He feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse
But he loves her
He aches with love
He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance
Evidently it was more
thought about you a lot
Wrote you a letter, but it was no good, so  tore it up
How'd you come
Train
He looks her up and down
Nice dress
'm glad you like it
He admires her garden
His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old feeling is not there
This is new, too
The daffodils were already here,  but  put in the rest
You really do like them
At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around
She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses
've missed you
thought about you every day
You should've written
Did Abby show you what she got
Abby scowls at Ursula
With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace
(apologetically) For Christmas
Plus a music box
He spoils her
Why don't they spoil me, too
(whispering) You oughta be glad you didn't have to spend the winter
You would've gone crazy
225 The winter's peace is gone
Abby is sick with fear
Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be honest with Bill
The truth of her feelings would crush him
Moreover, there's no telling how he might react
He could ruin everything, even get them killed
226 Chuck looks on from behind the bedroom window
227 They dine in awkward silence
Benson has joined them
Abby, for all her winter's polish, still eats with the back of her knife
How was Chicago
Great
How's everybody doing
Okay
They are silent for a moment
Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back
How's Blackie
Still hasn't wised up
Know what  mean
He asked how you were doing, though
(pause) told him
Ran into Sam, too
He'd been in a fight
Oh yeah
Bill can see that her interest is only polite
He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot
The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold
His nose was like this
He pushes his nose to one side
Ursula and Abby laugh
228 Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond
Ursula orders a dog around
Look at this dog mind me
Sit
You've got to say it like hitting a nail
Has she asked you anything about me
No
Ursula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back
She waits to see what he will do
He gets up and after a short chase catches her
He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her
What'd you do that for
Bill wonders himself
To get revenge on Abby
He touches her breast
Don't
Why not
Cause there's nothing there
can be the judge of that
Then ask first
He kisses her neck
Nobody has to know but us  chickens
(pause) What do  have to say to convince you
You tell me, 'll say it
What makes you think  would
Nothing
She giggles and kisses him back
But guilt has caught up with him
He cannot go ahead
What's the matter
No reply
Maybe it would be wrong
(disappointed) You still love her, don't you
Bill hums a rock off toward the horizon
should've gone in the church, like my father was after me to
229	'  -    - Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi
The sound of their voices is muffled
The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching
She is comfortable with Chuck now
Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart
He wants to rush in and drag her away
230
- Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling
After a moment he withdraws into the darkness
231
( ) Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases
Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store
Ursula is with her
The  all speak German
Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress
The signs are old German script
Two  carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church
232 Abby walks up with Ursula
Listen, 'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon
Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay
Ursula runs off
Bill opens the door, and she gets in
233
( ) They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town
Abby smokes as Bill checks the radiator
Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop
How you been doing
Me
Fine
We don't talk so much these days
know
She knows what he wants
She cannot give it anymore
said a lot of stupid things before  went off
(politely) forgot about it already
Bill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge
You've forgiven me
There was nothing to forgive
He holds a bottle of liquor out to her
What're you worried about
She takes a swig
He laughs
She laughs back
So how'm  doing with you
Fine
He takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird
What's happened
She shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair
She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is
probably ought to leave
will
Already
You just got here
She hasn't really contradicted him
He leans forward as though to kiss her
She lets him
She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right
Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away
Where you going
He reaches out to catch her
She breaks away and starts to run
He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town
Why'd you have to come back
'm not going to hurt you
only want to talk with you
She stops and hides her face in her hands
He gently pulls them away
didn't come back to make trouble for you
guess we were fooling each other to think it could last
mean, What was  offering youanyhow
ride to the bottom
Looking at you now, in the right  clothes and everything,  see how crazy  was and--well,  understand
It's okay
sort of cut my own throat, actually
Her eyes close and her legs give in
Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise
She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance
234 Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her
He looks to see that she is okay
He picks a fox-tail out of her hair
Her dress has worked up toward her knees
He pulls it back down
He wants to caress her face but hesitates
How'd we let it happen, Abby
We were so happy once
Why didn't we starve
love you so much
What have1 done
You're so beautiful
What have  done
He touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road
He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland
235
- ' They have arrived back at the Belvedere
'm sorry
She touches his face in a surge of sympathy
What has she done to him
He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door
236 The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere
Chuck has seen them
Hot tears leap to his eyes
Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them
Now it all looks different
237	'  ( ) He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary
None of them is any consolation now
Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past
238 Abby notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door
You want something from me
No
Will you hand me that magazine
He gives her the magazine she wants
What's the matter
He seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs
239 He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices
The jostled birds raise a fuss
240 He runs into Bill on the front porch
've been looking for you
have to take off again, real soon here, and
Chuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him
They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on
Bill seems puzzled
241 Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields
The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in
He sits down and rests his head against a furrow, powerless to think
The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads
He puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal
He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows
242
- Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza
We do not see where they come from
They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed
Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn
Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed
243 The animals sense it first
The buffalo move off in a mass
The horses become uncontrollable
One runs around the barn in a panic
Bill watches it, puzzled
Two peacocks have a fight
dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch
The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills
244 Everything seems normal in the fields
Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing
As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until
245 Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times
They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc
246 Their eyes are dumb and implacable
They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own
247 Little by little they gather in numbers
Ursula first sees one on the drainboard
She swats it with a newspaper
Others sprout up
One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove
This method is too slow
She begins to use her fingers
She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile
At last claustro-phobia seizes her
She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight
248 In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another
She jumps out of bed and goes to the window
The locusts pelt against the pane like shot
She throws the bolt
Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass
She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in
They are free to enter
249 Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing
Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration
250	   - Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion
His hair is seething with them
251
- Panic hits the bonanza
Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and other noisemakers to scare them off
Some pray
Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host
couple get into a fistfight
storm flag is run up the flagpole
tractor blasts out an
The peacocks huddle under the stoop
252 Chuck gives Benson his orders
Offer fifty cents a bushel for them
Get out the reapers
See what you can harvest
253 The locusts snap through the air
Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag
One has flown into his mouth
254 They jam up the gears of the machinery with the crush of their bodies
255 Abby throws a sheet over herself, but they get in under it
She thrashes around madly, then with a cry goes limp
256 Benson reports back to Chuck
team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over
We can't get the machines out
They're jamming up the gears
There's a good chance they'll pass on south, though
Unless
unless a wind comes up
What happens then
They'll set down and walk in
257 The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc
Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble
Bill looks away from a tree for a second
When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness
258
, The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir
Little by little the wind picks up
dust devil spins across the yard
The grass lists by the well
power line moans
259 As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants
The roar of their wings is deafening
The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy
260	    - And these are but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud on the horizon
261
- dump bushels of the insects into a bonfire
with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed
262	  - The wind has picked up
Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen  to investigate the extent of the damage
The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles
263	   - Chuck inspects the grain
There's nothing we can do but wait
They're either going to take it all or they're not
He covers his face with his hands
The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal
Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights
Bill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders
Come on
They might still lift
Hey, 've seen a wind like this lay down and die
Don't give up now
(ignoring him) We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south
He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do
Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze
Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat
What're you doing
Watch it
What're you, crazy
There's still a chance, don't you see
Chuck goes to his horse
Bill grabs him by the sleeve
Does he really mean to set the fields on fire
Chuck pushes him aside
Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support
Stop him, or it's all going up
They, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene
Chuck turns on Bill
What does it matter to you
Chuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise
Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea
He slings the fire out again
patch lands on Bill's pantleg
Bill slaps it out
What's got into you
They stare at each other
Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could
Why do you care
gave my life for this land
Chuck walks towards him
Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running
Chuck swings at him with the lantern
Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them
The whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes
Stop, Chuck
Chuck leaps on his horse
She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot
Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup
He eludes them and rides off after Bill,  leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain
They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards
264 Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern
Chuck bears down on him
Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop
Bill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight
All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire
265 With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter
266 Abby spots Bill against the flames
She rushes up, gasping
They have been caught inside the ring
What're you doing
This is a bad place to talk He throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame
They have to shout to make themselves understood
The locusts roar like a cyclone
Did you see that
He was trying to burn me
What's got into him
He knows
He must
whole year's work
All wasted
These bugs, once they make up their minds
Bill stalls
The fire races toward them through the wheat
They appear as silhouettes against it
need to get out of here
think you probably should, too
(pause) Hell of a life
Damned if you do and damned if you don't
He leaves
Abby wonders if she ought to run after him
Bill
But this moment's hesitation has been too long
Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop them
Abby turns back
She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape
267 Benson rallies the workers
There's still a chance they're going to fly
Get the tractor out
The pump wagon
Blankets
They rush off to find equipment to fight the fire
268	   - Chuck rides through the dark like a lone Horseman of the Apocalypse, setting his fields on fire
269
-    - Tractors attempt to plow a firebreak
Mad silhouettes run back and forth, slapping at the blaze with wet gunny sacks fixed to the ends of sticks
Two dormitories burn out of control
Ursula throws open the barn and lets the horses out
They have raised thunder kicking at their stalls
The light above the barn door pulses erratically
270	 -  () Oil wells explode along the horizon
Huge balls of flames roll into the heavens
271
- Panic spreads among the workers as the holocaust threatens to engulf them
They throw down their tools and run for their lives
272	 - Animals flee in all directions:  birds and deer and rabbits, pigs, buffalo and the horses from the barn
The locusts mill around crazily on the wheat stalks, backlit against the flame
273	 - Bill, fleeing on his motorbike with his rabbit, holds up for a moment to watch the fire--a Biblical inferno of spectacular sweep
274
--  (' )-- single light burns in the Belvedere
275
- Heaving with sobs, Abby throws her things into a bindle
She has lost Chuck forever
Their life is destroyed
She glances out the window
She still has time to get away, but she must hurry
She bolts for the door
Sud- denly Chuck steps from the shadows, blocking her exit
His face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight
The locusts have chewed up his clothes
Abby is like a frightened deer
Did he see her packing
You look as though you'd seen a ghost
(pause) Where you going
(pause) Off with him
The wind cuts gaps in the death wail of the locusts
From time to time we hear the thump of an exploding well
He's not your brother, is he
How much does he know
She edges toward the door
Why do you say that
Come here a minute
Who are you
(no reply) Where'd you come from
told you
He shakes her
She quivers like a child in his grasp
She no longer has the audacity to lie
How long have you known
He drops his eyes
Shamefully long -- and his anger is partly just at this
What'd you want
He punches in the shade of a lamp, extinguishing it
Tell me
He shoves over the chest of drawers
She does not move
He tears down the drapes, already in shreds
This
Show me what you wanted
would have given it all to you
Please, Chuck
Please what
You're not going to tell me you're sorry,  hope
But  am
Outside the window fires rage along half the horizon
He sits down
He wants to sob, but cannot
You're so wonderful
How could you do this
'm just no good
You picked me from the gutter, and this is how --  never deserved you
(interrupting) The things you told me
love you, though
You have to believe me
It may sound false after
(interrupting) Down at the cave
Don't you remember
believed them
All right
'm going away
You'll never have to see me again
Away
He gets up, suddenly alarmed, walks to the mantel and opens a chest
What're you doing
Chuck drapes his neck with the stole he used in slaughtering the hog
Her face goes empty
He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin
She shrinks back in the corner
He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room
276
- Abby pursues him down the stairs
He throws her aside
Where are you doing
Chuck
What are you doing
won't let you
Come back
Again he throws her aside, and again she keeps after him, desperate to prevent any harm coming to Bill
Finally he picks her up and drags her outside
277
- He lashes her with a rope to a column of the porch
She struggles vainly to free herself
Does he intend to use the razor on her
No, Chuck
Please, darling
It wasn't his fault
It was mine
Let him go
love you, Chuck
Do anything, only please
'm sick of hearing lies
He stuffs a handkerchief in her mouth and leaves
278	   - Chuck wanders through the night with a lantern, calling his mare
279
-  - Dawn breaks
Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill
The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass
It prances warily along, without making a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke
With him he carries a stool
The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off
280	' Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions
The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there
Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out
peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and perplexed
281 Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape
The tires are soft as licorice from the heat
Suddenly, he looks up
Chuck has found him
He jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off
Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further
Who do you think you are
Now you've ruined it
What's got into you
Where you headed
Why do  have to tell you
can come and go when  like
This is still a free country, last  heard
Bill stops when he sees the stool
Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap
There are no secrets now
What can  say
Too late for apologies
You've got a right to hate me
Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool
want to leave
You won't ever see me again
already got what deserve
There is nothing Bill can say to appease him
This will be a fight to the death
Chuck lashes out with the stool
Bill ducks too late
Watch it
Chuck comes at him again
Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool
Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame
This time he stays down
Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope
282 Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian
Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve
Chuck moves in for the kill
Bill gets to his feet
He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water
Suddenly, they are face to face
Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses
Bill lifts the spoke above him and drives it deep into Chuck's heart
Chuck gasps
Bill seems just as shocked
Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury
Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw
Bill circles him, unbelieving
Should  pull it out
Chuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke
Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem
better get somebody
He tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled
He looks back at Chuck in anguish
What has he done
You were my friend
283 The Belvedere is visible on the horizon
Bill hesitates a moment, then heads back on foot to find Abby
He gives Chuck a wide berth
Then, on a ridge in the distance, he spots Benson
Get a doctor
Fast
How much did he see
Bill does not stay to find out but takes off running, though not without first collecting his rabbit
Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side
His left sleeve has been burned away
The flesh beneath is the color of a raw steak
284	' Chuck sees the smoke from his fields, the burnt deer, a circling hawk
285 He breathes in gulps
His eyes are blank, like a child's marbles
He takes Benson's hand
(weakly) Wasn't his fault
Tell her
forgive them
The locusts can be heard no more
The prairie makes a sound like the ocean
Chuck turns his back and dies
286 Benson weeps
Whether or not he understood Chuck's last wishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them
287 Bill finds Abby bound to the house like the figurehead of a ship
He cuts her loose
The ropes fall at her feet
She is free
They look at each other for a moment
Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws her arms around him
Bill wonders if she is taking him back
Might their differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding
We have to hurry
Chuck's out looking right now
Oh, Bill, what have we done
He took his razor
We need to hurry
He might be coming back any minute
Bill mentions nothing of his encounter
She grabs her bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella
After a moment's hesitation, he puts them back
288 They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored
The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even of their bark
Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere one last time
Chuck does not want her anymore
How could she expect him to
Bill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along
289 Abby throws open the doors of the barn
Bill cranks up the engine of the Overland
Will the cops be looking for us, too
Probably
Abby stands in the door
She is reluctant to leave, though she knows they must
Get in
She notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with blood
What happened to you
Where's this from
Bill looks down
He forgot
Had an accident
She looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this explanation
The engine catches with a noise like start- led poultry
Bill gets behind the wheel
Just as they are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black as coal from battling the fire all night
Where you going
(breathless) We got in a jam
You'll be safer here
Say we're headed for town
Take care of the rabbit, too
He's yours now
What's the matter
Just do what  say
Why're you always arguing about everything
Wait here till we get in touch
Bill gives Ursula his wallet and a kiss
Abby gives her a hug
290 They roar off through the burnt grass of the prairie
Abby waves goodbye
291	  () As they crest a ridge, Benson appears in front of them, waving a hand to flag them down
Bill puts his foot on the gas
Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires at then with a pistol
Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab- bard under the dash and fires back
Nobody is hurt
What's the matter with him
Bill shrugs
Inside he feels a great relief
They are free at last
At last he has her back
292 They veer off across the prairie, towards the Razumihin gates
The music comes up full
293 They have come to a lone shack on the river, a drinking house for passing boatmen
They negotiate (in pantomime) with the  for a tiny steam boat moored at the end of the pier
When the car is not enough, Abby throws in her necklace
294 They board the boat and turn down stream
There is a phonograph on board
295 The necklace sparkles on the hood of the car--a hint they are leaving behind evidence that could betray them
296
- They glide along in the hush of evening
The reeds are full of deer
Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the sand bars
Bill looks around in wonder
He knows these may be his last days on earth
Abby throws a sounding line
from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows
Other  glide past in silence
plays a fiddle on the deck of a scow
creep along the shore in search of waterfowl
297
- Bill sleeps under a tarp
Abby looks out across the water and bursts into sobs
She has wronged Chuck and thrown her life away
298	  () - They shine a lamp into the murky depths and spear pickerel with a hammered-out fork
Strange rocks loom up and give way to wide moonlit fields
They have the sense of entering places where nobody has been since the making of the world
299 Four , in pursuit, interrogate some
Have they seen the two people standing by Chuck in his wedding portrait
Benson holds the bulky frame
There is a funereal border of black crepe at the corners
300
- They drift idly on the flood
The phonograph is playing in the stern
Abby is back in trousers
Bill points to a white house on the shore, an image of comfort and peace
used to want a set-up like that
Something like that,  thought, and you'd really have it made
Now  don't care
just wish we could always live this way
He sees that her mind is somewhere else
He wants to tell her the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it would just put more of a cloud over everything
It might even cause her to hate him
Maybe you want to write him a  letter
hadn't thought of that
You really do love him, don't you
She does not reply
You want to go back
(shaking her head) Too late for that
could never face him again
They look at each other for a moment
He touches her face, to show that he does not hold it against her
She touches him back
They only have each other now
They must save what moments they can
Guess it's you and me again
301 On a sudden whim, Abby takes off her wedding bracelet and holds it over the water
Watch this
Bill is caught off guard
Before he can make a move she throws it far out into the river
They laugh, without knowing why, at this extravagance
302 They gather May apples and black haws
The music from the phonograph comes up full
They dig clams from a sand bar in a playful way
We are reminded of their first days on the harvest
303 They make love in the undergrowth
Abby, afterwards, lies in a naked daze
The damp greens of the wilderness envelop her
304	  -     - Rounding a bend in the river that night, they come upon the lights of a great city
They have doused the running lamp
Except for a faint groaning of the trees along the shore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the city to them from across a great distance -- bells, joy- ful voices, horns, the chirping of brakes, etc
305
- They sneak down an alley
There are signs of life behind a few windows, but the city pursues its gaiety elsewhere
Suddenly, they come upon a  making his rounds
They let him pass, then cut through a vacant lot back to the boat
306
- The next morning finds them camped in a thicket on the river front below a factory
Bill wakes up, mysteriously happy
Their blankets are heavy with dew
Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch light wind rushes through the leaves
Whatever his trou- bles, they seem very small to him in the great
scheme of things
He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep
He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat
The slope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst mattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta
307 Abruptly he stops
Two   are combing over the boat
They have not seen him
He edges back
Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them
Bill looks up
Benson is calling him to the attention of a car-load of  pulling up beside him
The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire
Bill darts like a rabbit into the thicket
308 Abby bolts awake
Bill jumps down beside her, breathless, and begins looking frantically for the shells to his shotgun
What's going on
Keep down
Can't explain now
They're here
Who
What're you talking about
Stop a minute
He covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the undergrowth
His face is close to hers
She bursts into tears
Don't get shot
Look for me under that next bridge down
After dark
He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down in front of her
The Police fan out along the ridge above them
He jams a flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after a moment's hesitation -- on the cheek
She tries in vain to hold him back
wish  could tell you how much love you
309 Bill runs from the thicket down to the water
The Police have bunched on the other side
It seems he might be able to escape
Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat
Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has left out overnight
The hooks bite into his thigh and shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish out of the water
He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is staked to the shore
All at once, he jackknifes in the air
The stake twangs loose
The Police now spot him and begin firing
310 Abby runs out of hiding, thinking at first that the Police must be looking for her
Why're you shooting
You'll kill him
Have you gone crazy
Stop
Oh, Bill, not you
Not you
311 Bill stumbles along, trying to rip the hooks from his flesh, but the fish--fighting their way back to the water--only drive them in deeper
Ahead two   surge into the river, blocking his retreat
He empties his shotgun at them and throws it away
They hold up, astonished
He dashes across a sand bar for the deep of the river and comparative safety
Black mud clings to his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses
Benson goes running out into the river ahead of the Police
Leave him alone
want him
Leave him alone
(firing) There you go
There you go
He shoots Bill down
Bill turns and looks at him in sur- prise
Benson shoots him again, point blank
312 Bill's blood fades off quickly in the gliding water of the river
The line of frightened catfish dances out behind him like a garland
313 dog trots off in alarm
Benson wades into shore, tears streaming down his face, his chest heaving with emotion
Abby falls to the ground in a convulsion of grief
short way down the river  come and go along the bridge where they were to meet
314 roller piano sits in a corner by itself, playing a fox- trot
The camera moves back
315
- are learning the foxtrot in the attic of the Arboretum, a tacky Western version of an Eastern finishing school
The steps are painted on the floor as white footprints
Abby is apparently enrolling Ursula here
The headmistress, , boasts of the school's achievements
Ursula looks trapped
Abby checks her watch
She must go
316 Abby and Ursula walk down an empty street
Abby wears a mourning band on her sleeve
She is under the false im- pression that Ursula likes her new home
An carts her bags along behind them in a wheelbarrow
They'll teach you poise, too, so you can walk in any room you please
Pretty soon you'll know all kind of things
(pause) never read a whole book till  was fifteen
It was by Caesar
They laugh at her careful pronunciation of "Caesar
" 317 Abby's train is about to leave
The  walks by blowing a whistle
five-piece  plays Sousa airs
They are practically the only civilians on the platform
The rest are  bound for Europe, where America has just entered the War, on fire with excitement and a sense of high adventure
like your hat
It doesn't seem like a bird came down and landed on my head
Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately has begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb- ing her hair free of its usual snarls
They laugh at their reflection in a window of the train
hardly ever wear it
Be sure and write every week
Signals nod
lamp winks
There are leave-takings up and down the platform as the train slides away
Abby hops on board
next to her sheds bitter tears
You write me, too
They wave goodbye
318
- Late that evening Ursula lowers herself out a third-floor window of the Arboretum with a rope made of bedsheets
319 The other  stand in their nightgowns and wave good- bye, amazed at her boldness
She slips off into the night
320
- Ursula looks in a backstage door
She can see, through the wings, a  dancing on stage
There is a feeling of mad excitement about the place
The person she is looking for is not here, however
321
- '  - She runs down an alley
man steps out of the shadows-- George, the pilot
She throws herself in his arms
This is our first sight of him since he left the bonanza
You're here
Oh, hug me
They kiss madly, with mystery
The moonlit, midsummer night thrums Aren't we happy
Oh, George, has anybody ever been this happy
He rocks her back and forth in his arms
They laugh, thinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world's misery
Hurry
They'll be looking for me
322
- George bundles Ursula, giggling, into a biplane
This doesn't even belong to you
Suppose they catch us
323
-- From a pasture outside town the plane rises into the vast dawn sky
324 Abby changes bobbins on a huge loom
pall of lint and anonymous toil hangs over the factory
Down the way a handsome   smiles at her
She smiles back, interested
It seems an age we've been apart, and truly is for those who love each other so
Whenever shall we meet
' 325 The shuttle rockets back and forth
Off camera we hear Abby reading what seems part of a letter to Ursula
(o
s
) Soon,  hope, for by and by we'll all be gone, Urs
Does it really seem as though we might
' 326 We look from the bottom of a river up toward the light
In the foreground, dangling from the tip of a submerged limb, is the bracelet Abby threw away
(o
s
) 'The other day  tried to think how 'd look laid out in a solemn white gown
Closing my eyes  could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep asleep, so still
327
- The  of the Razumihin rebuild the land -- raising fences and sinking a well, plowing down the stubble and putting in the seed
(o
s
) ' went to Lincoln Park Zoo the other day
It was great as usual
enclose a check
' An   , standing on a carpet of new-sprung wheat, looks up with a start
From the distance comes a ghostly noise--the call of the prairie chickens at their spring rites
He listens for just a moment, then returns to work
