Written by John Guare April 1992 ' and   ("" and "") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock
Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them
survey their living room which under normal circumstances would appear to be a serene haven
But why are they-so aghast
And terrified
Has the apartment been violated
The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is filled with beautiful objects chosen with care
Even though the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern paintings hang on the walls
No
No visible disaster here
But then why  and 's emotional state

Is anything gone

But nothing leaps out

The Kandinsky
0UISA runs into the living room
can see by the discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing
It's gone
Call the police
There it is
An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and brilliantly colored
0UISA Thank god
picks the painting up and flips it around
It's a double sided painting
The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in different styles on either side of the canvas
One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other side is all chaos and brilliant colors
replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the geometric side

The silver Victorian inkwell
runs past  down the hall back to the living room
follows  back into looks on an antique table crowded with framed family photographs going way back in time and all kinds of mementoes
How can you think of things
We could have been murdered
want to know if anything's gone
picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver and looks at it with great objectivity
There's the inkwell

Slashed ---our throats slashed
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered

But it's their pug dog licking her leg

remembers something and buries his face in his hands

We were having a wonderful evening last night
friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner
don't think you know him - () Geoffrey Miller
From South Africa-- Don't say it so portentously

Somehow the telling calms
lean forward
We knew Geoffrey through our children when Geoffrey and his family all lived in New York
They've moved back to South Africa
He was here in New York briefly on business and asked us to ask him for dinner
12 He's King Midas rich
Literally
Gold mines
puts down the tray of drinks
Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine
But he is always short of cash because his government won't let its people -- Its white people -- -- its white people take out any money
So it's like taking in a War Baby
( ) Thank you
That one's mine - switch drinks
When he called it was like a bolt from the blue as  had a deal coming up and was short by puts down his drink
The figure is superfluous turns to
hate when he uses the word "superfluous" mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have two million dollars
The currents last night were very churny
we weren't sucking up
We like Geoffrey
13 It's that awful thing of having truly rich folk for friends
Face it
The money does get in the - Only if you let it
The fact of the money shouldn't get in- Having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats
But the friend gets very touchy if you say one word: life boat
(  laugh
) Well, that's two words
We were afraid our South African friend might say "You only love me for my
life boats
" But we like Geoffrey
know who he is now
Lovely man
Didn't he invite us to visit him
It wasn't a life-threatening evening
- Rich people can do something for you even if you're not sure what it is`you want them to do
turn at the sound of applause
and  have entered the Country Club and our table in the bar looks up as    passes by for a moment rushing past the Bar into the ballroom
Off in the ballroom    strikes up "Just One Of Those Things" for the ten thousandth time

But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in life's little tea leaves because who wants to go to banks
'  takes us back to last night ' () Geoffrey called and our tempests settled into showers and life was manageable
What more can you want

"Follow Follow Follow"
What's that song

Russia and Poland - you can't believe the developments in the world - ( remembers:) "The Fantasticks" (:) "Follow Follow Follow"

29 But he found a better way
As a matter of fact, he turned it down at first
He went to tell the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats and in going through all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats, he suddenly saw how you could make a movie of Cats -- Eureka in the bathtub

30 , leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to that    who is the  of the camera
Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of films, was born the twenty fourth of February 1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to Florida - legally
-to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the Bahamas
He grew up on Cat Island, "so poor they didn't even own dirt" he has said
Neglected by his family, my father would sit on the shore, and, as he told me many times, "conjure up the kind of worlds that were on the other side and what 'd do in them
" He arrived in New York City from the Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus station across from the old Madison Square Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue
He moved to the roof of the Brill building, commonly known as Tin Pan Alley
Washed dishes at the Turf restaurant for $4
11 a night
He taught 0 himself to read by reading the newspaper
In the Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite the Want Ad page
Among his 42 films are No Way Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/ Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/ Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field 1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course, (     ) Guess Who's Coming To Dinner
() He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and was twice named top male box-office star in the country
My father made no films from 1977 to 1987 but worked as director and author
Dad said to me once " still don't fully understand how all that came about in the sequence it came about"
And we hear the    applauding
bows, happily
kicks his shoe off into the camera

My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa
The camera moved from this vile rioting in the streets to a villa where people picked at lunch on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals
And didn't understand
And Dad said to me "You meet these young blacks who are having a terrible time
They've had a totally inadequate education and yet in '76 - the year of the Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous political responsibility
It just makes you wonder at the maturity that is in them

Now, 've been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell apart
My wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter
And  sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged
But  hold firm
In spite of prejudice because want to get back to my wife
Out of this forest,back to the church
' And my father is in tears and  say Pop, this i:
not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you
And my father says ' ' m trying it out to see how it fits on me
' But he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents
That's his past

( takes a deep breath and leans back in ) substitute teacher out on Long Island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student
few weeks later, the teacher returned to the classroom, shot the student unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then shot himself
Successfully
This fact caught my eye: last sentence
Times
neighbor described the teacher as a nice boy
Always reading Catcher In the Rye
The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said he did it because he wanted to-`draw the attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and the reading of that book would be his defense
And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan and his press secretary said if you want my defense all you have to do is read catcher in the Rye
It seemed to be time to read it again
haven't read it in years
shushes
borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because  wanted to see what she had underlined and  read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate
started reading
: It's exactly as remembered
Everybody's a phoney
Page two: "My brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute
" Page three: "what a phony slob his father was
" Page nine: "People never notice anything
" Then on page twenty two my hair stood up
Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap
" deer Hunter hat
Like hell it is
sort of closed one eye like  was taking aim at it
This is a people shooting hat
shoot people in this hat
" 40 () Hmmm,  said
This book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than  ever dreamed of
Then on p
89 "'d rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw
hate fist fights
what scares me most is the other guy's face
" finished the book
It's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything
Hates all phoniness and only lies to others
Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved
In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent
, ,
are transfixed
And what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis
The boy can't function
And at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds
Now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis
It may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett be the great modern theme
The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For Godot--"Let's go
" "Yes, let's go
" Stage directions: They do not move
But the aura around this book of Salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination
Because what else is paralysis
The  moves closer and closer in on
42 () The imagination has been so debased that imagination--being imaginative-- rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like Science fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars
So imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative
And Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so --- The imagination has moved out of the realm of being our link, our most personal link, with our inner lives and the world outside that world-- this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match up with what's out there
Why has imagination become a synonym for style
believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world
believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely Is
Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious
Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the faces we face are not the other guys' but our own faces
And it's the worst kind of yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself
To face ourselves
That's the hard thing
The imagination
That's God's gift to make the act of self- examination bearable

Paul found some extra money of his own and he wanted to thank us for staying here

Isn't it a gas
He's going to give us the money back

But we had promised Paul that we would bring him to the police

Well, Ouisa did

There's nothing more you can do - What could we do
We tried
went to the precinct
hands the detective's card to the
He's transferred
Since yesterday
He's been handling this 138 He's transferred - This is about an arrest made yesterday at the Waverly Movie theater - checks the records
This precinct didn't do any business at the Waverly Theater
didn't imagine it - 'm not saying you did
Could you find out which precinct - looks through the book
The name
Poitier
He's a young black man
Or maybe Kittredge
don't know the exact name - Are you family
Not exactly
But the detective promised me yesterday that  could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special
We have no record of it
Some other precinct must have made the arrest
It sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else
Like what
Lady, how can  help you
You don't even know your friend's name
139 We can find anybody - Six degrees closes the book
We weren't family
We didn't know Paul's name

we weren't family
We didn't know Paul's name

You see,  read today that a young man committed suicide in Riker's Island
Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged himself
Was it the pink shirt
This burst of color
The pink shirt
Was it Paul
We never found out who he was
'm sure it's not him
Yes
agree
Isn't it amazing
He'll be back
We haven't heard the last of him
The imagination
He'll find a way
Could we talk about something else
Our guest of honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you- But
leans forward
Why does it mean so much to you
140 He wanted to be us
Everything we are in the world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted it
He stabbed himself to get into our lives
He envied us
We're not enough to be envied
Like the papers said
We have hearts
Having a heart is not the point
We were hardly taken in
We believed him -- for a few hours
He did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did
He wanted to be your child
Don't let that go
He sat out in that park and said that man is my father
He's in trouble and we don't know how to help him
Help him
He could've killed me
And you
agree
You were attracted to him - throws down his napkin in mock outrage
Almogj mock outrage
Cut me out of that pathology
You are on your own - Attracted by youth and his talent and the embarrassing prospect of being in the movie version of Cats
Did you put that in your Times piece
And we turn him into anecdote to dine out on
Like this
As we are right now
But it was an experience
will not turn him into an anecdote
How do we fit what happened to us into life without turning it into an anecdote with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over and over for years to come
"Tell the story about the imposter who came into our lives---" "That reminds me of the time this boy--"
And we become these human juke boxes spilling out these anecdotes
But it was an experience
How do we keep the experience
looks around the dinner table
have decided to start on their dinners
141 (to his Dinner Partner) That's why  love paintings
Cezanne
The problems he brought up are the problems painters are still dealing with
Color
Structure
Those are problems
(to herself) There is color in my life, but 'm not aware of any structure
What are you saying, darling

frowns and turns back to his dinner partner brightly
Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush stroke, give a reason for the color
Then  am a collage of unaccounted-for brush strokes

Her chair scrapes
There is an embarrassed rush

Do you realize how important this woman is

Are you drunk
What are you unhappy about
The Cezanne sale vent through
The Matisse went through
We are rich
Geoffrey's rich
Next month there's a Bonnard and after that - These are the times  would take a knife and dig out your heart
Answer me
How much of your - - life can  account for
All

smiles at the simplicity of her realization
We're a terrible match
steps out onto (following ) She is a very important woman
am hoping to do business
Did you see the paintings on her walls
She might want to sell
She glares at  and turns back into the lobby and returns to the party
moves to follow , then walks up  , lost, agitated, unsure
walks on, remembering 's hand completes the action
slaps the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
slaps the Hand of God
