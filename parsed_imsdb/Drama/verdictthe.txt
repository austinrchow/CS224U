The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands
These Two Men from the front
Both somber, in their early fifties
They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor
The
woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences
The Two Men approach her
The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks: Mrs
Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney
It's a shame about your husband, Mrs
Dee
The Widow nods

He was a wonderful man

Really

Beat
(thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time) Well
He shakes her hand and moves on
- Galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat
Reading a section of the paper
He picks up his teacup, drinks
Lowers it to the table
- Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea
His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table
He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section
We  several names crossed out
He circles one funeral listing
Galvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips
Looks around deserted coffee shop
Sighs
- Galvin outside a second funeral home
- entering, Galvin enters the home
Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak
He is stopped by the ' , a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow
(of the card) What is that
What the hell is that
was a friend of your fa
You never knew my father
(hits card out of Galvin's hand) You get out of here, who the hell do you think you are
The   hurries down the aisle, and starts extricating Galvin from the commotion
(to Funeral Manager) 'm talking to this man
Excuse me, Mrs
Cleary
He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral parlor
The Son calls after him: Who the hell do you think you are
- The Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold
don't want you coming back here
Ever
Do you understand
was just talking to
Those are bereaved people in there
The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners
"Good evening
" Galvin, the ground cut out from under him
Standing watching the mourners enter
- Galvin walking down a residential street
He has been walking a while in the cold, snowy night
He stops for a stoplight at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic
Lights a cigarette
The light changes
He looks both ways and irresolutely starts across the street
He stops
He checks his watch
He sighs, and starts back in the opposite direction
''  - Galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's establishment,  , acquaintances, standing around him, appreciative
Pat says, 'Mike
there's a new bar, you go in, for a half a buck you get a beer, a free lunch, and then take you in the back room and they get you laid
' The bartender, , comes up to Galvin
Another, Frank
(gestures to include group) everybody
Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid
' 'That's correct
' Mike says, 'Pat
Have you been in this bar
' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has
' (gestures to Jimmy) Everyone
Buy yourself one too
'  - The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves opening a file cabinet
He takes out an armload of files, carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in
He sits on his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass
He has been drinking for some time
He starts stumbling back to the file cabinet
On the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall
He stumbles to them, picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in
He goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing
Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so
He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference
" He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still- ringing phone off the desk
He pours himself a drink
As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the floor: a '
"Frank
Frank
Frank
Goddamnit
Are you there
Frank
" Galvin pays no attention
Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of degrees
-
The empty wall
Galvin's
The telephone heard Voice Over insisting, "Frank
" '   - , a man in his late sixties, dressed in suit and overcoat, looking worried, unlocks the door to the dark anteroom
Looks around
Sees something in the next room
-
Galvin asleep on his couch, clothed as before
Covered in his overcoat, the bottle and glass next to the couch on the floor, the sound of the phone off the hook
Mickey walks into the office
Stands looking at Galvin
(harshly) Get up
(beat, more harshly) Get up
Galvin wakes up
Looks around
Swings his legs over the couch
Drinks from the glass
Vacantly: Hi, Mickey
What the hell do you think you're doing
(surveys the wrecked office) What's going on here
Uh
Fuck you
got a call today from Sally Doneghy
now who is that
You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them
Sally Doneghy, now who is that
One lousy letter eighteen months ago

'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months
You're 'sposed to be in court
bet you haven't even seen the file
Galvin pours himself a drink
Hey, what are you, my nanny
Mickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and slaps him several times in the face
Listen to me
Listen to me
listen to me, Frank, 'cause 'm done fuckin' with you
can't do it any more
Look around you: You think that you're going to change
What's going to change it
You think it's going to be different next month
It's going to be the same
And  have to stop
This is it
got you a good case, it's a moneymaker
You do it right and it will take care of you
But 'm through
'm sorry, Frank, this is the end
(beat) Life is too short, and 'm too old
(beat) Mickey walks out of the office
Slams the door
Beat
Galvin looks around the office
Goes to his sofa
Sits, reaches to side table
- The side table, a pack of Luckies
Galvin taking one, his hand shaking a little
Also on side table a pile of change containing a small rosary and a wedding ring
'   -  - The carriage of a typewriter
sheet of paper
Its letterhead reads "Frank

"  hand takes a paper from carriage and puts it on desk
Takes a pen and signs, "Claire
" Galvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having just signed the paper
He takes a piece of Scotch tape from the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the coffee table
It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch- taped
-
- The file headed Deborah Ann Kaye v
St
Catherine Laboure Hospital et
al
Galvin surveys the anteroom, opens door to corridor, Scotch tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the door
''  - Dark paneling, clean, simple
drinkers' bar and   spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat downing a shot, the file open before him
He is reading
He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door
- Galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home
He receives suspicious looks from the Attendants
He is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file
He finds the correct door and enters
- The door to the ward from the inside
Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking
He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward
As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed
Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart
-
The chart held by Galvin
, various medical notations
He lowers the chart and we  in the bed beyond it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes
Galvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc
on the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed
Takes another one
Puts down camera, sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form
He lights a cigarette, and sits looking at her
- '   - mousy woman in her forties is standing by a door on which is written, "Frank
Galvin
Attorney at Law
" 'm
Mrs
Doneghy
'm Frank Galvin
why didn't you go in
It's locked
(astonished) It's locked
Sally Doneghy points to the note on the door
Galvin takes it from the door
Reads
"Back at 10, Judge Geary
Lunch
" 'm terribly sorry
hope we didn't put you out
Won't you come in
(motions Sally into inner office, gestures with note) 'd offer you some coffee, but it looks like my girl just went out
- Galvin is perched at his secretary's desk
Sally Doneghy across from him by the coffee table listening intently
It's not a good case
It's a very good case
healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic
we, we love her, Dick and me
'm sure you do
But what can we do
She don't know who's visiting her

You saw her
Yes
Yes,  have
You know how beautiful she was

They, they, they'd let you die in there
They don't care

We didn't want to sue

But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson
and they called him up and said to come out
He's a good man
He's only trying to do what's right
The door to the corridor opens and  , a workingman in his forties, comes into the room
Sally and Galvin stand
This is my husband
Donegy and Galvin shake hands uncomfortably
He motions the two to sit
Please sit down
told your wife
'm sorry that we have to meet out here
've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers
that's all right
was telling your wife, we have a very good case here
He saw her at the Northern Care
and  have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field
there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent
the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial
doubt we'll have to go to trial
we told them we didn't want it to come out this way
completely understand
We just
We just can't do it anymore
(beat) This is our chance to get away
'm going to see you get that chance
What is this going to cost
It's completely done on a contingency basis
That means whatever the settlement is  retain one-third
that is, of course, the usual arrangement

Headline: "Patricia Harrington to Wed
" (
) His name is Frank Galvin
Law, class of 'fifty-two
Second in his class
Editor of the Law Review
Worked with Mickey Morrissey twelve years
Criminal Law and Personal Injury
' hand turns a page and reveals a second clipping: "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case," with a picture of a very confused Galvin at around forty-five being led to jail
'Married Patricia Harrington, nineteen sixty
' The small, sumptuously appointed Italianate office
French windows, a fire in the grate, a view of Boston Common, , a slender, elegant man in his forties dressed in a very expensive suit, reading from his notes, news clippings, etc
, which are held in a leather folder
'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce nineteen sixty as a full partner
Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine over the Lillibridge case
' Do you
Alito, strolling as he reads, moves toward the windows with his file    , a self-contained man in his early sixties, sitting on a leather couch, listening
He was accused of jury tampering
Accused
Not indicted
He resigned the firm
Divorced nineteen seventy
Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight
Since then he's been on his own
Four cases before the Circuit Court
He lost them all
He drinks
Four cases in three years
The man's an ambulance chaser
tell me about this case
This is a nuisance suit
He's looking for small change
He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court
No -- we don't want this case in court
Neither does he
That's where he loses
This man's scared to death to go to court
We only have to call his bluff
want to settle this thing and be done with it
don't want the Archdiocese exposed
No
Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not
So what  want to do is stop it here
'm going to make him an offer want to do it myself
want it to come from me
All right
But let's keep the price down
've called Ed Concannon
He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial
The Bishop nods, meaning, "You are dismissed
" As an afterthought: If we were to go to trial, would we win the case
Well, of course, it's always dangerous
know that answer
If we went to trial would we win
(in an "of course" tone) Yes
Alito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, where he has laid his leather folder
The clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into jail, "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case
" Alito's hand snaps the folder shut
'    - man's arms full of textbooks
Prominently displayed: "Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology
" The man stops, fumbles for a key in his pocket
Galvin, in his overcoat, arms full of books, reading from a textbook and trying to unlock his office door
Galvin entering
, a woman in her fifties, at the secretary's desk, hanging up the phone
(to phone) Thank you very much
Galvin looks up at her in surprise
What are you doing here
Mickey told me to come back to work
Galvin nods, proceeds into his office, reading from the textbook
Claire follows him into the office
here's your mail, call Mrs
Doneghy
yes
Get her on the phone
that was a Dr
David Gruber's office
(putting down books) Gruber
Mickey told him to call
(reading from notes) 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass
Commonwealth
He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye
You meet him at the hospital
' She hands him typed memo slip
(surprised) he wants to testify
It looks that way
You know what that would mean
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify
a Mrs
Doneghy called
told you that
Phone rings
Claire moves to it
(delighted) This is going to drive the ante up
(into phone) Frank Galvin's
who's calling please

She gestures to Galvin, "Do you want to talk to them

She hangs up
That's the call that 'm waiting for
What does it mean

Does that mean 'm back for awhile

watch reads: 6:56
Galvin in overcoat standing outside door marked "Doctors Only" in bustling hospital corridor
He glances at memo slip in his hand
He opens door
him onto: '    - Carpeted, small, comfortable, lined in lockers
, on the phone in greens, smoking a cigarette, talking on the phone softly, a couple of  sitting, drinking coffee, chatting
Galvin, a trifle nervous, to Doctor  : Dr
Gruber
The Doctor on the phone gestures behind him to a thirty-ish in blue jeans smoking a cigar, changing at his locker
Galvin walks over to him
Dr
Gruber
(turning) Yes
Galvin, right
He checks his watch, continues changing into suede jacket, checks next appointment on a leather appointment book, locks the locker, pockets key
appreciate -- a man as busy as -- That's perfectly all right
'm kind of rushed
Do you mind if we walk while we talk
Gruber, Galvin following, talk while exiting locker room
'   - read the hospital report on your client
Deborah Ann Kaye
Deborah Ann Kaye
They walk hurriedly through a hospital corridor, to an door and down concrete stairs
'   - They called, they're going to settle, what  want to do is build up as much
Right
Who called
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle
her estate
and you're going to do that
(surprised, of course) Yes
You're going to settle out of court
Gruber stops at the bottom of the stairs, beside an exit to the outside
Yes
Why
beat
(it's a meaningless question to him, as if to a child) Uh
in the, well, in the interests of her family
you, Dr
Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do
St
Catherine's a very well thought of institution
Her doctors
(glances at watch, impatient) Her doctors killed her
(a beat) 'm sorry
Her doctors murdered her
They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life
(a beat) Her doctors murdered her
Do you know who her doctors were
read the file
Yeah
Marx and Towler
know who they were
The most respected
(smiling) Whose side are you arguing thought that you wanted to do something
don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to
have an interest in the Hospital; and  don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me
They gave her the wrong anesthetic
They turned the girl into a vegetable
They killed her and they killed her kid
You caught 'em
Now: how many others did they kill

Gruber discards end of a cigar
Takes a leather case from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar
Offers one to Galvin
You want a cigar
Galvin takes one absently
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of
What are they going to do
Not invite me to their Birthday party
(checks watch) Look,  gotta go
have to be in Cambridge
Galvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar
His hand shakes badly
He has forgotten to bite off the end
He bites it, lights the cigar
Well, well, when can we meet again
'd like to get a deposition
Okay
'll meet you here
Tuesday night
gotta go
You going my way
Galvin shakes his head
'    - Gruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar
We have to

we have to keep you under wraps
Please don't, don't discuss

the case with anyone
And 'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony
They stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan
Gruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to Galvin
Right
Seven o'clock
Here
Galvin scribbles information in his appointment book
Thank you
that's perfectly all right
(beat) Uh, why, why are you doing this
(thinks a second) To do right
Isn't that why you're doing it
''  - Galvin is at the bar, smiling to himself
His drink is being refilled
To : want to buy you a drink
( ) Thanks, Franky
Galvin looks around
very attractive self-possessed is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him; she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items with a felt pen
Galvin speaks to her: Would you like a drink
She looks up
Smiles
'd like an apartment
Settle for a drink
She gestures at her own full glass in front of her
No
Thank you
Galvin shrugs
had a very good day today
(beat, smiles, downs drink, gets up off the stool, sincerely) 'm glad you did
Thank you
Good night
You're very welcome
He watches her as she leaves the bar
He turns back to his drink
Well, well, well
Huh
Yeah
(sighs) It's a long road that has no turning
That's for sure, Frank

Galvin, beer and cigarettes on the table beside him
He is sitting on an armchair in the bedroom
yellow legal pad in his lap
He is talking on the phone softly, soothingly
'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow at two
know you don't
know you don't
no, you're just following your life
You have a life too
you have to move out West
It doesn't help you to stay here
Well
'm sure she knows you care for her
His attention wanders to the legal pad in his lap

The legal pad
Spread on it a couple of Polaroids of Deborah Ann in the nursing home
Below them, written on the pad, large, "Dr
David Gruber
Ass't
Chief Anesthesiology, Mass

you give him my respects too
Not at all
Not at all
Good night
(beat) Well, bless you, too
Good night
He hangs up phone, sighs
Lights a cigarette
Rotates his neck to loosen it up
Reaches to the table next to his bed for the bottle to pour a drink
- His hand reaching for the bottle
On the table the photo of a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame
She is the same woman we saw earlier in the news clip
She is on the deck of a sailboat, laughing
pile of change on the table, a money clip, a rosary, and the wedding ring in the pile of change
Galvin looking at the photo in the silver frame next to his bed
He sighs deeply
Beat
Reaches up to the lamp above his head and turns it off
He sits stiffly in the dark a moment, then lets his head fall back to the chair
- Galvin, spruced up a bit, sitting on a bed, his briefcase on his lap
Gazing at the unseen Deborah Ann Kaye in the dark ward
Silent
Beat
He looks in his briefcase, takes out a file
-
- The file, labeled Deborah Ann Kaye
Galvin extracting the photo of the young mother romping with her two children; he takes the yellow legal pad from his briefcase and puts it on top of the picture (the figures crossed out; "Her doctors murdered her," etc
)
We hear the door to the ward open and gossiping
#1 (
) Jimmy,  said, don't you go in your pocket if there's nothing there
#2 (
) and what did he say
#1 (
) (spies Galvin, her tone changes) Sir, you aren't allowed to be in here
Galvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann
He looks up to the speaker
slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into the room and is standing by him
The other Nurse is framed in the doorway
Galvin is lost in thought
You can't be in here
(as if remembering something, simply) 'm her attorney
'  - The Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk
Compassionately: It's a question of continuing values
St
Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community
So we have a question of balance
On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors -- and, on the other hand, the rights of your client
Galvin seated across from the Bishop
seated, discreetly, attentively, across the room
Sherry glasses in front of Galvin and the Bishop
Galvin drinking from his
young woman
In her prime
deprived of
(searches for a word) life
sight
her family
It's tragic
It's a tragic accident
Galvin has been dreaming
nothing, of course, can begin to make it right
But we must do what we can
We must do all that we can
He gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream
The Bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper
Galvin glances down
The sheet: ", Frank
Galvin, duly appointed conservator for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000
00) paid in hand to me this day by St
Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any and all claims
" Galvin and the Bishop as before
Galvin finishes reading, looks up
Yes
We must try to make it right
Beat
Galvin nods
Beat
Bishop nods discreetly to the Young Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, holds it out to Galvin
It's a generous offer, Mr
Galvin
(beat) nothing can make the woman well
but we try to compensate
to make a gesture
How did you settle on the amount
We thought it was just
You thought it was just
Yes
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount
Two Hundred Ten Thousand
That would mean  keep seventy
That was our insurance company's recommendation
Yes
It would be
beat
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well
And no one will know the truth
What is the truth
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone
She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way
We have been paid to look the other way came in here to take your money
(beat) brought snapshots to show you
So could get your money
(to Young Priest, waving away document) can't take it
If  take it
If take that money 'm lost
'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser
(beat; pleading for understanding) can't do it
can't take it
If we may discuss money, Mr
Galvin
How is your law practice
It's not too good
've only got one client

have to talk to you
What do you want
(dragging him up) Come on
Let's get a drink
(sighs, to partner) Don't touch anything
Galvin leads Mickey out of the room
- Mickey and Galvin silhouetted against a window at the end of the dark corridor, arguing
(enraged) Are you out of your mind
'm going to need your help
You need my help
You need a goddamn keeper
are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand
(beat) Huh
Are you nuts
Eh
Are you nuts
What are you going to do, bring her back to life
'm going to help her
To do what
To do what, for chrissake
To help her to do what
She's dead
They killed her
And they're trying to buy it
That's the point, you stupid fuck
Let them buy it
We let them buy the case
That's what  took it for
You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer
He turns away

You won it
Franky
You won it
When they give you the money, that means that you won

You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon

-- young  in shirt-sleeves and vest racing through a huge, ultra-modern, ultra-successful legal office
The office is near empty
couple of secretaries are at their desks, a couple of lawyers in their cubicles
The   the Attorney tearing through the corridors of the office, up a spiral staircase, through yet more office space, into: - a conference room
Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic view of Boston
Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room
He stops running
He approaches the front of the room tentatively
Standing at the blackboard in front of the conference room is
Senior partner of the firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success
As the young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a gesture
Concannon addresses the room
(smiling) Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a shoe a horse was lost
' Who's going on vacation tomorrow
young  raises his hand
Friedman
St
Barts
is that right
Yessir
(to secretary taking notes at the side of the room) Send Mrs
Friedman a dozen roses tomorrow morning please, Sal
tell you what, send her a sunlamp
(smiles, there is laughter from the room; to Friedman, sympathetic) 'm sorry, but you'll have to stay
No vacations till this thing is cleared
Concannon motions to the young Attorney who has run in
The young Attorney goes to Concannon and hands him a box of chalk
Concannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard "Jan
12th
" He underlines it heavily
Our court date is January twelfth
You're all acquainted with this case
It's been scheduled for eighteen months
We have the attorney for the Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and trust you are all familiar with his record -- and we have been expecting him to call us to negotiate
As he did not, and five days before we're supposed to go to court we made him a rather generous offer, which he refused
Five days before the trial
What does this mean
want to find out
(writes on the blackboard, "1) Research") (writes "2) Homework") Acquaint yourselves again with the depositions
Don't rely on the fact that we did it last year
Do it again
We're going to review them here, and you do it at home
You each have a full file
Know the deps, and  want you all to be here when we work with the defendants
when is that, Billy
The young Attorney responds
() Tuesday evening, Sir
Concannon writes on blackboard "3) Public Awareness
" want an article in the Globe As Soon As Possible, 'St
Cat's
Neighborhood Giant serving the community' etc
We've got it in the files
want something in Monday's Herald: 'Our Gallant Doctors,' something
Be inventive,  want television
(nods toward one of the young lawyers) talk to our man at
And to belabor the obvious for a moment
(beat) Our clients are: the Archdiocese of Boston; St
Catherine Laboure Hospital, and Drs
Marx and Towler, two of the most respected men in their profession
The thrust of this defense will be to answer in court, in the press and in the public mind -- to answer the accusation of negligence this completely: not only that we win the case, but that we win the case so that it's seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity
(beat) All right
Let's get the cobwebs off
Billy
The young Lawyer stands as Concannon sits, listening
Please turn to your Page Four
All the lawyers in the office turn in their files to that page

They are smoking, speak in undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them
Rehashing material
Who have we got
We've got her sister
Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital
This is the point
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance
Admittance form is wrong
Forget it
You can't prove it
Sister's testimony is no good
Jury knows we win she gets the cash
've got my Dr
Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains
(conceding) Gruber's not bad
Not bad
This guy's Dr
Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick
And you calm down, all right
Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, (hunts for book on desk, holds it up; reads) 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology
' (rummages through a pile of papers on the desk) and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse
'All these guys are God

We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse

Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital

How come she isn't speaking up

Okay now

The remains of a dinner and drinks around them
They are both smoking cigarettes, intent on each other
Both a little drunk
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them
Isn't that the truth
You want another drink
think  will
Galvin motions "another round" to the bartender
Jimmy
(beat) That's why the court exists
The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh
But to give them a chance at justice
And are they going to get it
They might
Yes
That's the point
is that they might

They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe
have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case

Both awkward
He looks at her, turns back to the bed, turns down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it down
That's all right
She starts taking off her blouse

He looks out of the window at a building across the street

Why is that

Concannon smiles and extends his hand
Ed Concannon
(shaking his head) Frank Galvin
We've met before
As the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at Concannon out of the corner of his eye
Let's do some business
- Concannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit
(
) They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal
Concannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles
-  , , Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother
This is a complicated case, your Honor
'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something
If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it
(smiles at Galvin) See my point
Let's talk a minute
Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop
My client can't walk, your Honor
know full well she can't, Frank
You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket
You follow me
'm trying to help you
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars
Huh
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price
They wanted this cleared up in court
They want their vindication
agree with them
But for today the offer stands
Before we begin the publicity of a trial
For today only
(beat) When  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn
(turns to Galvin) As long as you understand that
(beat) It's got to be that way
We are going to try the case

Galvin fumbles for a cigarette
The three sit in silence
(incredulous) That's it
(beat) Come on, guys
life is too short
(beat) You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it
(beat; turns to Galvin) Frank:  don't think 'm talking out of school, but  just heard someone offer you two hundred grand
and that's a lot of money
and if may say, you haven't got the best of records
things change
that's true
Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't
Now,  remember back to when you were disbarred
wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself
(beat) myself would take it and run like a thief
'm sure you would
The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him
He controls himself
Hm

Next Thursday
Good

'Code Blue,' what does that mean
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat
Dr
Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby
Ms
Nevins
Why wasn't she getting oxygen
Well, many reasons, actually
Tell me one
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask
She
Let's cut the bullshit
Say it: She beat
She threw up in her mask

and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen
That's right
And what did your team do
Well, we
You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear
Isn't that what you did
Yes
patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form
We did everything we could
to save her and to save the baby

Okay
Yessir
Good
What else do you do

Concannon nods, meaning "that is correct

We'll be at Locke-Obers

Thompson in shirt sleeves, attentive, stands against a sideboard
Mickey Morrissey, seated, in an armchair
Grilling him
They gave her the wrong anesthetic
Why is that
(starting on reciting a list) Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance
she
that's what the sister said
The chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps
Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
Is that what a good doctor would do
How old are you, please
am seventy-four years old
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics
am on the staff of
Easthampton Hospital for Women
Excuse me, what is that, a joke
Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure
Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life
They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say
made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening,
Mickey drops his belligerent attitude
Turns to someone behind him
The two men, Galvin standing behind Mickey, smoking
He nods
(to Dr
Thompson, casually) She getting good care over there
Actually, yes
It's by no means bad, (grilling him again) Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least
You know what means
'Code Blue'
It's a common medical term
Mickey half-turns to Galvin, shrugs minutely, meaning, "We're in trouble

Galvin looks out the window and then looks back to Laura
Do you think it's my fault
Isn't there something you
That's not the question
It's over
(beat) Do you think that it's my fault
If 'd

never should have taken it
There was no way that was going to win
You're talking like a drunk
That's what  am

And it's over
Yes
Well, then what are you doing here
do you want me to leave
You do what you want
You want to leave
You want to go kill yourself
You want me to tell you it's your fault
It probably is
What are you going to do about it
(beat) thought it's not over till the jury comes in
Who told you that
You told me so
Maybe you'd get some sympathy
You came to the wrong place
And what makes you so tough
Maybe 'll tell you later
Is there going to be a later
Not if you don't grow up
If  don't 'grow up

Believe me
You say you're going to lose
Is it my fault

It's over

Mickey looks up

And all we've got is a witch doctor
Yeah
The  enters, some , knowing the routine, start getting to their feet
Look at it this way: it's refreshing every time a Doctor takes the stand he's not a Jew

He pauses as before a great effort
Takes a breath
Exhales
It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment
So much rides on it know that you've thought, 'How can be pure
How can  be impartial without being cold
How can  be merciful and still be just
' And know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped
To judge correctly
We have the reputation of two men
Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us
And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye
(beat) who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life
(beat) We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence

We will show: One

Why did he go to see Mary Rooney
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors
What did he find
Nothing
How good's your intelligence
Very good
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr
Thompson
As far as we know, nothing
Alito nods, they stop outside a large double door
Thank Mr
Concannon for me
Please tell him 'll see him at his office
Alito knocks on the door
The door is opened by a Alito nods to the Young Lawyer, enters the Bishop's study
The door is closed behind him

One  leans over and makes a whispered comment to another
The   nods, inclines his head toward the witness box
Thompson on the stand
Composed, waiting
Concannon consulting his notes
Dr
Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye
Is that correct
That is correct
was engaged to render an opinion
Engaged to render an opinion
For a price
Is that correct
You're being paid to be here today
Just as you are, Sir
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor

Yes, we've heard that
Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians
Isn't that right
You, you're available for that
When you're paid to be there
Sir
Yes
When a thing is wrong
as in this case,  am available am seventy-four years old,  am not board-certified

Do you, indeed
'll bet you do
Fine
Fine
We'll save the court the time
We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine
Concannon sits
(in undertone, to Bailiff) Do we have time this morning to
(glances at watch, Bailiff nods to him) All right
Mr
Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr
Thompson this afternoon
(rising) Thank you, your Honor, 'll continue
Dr
Thompson
Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility
did
Objection
Sustained
Yes
The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records
What
(patronizing) believe that's the law
is it not, Mr
Galvin
beat
Dr
Thompson
From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye
Cardiac arrest
During delivery her heart stopped
When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen
You get brain damage
That is why she's in the state she's in today
Now, Dr
Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes
In your opinion is his estimate correct
It's my opinion it took him much longer
Nine
ten minutes
There's too much brain damage
The Judge leans over
(to Dr
Thompson) Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice
Well
Your Honor
He has shouted unconsciously; the whole Courtroom turns to look at him
Yes, Mr
Galvin
If  may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way
'd just like to get to the point, Mr
Galvin
Let's not waste these people's time
Answer the question, Mr
Witness
Please
Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence
in that small context  would have
would have to say 'no
' Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question
given the limits of your question, that's correct
The Doctors were not negligent
(beat) um
The Judge shrugs, meaning, "Well then what in the hell are we doing here
" Galvin, furious
The Judge and Witness
Thank you
The Witness starts to step down
Galvin strides over to him and speaks to the Judge
'm not through with the witness, your Honor
With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me would appreciate it if you wouldn't lose it
The Judge stands, furious
Thank you
think that's enough for this morning
'll see the Plaintiff's Counsel in my chambers
Now, please
The Courtroom rises
The Bailiff is heard, "All rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock
" '  - Galvin, furious, standing against the wall
The Judge comes in from his own entrance, shucking his robe
Equally angry
got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out
They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case
Now this is it today
'm an attorney on trial before the bar
Representing my client
My client, do you understand
You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me
Listen to me, fella
No, no, you listen to me
All  wanted in this case is an even shake
You rushed me into court in five days
my star witness disappears,  can't get a continuance, and  don't give a damn
'm going up there and 'm going to try it
Let the Jury decide
They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge don't care
said, the hell with it
The hell with it
'll take my chances he'll be fair
Galvin is pacing
Beat
(conciliatory) Galvin, look, many years ago
And don't give me this shit, ' was a lawyer, too
' 'Cause  know who you were
You couldn't hack it as a lawyer
You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are
know who you are
(beat; barely controlling anger) Are you done
Damn right 'm done
'm going to ask for a mistrial and 'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case
'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy
We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end
Now you get out of here before call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail
'  - Galvin walking down the corridor, having just come from the Judge's Chambers
Sally Doneghy comes up to him
What does it mean
(beat) mean we, you have other tactics
We, yes
Yes
They, they present their side, and  get the same chance
To cross-examine
to
to
Are we going to win
(beat, desperately needing to trust) We have, you know, other tactics, though
Yes
She nods

Walks off
Galvin turns to the open door to the Courtroom, through which the  are reentering for the afternoon session
Mickey is standing by the door, he catches Galvin's eye
They look at each other a moment
- Dr
Towler on the witness stand
Concannon walking away from him
No further questions
Galvin at the Plaintiff's table, hastily scribbling notes, he looks up
Gets to his feet, walks over to Dr
Towler in the witness box, the    him
Dr
Towler
Yes
You have a record of what happened in the operating room
Yes, that's correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
Yes
of the procedures
Yes, the roving nurse
But those notations stop
(consults notes) Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's
We, we were rather busy
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped
(beat) And they resume seven minutes
As 've said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes
(beat) We were trying to restore her
What happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
What happened in those three minutes
(beat; controls himself) We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat
(
) Objection, we've
to get her heartbeat back
(
) We've touched on this, his own witness has said
(overriding him) almost nine minutes
causing brain damage
Your Honor
Your Honor
Brain damage could have been
it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes
Yes
(contemptuous) Huh
And why is that
Because she was anemic
(beat) It's right there on her chart
Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway
Galvin is struck dumb
He has just made a terrible error
He looks at Mickey
-
Mickey looks at Galvin
He shakes his head sadly

- The last of the spectators coming out of the court
Galvin and Dr
Thompson are standing there
didn't do too well for you
No, you did fine
'm afraid that's not true
(beat) Will you want me to stay on till Monday
No
No thank you, Doctor
You go home
You know
sometimes people can surprise you
Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
Yes
yes
They shake hands
Dr
Thompson walks off
Stops
You sure you don't want me to stay on
No
No
Thank you
You go home
Mickey walks out of the courtroom arranging papers in his briefcase

He walks off leaving Galvin standing there alone

Tentatively, she looks around

Mickey seated
Morose
Okay
What do you do when you don't have a witness
(reciting a catechism; dispiritedly) You use their witness
That's right
think we tried that
The case is over
Galvin continues pacing
He will not hear what was just said
And how the fuck
You broke the first law that they taught you in law school
You never ask a question you don't know the answer to
(beat) Frankie, wake up
You got your own expert witness says there was no negligence
It's over
Period

He closes the phone book
He reaches in a pack of cigarettes on the desk
It is empty
He roots in the ashtray for a long butt
This disgusts him
He rejects it
Rubs his eyes
Gets up
Goes to the window, stares out
Looks back at the scene in his office
It is over
He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey
He has let them down
He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass
He walks into the anteroom
Sighs, sits on the couch near the door
Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through the slot
He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains it
He refills the tumbler
He absently picks up the mail and starts mechanically sorting through it
He stops at an official-looking piece
-
The letter, return address
He lethargically opens the letter
On Bar Association letterhead, it reads: "You are directed to appear on January 15th to show cause why you should not be disbarred
You are permitted to be represented by counsel of your choice, and
" Galvin reading the letter
He crumbles it and throws it into the wastebasket
He looks at the next letter and skims it into the wastebasket
He looks at the next letter and stops
-
It is a phone bill
'  - Galvin hurrying up the steps of the tenement him into the vestibule
It is Mary Rooney's tenement
'   - He stops by the mailboxes, bends over to read the names
-
The mailboxes: Swoboda; Murch;
Rooney
Galvin straightens, looks around the vestibule, takes heavy letter opener from his jacket pocket and pries open the Rooney mailbox
He extracts letters and rifles through them
-
Mary Rooney's phone bill
- Galvin in an old-fashioned sit-down phonebooth in a drugstore
He is dialing the phone, holding the phone bill
The operator answers, he starts dropping change into the slot
The phone bill opened
It reads, "Rooney, Mary
263 Church Street, Arlington, Mass
" Various local charges
One call to Chicago
One call to Fort Lauderdale
Eight calls to New York
The calls to New York are circled in pen

Swings his feet to the floor
Picks up a pack of cigarettes
Crushes it
It is empty
Can we meet there, Joe
Mickey gets to his feet
(to Laura) You got a cigarette
She shrugs, " don't know
" At the Beacon
On Fifty-third Street
we can spend the night
Mickey has gone over to Laura's purse
Opens it, rummaging
Comes up with a pack of cigarettes
He sees something in the purse
Stops
-
The open purse
The red-backed legal form
The letterhead reads, ", , ," stamped huge across it in black: "
" Mickey takes out the form, turns page
It reads, "Report on Joseph Galvin," lists haunts, habits, and is heavily notated in various types of pen and pencil
(
) (on phone) At around four
Mickey replacing the form and the cigarettes
He re-closes the purse
He turns to her
She has seen nothing
feel the same way, Joe
'll see you this afternoon
She hangs up
You got any cigarettes
- Two very young children walk across a play area
The door to the play area opens and Joe Galvin, in overcoat, comes in
He looks around the room, starts to walk across it
him to  a woman, , who is comforting a crying child
Galvin walks over to her
Stands a respectful distance away
She sees him watching her, looks up
Hi
Hi
How are you doing
She nods, happy to be working with the child
've been meaning to come in a long time
You live in the neighborhood
Uh-huh
My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so stopped by
How old is he
Four
You're great with these kids
She beams, caught unprepared in something that is a great point of pride with her
Thank you
You're really
(stops, remembering something) You, are you the one they told me was the nurse
Who told you that
(gestures back at the office, vaguely) Mrs
Mrs
Simmonds
Yes
(very serious, correct) used to be a nurse
That's a wonderful profession
My daughter-in-law's a nurse
What did you do, stop
Kathy is lost in thought
This is obviously a very painful subject for her
Beat
Yes
Galvin, getting involved in a serious conversation, takes off his overcoat, he is going to stay awhile
How come you stopped
She is traumatized by the question
The casual conversation has become immediate and painful
She opens her mouth to speak, then stops, staring at Galvin
He doesn't know what she is staring at
something on his jacket
He looks down
- '
The shuttle ticket,  -  , stuck in the lapel pocket of Galvin's suitcoat
Kathy and Galvin
She realizes why he is there
She starts to cry quietly
(beat; gently dropping his pretense) Will you help me

Empty tables -- crisp linen, Laura alone at a table, watching the door, an untouched cup of coffee in front of her

The street
Pedestrians
Joe Galvin comes walking hurriedly, smiling, down the street
Mickey starting down the steps, intercepts Galvin
Galvin looks up, surprised
What the hell are you doing here
We got to talk
He is moving Galvin off down the sidewalk, away from the Hotel
, and their voices get fainter as they move away
What are you doing in New York
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee
They continue walking
We cannot hear them
Galvin is becoming agitated
He stops Mickey, stands there, Mickey very sad, Galvin incredulous, talking to him
Mickey nods
Galvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the Hotel
- of Laura seated at a table alone
Galvin at the entrance to the restaurant looking at her
He walks over to her slowly
- Laura, looks up, sees him, smiles
Her smile fades, she sees that he knows
Laura getting up from the table
We  her back, and Galvin approaching
We  her shoulders droop, beaten
He draws closer
Galvin comes up to her, his face a mask of pain and confusion
She sighs, starts to speak
Stops
Beat
They look at each other -- he starts to speak, cannot
He knocks her to the floor, she upsets the table
large man at the next table starts to restrain Galvin
(as if in shock) It's all right
it's all right
it's all right
it's all right
- Galvin and Mickey seated next to him, flying home in silence
Mickey smoking a cigarette
Galvin stone-faced, beat
talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association
(beat) The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago
(beat; lamely) She wanted to move to Boston
(beat) How badly did she hurt us, Joe
don't know

We got a mistrial, you know
Joe -- did you hear what  said
don't want a mistrial
'  - The doorway to his study
basketball game dimly  in the half-light
Mickey, o
s
: He's not here
(pause) Yeah
don't know when
(pause) All right
Sound of him hanging up a telephone
He enters the frame carrying a bottle of booze, goes through door into study
: (
) The Knicks are pressing hard
(etc
) He sits on a sofa opposite the television
Watches the game a beat
Opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large shot into the almost-empty glass in front of him
Looks to his left
Reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf, takes one down, pours drink into the new glass, leans to his left,    him, and we  Galvin sitting in a deep leather armchair, staring
Mickey offers him the drink
Galvin becomes aware of him, shakes his head "no
" Beat
Mickey moves back into his seat, they both stare at the television
-- '
- Half full of spectators
Galvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book as Dr
Towler takes the stands
He reads: Dr
Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic
Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic
' Does that sound familiar
Yes
wrote it
Galvin shows the book
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia
' General textbook on the subject
Is that correct
Yes
It is
And you wrote that
Yes
(reading) Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask
' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye
She aspirated into her mask
She threw up in her mask, yes
But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic
the type you gave her
would have been negligent
Negligent
Yes
it would have been criminal
But that was not the case
Thank you
Galvin signals he is done
The Judge signals Dr
Towler to leave the stand, which he does
Mr
Concannon
Nothing further, your Honor
Mr
Galvin, rebuttal
(to Bailiff) Katherine Price
The Bailiff calls out her name
Katherine Price
Kathy at the back of the court, coming down the aisle
As she passes the Defendant's table, Towler grabs Marx and starts whispering frantically
Concannon looks on, ignorant of what is happening
We hear Dr
Towler's "Oh, my God
" Galvin surveys the courtroom, Kathy crosses in front of him, takes the stand, we hear the Bailiff administering the formula as we  Galvin turn and look at the Jurors
(
) State your name please
(
) Katherine Lynn Price
'you swear that the evidence you are about to give will be the truth, the
The Bailiff swearing in Kathy
whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God
do
Be seated
Kathy sits, the Bailiff retires, Galvin walks over to her
Kathy Price
Yes
You were the Admitting Nurse at St
Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted
Yes
Galvin holds up a form
You signed this form
She looks closely at it
Is satisfied
Yes
These are your initials, '
'
Kathy Costello
That's my maiden name
beat
'you ask the patient when did she last eat
Yes
What did she say
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital
One hour
Yes
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour
did
single hour
Yes
Galvin walks away from the witness box
He looks at the jury
He turns to look at the spectators
His thoughts are a million miles away
Unconsciously he straightens his tie
Galvin in front of the dead-still courtroom
He breaks his reverie
(to Concannon) Your witness
Concannon is on his feet as Galvin walks back to his table
Concannon walks over to Kathy and begins forcefully: You are aware of the penalties for perjury
It's a crime
Yes
(beat) It is a crime
serious crime
wouldn't do it
You would not
No
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury
You've just sworn to that
Isn't that right
Yes
Just now
Yes
sworn before God you would tell the truth
(beat) Yes
Now
'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs
Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed
And wasn't that an oath
These are your initials here:
When you signed this chart you took an oath
No less important than that which you took today
(beat) Isn't that right
(beat) Isn't that right
yes
Then, please, which is correct
You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago
Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago
Which is the lie
When were you lying
You know these doctors could have settled out of court
They wanted a trial
They wanted to clear their names
Objection
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives
They lied
'They lied
' Indeed
When did they lie
And do you know what a lie is
do
Yes
(holding chart) You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
That's not my handwriting
You've just said you signed it
Yes, , yes,  signed it, yes
But ,  didn't write that figure
You didn't write that figure
And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
(taking a paper out of her purse) Because  kept a copy
have it right here
She looks toward Galvin
Galvin nods, meaning, "You did it perfectly
" Concannon, the Judge, Kathy
Objection
This is ri
expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right
'll rule on that presently
(beat) Proceed
Concannon is taken up short
Amazed at the Judge's reaction, he pauses an instant
Please proceed
Concannon motions to Billy, the young lawyer, who nods in response and starts whispering instructions to his colleagues at the Defense table, who start leafing through their lawbooks
Concannon takes up the fight again
what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years
This is a
why
Why would you do that
thought  would need it
And why, please tell us, would you think that
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma
Dr
Towler called me in
He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form
(beat) And he told me to change the form
He told me to change the one to a nine
(beat) Or else, or else, he said
(beat; starts to cry) He said he'd fire me
He said 'd never work again
Who were these men
Who were these men wanted to be a nurse
She is weeping copiously
beat
She starts to get herself under control
No further questions
You may step down
Beat
Kathy starts to get down
She looks to Galvin for assurance
Galvin nods at her
Mr
Galvin
Kathy getting down from the stand
The Judge addressing Galvin
Nothing further, your Honor
Mr
Concannon
Concannon is signalled by Billy, the young lawyer at the Defense table, who is gathering notes from his colleagues, who have been researching during Kathy's speech
Concannon walks over to the table and is quickly "talked through" the notes by Billy
Mr
Concannon
Concannon cuts Billy short, meaning, "Yes,  understand, 'm far ahead of you," he takes the notes and returns to the bench
Thank you, your Honor
We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana,
131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed
' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form
one moment, Mr
Concannon
The Judge nods, meaning, " am considering
" The Judge
He is making some notations on a page in front of him
He nods to himself, he has reached a decision
He looks up
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form
(explains to them) It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original
Thank you, your Honor
Further: Ms
Costello is a rebuttal witness
As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony
As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed  request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here
'm going to uphold that
Galvin getting to his feet
object, your Honor
Overruled
Exception
Noted
Thank you
(to Jury) Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness
Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed
Galvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table
(
) Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record
You shouldn't have heard it, but you did
Now, that was my mistake
and you must strike it from your minds, give it no weight
Galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on it
'  - Legally it's over
Concannon was brilliant
Tell me about Kaitlin Costello
There's nothing to tell
It's been stricken from the record
know
Did you believe her
-  '
-   - All looking slightly to their right
Mr
Galvin
- In front of the full jury box
Beat
You know, so much of the time we're lost
We say, 'Please, God, tell us what is right
Tell us what's true
There is no justice
The rich win, the poor are powerless
' We become tired of hearing people lie
After a time we become dead
little dead
We start thinking of ourselves as victims
(pause) And we become victims
(pause) And we become weak
and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions
and doubt our beliefs
we say for example, 'The law is a sham
there is no law
was a fool for having believed there was
' (beat) But today you are the law
You are the law
And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble statues and the trappings of the court
all that they are is symbols
(beat) Of our desire to be just
(beat) All that they are, in effect, is a prayer
(beat) a fervent, and a frightened prayer
In my religion we say, 'Act as if you had faith, and faith will be given to you
' (beat) If
If we would have faith in justice, we must only believe in ourselves
(beat) And act with justice
(beat) And  believe that there is justice in our hearts

You are not bound by anything, other than your good judgment, based on the evidence
Galvin, totally defeated
Nods his head sadly, as if commiserating philosophically, with himself
Mickey looks at him in grief, with sympathy

Galvin slowly raises his head, turns and looks at the Jury, Mickey begins to smile
Yes
You are
