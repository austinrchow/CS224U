Sydney's mother and Sydney's father

Neighbors and lookie-loos around
When confronted with the charge, which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime, Fay Barringer swore that she did not know that the gun was loaded
didn't know --  didn't know -- She always threatens me with the gun, but  don't keep it loaded -- -- and you didn't load the gun
Why would  load the gun

He is killed instantly but continues to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach

,
The crowd of fifty  who are taking the "Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and play along; Frank is on a slightly elevated stage
vBehind him a huge banner for, "Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf with a big buldge in his fur
It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives"
And you did hear me right
Tame it
Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, "No
You will not control me
You will not take my soul and you will not win this game
" 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: 'm in charge
'm the one who says yes, no, now or here
Shit, man
Sad but true
Sad But True
And you wanna know what
It must be the way
The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is
mean:  wish  could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality If each chick had something new, something really new that 'd never seen before
Fuckin' hell: 'd be in the money
Because 'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case
They are universal
They are sheep
They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted
'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are
Reality: They Are All The Same
Each and every one of them
And once you learn these methods: You're Set
You Don't Have To Come Back
That's it
In solid
Boom
Done
Over
Why
Because all women are the same
Period
End of discussion
Sorry
It's true
Sad But True
And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair
"  Yes, they are
Guilty as charged
And so's the world
It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- Period
Sorry
End of discussion
: / - Sliding doors open in the lobby and a young woman  (30s) enters, takes off her sunglasses and looks around
There's a bunch of Posters and Signs for the "Seduce and Destroy Seminar with Frank  Mackey," etc
Frank's two sidekicks:  (20s) and   (40s) approach; You're Gwenovier
Yeah
'm Captain Muffy, 'm Frank's personal assistant
This is Doc -- Hello
Hello
We can go right in here
He started about thirty five minutes ago, but it's all getting pumped up now -- : /  - Captain Muffy, Doc and Gwenovier enter and head tor some seats, swings a 180 and moves down the aisle, towards the stage as Frank speaks -- Number One: Get a calendar
cannot stress this enough
This is a simple item guys
It's 99 cents at your corner store: Go And Get One
Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you'll see 've been nice enough to include one, 'cause that's the kind of prick  am -- You're gonna need this calendar and  know it sounds like a small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you meet a girl and you're gonna work an -3 Interuption -- let's say an eight day waiting period before the next call -- how you gonna know when those eight days are up
Buy a calendar
Next move
Mark the calendar
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What did  pay my eight hundred dollars for
To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it
Just stick with me and stick by the calendar
Mark it up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna make that "friend" something else -- you gotta be hard on yourself, set goals: (beat, to audience) You, there: And What's Your Name
: ' / - Phil flips through a little adress book, finds a number
- It reads, "Frank 8/509-9027"  He picks up a phone and dials; Hello
Hi
Is Frank there
think you have the wrong number
'm looking for Frank Mackey
No
Is this 509-9027
Yeah
You have the wrong number
There's no one named Frank here
Alright
Thank you
Yep
Phil hangs up the phone
: /  - with Gwenovier as she walks quietly over to the side of the crowd to a   that's been set up and is recording Frank's seminar
She speaks sotto to a ; Sorry 'm late -- -- we're all set upstairs
Thanks
She moves towards a row and takes a seat next to Captain Muffy and Doc, speaks sotto again; You have everything you need
'm set, thanks
moves away, Frank is kneeling down to a  in the audience, interacting, speaking compassionately; Denise
That's right -- -- and she hurt you didn't she
know,  know
know how that can be brother, but let me tell you loud and clear what we will be teaching Denise when we put our calendars to work and set goals: Frank hops back up on the stage; Little Denise,  say this:   mark it up and  write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know 'm not gay
" "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon
" "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage
"  've
And what
've said "enough is enough
" Because why
She's not gonna be your pal
She's not gonna be your friend
You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something
Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise
(audience cheers) But: Listen up:  That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps
But we'll get to that
Number One (this is page 18 in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and follow along with me
) The guys flip open their little blue booklets and follow along
Create a crisis -- simple and clean, and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush
Here we go:  Set a date with your so-called "friend
"  Let's say you make it 7:30
You call her on the phone -- : '  - a young  (20s) on the phone
That sounds like fun, Frank
love seafood
: '  - Frank on the phone
So 'll see you about 7:30
Great, then
Bye-bye, Cindy
He hangs up
: '  - ( ) follows behind the  as she walks from the kitchen to the front door, shaking her head, huffing and puffing
() You wait until about nine o'clock and you ring the doorbell
She opens the door and sees , crying and hysterical
() She opens it up, pissed as hell, but finds you sobbing your eyes out -- Frank looks up at her and says: can't believe what happened
Frank and the Girl sit down on the couch together
() You explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal hospital but by the time you got there -- and it's paw was sticking out
and it was too late
It was too late
She moves in and hugs him
Ohhh, shhhh
shhh
Frank
: /  - Frank is cracking himself up
He continues
can't believe 'm telling you guys this, but the truly terrifying part is that:
Any girl that calls herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like that
Technique #2: Staging a fight
This is not knock down, drag out, crying screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girl's mind
Remember we are using reinforcement technique "" with these women
Here's how: : '  - The Girl picks up her phone and presses some numbers
() One day, she calls you up on the phone
: '  - Frank picks up the phone
Hello
Hey, Frank
It's Cindy
'm wondering if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie
() You very directly say: " don't think  have anything to say to you, Cindy
" Frank hangs up the phone
: '  - The Girl gets the dial tone
She looks completely confused and hurt
: /  - Frank speaking to the group: Let her wonder what she did wrong
Frank's tone changes a bit, gets darker: This is the way
because they will always wonder, "What did  do
" "What could  have done different
" "How should  behave to get this back
" And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do
That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over
: -  - pushes in as  walks towards us, down the same hallway we saw Jimmy Gator walking down earlier, she heads into an office -- : ' /  - pushes in on Linda as she enters,  over to a who looks up; Mrs
Partridge -- 'm here and  need to see him
: '  - Quick shots get them in the room:
(40s) sits across from , who's in semi-hysterics, pacing; -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down
can help you through this the best  know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but  need to know that you're listening to me, ok
just,  just --  just -- 'm just in a fucking state,  know he's going and it's like  don't know how -- just tell me practical things -- What the fuck do  do with his body
What happens when he dies
That next moment: What
What do  do
Then What
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you
They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you -- He has Phil right now
Phil's one of the nurses from the service
Yeah
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body -- -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and  don't know if they're going down --  can't see inside his mouth anymore -- 'm up all night staring at him and  don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts -- We can fix that, because  can give you -- are you listening
'm listening
'm getting better
Do you wanna sit down
need to sit down
Ok
Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it
He's dying
He is
He is dying very, very rapidly -- She breaks a bit more
Now the thing here is making that experience as painless and easy as possible for him, you understand
Now you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking me about -- they are who you call when he dies
He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak; This is the number for Hospice
Ok
Now
As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine
it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back,  mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda
mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- -- how the fuck can  say anything to that --  don't know what to say to that -- The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible
Right
You understand

Not the Frank  Mackey you're eager to talk to because  was swimming in what was as opposed to wanted Where does that name come from
What name
My name
It's not your given name, right
My mother's name, actually
Good question
You've done you're research
And "Frank
" "Frank" was my mother's father
Ok
That's why
had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and
Your name change -- they had no official enrollment -- Oh, yeah
No, no, no
They wouldn't -- They wouldn't
no, no, no
Certainly not
wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right
Was that unclear
Kind of
wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there
But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others
was completely independent financially, and like  said: One Sad Sack  Shit
So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and  think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day
Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World
Defining It
Controling It and saying:  will take what is mine
You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not

End of Round One
Excellent work ladies and germs, let's see the scores on the boards: Kids up a leg with 2025, Adults down a bit with 1200
We'll be back for Round Two and a Ring-Dang-Do -- sudden and   sounds
Musical Bonus Question before we go to break and the lucky team is -- Jimmy opens an  and reads: Kids in the lead and they get a chance to pull further and farther ahead -- with the following secret bonus musical question: will read you a line from an opera and you are to give me the same line in the language in which the opera was originaly written and for a bonus 25 you can sing it
Here's the line: "Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame, and it's all in vain to call it, if it chooses to refuse
" and  over to the  and moves in close on Stanley; Well that was
uh
in French
and that was in the opera, "Carmen
" And that goes
um
(sings) 'amour est un oiseau rebelle Que nul ne peut apprivoiser, Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle, 'il lui convient de refuser
The  applauds and the "Carmen," que carries over the following scene; : '  - Sequence Jim Kurring and Clauida continued
He walks into the  area and sees a pot of coffee
got some coffee brewing, huh
Yeah
it's not
it's been on for a bit -- like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not,  enjoy a warm cup -- -- do you wanna cup
That's great, thank you
She starts heating/preparing him some coffee
don't know how fresh it's gonna be -- Oh, it'll be fine, 'm sure, Claudia
You take cream or sugar
That'd be fine
So, Claudia, lemme just say, so  can get my role of  officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee ( never like to talk shop over coffee) 'm not gonna write you up or anything, 'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that
If you had a job you'd probably understand, but  see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what  do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright
see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok
Yeah
Arlight, then
Cheers
They clink coffee cups
He makes a sour face at the taste; Is this boyfriend bothering you
don't have a boyfriend
The gentleman who came to the door -- -- is not my boyfriend
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but  have to tell you that, being a police officer, 've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, 'm gettin' a call on the radio, got a 422 -- It's not -- what's a 422
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help
Now there are certain measures you can take -- It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over
Really
It's not
He won't came back
don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance
You won't
You won't have to
But  wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face
They laugh
'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick
Okey-doke
She exits
with him
: '  - She enters, gets the coke from the laundry basket -- and sets some up, snorts it back -- : '   - Jim Kurring looks over his shoulder and sees that she's gone
He quickly moves to the kitchen and dumps the coffee in the sink and then quickly sits back down
End Carmen Que

He takes a shot of Jack Daniels that Mary has brought out for him
can't fuckin' do this
Are you alright
Fuck
think 'm gonna throw up,  think
(beat) haven't thrown up since  was twenty years old
Jimmy stumbles over to a corner a bit; ,
Stanley is trying to flag down Cynthia, who stands off in the wings, she finally comes over; Stanley, what's the problem
have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now
You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is  the time to go to the bathroom
'm,  need to go, 'm gonna -- Why does this kinda shit always happen, Stanley
The Adult Challengers look over at the Kids section; What's the problem over there
Mind yer bussiness -- Watch your mouth, little man
Why don't you mind your own bussiness
Alright, stop it, cool down, cool it
Please
Now: Stanley, you wait until the next commercial break and you can go then -- Just Hold It
(to Adults) Don't taunt the kids -- just asked what was going on -- Don't start trouble, Luis

pushes in on Jimmy from behind as he throws up in a corner
Mary pets his back
He throws up a lot of
She snaps fingers to a stage hand to bring some towles and a glass of water -- Two minutes, everyone, we're back in two

: - pushes in on Chad, on the phone; Hey, Janet, it's Chad
What's wrong
Nothing's wrong,  just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father -- -- no,no,no what is this

) Earl is  in pain, the  are barking at the noise
Earl continues to hallucinate and remains in major pain, but at the same time he's very, very weak
There are moments of strength that pop and push into him and he's very angry with Phil, continues to scream for someone named, "Lily," and generally treats Phil like an enemy
,
Phil moves into the kitchen and gets the bottle of
He drops them, the crash on the floor, picks them all up, except one

Alright
Put him through and lemme see what's goin' on -- : - on Chad
He puts Janet on hold and clicks over to Phil: Phil, you there

(Bit less pain now
) The Mutt/Morphine Dog is starting to get a bit wobbly
Yeah, hey
Chad
Alright, so 'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do -- Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother -- Thank you
Thank you very much
Chad clicks a line and confrences Janet and Phil
Hello

Hi, hi, thank you for taking my call -- holds with  for a quick , : : -  - Jimmy finishes cleaning himself up and he looks to Mary: have Cancer, Mary
She doesn't know what to say

It's in my bones and  don't have a chance
And 'm fucked
had a stroke last week -- Jimmy
The  call from
Ten Seconds
Jimmy walks from behind the curtain to the "Adult" contestants, takes his mark and waits for the countdown --  moves over to Stanley who watches Jimmy closely and sees him stumble a bit, recognizes that something is wrong
Floor Director counts, 3-2-1 -- : - Sequence pulls back from the  above the bar, playing the show
We see Jimmy start to chat w/and do intro's for the adults
Director's Note : This runs through scene and a complete script is avail/will be shot
) Donnie and Thurston and the Patrons continued; do you know who  am
You're a friend of the family  presume
What
What does that mean
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra
rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see
see
see  used to be smart
'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith
'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv -- Might of been before my time
#1 remember you
remember
In the 60's right
'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith
like you said
#1 Smart Kid
Fuck, yeah, he-he
You got hit by lightning that one time, right
So what
#1 heard about that
#2 Did it hurt
Yes
But you're alright now, so what's the what
What
That's right
used to be smart but now 'm just stupid
Brad, dear
Brad turns and looks: Who was it that said: " man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself
" (to himself) -- Samuel Johnson
don't know
Donnie looks up at Brad
Brad smiles with his braces, Donnie looks away quick -- It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others
" "The" cause of dullness in others -- Picky, picky
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money
His parents
His mommy and daddy
Make him live this life like this -- " man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting
It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't
well, what -- #1 You're parents took your money you won on that game show
Yes they did
(turns quick to Thurston) What does that mean, "spoke in the wheel
" Things go round 'n round, don't they
Yes they do, they do, but 'll make my dreams come true, you see
will
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow
used to be smart but now 'm just stupid
Shall we drink to that
Donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up, pushes in slow to an
He repeats line's from his days on "What Do Kids Know
" and does his best Jimmy immitation; "If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh
" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" " little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius
"The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona
Where
Who
How and Why, Kids
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now
: - on the set with Jimmy walking over to the "Kids" panel; Are you guys glued to those seats or what
Are you ever leaving
You're getting close to the record, do you get more nervous as we go along
little -- -- yeah
-- kids at school must be real excited for you, eh
Oh, yeah
yeah
Sure
Stanley the Man
How are you
'm fine
Yes
You're fast becoming a celebrity
How are you handling it all
Ohh, it's all fine
It's all
Nice
'd just like to keep going
keep getting on
Sure, sure
that's fine, then
there
with
Jimmy starts to loose his grip on the proceedings a bit, slows his pace down
Stanley notices
Well you've got
many
things, many things happening and on the way
,
on Burt as he sees Jimmy start to zone out a bit
: '  - pushes in on Rose, sitting in the kitchen, watching the television
She holds her breath and tears a bit, noticing Jimmy start to fade
: - Back to Stanley and Jimmy
Jimmy repeats himself; What were you saying, Stanley
was saying
thinking maybe 'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy
Just like you
The  laughs
Jimmy clicks back with a chuckle and a "isn't that cute," smile to the crowd and he walks over to his podium;  stays for a moment with Stanley, notices him continue to grab his crotch and make a face
, , here we go: Steeper questions, bigger payoff, individual challenges with musical and audio pockets, no-steal-lock-out's, let's get it on in Round Two, Categories are: : - Frank and Gwenovier doing the telvision interview : -- that's right, that's right, and what ' saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding
Things of the past
Gone, Over, Done
Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is
How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is
'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values
'
There is no need for
There is no need for have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language
The "listener-patient" (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state:   , mind you, but a
state that is brand new
The System's state
What did  do
that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use
'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn
'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- Let's talk about -- just realized this is for television, isn't it
can't swear up and down like  just did
It's fine
can bleep it out
warned you --  get on a roll
-- let's talk more about your background -- Muffy -- coffee
Muffy moves to pour a cup, Gwen looks down at her clipboard, then: 'm confused about your past is the thing
Is that still lingering
-- just to clarify -- So boring, so useless -- would just want to clear some things up: (Muffy delivers coffee) Thank you, Muffy
Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something tell my men over and over -- This isn't meant -- -- and  try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of
Are you asking me that
Yes
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become -- In aid of what
'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are -- -- there's a lot more important things 'd like to put myself into -- It's all important -- Not really
It's not like 'm trying to attack you -- This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- We talked earlier about your mother
And we talked about your father and his death
And  don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but  have to ask and would want to clarify something -- something that  understand -- 'm not sure  hear a question in there
Do you remember a Miss Simms
know alotta women and 'm sure she remembers me
She does
From when you were a boy
Mm
Hm
She lived in Tarzana
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question -- Go ahead and waste your time
was told that your mother died
That your mother died when you were young -- And that's what you've heard
talked to Miss Simms
Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980
Frank goes silent
In my research  have you listed as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge
(beat) And what  learned from Mrs
Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980
(beat) See:  It's my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers to question's 've asked are incorrect, Frank
And if 'd like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then  think your family history -- you're accurate family history
well: this seems important
Frank
- Frank lights his cigarette
zooms into
Are you asking me a question
Well  guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms
, : : - Jimmy asks questions
Stanley is visibly uncomfortable; Kids, Adults, 'd like you to put yourself at a picnic
Place yourself there with your family and friends if you'd like -- you'll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it might represent that you'd find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes: we hear three musical notes
The "Adults" panel lights up, Todd answers; Well, Jimmy,  know this,  have perfect pitch, you see -- and that would be --
And that would represent lemonade
For 250
Next notes, please: musical notes: --
(buzzes) Got it
That's -- which would be ~egg
" Richard and Julia glance at Stanley, like "why the fuck aren't you answering these questions
" He looks straight ahead
For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes: musical notes: --
(buzzes) -- -- and don't get stung
The "Adults" are now within 200 points of the "Kids," on the scoreboard
: - Linda seated across from a lawyer,   (50s) She's visibly shaking and fucked up
You don't want any water
No
just
(starts crying a bit) 'm so fucked up here Alan,  don't know
there's so much
so many things -- Are you on drugs right now
If  talk to you
y'know
if  tell you things
then you're a lawyer, right
You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right
Attornery-client, you understand
Not exactly, Linda
'm not sure where you're going with this -- Like a shrink, like if  go to see a shrink, 'm protected,  can say things -- fuck --  don't know what 'm doing -- Linda, you're safe
Ok
It's alright
You're my friend
You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say -- --  have something to tell you
have to tell you something
want to change his will, can  change his will
need to --- You can't change his will
Only Earl can change his will
No, no
no, you see
never loved him
never loved him, Earl
When  started, when  met him,  met him and  fucked him and  married him because  wanted his money, do you understand
(beat) 'm telling you this now
this 've never told anyone
didn't love him
And now
know 'm in that will, know,  was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money ' get --  don't want it -- Because  love him so much now
've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and  look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead
he's moments
(beat) took care of him through this, Alan
And What Now Then
: - pushes in on Jimmy
Let's listen: There's an   that speaks the clue; "Hello, Mary
How are you and the seven kids
As you probably heard by know, we sure gave that Pope a run for his money --" The ~Adults" buzz
Jimmy looks to Mim
Well: That would be General Robert Lee
His wife Mary Park Custiss
And he did have seven children and he would be talking about Pope, who he defeated at the Battle of Monasses -- : - pushes in on Rick, who sits back, starting to get real pissed that Stanley isn't answering these questions
'mon, c'mon, c'mon, snap out of it
: - moves from the  over to the Stage, listening to another question that is spoken by the  voice -- this time in French; (in French) "Hello, Josephine, 'm speaking from Egypt --" The Adults buzz again and Mim answers; Mim -- Well that would be Napoleon speaking to Josephine
That's right
,
He stands off, looking at the scoreboard as the Adults have now pulled ahead by 200 points
he mumbles and grumbles to himself
: '  - Linda continued with the lawyer, Kligman
don't want him to die,  didn't love him when we met, and 've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things  want to confess to him, but now  do:  love him
love him so much and  can't stand -- he's going
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's -- This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't --  don't know
don't know -- Can you give me nothing
You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will --  don't want any money,  couldn't live with myself, this thing 've done -- 've fucking done so many bad things -- fucked around
fucked around on him, fucking cheated on him, Alan
You're his lawyer, our laywer, , 'm his wife, we are married
broke the conract of marriage,  fucking cheated on him, many times over,  sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - fuck
Other Things 've Done
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda
Linda
Calm down
can't
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time
Where will the money go
Well
Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will
we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will -- What does that mean
The money would go to Frank
The court would put the money in the hands of a relative -- -- that can't happen
Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up can hardly stand it
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time -- Shut the fuck up
'm trying to help, Linda -- Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
You need to sober up
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please
Shut The Fuck Up
Linda -- have to go
She heads for the door
Let me call you a car, Linda
Shut the fuck up
She's out the door
: - Three  in  and  have taken a place near the band
Jimmy, reading from his cards, introduces them and asks the following question: (Note: Jimmy's speech is starting to slur a bit more at this point
His motor skills seem to be fading quickly
) Imagine you are attending a jam session of classical composers and they have each done an arrangment of the classic favorite, "Whispering
"  Here are three variations on the theme, as three classic composer's might have written it -- you are to name the composer
The First: The Harmonica Fella's play an arrangment
pushes in close on  and
Stanley begins to piss his pants
He trembles and shakes and holds back tears as the wet stain gets bigger
through this we hear the Adults answer the question: () Well, Jimmy that sounded to me like Brahms, a bit like his Hungarian Dance Number Six,  believe
() Excellent
Next number: The Harmonica Fella's play another arrangment of "Whispering" that sounds like Ravel's "Bolero
" Stanley moves his arms down to his sides to cover his crotch and pull at his pants -- and his  goes off with a brush of the side of his arm -- Stanley the Man -- answer: Stanley
He starts to cry
Julia and Richard look over at him and see his pants and they start to laugh a bit
don't know the answer
Jimmy starts to  and  a bit
holds a tight grip on the podium; That is not right
That's not right, Stanley, the answer is
Ravel

and pushes over to the
What the fuck is wrong with him
(into headseat} What do you wanna do here, he's fading fast -- : - The main booth with monitors and board, etc
The  and and  watch the monitors; need a better cutaway, go to the black chick, Camera Three, Camera Three the black chick -- monitor sees the video camera zoom in on Mim as a cutaway but her face is like, "What the fuck is going on
" : -   - Jimmy is, with a lot of trouble, trying the Harmonica Fella's with the next question
Burt walks over quickly to the Floor Director
Get the technical difficulty card up -- pushes over to Stanley, who's crying and shaking
pushes in on Jimmy, who stumbles back from his podium and falls to the ground
taking the podium with him
pushes in on Burt and the Floor Director
Cut it, go to the card, go to the fucking card -- : - The  snaps his fingers to an  at the board
Go to the card, now -- go -- -
The card that reads, "Technical Difficulty," comes up and holds
: '  - pushes in real quick on Claudia   from her hand in the bedroom -- she rushes back into the kitchen area -- Ok, ok
'm back
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia -- Thank you
She sits down, ready to talk, lights a cigarette
What do you wanna talk about
: - Burt, Mary and Assistants and folks run over to Jimmy
He stands, doesn't realize what's happend and mumbles, "what the fuck, what the
" The  is murmuring, standing and watching the scene
: - leads  as he comes charging out of the green room and races down the hallway -- : - with the "Kids" panel as Richard and Julia looking at Stanley
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley
Shut up -- shut up -- Cynthia walks over; What happend, what's going on
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley
am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that  ask, you understand
Rick comes over; What's the problem, what's the problem here
'm fine
nothing
Why didn't you answer those questions
didn't know the answer -- Bullshit
Bullshit
You know the answer to every goddamn question and knew the answer to those questions and 'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened
don't know
He pissed his pants
Did you -- did you -- didn't 'm fine, 'm fine
Stand up

Rick grabs Stanley a bit and sees a large   in Stanley's pants
oh Jesus, what the fuck

Jimmy is sweating
had a stroke,  think  had a stroke
Call 911
Call 911 right now
No, no, no

It's small, wanna keep going -- no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor

Call 911, Mary, do it right now
You fuckin' don't do that
You don't do it, you cocksucker

Go

Shut yer fuckin' mouth

Are we gonna keep going with this game
Yes
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and ' do anything for you, you just gotta get through this -- Alright
hang in there, ok
love you
Rick walks away with Cynthia
Dick Jennings has sobered up a bit and is doing bad, "calm down/comedy/everything's cool" stuff for the Audience
Jimmy and Burt and Mary stand up and a   person runs over with some water and cleans him up a bit
Burt moves away -- What are we doing
This is fuckin' stupidity, we'll get back on and go through it -- The Floor Director starts throwing directions in his headset and to the camera people, etc

Well, then

She's rubbing her jaw, blabbing away and he's listening with a grin; --- yeah, yeah,  get in it in my ear

( Director's Note : Following is the story Earl tells, it is to be more broken and elliptical, factoring in Earl's state of mind and health, etc, but here's the concept in its entirety;) Do you know Lily
Phil
do you know her
No
Lily
No
She's my love
my life
love of it
In school when you're 12 years old
In school, in six grade
and  saw her and  didn't go to that school
but we met
And my friend knew her
would say, "What's that girl
"  "How's that Lily
" "Oh, she's a bad girl

couldn't get over that  wasn't a man, but she was a woman
'see
'see  didn't make her feel ok about that
would say, "How many men you been with
" She told me,  couldn't take it
take that wasn't a man
because if  hadn't had sex with women
like as many women as she had men
then  was weak
a boy
But  loved her
you understand
well, of course,  wanted to have sex with her
and  did and we were together
we met
age twelve, but then again
age seventeen
something, somethin
didn't let her forget that  thought she was a bad
a slut
a slut  would call her and hit her
hit her for what she did
but we married
Lily and me and we married
but  cheated on her
over and over and over again
because  wanted to be a man and  couldn't let her be a woman
a smart, free person who was something

jesus christ, what would  think

He's reading a book

He sticks a finger down his throat, makes himself well with tears

Hello
Hello

They're on the couch
Lights dim
Sitting, talking
She hands him a pill from a bottle with a drink
don't think  want that
It'll take the pain away
It's not really pain
She sets it on the coffee table
Drinks a drink herself
gotta ask you for a cigarette, 'cause don't wanna spend six hours tryin' to get it to my mouth -- She lights a cigarette, puts it in his hand and he struggles a bit with his hand/eye coordination
beat, then; How do we do this, then
We just do it
we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do,  guess
Do you love me, Rose
She smiles and moves closer to him
You're my handsome man
'm a bad person
No
No
No,  mean:  'm telling you this, now
You see
You see  want to make everything clear and clean
and apologize for me

Please
Just

don't want you to think
maybe you knew, think that maybe you've known
So  hope that 'm not saying this for me
for me to make myself feel better about what 've done
but for making you not feel like you're sitting there like a jerk
you've been the good one
You understand
'm so sorry for all 've done wrong
and this is pathetic
what
"Dying man, confess the sins" something
Is it selfish for me to say this
To say what 've done

Rose takes a long moment, then: No
don't hate you
(beat) Do you want talk
do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy
Yeah
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me
Will that help
Yeah
: ' - In a secluded table in this dark steak place
Jim Kurring and Claudia
does a slow push in on a 2-shot
Did you ever go out with someone and just
lie
question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything -- Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something
They want to impress people, the other person
or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them -- So you've done it -- Well  don't go out very much
Why not
've never found someone really that think  would like to go out with
And  bet you say that to all the girls -- No, no
You wanna make a deal with me

He does a little "Cops" talking to himself
alot of people think this is just a job that you go to
take a lunch hour, the jobs over, something like that
But
it's a 24 hour deal
no two ways about it
and what most people don't see:  Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing
(beat) People think if  make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them
but that's not what  do and that's not what should be done
have to take everything and play it as it lays
Sometimes people need a little help
Sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail
And that's a very tricky thing on my part
making that call
the law is the law and heck if 'm gonna break it
but you can forgive someone
Well, that's the tough part
What Do We Forgive
Tough part of the job
tough part of walking down the street

with him as he drives
he starts to cry a little bit to himself

from the back it is clear that it's Jim Kurring
She tears a bit and looks at him
She turns her eyes from him and looks    and smiles
