"The Truman Show", early, by Andrew
Niccol Screen Play By Andrew
Niccol white title appears on a black screen
"One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time
" Andre Gide The title fades off, replaced by a second title
"We're all in this alone
" Lily Tomlin fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old   as he gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of his mother's womb
We focus on the unborn's hand, already a tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed lips
He sucks his thumb
-
seconds old   - umbilical cord still attached, smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera
Shocked by the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the newborn fights for his first, arduous breath
Following almost immediately, a cry
From another angle we see the crying infant on a television screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible
- ,
The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying
, thinning hair, a body going soft around the edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme
He cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears
Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in front of his idling car
Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate
Amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism
He looks around him but the street is deserted
He checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though the fallen fixture is far larger
He looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight
With some effort, Truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away
-
sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into his Styrofoam cup of coffee
Stirring it in with his finger, he burns himself
Shit
As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School, adjacent to the parking lot
The sound of the children triggers a memory in his head
,
, -
Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen
sandy-haired, -- , runs towards a bluff on the beach
The boy's father, , late-thirties, beer bottle in hand, flirts with two   at the shoreline
Suddenly, the father remembers his son
He looks anxiously around
The sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him
The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot
(out of breath, clutching his side) Truman
Truman
Stop
Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his father
But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the anger and distress on his father's face
Come down now
His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more tantalizing
The boy considers defying his father
He puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side
One good stretch would do it
(reading Truman's mind, enraged) No
(sensing his father is keeping something from him) Why
What's there
(unconvincing) Nothing's there
It's the same as this
(trace of desperation) Come down, please
Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other have stopped their activities to stare at him
Reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks
When he finally jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and drags him away down the beach
told you to stay close
Don't ever leave my sight again
You gotta know your limitations
You could've been washed away by the tide
,
emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street
snarl of taxis, buses and traffic
thrusts a pretzel under Truman's nose, a   catches his eye
Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy pages
Glancing in the direction of the   and finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a portion of the open page and pockets the cutting
He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him
(quickly recovering) Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald"
We ran out
(hastily departing) Thanks anyway
As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo and instantly turns to the torn page
It is a Lancome advertisement with  's nose missing
Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to confront him, almost as if he were expecting it
Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective glass
He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his gut, but quickly concedes defeat
The image triggers another childhood memory
, -
Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television screen
The sandy-haired --  sits in the middle row of a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or- so other well-scrubbed, uniformed
, the boy next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty- year-old  with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched
wanna be a chiropractor like my dad
(impressed) Tell the class what a chiropractor does, Douglas
He helps people by fixing their backs, Sister Olivia
That's right, Douglas
(holding her back, hamming it up) Perhaps 'll be your first patient
The  titters
Douglas sits down, pleased with himself, throwing a smirk to Truman
What about you, Truman
Truman rises to his feet
want to be an explorer (with reverence) like Magellan
The Sister's face falls
No one's going to pay you to do that, Truman
(with scarcely disguised glee) Besides, you're too late
There's nothing left to explore
The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat
,
From '  we see that he is staring up at relief letters that proclaim, "American Life & Accident Insurance, Inc
" above an office building's entrance
walking his beat, wanders in Truman's direction
From another angle, we observe Truman from the Police Officer's  - shaky, handheld camera - on a television screen
Truman enters the building
-
In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle,  talks on the telephone
(into receiver) okay, okay, let's call it what it is
'm not gonna lie to you
life insurance is death insurance
you just gotta ask yourself two questions
one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss
and two, do you care
drops a large reference book on Truman's desk
He checks the spine - " , 1986 to Present"
(into receiver) Hold on will ya
(to Clerk, putting receiver to chest, referring to the book) This's no good
Lumps all drownings together
need drownings broken down by category
The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues his rounds
(returning to his call) just think about what 've been saying and lemme
hello
The person on the other end has hung up
With an apathetic shrug, Truman replaces the receiver
He looks over his shoulder and places another call
(lowering his voice) Can you connect me with directory inquiries in Sydney, Australia
(a long delay makes Truman even more uncomfortable) er, yes
Do you have a listing for a Lauren Powers
(pause) nothing listed
what about a Sylvia Powers
nothing
Thanks
Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed
stands in line with a crush of other As he reaches the counter, the store owner, , has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll
Truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own predictability
(nauseatngly cheerful) How's it goin', Truman
(deadpan) Not bad
just won the State Lottery
(not listening to Truman's reply, as Truman anticipated) Good
Good
Tyrone, what if  said  didn't want meatball today
(not missing a beat) 'd ask for identification
Truman forces a half-smile
We focus on another    in line at the cash register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye
About to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke from the
(a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing) He's right there
You're supposed to pay when he's here
(nonchalant shrug as he departs) He never notices
We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped sandwich from Tyrone
Hold on, Truman
got somethin' to show ya
Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus' Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline
Truman's eyes widen at the photograph
(referring to the photo) The flagship of Christoforo
our Genoese navigator, huh
know you love this like me
(averting his eyes with difficulty) Not me
You got the wrong man
Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays the Cashier and exits
See ya tomorrow, Truman
eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park
From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration"
in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout
Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders and gives him it all, his appetite gone
As the transient wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book
-
Close up on an old man's face
Hair pure white, late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years
He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room
Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep blue Californian sky
news anchor-style earpiece disappears down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears
Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed in his book, silently plays
, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited, joins Christof at the window
(never taking his eyes from the monitor) You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road
They're pulling out a body
You know you shouldn't look, but you do
group of a dozen  and  of varying ages sit around a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting room
All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the table, anticipating a call
On cue, the phone rings and one of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up
Hello
'm sorry,  got more than enough insurance
He hangs up
After a moment the phone rings again
sits at his desk, making a cold call
(into receiver) this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable - when will death occur
Could be a week, a month, a year
Could happen today
sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella
No way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all
The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs up
Truman's supervisor, , younger than Truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the corner of the cubicle
(handing Truman some documentation) Hey, Burbank,  got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton  need you to cloes by four
Truman turns pale
Stapleton on Staten Island
(sarcastic) You know another one
can't do it
(insistent) half hour across the bay
Sea air
Do you good
No,
(searching for a plausible excuse) got an appointment uptown
This is a sure thing
(conspiratorial) They're upping our quota
You need this
Lawrence exits the cubicle
Truman's head drops
He picks up the framed picture of his wife from his desk
, early thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail
He deposits the photo in his briefcase and departs
, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the Staten Island ferry
As the  and  impatiently brush past him onto the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering a flashback in his head
, -
The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the --  sits alongside his father, , in a small sailing dinghy
(shouting above the wind) Let's go further, daddy
Let's go further
(shouting back) It's getting late, Truman
(entreating his father) Please
Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon
turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of  boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street into the bright sunlight, gasping for air
Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street subway station
Two  surrepticiously observe Truman as he departs
1 (commenting out of Truman's earshot) can't believe he's taking the long way
2 He'll never make it
stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief
taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten Island
keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across
refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor
,
finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do condominium on Bay Street
As he approaches the lobby, he realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his suit jacket
middle-aged  behind a reception desk, is having his hair brushed by a   in his mid-thirties
Anticipating Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and swiftly departs through a rear door
enters the lobby and approaches the , trying to keep his arms tightly at his sides to hide the perspiration
'm here to see a Mr Hamilton
You from the insurance company
You missed him
When will he be back
Vacation
Two months
He waited as long as he could
You was supposed to be here by four
clock on the wall reads 4
l2pm
sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated
The only other occupants in the train, a  , mid- thirties, reading a pulp novel and two  , late-teens, sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her
1 (to woman) You wanna read to me
His companion smirks
1 (more insistent) You wannna read to me
The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now
She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book
The other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp
2 (menacing) My friend asked you a question
The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her
She looks around the train for assistance, briefly catching Truman's eye
The youths also look in Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere
Truman quickly averts his gaze
(reaching for the book) Please
The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket
2 Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends
The train pulls into a deserted station
Feeling vulnerable, the woman jumps up from her seat and exits
The youths, sensing a chase, also exit
Scanning the empty platform, the woman realizes she has made a serious error
Truman watches through the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat
1 We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby
One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it in the woman's face
2 Don't you wanna know how it ends
The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of their bodies
The woman looks again in Truman's direction
Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading
(screams) Help
Please, help
The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes
Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door
There is still time to act
He stands up and half-reaches for the handle but moves no further
The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel
Truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on
The train safely out of sight, the  promptly release the She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid
The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve her shoulder bag
Thanks
The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong friends
(pondering the incident) He did nothing
1 (shrugs, suddenly more couth) Physical violence paralyzes him
Always has
'
The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home
Beyond the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy Expressway
wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, , pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry
She has a sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new knife-set in a wooden block
She kisses Truman affectionately on the cheek
(proudly referring to the knife-set) got it free with the tune-up
Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes
You missed a section
Meryl enters the house
Truman restarts the lawnmower and obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn
As the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass, Truman pulls back abruptly
He checks the kitchen window for Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut
'  -
is applying ointment to her wrists as  enters
(referring to her hands) Do they hurt
was afraid 'd seize up during cross
One of the keys kept sticking
Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it
He notes an article headlined, "    "
(referring to the article) Is he gonna take the stand
(dispassionate, matter-of-fact) No point
Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs
She flexes her arthritic wrists
You gonna eat before you leave
'll get something out
(sensing something odd in his demeanor) Did something happen today
Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing
(composing himself) What could happen
An abandoned freeway project in Queens
The four hundred yard stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked
At one end is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel protuding from the concrete
stands at the end of the off-ramp with , thirty- two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big
Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up golf ball with a number three wood
Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the ball
The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the adjacent operating roadway
From a new angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt
Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, ""
Truman sets the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot
With a slight fade, the second ball carries even further than the first
Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment
Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot
Ouch
Whose nuts were those
(opening a beer from the six pack) Mine
Marlon tees up a ball of his own
initialed with the letter ""
gotta get out, Marlon
(mild interest only) Yeah
Outta what
Outta my job, outta Queens
out
Marlon takes a practise swing
Outta your job
What the hell's wrong with your job
You gotta great job
You gotta desk job
'd kill for a desk job
Marlon addresses the ball and swings
sweeping hook shot that bounces off the freeway out of bounds
(annoyed by the errant tee shot) Sonofabitch
It doesn't mean anything
(still looking in the direction of his ball) Nothing means anything
Try stocking vending machines for a living
My biggest decision of the day is whether the Almond Joys look better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths
Truman selects another "" ball from the bucket and tosses it to Marlon
(adamant) gotta get out
Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in the other direction
lucky bounce keeps it on the cement fairway
(skeptical, picking up his beer) Sure and go where
Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer
(unable to disguise his reverence) Australia
(impressed) No shit
Where is Australia exactly
Near England
Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate
He points to a dimple on his make-shift globe
See here, this is Queens
(sliding his finger around the other side of the ball) All the way round here, Australia
You can't get any further away before you start coming back
(tossing the world in his hand, warming to his subject) 'know, there're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot
(still dubious) So when are you leaving
It's not that simple
Takes money, planning
You can't just up and go
(heading off Marlon's skepticism) Oh, 'm gonna do it, don't worry about that
just gotta move slow
Pick a moment
Bonus time's just around the corner
Soon as  get a retaining wall built on the back of the house  can start thinking about selling up
and 'll be gone
Up and away on that big steel bird
(as if to convince himself) 'm going, don't you worry about that
Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond his imagination
never knew anybody who got out
An awkward moment
Truman, once again, not so sure of himself
He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball
and  wander down the empty freeway, retrieving the golf balls
As they return them to the bucket they check the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their long-drive competition
(slightly the worse for drink) Tick-fucking-tock
That's the fucking problem, Marlon
'm thirty-four
'm older than Jesus Christ
Marlon looks sideways at Truman
It sounds to him like the beer talking
Where do the dreams go, Marlon
(picking up the last ball marked with an initial "", trying to ignore the question) You win
'm serious
Where do the dreams go
(humoring his maudlin friend) They're still there
Just buried under what we settled for
They approach Truman's Oldsmobile
Truman opens the trunk to deposit their humble golfing equipment
Inside are the remains of the fallen light fixture
(referring to the light) You really think it could've dropped off an airliner
(unimpressed) Sure
It's halogen
You oughta report it
(quickly changing the subject) You coming for a drink
can't tonight

, -
The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's flashbacks
small group of  in black, several openly weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the - - , dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping , older sister, , and a  at the head of the gathering
The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and cumbersome in his tiny hands
He heaves it off the dock
'  ,
,
smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later
stares at the wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the shoreline
In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand
He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf
For a long while we watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible through the gloom
We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse
From the light's , through the green hue of a night vision camera, we observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water
(shouting at the surf) 'm sorry
'm sorry
-
's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a television monitor that displays the distraught  at the water's edge
'
At the Formica kitchen table,  makes calculations in a school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand
appears in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless
She throws her arms around Truman's neck
(suggestive) What are you doing
Come to bed
(ignoring the suggestion) figure we could scrape together eight thousand
(suddenly exasperated) Oh
God, everytime you and Marlon-- --We could bum around the world for a year on that
And then what, Truman
We'd be back to where we were five years ago
You're talking like a teenager
Maybe feel like a teenager
Getting to his feet
Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were courting
Meryl, it'd be an adventure
We said we'd try for a baby
Isn't that enough of an adventure
That can wait
want to get away
See some of the world
Explore
Meryl gives a derisive laugh
You want to be an explorer
You mean like all the other great explorers from Queens
You don't even have a passport, Truman bet you don't even know how to get one
The words sting
Truman turns away
Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack
This'll pass
Everybody thinks like this now and then
(making one more attempt at seduction) Come to bed
'
In a nightwatchman's office, two   drink coffee
1 How can they have a child
2 It's not gonna be his, you idiot
1 Why not
2 You think she'd go through with it
(reassessing his own opinion) Guess  always thought they'd adopt
'  -
stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear looking down at his bed
has fallen asleep waiting for him, snoring lightly
Truman rests his hand tentatively on the bed
The surface rocks
waterbed
The motion triggers a flashback in his head
, -
As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen
The --  sits on the upturned hull of a small dinghy in calm, deep water
(plaintively calling into the mist) Daddy
Daddy
His cries go unanswered
Two  , seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they talk
Nothing else of the room is seen
1 (playing amateur psychiatrist) It left him with more than his obvious fear of the water
It's as if he felt his father had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed never to repeat the mistake
He was never the same curious little boy again
2 We're all born with a pound of cocaine up our nose
By the time we're eleven it runs out
1 Half the people  knew named their babies after him
emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the newspaper stand
He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing 's nose from one of the pages
He returns the magazine to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush hour pedestrian traffic
Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he glimpses the reflection of a   standing directly behind him
Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels around to face him
The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties
more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a serene smile on his face
From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a television screen
The Homeless Man places his hand ever so gently on Truman's cheek
Truman makes no effort to withdraw
He is transfixed by the the man's eyes
He appears to recognize him
(almost to himself, mouthing the word) Daddy
Suddenly a distinguished   walking a small dog and a carrying a briefcase, walking in opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man, one taking each arm
bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group, doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus
Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors, closing sharply in his face
(to  ) Hey, stop
Stop
Truman thumps against the doors, but the   ignores his cries and the bus roars away from the curb
He starts to run after the bus, colliding with several  who make no attempt to avoid him
Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi
vacant cab suddenly switches off its " " light as he reaches it
Truman pleads with the   through the closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts
Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised parking attendant's kiosk
Running along the rows of parked cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons attached to the key rings car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's winking sidelights
He jumps inside a brand new  and guns the car
The  , alerted by the squealing tires, appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down
(running after the car) Hey
Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take evasive action
Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists
He is only a couple of car-lengths from the bus
(reading aloud, the number of the bus) Two, four, oh, six
Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to slow for no apparent reason
Truman looks for a way around but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage, working together almost as if they are running interference
(shouting at the cars) Outta the way
Outta the way
The bus is escaping
Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move
By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam
Truman spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and disappear from view
Fumbling with the gear stick
he finally finds reverse but turns to find a hostile group of  herded tightly together behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go
The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath yanks Truman from the driver's seat
What the fuck are you trying to pull
(cowering, the fight instantly gone out of him) 'm sorry
'm sorry
No harm done
No harm done
(feverishly inspecting the fenders for dents, he finds none) oughta fuck you up
The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes
They get the better of him
Get the fuck outta here
The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and brushes him aside
As he departs, Truman notices that the traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of pedestrians has dissolved
Row after row of parked buses
and  exit an administration office
Instead of heading for the exit, Truman begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the number painted on the rear of each one
What're you doing
(gesturing to the office) The man told you there's no such bus
He's lying
Two, four, oh, six was definitely the number
Marlon stops walking
Truman continues his inspection
Seeing there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up
never believed he was dead
(trying to be patient) 'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find a body
You know what the currents are like in that water
(shudders, a memory flashing in his head) You had to see his face when that wave hit
He wasn't scared Marion
It was like he was expecting it, waiting for it
He knew it was coming
Why would he fake it
(trying to make light) He's not Elvis Presley
(ignoring the joke, pondering the morning's events) You know what was really strange about today
An old woman with a little dog and a businessman, walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork
They force him onto a bus against his will, a bus that doesn't normally stop outside my building
And when 'm giving chase, the bus never makes another stop and  get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure  never catch up with it
(sarcastic) Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars
What are you saying, the entire population of Lower Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person
Oh yeah, that makes sense
Truman has no answer
We see an aerial shot of Truman and Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance
They have come to the last bus in the final row
Truman hangs his head
The offending bus is not amongst them
He makes towards the exit without comment and Marlon follows
Unseen by the pair, we focus on the  number on one of the buses they have previously checked - "2400"
single drip of black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit
and , drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked behind them
You think  imagined it, don't you
think you're missing your dad
(trying to be delicate) The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it
Truman is surprised Marlon remembered
Marlon nods to the sidewalk
You got sand in your cuffs
Truman looks down at his feet
small, tell-tale pile of sand has poured out of his tight trouser cuff
Maybe you're right
If only the old woman hadn't left her dog behind
We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the Lower Manhattan street
It confirms that the old woman's was abandoned on the sidewalk
' ' ,
stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy
doilyed apartment with his older sister, , late forties, prematurely grey
Through a doorway, the figure of his is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour
Truman and Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her
Don't you dare go in
Truman
just got her off to sleep
It was Dad
swear
Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare
Well, the next time he shows up
bring him over
Until then, 'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you
If it wasn't him, it was his twin
Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us
know a reason he'd want to hide from you
Look at how you treat us
You live ten minutes away, we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you don't even believe it yourself
Haven't you hurt her enough, Truman
She already blames you
(incredulous) was seven years old
But you're here and he's not
Has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience
'm telling you he's alive
(snapping back bitterly) And 'm telling you he's fish food
Truman meets her unforgiving eyes
Without another word, he walks out of the apartment
Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out
, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close to Truman without being detected
Raquel's demeanor immediately changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears younger, posture more upright, almost a different person
Christof hugs Raquel
You did well
cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical mirrored make-up tables
At the only occupied table, Truman's contrite father, , is having what's left of his homeless disguise cleaned from his face by a -  under the watchful eye of two -
From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision,  and also take in the proceedings
Behind their heads, a monitor shows a surveillance picture of an agitated  sitting in his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic
We've tightened security
Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done
(referring to Kirk) Why would he do this to us
Old age
Sentiment
You play someone's father all those years, you are someone's father
He sees the way Truman is
He feels responsible
Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony, containing a state-of-the-art monitor and
Chloe follows
Christof plays the cued recording without comment
We focus on the screen
, -
younger-looking  sits in a motorboat in the calm water of Long Island Sound
Truman's father, , twenty-seven years younger and a   , Truman's age at the time, acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy
Two   in the ocean
(barking instructions to Kirk) as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward
Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction
The freak wave will strike from the starboard side
Remember, you don't go to the diver
The diver goes to you
To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on the side of the dinghy to capsize it
Kirk and the boy are tossed into the water
While the boy immediately bobs to the surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface
After a long moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away
now wearing a spare aqualung
Good
Good
of course, on the day you only surface once you're safely beyond the cove
Try it one more time
You okay
Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned boat
Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing participant in the masquerade
The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain face
'
cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty trunk under a canvas sheet
The trunk is fastened with a combination lock
He deftly dials the correct combination and opens the lid
Inside, mementoes from his youth
"  " book, a stack of " " magazines, and beneath it all, a garment in a drycleaning bag
Truman carefully lifts up the plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated with pearl beading
He puts the cardigan to his nose and breathes deeply
Footsteps
Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and shuts the lid
, standing close behind
What're you doing out here
(turning attention to an upturned mower on the garage floor) Fixing the mower
Meryl doesn't look like she buys it
(concerned) Your sister called
She was worried about you
(matter-of-fact) saw my father on State Street dressed as a homeless man
(attempting to comfort) kept seeing my brother for years after he died
(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness) What do you want
made macaroni
gotta go out
About a replacement
(hastily adding) mower blade
Meryl nods, not at all convinced
After an uncomfortable pause, she turns and heads back to the house
ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly washed Oldsmobile
In the background is the warning sign he has just ignored, " ,  "
Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the severed aerial
'
motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides with
As he drives, he tests his car radio
Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station
(from radio) west on Atlantic
he's making a right on Woodhaven
Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio
Distracted, he almost bowls over an   on a crosswalk
(from radio) God, Truman almost hit Marilyn
he's on the move again, passing the Burger King
Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out
Suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback
He looks up and, as far as the eye can see, every ,  and along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right ear at exactly the same moment
(from radio, in distress himself) something's wrong
Change frequencies
Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without success
Still shaken by his experience with the radio,  exits a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag
Out of the corner of his eye he catches a   still checking his right ear with his finger
He goes to say something to the by-stander but thinks better of it
,
in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares
cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each is by-passed
Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy, prostitute, , wearing a platinum blonde wig
She is in deep discussion with a fellow
Veronica recognizes the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window
Hey, Truman
Where you bin
You bin cheatin' on me
Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger seat
'
knows the form
As  pulls away from the curb, she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the drycleaning bag on the back seat
She drapes the cardigan around her shoulders
Bout time you got this thing cleaned
(half-joking) Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it
Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply
Veronica removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it
(examining the bottle) God, do they still make this stuff
What's the Sell-By Date
From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park
and  watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe, the Unisphere
Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up picture of  and  inside the car
(into a flip-phone, condescending) you see him messing with the antenna
what did you think would happen
"lapse of concentration", is that what you call it
call it amateur-hour
(sarcastic) In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over
Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant with affection and even a mild amusement
(as she hangs up, querying the smile that plays around his lips) You think this is funny
The mask has slipped before
Everything can be explained
kills the lights and he and  exit the car unaware that they are being observed
(adopting a more serious tone as he returns his attention to Truman) What's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge of the pool surrounding the great steel globe
Like  say,  don't normally do this
gotta charge extra
Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills
Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain
When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her shoulder
Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in her role
She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the nape of his neck
Slowly both heads drift together, but stop just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close
So close they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight separating them
Then finally their lips touch in the most gentle of caresses
They hold the kiss for another long moment and then simultaneously break
As they look into each other's eyes, Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing a finger to his lips
Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste
From Truman's  we focus on the cardigan on the pavement, triggering a flashback in his head
,
As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be playing on a television screen
However, on this occasion it is also accompanied by 's comments from his perch in the tower above the park
(
) He's re-created the event on and off for a number of years
We've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place
-- , carrying a stack of books, spies , sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender, beaded cardigan at her open locker
She is entertaining two with what appears to be a lewd tale
(
) We'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything
She was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league
Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the lockers
The three girls look up, surprised by the interruption
(to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting) Hi
1 (to Lauren as the two girlfriends abruptly depart) See you in class
Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends
Lauren, right
Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her text books
No
(ignoring her lack of interest) Look
was wonder-- -- can't go out with you
haven't asked you yet
Well when you do, that's my answer
(softening) 'm sorry
It's not up to me
(summoning up courage from somewhere) Why, you married
Lauren smiles despite herself
'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza
How about Saturday
(adamant) No
Friday
Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor
Now
Right now
We got finals
If we don't go now, it won't happen
Truman hesitates
(impatient, looking anxiously around) Well, what do you want to do
- -
The --  and  enter the park near the Unisphere
The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon
(
) We knew we were taking a risk
She hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn
He'd summoned the courage to make the approach
We wanted to reward that
Of course she took full advantage
Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding the steel sculpture
never knew this place existed
They both stare down at the inviting water
Lauren suddenly throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another thought
She comes splashing to the surface
Truman stares down, transfixed hy the shimmering water
Come on
Come on
It's wonderful
(nervous) can't
Lauren suddenly stops splashing
That's right
Oh, God, 'm sorry
She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet
(confused) Why
You've got nothing to be sorry about
Has someone been talking to you
Lauren wrings out her dress
(to the sky, upset) Get me out of here
don't want to be here
Lauren starts walking away
(confused, calling after her) What are you talking about
Lauren
Lauren
Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing her to face him
(distraught) My name's not Lauren
It's Sylvia
Truman looks into her eyes and believes her
- and  (as she is now called throughout the remainder of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later
As we have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great delicacy
Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips with her finger
In a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you
(looking around the deserted park) Who
There's no one around
(covering his lips once again) You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan
And your teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too late, Truman
There's nothing left to explore
"  And all the other kids laughed
And you sat down
(incredulous) How do you know about that
It doesn't matter
You've forgotten about that boy, Truman
You got scared
Just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life
don't understand
(looking over her shoulder nervously) There isn't much time
Just listen
Everybody's pretending Truman
Everybody but you
(pointing to the buildings on the horizon) Look at that project
You think anybody lives there
It's all for you, Truman
show
The eyes are everywhere
(protesting) Eyes
Where
(frustrated, raving) Everywhere, disguised
Truman, they're going to fill your head with lies
You've got to make yourself deaf, you understand
When you're afraid the most, it means you're on the right track
Trust that boy
Promise me you'll do that
Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making
Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of nowhere
(scared) told you, Truman
The car skids to a stop and a large , 40ish, with a shock of dark hair jumps from the car
The man yanks the frightened Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground
(shocked) Hey
(to Sylvia) Get in the car, Lauren
Truman jumps up
(to the Man) Who are you
'm her father
No he's not
He's just saying that
Does he look anything like me
Shut your mouth
The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles her into his car
Truman rushes at the man
Leave her alone
The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground
He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth
(to Sylvia) told you not to come here anymore
(to Truman, who is getting to his feet) Which one are you
Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back into his head
(calling out from the car) Don't listen to him, Truman
Make yourself deaf
Come find me
(to Truman, getting into the car) Don't bother
We're moving to Australia
New York's done something to her head
The Plymouth roars away
Truman stares after it and then turns back to the cardigan left on the ground
(
) Why did he say Australia
Why couldn't he have said New Jersey
,
' head suddenly appears back in frame beside
You want me to do it again
think could do it better
(coming back to reality) No
thank you
Truman picks up the cardigan
They return to the car
'
drives  back to her turf
She smokes a cigarette, flicking ash out of the window
Veronica, what do you know for sure
For sure
(taking a long drag on her cigarette as she gives the question due consideration) The nuns at my school, they used to say, "The whole of life is faith
" Truman regards his companion in a new light
He comes to a stop at the corner where he picked her up
(giving Truman an affectionate peck on the cheek) On the house
,
Another televised flashback
The -- stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker
(
) We removed all physical trace of her but we couldn't erase the memory
- In a secluded corner of the library the -- sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's magazines
By tearing out individual facial features - eyes
nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to improvise a composite picture of Sylvia
The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose
He toys with several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one
He stares wistfully at the completed picture
- -- '
--  enters the front door
His older sister, , has been awaiting his arrival
(
) When he decided to go after Sylvia, we were forced to intervene once again
(excited) 've got something to tell you, Sis
(adopting a low, serious tone) 've got something to tell you too
(unable to contain his news) 'm going to Australia
Mom's real sick
Truman's face falls
As he enters the bedroom where his ill lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his that he has inadvertently crushed in his hands
, ' turns into his street but stops several houses short of his own driveway and kills the car's engine
In the light of a streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed photograph of his wife,
But he turns his wife's face away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame
Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by the years
With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a handful of paper fragments from his jacket
Noses
He tests the likeness of each one in turn
Unsatisfied that any of the new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car window
We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway
'
Close up on a nose
We pull back to reveal that the nose belongs to , seventeen years older than Truman's composite picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter
She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the high-water line
In the background, a solitary, white beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene
Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece of paper carried on the ocean breeze
The paper catches on the mast of one of the sailing dinghys
page from a newspaper, carrying a photograph of  in the street where he encountered his father
Sylvia retrieves the page
The article's headline reads, "'   "
Spying a , late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her sweater
The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on the sand
Sylvia waves cheerfully back
In a quiet bar, a  patiently explains her viewpoint to the
on a barstool, eavesdrops
She was willing to lose him if it meant he could find himself
(registering the barman's blank look) Never mind
sits in his car, about to lace his coffee
From inside the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar excited squeals and shouts of
Truman suddenly throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across the parking lot and into the school
slams through the front doors into the reception area
It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the corridors empty
He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open classroom doors as he goes
They are all unoccupied
Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium
The childrens' voices can still be heard
Truman takes a deep breath and bursts through the double doors
The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape of childrens' voices
The recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands facing the ventilation ducts
Truman stares at the machine in disbelief
exits the subway, still lost in thought
He stops at the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it
He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will appear at his side once again
But no one joins him
However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself that takes his interest
An imposing forty-story office building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a building Truman passes every day
As usual, a steady stream of  and  enter and exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two
Beyond security are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business
Truman abruptly enters the building
He strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs
1 (to Truman) Can  help
(sneaking a glance at the building directory) have an appointment at, er
Diamond Enterprises
1 They went bust
The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it
He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing, defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard in the elevator looks in horror at Truman
The cause of her concern becomes all too apparent
Looking beyond the woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car
The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building
Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with no floors above the ground floor
The  Truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator cars
Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn stares back, appalled
The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take him by the arm
1 You gotta leave
(riveted by the equally-stunned building occupants) What're they doing
2 You gotta leave
The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an Emergency Exit
(not going quietly) Just tell me what the hell's going on
1 We're re-modelling
Like fuck
What're they doing
continues to struggle as the  usher him to the street
You don't tell me, 'll get you investigated
2 Investigate what
You're trespassing
Truman sees there is no point in arguing further
His shouts are attracting the interest of -
thought occurs to him
He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another building at random
An office block with a bank on the ground floor
As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the and  on him
Is he so suspicious-looking or were they expecting him
Truman rushes to the elevators
The lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors
Frantic pressing of the elevator button gets no response
Truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a   who bars his way
You can't-- (anticipating his response) -- know
Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district
Every building he encounters seems to have a anticipating his arrival or a building  hanging a sign on the front door
He feels the eyes of
Is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior
Truman wheels around, trying to make eye contact with passers-by
They shy away
Truman stops still, his head reeling
From the office window on the twelfth floor,  can observe the glass building down the street
He ponders the black, mirrored box
appears at his side
You ever been into the  Building
(following Truman's gaze) Not since they begun reconstruction
(referring to the file in Truman's hands) What're you doing with that
(defensive) 'm going to visit a site
What for
Because  never do
(placing a hand on Truman's arm) That's why we got adjusters
(looking at Lawrence's hand on his arm) You got a problem with me going
got a problem with you not doing your job, Burbank
You already screwed up once this week
Let me worry about that
Truman exits with the report
After waiting only a matter of seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell
As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim  emerges from a nearby office, shadowed as always by
They approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates
680 West 89th
Christof nods
Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call
-
An out-of-breath  arrives on the second floor landing of the stairwell to find two burly  blocking his path with a large office desk they are attempting to transport
Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning clambers over the mahogany barrier
1 Hey, would it kill ya to wait
paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other frustrated passengers
He loses patience and suddenly turns and runs up the stairs
sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no apparent reason
(impatiently to driver) Is there another way
Can't you get around this
exits his taxi and takes in the scene
partially burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering
Truman checks the address on his file
small, serious-looking straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk
(to the boy) When was the fire
(shrug) Week ago
How come it's still smoking
Started up again
(dismissive) Kids
(referring to his claims report) Says here it burnt to the ground
Wishful thinking maybe
The boy is wise well beyond his years
Truman fixes him with a glare
Someone send you to tell me all this
(unfazed) You the one askin' questions
The boy casually rides away
wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing
We sense, truly observing for the first time
group of  play a pick-up game of basketball walks a pair of
An   answers the incessant questions of his
Nothing appears amiss
stands amidst a throng of  and  marooned on Times Square
Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of vehicles flowing through the intersection
Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out into the traffic
However as his foot is poised, the stream of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to be giving him a wider berth
He steps off the sidewalk and
to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle will take evasive action
Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of the window of an electronics store
He watches a local news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13
However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own face on another  taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the store window
He shudders at his video reflection
-
' face stares out from a televison monitor
We slowly pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room the size of a football field
The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile
Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life
Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard, car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the locations strangely devoid of people
Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom
Facing the desk, several  in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs, wearing the slimmest of headsets
, a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles
stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe, continuing to inspect his surroundings
hovers in the background
There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first time
Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a microphone on the control panel
Everybody stay focused
remember who you are
,
sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move
unloads boxes from the back of his truck and carries them into a Restaurant Supply store
Further down the street   take their time tending to an electrical repair in an exposed manhole
does his rounds
An   struggles with two heavy shopping bags
Everybody appears natural, places to go
Truman turns his attention to a group of - at the only other occupied table at the cafe
We see extreme close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of phoniness
They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments to the  and generally showing off like schoolboys
Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine
Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he has been fidgeting
The on-air monitor shows  from the ring's , revealing that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden camera
Truman suspects nothing
He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime run, making their way down the street towards the cafe
Truman happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers
He springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path
(staring at the monitor) Damn
Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a moment of pleasure from the older man's distress
,
(to the jogger with the familiar sneakers) Small world
1 (attempting to sidestep Truman) Excuse me
Truman blocks the man a second time
You don't remember
Two days ago  gave you my meatball sandwich in the park
You were in a wheelchair
Same sneakers
An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head confirming that the  and the   in the wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same
(commenting ironically on his new-found mobility) miracle
2 (coming to his companion's aid) Get the hell outta here
The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table causing him to stumble
- '
is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van
hurries up to him
Marlon
've gotta talk to you
(surprised) Truman
Sorry, 'm up against it today
've fallen over something, Marlon
Something to do with my Dad
think
(looking at him for the first time) Are you okay
You look like shit
(ignoring the inquiries about his health) It's big, Marlon
You wouldn't believe who's in on it
(distracted) In on what
There's no point trying to show you, they cover their tracks too well
But 've been going into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta familiar faces, y'know what  mean
(still engrossed in his own problems) Something's definitely in the air
My last delivery, a kid got crushed to death
tilting a vending machine
They won't even let me take the rest of the day off
Do it, anyway
Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't joking
'm deadly serious
Marlon
We can't talk here
'm being followed
(suddenly concerned) Who
don't know
They look just like regular people
(producing a notebook from his jacket pocket) But 've been writing down numbers - license plates, taxi numbers,  numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over
Is someone leanin' on you, Tru
Cos  got some friends here, they owe me
We can lean back
(pointing out a taxi parked outside the yard) Is he one of them
(anxious) don't know
Could be
One thing's certain
The key is spontoneity
Be unpredictable
They can't stand that
That's why we've got to get outta here
Can you come with me
(weakening) Christ, Truman
You're gonna get both our asses fired
Marlon shuts his van and gets in
Truman enters the passenger side
Where're we going
The beach
is in deep conversation with two executives
, a contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking and , a fresh-faced, younger man
hovers in the background
monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a surveillance shot of  and  pulling into a beach parking lot in Marlon's van
The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control facility where  continues to call the shots, all too aware of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background
(marveling, excitedly referring to Truman on the monitor) can't believe how much he's shoved down
That he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely

It's compromised
Becoming unwatchable
Too much for Christof
He wheels on the young man
Fear
Doubt
Is that what you have trouble watching
Perhaps you don't like watching yourself
Roman is stung into silence
(realizing his colleague is in over his head, including Chloe to save Roman's face) Why don't you two wait outside
Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video wall
(instantly more comfortable in the company of a man his own age) He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all
We'll get him back on
You know why they're so nervous
The birth of Truman's child is going to double revenue
For God's sake don't let him upstage you
(indicating Simeon through the glass walls) You've been grooming a successor
He's not ready
Him or you
(jaw setting firm, referring to Truman on the monitor) You can't pull him back in without me
(more reflective) He's just acting out of character
What if he's in character
What if he's starting to act in character at last

sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years earlier
However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his father described - almost identical to its neighbor
, laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop
What're we doing here, Truman
This is where it started
Where what started
Things
Things that don't fit
Loose threads
False steps
Slips of the tongue
(irritated) Make sense, Truman
You going religious on me
(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes) My father didn't want me to see what was over here
Whatever it was, it's gone now
never shoulda listened to him that day
knew it was wrong
We see a quick flashback of --  on the cliff- face twenty-seven years earlier
There were a hundred people on the beach that day
Everybody knew what was going on except me
don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you
Maybe 've been mistaken for somebody else
(a memory triggered) couple of years ago,  tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine
The week before an ad said, "Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation"
Marlon shrugs, unimpressed
guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine
It ain't a common name so looked out for it
But the day it came out, every newstand was sold out
No library had it
even wrote off for a back-issue
Never seen a copy to this day
Marlon remains unconvinced
Maybe 'm being set up for something
You ever feel like that, Marlon
Like your whole life has been building to something
Marlon looks skeptically at Truman
He hasn't had that feeling
(becoming testy) coincidence
Haven't you ever heard of a coincidence
'm a walking coincidence
can't count 'em
No something's happening, Marlon
've got to get to the bottom of it
(shaking his head in exasperation) Of what
Why're you doing this to yourself
'm scared, Marlon
'm as scared as hell
But 've never felt more alive
It's just like she said
(suddenly intrigued) Who
It doesn't matter
She was too beautiful for here
Now Marlon is really confused
Can you lend me some money
hundred bucks
All  got on me is the takings from the machines
Why do you need it

As she pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor
Truman's missing copy of Time Magazine
His face on the cover with the headline, "Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation"
Sylvia retrieves the magazine
In front of a nearby mirror, she holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment imagining them together

However, as he goes to get up from the sofa,  starts to slide down his chest towards his lap
We could do it right here, like we used to
The program cuts to a commercial break
The commercial is for "Global Travel"
(from television) Travelling Down Under
Global Travel is turning rates to Australia upside down
Round Trip to Sydney only $829
One way, $465
Global Travel at Broadway and 44th
Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is elsewhere
(abruptly getting up) Lemme go to the bathroom
Don't be too long
Truman exits the living room
However, on his way to the bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table

They're guilty as hell but they'll walk

There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine

Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and begin working
As  enters  , one looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival
Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a female
Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with his hand

(believing she is being deliberately obtuse) Australia
(a trace of condescension) Where in Australia
What city
Sorry, Sydney
Sydney, Australia
That's right

When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there

But you wouldn't want to do that
Why wouldn't

You want to book the flight
Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines

Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the harbor

Thick cloud cover to disorient him

Christof glances at the  screen in her hand, showing sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of

Why not just tell him she's dead
It's too late for that

He looks up, staring into the middle distance
His eyes widen as something clicks in his mind
Suddenly  snatches the dictionary from his hand
Where the hell have you been, Burbank
What the hell's going on
That's what 'd like to know, Lawrence

Isn't that a laugh

Listen, don't bother with the resignation

Huh
(gesturing to a computer terminal) What is this a front for
Why aren't  in on the joke

Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer off the desk to get their attention
It lands on the floor with an expensive crash

Who am
(taken aback by the sudden violent act) You better get outta here or 'm calling Security
(mimicking) "Security
'm calling Security"
Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing 's hidden likeness
Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence, pinning him to a cubicle wall
You don't believe a single word you're saying
(to the assembled group) None of you do
(suddenly talking to a sprinkler head in the ceiling) You hear me
We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's
Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents giving him a wide berth
He shoves computers, desk lamps and pot holders off desks as he goes
steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead

Behind him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze

Hard to tell

playing- drives erratically down a quiet suburban street
On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a   pushing an in a baby carriage
Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk
He has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come to a halt
Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot
The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds the crying bundle in both hands above his head
(to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk) Say my name or 'll smash its head open
The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply
(vehement) Say my name
(composing herself, reaching out for her child) Please, give him to me
(screaming above the baby's cries) Say my name
You know my name
Say it
(bewildered) don't know you
The commotion has attracted the attention of an   across the street, watering his garden
He drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas
Halfway across the street, the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in the air
(hysterical) mean it
'm ready to do it
What's my name
Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can, his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete
We see a view of the scene from the  of a streetlight
The young mother, recognizing Truman's seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes
(entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes) This is your last chance
The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on the brink
The young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks
She is at a loss, powerless
(his entire body shaking) What
is
my
name
The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name
Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go through with it
With everything he has, he gathers himself
After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms
(clutching the baby to her breast, without thinking) Thank you, Truman
Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat
He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street
The young woman and the old man stare after Truman's car as it roars away
'
As  drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at the streetlamps lining the roadway

Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car
Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by
Meryl is unimpressed
Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game
predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle
Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for the house
Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch
He turns to check his prediction
convoy of cars approaches
There's the Honda
the Dodge
here comes the dented Beetle
Meryl's attention wavers
Truman tightens his grip
Look, damn you
Following the  is a school bus

Truman is momentarily disappointed
Meryl seizes her chance and heads for the house

It's over

Shut up

We're going for a drive
What
Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door and towards his car

Let's just jump in the car and go

holds 's wrist to stop her exiting the car and accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking

That's right

So why do you wanna go
Cos  never have
That's why you go places, isn't it
Cos you're curious
haven't been curious since  was seven years old, y'know that
Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place
All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track Truman's speeding car
How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs
We could be up and running
three hours maybe
Give me a number five gridlock on the Jersey Turnpike
'
and  are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New Jersey Turnpike
We observe the Oldsmobile on a television lens from the  of a tail-light on the car ahead
(a manic edge to his voice) So much traffic, this time of day
Does that strike you as peculiar
On the side of the road,  , are arguing over a minor collision
(sneering at the sight of the motorists) Look at them
You believe they're fighting
don't believe it
(shouting out the window to the motorists) Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic
Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway
But his move is anticipated
At the end of the offramp a pack of cars suddenly appears
Other vehicles fill the gap behind
(to Meryl, marveling) Blocked at every turn
Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree
(incredulous) You blaming me for the traffic
Should You've never been on this road before
You don't know what it's like
(manic) That's true
We could be stuck here for hours
Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City
Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk
What the hell are you doing
You're right
Let's go back
'm sorry
don't know what got into me
Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic
Would you please slow down, Truman
Truman floors the Oldsmobile
The car flies past the exit for Route 276
He continues along the Jersey Turnpike
Truman, that was the turnoff
've changed my mind again
What's Maine like this time of year
've never been to Maine
(Truman looks up through the windshield at a helicopter tracking his progress) Or let's just see where the road takes us
(pleading) Let me out, Truman
You're not right in the head
You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own
(eerily calm) think 'd like a little company
, ,  and the other  follow Truman's progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically circled to ease identification
Christof jabs his finger at the rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle
(to Simeon) What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"
Keep them together
(agitated) They're rusty
We can't keep up
(rueful aside) We don't know where he's going any more
Oncoming is very thin

As he speeds erratically,  glances at the streets either side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of moving traffic
(to the anxious Meryl at his side) Look down there, Meryl
No cars
don't run into traffic
The traffic follows me around
(excited by his discovery) We're in a moving pack, don't you see
Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway
(enthusing) He's so close
It's tantilizing
You want to pull him over
No police
Not yet
We shadow him
We don't want him to panic
He's trying to outrun the traffic
He's trying to outrun the world
Keep him on this route

Simeon nods

In the twilight sun, '  wander up the gravel path, leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried in their parents' arms
Hanging back from the rest of the group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back to the house
As the  is about to lean his bicycle against the side of the beach house, he looks in a window
Lit by a blue-glow,  sits transfixed by the television playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our view
She is unaware of the man's face at the window
Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards Sylvia with a resigned smile
He mounts the bicycle and rides back up the path
Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant, the pursuing police car blocking his retreat
flees the car, leaving  in the passenger seat
Truman
Come back
Truman bursts past the alien-looking    in their protective suits carrying detection instruments
The workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off his path to the power plant
As he crests a slight rise beyond the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground
However, peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the lights of a cityscape in the distance
, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to
Did he see it
don't think so
The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling is being escorted away

and  sit at their kitchen table
Truman stoic, tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks
Truman's airline ticket torn to shreds on the table in front of them
Let me get you some help, Truman
You're not well
(ignoring her tears and medical advice) Why do you want to have a child with me
You can't stand me
That's not true
(suddenly angry) Don't lie to me
Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet
Truman follows, getting in her face
Tell me what's happening
(frightened but remaining poised) thought you knew everything
What could tell you
(backing her up against the kitchen bench) You're part of this, aren't you
Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect herself
Truman, you're scaring me
Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness, grabs her wrist and disarms her
No, you're scaring me, Meryl
Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her
While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to march her around the room, talking to the walls, light fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television
Stop this now or  kill your leading lady
(to a lamp) know you can hear me
and the  watch the monitors spellbound as looks directly into one camera lens after another
is the first to crack
(entreating Christof) Get somebody in there
(quiet but firm) No
(siding with the executive, showing his true colors) She's in trouble
We've got to help her
Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into the microphone
'  -
We see an extreme close up of 's ear
Unheard by , from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice
(
) He's bluffing
Call his bluff
(in reply to the voice in her head, half-strangled due to the pressure of the knife) Do something
Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen
Sensing that she too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to read her face
(wild-eyed) Who are you talking to
(incredulous) You're the one talking to the walls
No
You said, "Do something
"  Who were you talking to
swear 'll kill you, if you don't tell me
Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman forces his way inside
They both tumble onto the waterbed causing it to rock back and forth
Gripping Meryl's hair, Truman throws aside the bed covers
(distraught, referring to the bed) How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me
Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash
You have any idea what it's like to drown
Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water
She thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself
Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water
(gasping for air) Truman, stop it
(to the ceiling) Don't let him do it
(to a light fixture, threatening) 'll kill her
He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her head down longer this time
She continues to struggle
Suddenly, the front door chimes
Startled, Truman lets Meryl up for air
(sneering at Meryl) Right on time
Cops must be telepathic
Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats her to it
Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand
(wincing in pain) Damn
At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the front door
The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more insistently
(shouting through the closed door) Stay where you are or 'll kill her
(
) Truman
It's me, Marlon
Truman flinches
He was so convinced it would be the police
He takes a step back against the hallway wall
Before he can decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound
Marlon locks eyes on Truman
Sizing up the situation, he slowly but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand
Meryl wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing
(distraught, dropping character, forgetting herself) They were going to let him kill me
and , both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end of their abandoned freeway off-ramp
People know who  am, my every move, complete strangers know my name
Even when there's no one around,  feel the eyes on me
(reluctant admission) was in the bank today
The Federal on Lewis
clerk was talking about somebody named Truman messing with her baby
Is that the stranger you're talking about
Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation
(half to himself, refusing to accept it) No
No
've never seen her before
(registering Marlon's skepticism) know you already think 'm going out of my mind but  genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow
Everybody seems to be in on it
It's a lot of world for one man
You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself
Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters
Who hasn't wanted to be somebody
That's just it
think am somebody
(sympathetizing) used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up
Sometimes  think it's in my head, sometimes think it's for real
Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere in the night
Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on
Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark
The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers
Jesus, they were identical
always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together
Truman nods fondly at the memory
The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and  wet myself but you never told anyone
was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and  didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been
And  never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that
Truman is slowly coming around
Marlon's speech from the heart soothing away his pain
know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would
We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should
know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else
But, well, the point is,  would gladly step in front of traffic for you
Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back
We see a close up of Marlon's ear
From inside, unheard by Truman, dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech
leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the lines to Marlon, immersed in the role
(hushed tones) and the last thing 'd ever do is lie to you
Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably superior to Marlon's own delivery
(staring into Truman's eyes, repeating the words in his ear) And the last thing 'd ever do is lie to you
(pause) Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, 'd have to be in on it too
'm not in on it cos there is no it
Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining away
Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug
Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star shines
From his chair,  modestly accepts the congratulations of his
The two executives,  and  are at the head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten
gives Christof a warm hug
, accepting a towel from a
, still in wardrobe, approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair
grasping his hand
(leaving his head close to Christof) can't thank you enough
don't know what happened
He was so close
It threw me
'm indebted
Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and Marlon withdraws
Finally Christof's Assistant Director, , approaches and offers his hand
Christof hesitates before shaking
Simeon returns to the monitors, now showing  alone at the dock or Long Island
Christof stares out the window to conceal an expression of quiet vindication
The two   we have seen before sit on their sofa gazing straight ahead
On the teievision in front of them, a live picture of  - the first time we have seen him broadcast to a viewer's set
He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the cameras recording him
The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from another angle showing the book's title, "To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration"
At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully framing the "action" with the message, " Coffee - Good To The Last Drop
"  After several seconds, the border disappears
Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around the edge of the image
Overlapping scenes from Truman's life appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and finally adulthood
graphic, " - Total Record Of  Human Life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory narration
(
) You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of Human Life"
Everything that occurs here is real
There are no re-creations or interruptions
Due to the live and unedited nature of the program, viewer discretion is advised
The title sequence is replaced by an , mid-fifties, conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite  in a Larry King-style interview setting
Projected in the background is the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book
(to camera) Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have been a more momentous week in the show's history
'm your host, Michael Conners, and this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the forum where we discuss and analyze recent events with the show's award-winning creator and producer, Christof
(referring to the image of Truman in the background) remind viewers that as this is a living history, it is our practise to keep the image of Truman on screen at all times
(turning to Christof) Welcome
Thank you
Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in ratings over the last few days, how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"
Ratings have never been our primary goal imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment
However 'm certain our core audience will remain loyal
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question
What keeps us watching one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation
It has to be the reality
During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of  - the , the two   on their sofa, the and the  - listening to Christof's theories on their viewing habits
We've become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects
While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself
No scripts
no cue cards
It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine
That's how he can support an entire channel
window onto the human condition
prefer to think of it as a mirror
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort
Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls
The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his desk's high-tech phone terminal
(into speaker phone) Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof
1 (
) Hello
You're on, caller
Go ahead
1 Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you
Thank you
1 Truman has never been closer
The way he looked directly at us, spoke to us for the first time
Do you think he'll ever work it out
don't believe so
Not now
He tested his world, as we all do at certain times, and eventually it passed the test
You have to understand, he is a man made-for-, the world he occupies his only frame of reference
No, for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts
The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal
Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk"
2 (
) How much of a strain has the last few days placed on the actors
Working on "Truman" has always been a huge commitment for an actor, not just in terms of separation from friends and family, but since Truman essentially drives the plot, it's a never-ending improvisation
Recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige
(cutting off the call) Of course Truman has always been very much in on casting
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family
Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player
(pressing another line) Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned videographer, Christof
3 (
) Christof
've admired your work my whole life, although  can't say 've seen it all
Who can
3 Can you settle an argument for me
What's the longest time Truman has been off-camera
(trace of pride) In his entire life, forty-two minutes technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time
The remainder generally results from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman would stray out of range of our cameras
The Hague for Christof
The Hague
lost them
(pressing another line) Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk"
1 (
) How can you say Truman lives a life like any other
(sensing the thinly disguised resentinent in the caller's voice) believe that to be so
often feel the only difference between Truman's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented
We all play our allotted roles-- 1 (
) --He's not a performer
He's a prisoner
The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof holds him back
(rising to the challenge) --He can leave at any time
If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him
think what really distresses you, caller, is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"-- 1 (as if trying to convince herself
giving herself away) --No, you're wrong
He'll prove you wrong
He can still do it
(a thought occurring, looking directly into camera) Do  know you, caller
Your voice sounds familiar
'
, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off the call, stares at  on her television screen
It is she who is the Female Caller
Christof seems to stare back at her as the talk show continues
(from television) Recording a human life from birth to death, that's still the intention
You still believe Truman has more to contribute
(still reflecting on the last call) More than ever
By unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives
He gives us hope
Let's take another call
(pressing a line) London, England you're on "Tru Talk"
2 By definition Truman has to be free of censorship, but has the recent violence and profanity caused a problem for the sponsors
Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on the window that displays , still buried in his book
She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy
She has a camera and a white envelope in her hand
With a look of resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name on the envelope in her familiar blue ink
Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire, cavernous room - "Truman" and a date on the spine of each cassette
Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live picture of  sleeping on the sofa
Sitting in front of a playback monitor,  is transfixed by Truman thirty-four years earlier, a  in his mother's womb
(
) What are you looking for
Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at 's unexpected entrance
(not taking her eyes from screen) He was premature, wasn't he
Only by two weeks
Curious even then
Like he couldn't wait to get started
(feeling out where the conversation is headed) His eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected
What was it like, the first show
The ultimate live television
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue
Is it true what you said
on the show tonight
About letting him go if he wanted it badly enough
Would you really do that
Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty
It won't come to that
The suitably crestfallen  stands in front of his boss, , sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down
approaches the bank window
The teller is the whose child Truman attacked in the street
She takes a step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the confrontation fresh in her memory
Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street
He begins to apologize profusely
'
enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater
He breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it in the trunk
With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and fastens the lock
'
emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower, deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house
Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in her hand,  has been anticipating her husband's appearance
She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman than for any benefit she might derive
Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section of grass
We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are severed by the mower
The lawn is now uniformly trimmed
From a mechanical platform above the Expressway,  and watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest
,
In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district, a   in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth
In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour traffic
The  are all standing around, no one walking
Some are chatting with each other, others primping
The cars, vans and taxis are also idling
Camera locations are being checked
miniature camera inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the eye of a  on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean, the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is placed on a 's double-breasted jacket by a - we see from the button's , a    is carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, , another  we observe from the contact's
Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building and a ' camcorder are positioned
is seated at the control desk, directing the morning session,  assisting,  at his shoulder, a buzz of excitement in the room
hope we've got fresh extras
(consulting a clipboard) The rotation was made this morning
(staring at a monitor, irritated) don't like the couple with the baby
They'd never be together
The  with the stroller are promptly moved further along the street
Who's doing wardrobe
keep seeing the same wardrobe

At the command, the  and  begin inoving normally,  exits the subway, suspecting nothing
He begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour traffic

let's keep it moving

everybody look like you've got places to go
covers his microphone to deliver an aside to , from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director
bet he doesn't stop at the newstand
As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's banner headline, "   "
Christof scans the shot options available to him on the video wall
Bodycam Two
The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view of an approaching
For an instant, the unaware Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera
streetlight eight
The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp
The camera continues to follow Truman's progress
ready, Car-Cam One
Go to One
enters his office building as a taxi cruises by
and cut to interior
Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an ancient
looser
The camera widens the angle
and action, Vivien
(aside, proud of his casting) Looks just like Truman's mother at that age
, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at the same time as Truman
However she reaches for it after Truman has already turned his back
(incensed) Damn, she missed her mark
(impatiently to Simeon) Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention
Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien
go to the master hold the elevators
(mustering patience, into microphone) Vivien, press the elevator button again and make sure you catch his eye this time
second time, 's brief encounter with  goes like clockwork
As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman
The elevator car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she sachets into the lift
For a moment he appears to glance at a piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor
Good
Perfect
Cut to the interior
The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly filling with co-workers
and Lawrence
Just as the doors are about to close,  oozes in
He gives Truman a smug smile
nice look, Lawrence
and, Vivien
The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers
(admiring aside to the remaining fellow-males in the elevator) wouldn't kick her out of bed
Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the comely young woman
He is miles away
-
Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are several principal characters in Truman's life - , , , , ,  and the new actress, , sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast
takes his place at the head of the table, a large monitor showing  drinking coffee in his cubicle at American Life plays silently behind Christof's head
(to the meeting, referring to Meryl by her real name) Regrettably,  have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract
All eyes turn to Meryl
She looks at the floor
'm sure we can all respect her reasons
Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co- star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit
Her separation from Truman will be orchestrated over the summer
(more up-beat) However, 'm pleased to announce that television's first on-air conception will still take place
You witnessed the initial contact this morning
(glancing to Vivien, once again using her real name) You all know Claudia from her work in theatre
Thankfully, Truman doesn't
The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction
(referring to the bound documents passes to each cast member) This is a copy of Claudia's back story
Her character's name will be Vivien
She's the new adjuster at the office
The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on the cover, "     "
We intend to entice Truman into the affair as soon as possible
Claudia will make her advance at the seminar Truman's attending next week
Details are in your schedules
'm sure you'll all make Claudia welcome
(injecting a note of levity, more sophisticated than the character he plays) Question is, will Truman make her welcome
The cast snickers
(immediately back to business) don't have to tell you, how critical the next few weeks will be
This takes us into the next generation
When Truman's child is born, the network will be switching to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives
What happens when Truman and the baby are both on camera together
There will simply be duplicate coverage
(mischievous) Let's just hope we don't have twins
(uncharacteristically flippant) When Truman dies do we go back to the single channel
The cast turn in her direction
Christof has a second occasion to question his Assistant's loyalty
The ,  and  we have seen before, observe on the television above the bar
The cameras track Truman's progress, walking along Broadway
As he ducks into a sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks
Inside the store, Truman appears apprehensive
What's he doing in there
Meryl's at her mom's
Maybe he's got an urge
On screen, Truman looks through some -Rated video titles
(referring to Truman's overcoat) What's with the coat
(smirking at the irony) Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized
Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an item to the floor
(remarking on Truman's clumsiness) Nervous
Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store, the cameras following his journey as always
(exasperated) Oh God, he never bought nothing
Give him a break
It's taken him thirty- four years to get the nerve to go in there
'  - We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several pages long
The kitchen itself is a bombsite
More than the cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked haphazardly on the floor
'  -
The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess
Blankets piled in a heap
Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the room
chair in an odd position near the bed
Clothes strewn everywhere
Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered
is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a standard mattress
Although he is completely covered from head to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly visible
Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control room
It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras
Assistant Producer, , and his   slouch in their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen
Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner
Ready two
Go to two
Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close shot of Truman's covered head
The camera stays on the blanketed head for a long moment
And back to the medium
Another button is pressed and the angle changes
trace of frustration is evident in the control room
Recording a sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness
and wide
(aside to Simeon) Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried
(shrugs) That loser pays our salary
He's given up on himself again
Who cares
Makes life easier for us
He is what he is
At the far end of the great room, one of the large double doors opens and  enters, as always accompanied by , carrying a leather-bound folder
Simeon and the Operators subtely straighten in their chairs
Christof pretends not to notice
He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor
When did he start sleeping like that
About the time Meryl left
Is that the best shot we can get
What's to see
Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes
(referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom) What happened to the room
He started to reorganize
was going to call you
But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep
Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator
want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's insurance convention
Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors
They show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors banner in reception reads, "   & "
The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his producer's attention has wandered
Christof is staring at the sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor
Give me a shot from his wedding band
(pointing out the ring on Truman's bedside table) He took it off
(a trace of concern) Why is he so still
He's too still
Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to his ear
Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify
An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel
Christof and his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their headphones
Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that nothing is amiss
Christof is not so easily convinced
Give me a preview
An  on his torso
camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's prone outline
while the breathing remains steady, the body does not rise and fall
(anxious, barking a command to Chloe) Phone him
Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials
(anticipating Chloe's question) Wrong number
The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head, begins to ring
Truman doesn't flinch
'
walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a late night swim
Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes to pick it up
However, after lifting the receiver, the phone continues to ring
The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau
On the screen,  sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call
Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination
and the  are now highly agitated
(a trace of panic) He didn't drink tonight
No pills
Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in reply
Hang up
Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone ceases to ring
Get Marlon over there
Under what pretext
(letting his anxiety show) Any fucking pretext
Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing
'
's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house
Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he dashes barefoot to the front door
He tries the doorhandle, pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously, shouting Truman's name all the while
Tru
Tru
Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the window
He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but his shouts fail to rouse him
Marlon picks up one of Meryl's carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window
(shouting a warning) 'm comin' in, Tru
Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower of glass over Truman's bed
Still he doesn't move
Marlon reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the window frame and unlatches the window
'  -
clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands in an awkward heap on the floor beside 's bed
He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally stands at his co-star's bedside
There is a hissing sound
Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover
Beneath the bedding is a life-size inflatable female doll
The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly deflating
Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable tape recorder
Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next to his ear
The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing
, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor of  and his bizarre companion
Marlon is frozen, staring into camera
(quiet but firm) Cut transmission
Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly
He looks to Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an "" button
(enraged) said, "Cut"
Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself
'
watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on her television screen is replaced by the "" logo and the message, "
" has taken his place at the control panel
On the bank of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's home and neighborhood
Occasionally  or an  appear in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt
While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card, Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner
It is a recording of the night's transmission
Simeon stops on the last on-camera appearance by
They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers over his head
As the light is switched off, the recording camera automatically switches to night vision
Simeon continues to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast- forward mode
Christof suddenly points to the screen
There
Freeze
Zoom into the chair
Simeon types the appropriate command
Enhance
On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg, it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement already positioned in the bed
(referring to the debris) He wasn't making a mess
He was engineering a blind spot
How does he know where the cameras are
don't know
(noting the time-code on the monitor, staring into the back of Simeon's head) All  know is we've been filming a blow-up doll for the last three hours
Simeon feels the hostility
The systematic search of the monitors continues
They now reveal that dawn has broken on the set
(hanging up the phone) We've declared a curfew
Only the extras required for the search are on the set
Everyone else is at first positions
All prop cars accounted for
He has to be on foot
He has the world's most recognizable face
He can't disappear
All heads turn to  as she enters the grand control room with a status report
The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we don't make a statement within the next hour
The media is in a feeding frenzy
The phone lines are jammed
Every network has a pirated shot of Harlon and the dummy
rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud
He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags
Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn
wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge
Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car approaching
As it nears, we recognize a police car
Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in the search
The car slowly draws alongside, the looking straight into Truman's blackened face
Any sign of him
(deliberately gravelling his voice) Not yet
The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman
After what seems like an eternity, he motions his  to drive on
(to Truman, as the car pulls away) Take it easy
We pan down one concrete canyon after another
The usually bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted
Suddenly we see a line of  fanned out across a street
Then another and another
of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted at a crime scene
The lines include  and linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as and ,  , ,  and ,  and , , , ,  ,  , ,
On one occasion we glimpse Truman's colleagues, ,  and , amongst the searchers
building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and shrubbery
We focus on one of the waves of searchers
has linked arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up
swarm of helicopters fills the sky
While his  monitor the bank of screens,  has been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives,  and (to Christof who is still studying the faces in a row of ) Rumors are circulating he's dead
(pacing nervously) The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts
(unconcerned, referring to the static " " graphic, now accompanied by soothing classical music) Why
We're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series
The television behind the bar carries the still graphic
animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks
Some place bets with each other over the outcome
crowd of - hover around a display of televisions in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments
The two   we have seen before stare intently at the graphic on their televisions
The fan of  reaches the harbor and automatically turns to make another sweep
(referring to the empty streets) When we flush him out how do we explain this
(deadpan) We tell him the truth
Chloe looks askance at Christof
(joking darkly) We're making a movie
(hopeful) We'll get him on this next sweep
What have we missed
It's just a matter of time
No
We've missed something
Christof turns his back on the screens
Over his shoulder, we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor
-  13
has broken away from the line of searchers, on the pretext of taking a leak
He is standing on the edge of Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning their next sweep
Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street Racquet Club
We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened face, staring down at the lapping water
It triggers a montage of flashbacks
As usual the images all appear to play on a television screen
on the   at seven years old, his second grade teacher  , a close-up of   at his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the , seventeen-year old  jumping in the fountain, his rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness
13
comes back to reality
He steels himself, shuts out the doubts and dives into the water
Underwater we see  panicking at the shock of the cold sea, arms and legs flailing
Suddenly he stops and sinks for a moment in the weight of his clothes
Then slowly he rises to the surface and begins to swim
Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus' flagship, The Santa Maria
is spooling through significant scenes in the history of "" on a preview monitor
He pauses on the scene of  and  at the fountain in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season
Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips
Christof presses "" on the mixing desk
(from monitor) You remember when you were a little boy
Christof fast forwards, then presses  once again
Trust that boy
Christof jabs the "" button, freezing the picture
He recites the words to himself
Trust that boy
(to Simeon) We're not watching the sea
(confused) Why would we
Sweep the harbor
is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her sails
Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's composite picture
His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor
As the archaic vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight
Truman steers around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the horizon
and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea
Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched against the horizon
That's him
Resume transmission
Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor
'
, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the sound of a helicopte's rotor blade
Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight of  at the wheel of the Santa Maria
(staring intently at the On-Air monitor) What do we have on that boat
Simeon scans a computer shot list
He types in a code camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates
Truman, unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel
is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising and falling beneath his boat
He nears a large buoy bobbing clumsily in the strong swell
An official-looking sign is attached - "
"  We see an extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised miniature camera tracks Truman's progress
and the other   watch  from the buoy's  as he sails by
hears a helicopter overhead
By now the ocean spray has washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains
The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open coat, are soaked
Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass
As he steers, he occasionally refers to a "  " book from his coat pocket
He tacks against the wind, as he watches the military chopper circle his boat
(over
) Alter course immediately
You are entering a restricted area
Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper
Fuck you
Two   on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image of  steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman
1 knew he wasn't dead
The   continues to circle
(over
) Alter course or we fire on your vessel
screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the pilot
Get the hell away
It's my life
(into microphone to pilot, eerily composed) Fire a warning
round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck flinches
In his eyes we see the ghosts return
With great effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house
(over
) Alter course
Drop your sails
Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun
The distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly missing
Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads
(shocked at the near miss) Jesus
God
Is he out of his mind
(composed, into microphone to pilot) Pull back
Before the chopper can take evasive action  takes aim a second time and fires
The distress flare fishtails into the sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark, striking the rear rotor blade
Truman lets out a whoop
The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards the sea
The   bail out of the cockpit, splashing down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like a stone
Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's head
He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering away from the drifting pilots
look of resolve in his eyes we have never witnessed before
'
kneels on the floor in front of the television
As Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much
, , , and the  have been joined in the control room by , ,  and
How long will another chopper take
By the time we pick up the pilots, too long
We have to stop him for his own good
Turn him back with the elements
(hesitant) There's no rescue boat in the area
He won't know what to do
(trying to appeal to Christof's sense of reason) For God's sake, Chris
The whole world is watching
We can't kill him in front of a live audience
He was born in front of a live audience
(never taking his eyes from the screen, reassuring) Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life for the truth
His doubts will turn him back
Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk marked "", "" and ""
After typing in a command, he winds the controls towards their maximum settings
Kill the lights
Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom she has believed for so long
Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's boat at an alarming speed
High winds buffet the boat fights the wheel
Hurricane force winds shake the masts and keel, ripping the sails to shreds
The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the sea
His "  " book skids off the deck
Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes himself to the wheel to secure himself on board
(shouting above the storm) 'm coming to find you Sylvia
'm making myself deaf
(screaming up to the sky) You're going to have to kill me
Come on
Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck
Truman continues to head into the teeth of the gale
In contrast to his panic-stricken ,  gives an outward appearance of calm
However a bead of sweat appearing at his temple betrays him
(agitated) It's not working
He can sail that thing
How can he sail
He's in insurance
He hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven
(to Christof) On the behalf of the studio,  demand you cease transmission
(defiant, to Operators) Keep running
(to Moses) take full responsibility
(to Operator in front of radar-style screen) How close
Very close
Capsize him
Tip him over
(unable to contain herself any longer, entreating him) You can't
He's tied himself to the wheel
He'll drown
(staring at Truman on the monitor, becoming affected by his display of courage) He doesn't care
(to Christof, lunging for the control panel) You lied, you hypocrite
The only way he can leave, is dead
Chloe lunges for the control panel but Christof throws her to the floor
(enraged) Do it
All eyes turn in Christof's direction, as he confirms Chloe's accusation
(staring at the On-Air monitor, numb) It's too late
appears to be losing his fight against the storm, each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright, his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning out of control
His will, draining away
As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his arm into the handles of the spinning wheel
He cries out in pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the wheel
He braces for one last wave
But the wave does not come
strange phenomenon is occurring in the ocean
distinct division has appeared in the ocean swell
Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane
The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting
Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane"
After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the horizon
Land
Islands
As Truman steers towards the nearest shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations
It is certainly not the moon
The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is exposed above the surface of the sea
The ocean swell is being caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed
In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see, the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers
Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines
The exposed half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its length equivalent to several football fields
The massive arms perpetually churn
Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly past the giant rotating drum
The water beyond the rollers is dead calm
Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his eyes
But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that greets him
His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow collision course with the sky
That infinitely receding horizon line recedes no more
The sea really does meet the sky
The join is only too apparent
Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions
The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop
Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight
The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping gently into its latex surface
Truman unties his bindings and stumbles across the deck to the side rail
Clinging to the rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the painted cyclorama
He touches the sky
He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it
Hie eyes well up with tears
He presses his distraught face into it
He screams at the top of his voice
No words primal scream
pained, animal howl
and his   take in Truman's reaction in silence
/
/ /
's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and streets - wherever a television is to be found
No speaks
They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed
As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve of the cyclorama, 's attention is drawn to an outline in the otherwise flawless backdrop
He clambers to the prow of the boat
There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water line, is a door
Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle and halts the drifting boat
He stands in front of the door and closes his eyes in a silent prayer
He opens the door in the sky and steps through
/
Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from  in their various locations - bars, homes and offices
Strangers hug each other and dance in celebration
Even the cynical   jumps out of his seat - for the first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting himself for a moment, caught up in the drama
Yeah
Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately
His are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky - Truman out of view
finds himself on a small metal landing
steel ladder rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so high as to be barely visible
The rungs also continue downward, the depth of the "ocean-bed", to a studio floor far below
Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just entered
Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away
The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an enormous tank
The sky, a massive cyclorama
New York City, an elaborate set
And it is all housed within an impossibly large soundstage
Truman makes no effort to save the boat
He shuts the door to his world
sign on the back of the door reads, "
No Unauthorized Access
"  Gradually he becomes aware of another strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage
All around him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an automatic timer
(The light fixtures match the one that almost struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film
) By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the step ladder
Below, a studio tram makes its way along the soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day
As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young   delivers his tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to the half-full tram of
the soundstage roof houses over eight hundred thousand lights of varying intensities to faithfully recreate the constellations
However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual
They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot of the open door in the sky
suddenly steps in front of the tram
The stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop
The Guide looks from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to believe his eyes
Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of the guide's head
(to the shocked passengers) Nobody move
(to the guide) Drive
The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the tour
(to the guide, gesturing to the microphone) Keep talking
Say whatever you say
The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone
Er,
the ocean tank contains over six hundred and fifty million gallons of man-made salt water, temperature-controlled
Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram - "  "
He is suddenly aware of the tourists gawking at him
(to , camcorder around his neck) Act normal
Keep filming
Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of speeds towards the tram
But they streak past, on their way to the site of Truman's escape
As he tentatively gets back to his feet, Truman finds a  standing in front of him with an autograph book
Please, Mister Truman
On the child's -shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face
talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the balance of power taking place behind his back
The executives, and  are huddling with , making him an offer he appears to welcome
(into the phone) What do you mean he's not there
We can't have lost him again
On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by
crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall displaying pictures from every facet of his life
His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private spot where he and  met
on your left, the control room where the angles are selected and the actors receive direction
Of course, the one place we can't show you is the story department
There is none
(hesitant) Truman writes the script
From Truman's  we watch  approach
She has a pure white envelope in her hands
As Christof looks up to acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the tram
Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard of an indoor shopping mall
Truman gift shops
is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles such as, "TrumanTrivia"
Video cassettes offering "Truman Highlights"
His face emblazoned on -shirts, caps, coffee mugs and posters
Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying Oldsmobile are offered for sale
The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end
are checking the disembarking
Truman, using the   as a shield, also exits the tram
(frightened for his life) Here he is
It's him
Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and makes a run for it
The guards give chase
Truman runs into a lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his own, promoting "TrumanWear"
He pulls his "double" to the ground to block the guards' path
Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end
(into radio) We've got him trapped
Truman enters a doorway marked " " to find a stairway leading upwards
He takes the stairs three at a time
The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind
Flight after flight of stairs
At one point, he loses his grip on the stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for an eternity down the stairwell
He finally emerges on a landing
Lungs bursting
One more door
He tries the handle
It opens
finds himself on the roof of the soundstage
Outside
Really outside for the first time in his life
He looks frantically around him
Nowhere to hide
The soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof
Facing him, a colossal Burbank
Several other soundstages almost as gigantic as his own
The palm trees lining the streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns
The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of traffic, twenty lanes wide
Gargantuan office buildings eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known
Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its arched entranceway
Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky
The real moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating for the last thirty-four years
Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape
Along with the  , keeping their distance in the background, are , , and the two studio executives, and
In front of them, the co-stars in his life - , , sister , mother  and supposedly dead father
No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the familiar faces
Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the eye
Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing at the head of the group
He approaches Truman alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a father calls to a son
Truman
Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time
As they stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof
For a moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky
(quietly, half to himself, half to Christof) Even the stars  wished on
As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping from Christof's hand
With a strength he never knew he possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world
Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself
The studio guards dare not move
(staring into the chasm, remaining eerily calm) You won't do it, Truman
've watched you your whole life
(meeting Christof's gaze) You never had a camera in my head
Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life
(incensed) Something was real
(a terrifying anguish) Something had to be real
It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the abyss
Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in the moonlight
Truman follows Christof's gaze
Contemptuously tossing Christof aside, he retrieves the envelope
Christof crawls to safety, thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and insignificant
But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer exist in Truman's mind
Truman gazes at his name for a long moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully breaks the seal
Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to be slowly revealed
photograph
close up of 's face including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose
serenity comes over Truman
He lifts up his eyes to the mountains on the far horizon
As he stands on the very edge of the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we commence a long, slow pull-back
Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic picture of his face and proclaiming, " - Total Record of a Human Life
34TH
" We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame
The two   in the living room, the , the two   with the Watchman , the  in the bar, - outside an electronics store are all captivated by their television sets
We focus on the screen of a television
small sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his life
The infant's doting parents,  and the new actress , enter frame and begin to fuss over the child
border around the action on the screen announces, " - Total Record Of a Human Life"
Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen
stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the television set in Sylvia's house
bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the air, much to the child's delight
Truman dwells for a moment on the mirror-image scene on the television before very deliberately shutting it off
joins Truman and their daughter
Together, they exit the beach house
We follow them as they make their way onto the deserted sand and down towards the sea
