-                              1 Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills
One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat suit stumbles
() (laughing) Shit
1 () 'mon
Hurry up
They come to a gated home
girl that seems to be the leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the bottom of the chain link fence
She rolls under, and the others follow
loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house
They've done this before, they have it down
One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back window open
guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room
She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they slip inside
Once inside, we follow  into a bedroom dressing area
She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is totally cool and composed
She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye- brow
Let's go shopping
And she pulls open the closet door
: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags
drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a Louis Vuitton duffle bag

medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of prescription pills and dumps them in a bag
We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags
Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it

-                            2 The kids exit with their hoods up, carrying out the Louis Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry
: The kids make their get-away: One girl,  leans over and throws-up on their way out
They get into the Toyota and peel out
2A     - :                                         2A : flashbulbs go off
Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive teenagers and news clips
We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up
Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels
We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night
: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the hat we saw her try on earlier
Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags
image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for pictures
: on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces

see myself being like an Angelina Jolie, but even stronger, pushing even harder for the universe and peace and for the health of the planet

'  -                          3 Nicki and Sam, also pretty, slutty and 17, are waking up in a messy teenage bedroom

Sam struggles to sit up, she's in a tight tank with bed head
She rolls her eyes
Oh my lord, you were so out of control last night
What about you
You were all over that old guy, the manager
Sam laughs
Oh yeah
He was totally perving out
She starts to slip into skinny jeans

She opens a cabinet as she calls up to them
little Yorkie nips at her heels
Girls
Time for your aderall
Let's go
Emily, 13, sleepily sits down for some cereal
Mom, they got home so late last night
Laurie with wide eyes and a forced calm voice answers her
That's none of your concern, 'll handle it
She calls up to them again

Nicki and Sam wander down to breakfast, disheveled

Uh
late
You know it's a school night
We know
Laurie tries to sound cheerful and in control
Let's have our morning prayer and then we'll meet in the living room at eight to start today's lesson on the laws of attraction,
They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her prayer
(') My chief aim in life is to continually strive to express my greatest potential as a spiritual human being and contributor to the greater good for our planet and all those who live on it
know that have the ability to reach my aim in life, by persistent action and that the thoughts of my mind will reproduce themselves in outward physical reality
will channel my energy towards my aim in life with graciousness and loving kindness to myself and others
( ) And so it is
Wahoo

Rebecca and Marc jump back, he yells
Rebecca glares at him to be cool
Oh my fucking god
They're her pet monkeys
Hi guys
She leans forward and makes a cute face at the monkey who hisses at her
They continue through the house looking around
They pass a gilded gold-framed couch with pillows with Paris' photo silk screened on them
They pass a wall of photos of Paris Hilton and her many magazine covers, as they go upstairs
Marc is nervous, Rebecca is cool and focused
He paces and is on the look out, while she looks for stuff
Let's get the fuck out of here
It's fine, it's fine
let's keep going
They go into her dressing area
It's a mess, clothes all over the floor
Rebecca picks up some small purses and finds crumpled fifties and hundred dollar bills that she takes
She's so messy
Rebecca looks through her underwear drawer, takes a bright pink bra
She takes a Louis Vuitton Camo bag and stuffs some things in it

You're tripping out
This is fine, it's ok, why are you tripping out
Rebecca casually descends the stairs as if she lives there
Marc follows her down, into Paris' night club room
There are pictures of her all over the walls, and a stripper pole on a little platform
Pink furry pillows line the banquette
Marc takes a bottle of vodka
Rebecca looks around the room, takes it all in

They see a security patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes
The patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes
Rebecca and Marc freeze in their hiding spot
Marc is freaking out, he thinks this is it for him
He tries to breath quietly
Rebecca calmly waits
Finally the flashing lights stop, and the car moves on
Marc and Rebecca sit in the dark, Marc breaths again
They wait for a while

They sneak out through the backyard, and run down a hill behind the house
Oh my fucking god
We see them as small figures running across the empty hillside

My dad is a director of photography on
shows, he's been in the industry forever
And how is Sam related
We've adopted her, we met in ballet class when we were little
was friends with her mother-- Mom, this is my interview
met her when my parents divorced
Now she lives with us, my mom's home schooled us all for a while
The philosophy of `The Secret', it's based on the law of attraction, but my great- grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy
It's man's relationship to the Divine, that's what energy science means
Since  was young  learned about every religion
So, Sam was in your ballet class, did she have parents
She had a dysfunctional background, we both did
And  met her mom-- Can  talk please

Yes, we do a lot of stuff through our church, it's Agape Church

Nicki,  don't want you to answer that comment
think that 'm a firm
have a good statement to say
She can speak generally
'm not gonna speak about the case, what  was going to say is that 'm a firm believer in karma and think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being
Nicki is getting emotional as she speaks, her voice quivers

What's your goal or life plan if you have one

Nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism
It's my main goal
God didn't give me these talents and what  look like to sit around and just be a model or famous

Marc laughs
On my Facebook page recently  had 800 friends requests,  accepted them all,  didn't even look at them, then  noticed someone had created a fan page for me
If it had been for something  had done to help the community or benefit something 'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society
