href <b>// --> </b> Life as a House - By Mark Andrus : clock alarm  over  on
We  someone clearing congested lungs, coughing up phlegm; a slight crash both the cough and the alarm
'   - The cottage is a tiny, peeling paint rat-trap set dead center on a small ocean front cul-de-sac, surrounded by four massive post-modern mansions
'    - , 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning light and ocean breeze enter through an open window
Bold waves crash against the cliffs outside the room
five-foot wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style, making movement in the room next to impossible
George stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again
He steps over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the sea
happy sounding tune by Guster, "   ," begins with the lyrics: 'Woke up today, to everything gray and all that  saw just keeps going on and on
' '  - The post-modern house is three-levels of concrete and glass
'  - is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two earrings and painted black nails
The song continues with: '
sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the curtains and cover my head
'  Sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle
He walks to a desk where a half-built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it
Sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose
He slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating
'    - , George's next-door neighbor, is a well maintained blonde in her late thirties
She walks out of the angular concrete mansion, grabs the paper and walks back in
'  - This is a minimalist kitchen, with pored concrete walls and stainless steel cabinets
Colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to wash her hands
The  : '
If this serenade is not what you want, it's just how it is
'  Colleen appears distracted for a moment
She walks outside onto the terrace with wet hands, then bolts back in, breezing through the kitchen with purpose
'  - is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and white teeth; her head is partially out the bathroom window
Colleen bursts in, eases Alyssa aside and with effort, sticks her head out of the same high open window
This is ridiculous
We must not see exactly what they see, but out the window and almost beyond view, a stream of urine arks out from George Nelson's beach house bedroom, into the pacific ocean some twenty-feet below
The piss stops
Colleen bangs her head trying to get it back inside the house
'   - is George's ex-wife, still beautiful at forty
She herds two boys,  (8) and  (7), down the hall
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug
Why
He'll be gone for his birthday
Can we have a party for him while he's gone
Robin stops and  on a bedroom door
hope you're showered and ready for school
loud  stops Ryan and Adam at the top of the stairs
'  - Robin rushes in and glances around the room for her son
Sam
' '  - The closet pole and a long line of clothes have been felled by Sam's dangerous whack-off technique; he's on the floor with the robe tie still around his neck and a pile of shirts sprawled over him
The song continues: '
come out come out, wherever you are, would you do it all over right from the start, and what you wish for won't come true, you aren't surprised to love, are you
' Robin stops at the door, trying to figure out why her son is sitting in a pile of his own clothes
Ryan and Adam join her, looking equally perplexed
' -- - George's dog, , is doing his business on the lawn of a modern day robber baron,  , who exits his house with a briefcase
He hops into his Mercedes and proceeds to chase Guster straight across his well-manicured grass
Guster easily escapes death and runs off
George walks out of his shack as David hops the curb, flips him off and drives away
George waves goodbye
Stick it up your ass
Have a nice day
(glancing around) Guster
Guster runs to his side as Colleen rushes out of her house
This has got to stop
He escaped
He's going back in
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your
penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter
There are no windows facing my
exposure
George, this is the third time
The plumber's due out on Friday
You'll have to explain that to the police
You were the only neighbor  could tolerate
did warn you
My life is a warning
just can't figure out for what
Colleen shies away from George's stare; he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back
(') Colleen, how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick
This stops Colleen for a moment; it was difficult
George walks back to the cottage and locks Guster in before stepping into an old Ford truck and driving off
Colleen watches him drive off, then turns to her house and stares
'   - , Robin's husband, is a distinguished, intimidating man with silver hair and an expensive suit
, the maid, serves French toast to Ryan and Adam as Robin sips tea
Sam broke his closet
Peter glances at Robin, who shrugs
don't have a clue anymore
wish you'd talk to him
He needs a man
His father is a man
man he respects
Sam walks into the room from the hall, outfitted in all black with kick ass boots
Thanks for talking about me behind my back
useful in court
Are you wearing eye shadow
Adam, Ryan and Robin check out the eye shadow
No
Take it off
Sam flutters his eyelids in defiance of his stepfather
(') Do it now
If  walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through
Peter hesitates for just a second
(') Have a nice flight
Sam's out the door with his eye shadow intact
Queer
What did you say
Dad said it first
Robin focuses on Peter, who simply shrugs
Adam stands up, walks over to his father and gives him a hug
get chocolate cake for your birthday
Are your hands clean
Adam is quick to back away from his father and lick the fingers of one hand
- George is resting his head against the glass window as he stares out at the blighted landscape leading to downtown Los Angeles
sudden pang tightens his face; he presses his hand against his stomach and closes his eyes
- Sam is alone at the back of the parking lot, sitting on the hood of an old Saab, smoking as two boys,  and , both seventeen, park a Porsche and pull Alyssa Beck (George's peeping neighbor) and another girl out of the backseat
Dude, nice look
Sam simply nods as Marek and the other girl laugh at his all black garb, earrings and eye shadow
saw your dad this morning
Sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his face lightens as Alyssa waves before walking away
Been thinking
No
Forget him
Two hours a week for three-hundred cash
The whole summer
Do the math
(as a dig) They consider that a hatchback or a station wagon
Oh, that isn't yours anyway, is it
Josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away
Sam faces the Saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can
Suddenly, a boy () bolts up from the back seat
was in total , man
- The architectural firm of Benson and Feinsilber occupies the entire fortieth floor; George Nelson is their sole model maker
Rather than offices, most of the space is open, segmented only by portable low walls
Along the outer walls, below the long line of windows, is a shelf filled with amazingly intricate models
George is alone in a cubicle of his own, cutting polystyrene with a hot wire rounds a corner with a velocity that makes George flinch
Done
close to done
'm doing the grass
Fuck the grass
Who said grass
Steven exits as quickly as he entered, but as soon as George goes back to work, Steven pops his head back in
(') Burke bided out the Berlin Plaza
Did he tell you
was going to start Monday
He likes the look of the computer models, anyway
You take too long
(beat) After you mow the grass, would you mind bringing the house to my office
have a presentation to make
George simply stares as Steven nods and leaves
- Sam is by himself, his eyes closed, listening to music through headphones as Alyssa stops to stare; she visually scans him head to foot, appearing slightly perplexed as a friend passes
wouldn't make a habit of it
Okay
The friend walks on; after a beat, Alyssa does too
- In the distance, the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as it sets
Range Rover with blackened windows is parked behind a Porsche
' ,' an up-tempo tune with a hand clapping by the Pansy Division, begins: ' bed would be a treat/But all we've got is this backseat/Tinted windows are a beautiful thing
' Through the front windshield, we can see Marek sitting in the passenger's seat with his eyes closed
Josh, Marek's friend, is sitting on a bench in the park behind the cars
' dark secluded spot/In a deserted parking lot/Tinted windows are a wonderful thing
' Suddenly, the passenger door on the Rover opens and Marek climbs out, brushing his hair with his hands before casually checking his zipper
He closes the door and the car speeds away
Josh walks to Marek and wordlessly they climb into the Porsche and drive off
'   - George is shirtless in his front yard, hand hewing a twenty foot beam
One strong, long pull and a thin shaving flutters to the ground; Guster nabs it and starts to chew
You'll crap real logs if you keep eating wood
Guster appears unconcerned as he awaits a new shaving
(
) Hi, Mr
Nelson
George glances up, wipes the sweat from his forehead as Alyssa walks toward him in white shorts and a tee shirt
(') Sorry  got you into trouble
'll survive
George goes back to works and Guster taste tests shavings as Alyssa searches for something else to say
Does Sam have any friends
George stops and looks up; he has no idea how to answer
He must
He seems lonely
Are you his friend
No
Why
Marilyn Manson
and  guess he's into guys
hate nose rings
And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working
George is totally confused, unsure most of the answer, but before he can question her, a police car pulls to a stop; steps out
Thought 'd run over the list
Officer Walker removes a pad from his pocket and flips through to find his place
This is such a street of whiners
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today
Okay
Mrs
Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn
The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your
structure
's caused the rat population on this street
Officer Walker focuses on Alyssa
And of course the Beck's, with the
It could have been a squirt gun
(to George) You've been good this week
You forgot David Dokos and Tom and Barbara
Kurt stuffs his pad back into his pocket
Mr
Dokos calls animal control for Guster and  was out here on the other
(pointing to the plane) Do you mind
George hands him the plane and Kurt begins to work the wood
Are you guys' friends
We've known each other since grade school
mean, but did you both go camping on weekends
Listen to music
Masturbate together
Talk on the phone
George doesn't answer and Kurt keeps working
Hunted rabbit in the hills
Alyssa stares at George, disappointed
aimed high
We just weren't very much alike,  guess
don't know
(casually; to George) liked your dad more than  liked you
wouldn't want you as a friend
George just never really
aimed that high
Even with not hitting a rabbit knew you were doing that, by the way
That's why  stopped doing it with you
You were no fun
It was always like you were frightened
Quiet and boring
Kurt is beginning to perspire as he shaves food off the beam for Guster
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop
He builds models for architects
His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal
Designed and built the coolest houses 've ever seen
Was bankrupt and dead before  was twenty
Left you this place
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it
He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title
Do you know what 'd give to have this
Forget how  got it
can't afford dirt in this town
live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean
Kurt stops working and steps back
(') Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot
didn't write him up
told him  wouldn't tell you
Thanks for telling me
At least your father tried, George
Kurt walks to his car and drives off
There's a moment of awkwardness with Alyssa
George walks into his house leaving Alyssa with Guster
'  - Robin is sitting at the kitchen counter, cutting carrots; through the French doors, she's able to watch Ryan and Adam, along with a few friends, play in the pool
(
) could be anyone
Robin jerks with fright as half the carrots roll to the floor
Then why do you stay you
George picks up the carrots and washes them in the sink
You should lock your doors
Ring the bell before you try the door
George bites into a carrot as Robin starts chopping again
(') Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend
You let him pierce his nose
Robin snatches the carrot from George's hand and chops it up
Lock the door behind you
Where is he
Where he always is
George takes Robin's hand and removes the knife
Not that  don't trust you
As George lets go, Robin holds on; he appears surprised by her grip of his wrist
Robin's eyes well with tears
(') should have knocked
George is clearly not comfortable with his ex-wife's hold of him, with her tears
What kind of a mother can't stand her son
George jerks his arm away from her grip
don't know
'   - George is tense and he walks to Sam's door and
Why aren't you coming in for the weekend
(beat) Sam
Nothing
George tries the door - it's locked
Frustrated, he walks back down the hall and down the stairs
'  - Outside, the boys are engaged in a raucous version of Marco Polo
Robin is at the sink; she holds her hair back with one hand and splashes water on her face with the other
George walks by outside, carrying a ladder
'  - Ryan is the first to notice  George
Marco
What are you doing
'm not cheating
'm not looking
Robin wipes her face with a hand towel as she rushes out
What are you doing
He doesn't answer
The boys have stopped playing; Adam opens his eyes
He never answers
Why does he have a lock on his door
Because he put the lock on
Do you think told him he could have a nose ring
Why do you ask me everything you should ask him
don't know anything, anymore
The boys line up against the edge of the pool and watch George extend the ladder against the house and climb
(') You climb up there and tell him what he can and can't do
Take him for the summer, okay
Whip him into shape
Cut his hair
Make him smile
Let him hate you for a while
(sadly) You're too late for heroics, George
George lops a leg over the railing and steps onto the bedroom balcony
He peers into the room through the sliding glass door and tries to open it (locked) before removing the screen to the small open window beside it
He climbs in
'  - Sam is asleep on his bed in his underwear, wearing headphones
On the floor is an aerosol can of whipping cream
George picks up the can and tosses it in the trash
He focuses back on his son with his nose ring, earrings, blue eyeshadow and thin, pale white body
Sam is soundly asleep
George gently removes the headphones from his son's head; drum heavy music surges from the small, padded speakers
You need every brain cell you've got
on the door stirs Sam more than his father's voice
(half-asleep) Leave me alone
Sam's eyes are still closed as he shifts onto his side
George opens the door; Robin is weak and weepy
don't know what to do, anymore
Take him
You take him
(hostile) You're such a good father
George walks out of the room, around Robin and down the stairs without a word
Sam stirs at the sound and sits up to confront his mother
What are you doing in my room
didn't go in your room
locked the door
Get out
locked the door
Get out
'   - Robin grabs the door and closes it quickly, but doesn't move
(
) Stupid bitch
Liar
locked the door
don't sneak around your room
Liar
'  - Sam rushes over to the window and stares down at the screen and ladder
Ryan, Adam and their friends are still in the pool, holding onto the coping, staring up at Sam
Sam slams the window shut and searches for the can of whipping cream
He gets down on his knees to search under the bed
Standing and making one more pass of the room, he notices the can in the trash
He instantly focuses all his rage at the closed door
This is my room
You have no right in here
This is mine
'   - Robin is sitting on the floor at the top of the stairs, staring blankly down at the foyer of this modernist mansion
(
) Why can't you all just die and leave me alone
- The traffic is thick and loud and the sky is a blanket of brown as George makes his way down a sidewalk mixed with professionals and panhandlers
Suddenly sick, George rushes to the side of a building and vomits
, ,    - George wipes a clump of wet paper towel against the vomit stain on his cuff as he walks through the pockets of cubicles to a large enclosed office
smiles as she stands up from her desk and opens the door
Good morning
Is there a
He holds out the wad of wet paper towels, but before he can say trashcan,   stands up from behind his desk
George, have a seat
've got juice
'  - George steps in and the secretary closes the door to the office
Bryan approaches with his arm outstretched, but George can only raise the paper towels
bird caught me
Bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up; George tosses the ball into the trash and sits down
Orange juice
croissant
Bryan motions with his hand as he sits
'm good, thanks
What are you on
Pardon me
how much weight have you lost
Oh
nothing
Thirty pounds
just haven't been very hungry
How's your wife
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry
(beat) Now she's just hostile
Bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and chews as he talks
Right
she married
what was he
He buys and sells the world
Peter Webber
Right
Quite the spotlight on that guy
did tell you, didn't
That 'd be ready to start the Berlin model today
Well, that's sort of
you're sure you're not hungry
Bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant
George shakes his head "no"
Bryan tosses his croissant into the trash can and leans forward
(') This isn't me
(beat) We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer
But you won't change
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why  started building models
All of us are typing and clicking, George
Whether we want to, or not
'm not
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects
It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do
George glances around the office, angered by the thought he's being fired
've been here twenty years
Maybe that's too long
(hopeful) Maybe
That's too long
George nods as he stares at Bryan
(') Listen, they decided on a week a year severance, but  got them to twenty-six
That's six months salary, George
Medical and everything for six months
You can learn all you need to on the computer long before that
Maybe find a job closer to home
Bryan is rattled by George's blank stare
He takes his glass of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, all the while keeping an eye on George
My wife left me because  wasn't
very emotional
kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me
Drunks do that, sometimes
Make their kids afraid
Make them unwilling to express themselves
Bryan knows he's supposed to say something, he just can't seem to figure out what
Oh
How old are you
Forty
We were probably in school together
You went to Berkley
Bryan lights up at the sound of his Alma matter
Class of eighty-six
didn't know you were there
was a sophomore when  got the call my parents were dead
This is not the direction Bryan had hoped the conversation was headed
(') My dad had a blood alcohol level of
18
little high
Drove right into oncoming traffic
Killed my mother with him lady in another car
Hurt her daughter
five-year old girl
think about her still
Bryan wants this to end
He leans forward with a whisper
Listen
maybe  can get you a year
hate this job
What are you talking about
You love your job
From the day  started
to today
Can't stand it
Bryan is perplexed as George stands
Then it sounds like 'm doing you a favor
It may sound that way, but  react out of fear
My life has nothing to do with what  like or don't like
You haven't been listening, have you
didn't know there would be a quiz, George
For everything
Well,  feel better about this now
Good
was hoping for that
Relieved and not understanding anything about irony, Bryan stands and extends his hand
George shakes Bryan's hand without malice
(') 've got one favor to ask
What can  do for you, George
built my first model here when  was twenty
There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office
Twenty years of my life
was wondering if  might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home
Only the ones that really mean something to me
Bryan recoils slightly from the request
Oh, well
those are
mean, we don't get to keep our work
could maybe ask them if you could choose one
But, you know, frankly George, you were the best
Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours
They're a part of this firm
They inspire me
go out there and sometimes just stare at something 've designed
It amazes me
would miss that too much
(beat) Look,  may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you
Just run it by me first, just in case, you know
but 'm sure it'll be okay
Thank you
Well, it's the least  can do
Yes, it is
George nods and leaves
Bryan looks lost and guilty again
, ,    - George walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own
He finds an empty box and starts to pack
Against a wall, a large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans
George pulls one of the plans down, rolls it out and detaches the wooden spool
Without warning and with a fury hard to fathom, he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully rendered models
Heads pop up in other cubicles as George walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage, methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown Los Angeles
Steven Gardner, who asked for his model without grass, rushes to within feet of George as he witness his creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic
Mother of God
Not my house
George stops for a second to focus on Steven, but Steven is smart enough to run
George continues on with the business of disassembling his work
Oh, please, please, no
The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine
George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model; portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as though bombed in war
Bryan Burke's secretary inches as close as she dares
Uh
Mr
Burke would like a word with you, George
George lowers his stick as he faces her
Oh
okay
In his office
When you're able
Thank you
With that, George finishes what he began only minutes prior: the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed on every shelf in the office, save one
Workers huddle together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from the mayhem
George picks up the sole surviving model in his arms and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burke's office
'  - Bryan cowers behind his desk as George enters with his model in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other
'll take this one, if that's okay
It takes Bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he simply nods
(') Thank you for going out on a limb and allowing me one
Bryan nods again, then quivers as George steps forward, leans the stick against the desk and extends his hand
(') You're a great architect and a miserable human being
Bryan winces as he extends his hand
They shake hands and George grabs hold of the stick again
Thank you
George walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on the floor, one that Bryan had obviously wanted to save
(') Oh, fuck
George drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office as Bryan garners the courage to stand
(') You're not even an architect and you're a miserable human being
George turns around only long enough to answer
You're right
You win
George closes the door behind him
Bryan stares down at the remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and carefully gathers up the pieces
- George is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items under one arm and the model under the other
Dizzy, he stops for a moment and tires to orient himself, glancing one way, then the other before staggering back and pressing himself against the building for support
Sweat beads and drops from his nose and chin as the song, '  ' begins by The Beatles
George sets the box down but clings tightly to the model as he closes his eyes
'Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing them, caressing me
' George drops face first to the cement, crushing the model beneath him
George is probed and poked by doctor after doctor
An ultrasound test followed by a  scan, followed by a results in more tests
flexible tube is slid down George's throat as dye is shot into his body
'Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open view, inciting them, inviting me
' long blunt needle is shoved into George's side for a biopsy of his pancreas
-rays are lit and highlighted as doctors ponder the specks, the disease
Finally, George is opened up; nearly bloodless slice through skin, muscle and fat reveals death
'Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, which calls me on and on across the universe
' George is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit
'Nothing's going to change my world, nothing's gonna change my world
' - George tries to sit up, but falls back as he closes his eyes, opens his eyes, closes his eyes
(
) That took care of the pain
George opens his eyes again as an attractive  enters with a tray of food
could kiss you
The nurse smiles as she lifts the cover off the dinner
(') No food
'm painless
She raises George's bed
(') What would you do if you had three or four months to live
The nurse glances over at the other patient in the room, who's sleeping, before answering in a soft voice
'd eat a lot of red meat
Good for you
The nurse smiles as she sits down beside the bed
She fills a spoon with corn and aims it for George's mouth; he accepts the good will, chews and swallows
What would you do
'd build a house
George takes another spoonful of food
What kind of house
You know what mortise and tenon is
The nurse shakes her head "no"
(') 've got every part of it ready
It's like a jig saw puzzle
all in pieces now, just waiting to make sense
've been through design and review
the planning commission, city council
She feeds George another small spoonful of food
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they
Stage four pancreatic cancer
They haven't even pretended to offer treatment
You tell me, when would you start eating red meat
Can you build a house in four months
can die trying
The nurse rests her hand for a moment on George's cheek
Good for you
haven't been touched in years
Suddenly alarmed by her emotion, the nurse removes her hand and stands back away from George
'm sorry,  don't know what that was
handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes
Doctors, people who have to touch you
But not by people who want to
No
friend
your mother
Everybody gets touched by someone they love
Isn't that weird
mean,  dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years
Six years
know when my son was younger
maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me
George suddenly stops to catch his emotion
The nurse checks the door before walking back to George; she brushes back his hair with both hands, then fingers the curves of his ears, finally resting her thumbs on his lips
Oh God, 'm married
Feeling guilty, she flees the room, waking the other
'm hungry
'm touched
- George is resting, eyes closed, sitting on a bench with his box and the remnants of the model beside him
black Range Rover pulls to a stop with a
George stands to gather his things as Robin steps out of the car, yelling
called everyone, everywhere
You just vanished
You could be dead
Thanks for waking me up
Picking me up
You're loud today
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion
You're the most beautiful woman  have ever known in my life
Robin is stumped for a second, confused by the words
What
'm not talking just physically
Even your anger is perfect
Robin climbs back in the car and slams her door shut
'   - George sets his box in back and climbs into the front seat as Robin takes off
He closes his door as she runs a stoplight
didn't think you'd know  went missing
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat
blueprint spool
Where have you been for a week
Four days
left to think
What did you do with your dog
Kurt's been feeding him
But you can't call me while you think
wasn't thinking
Look, 'm sorry didn't think to call you while thought
think
George raises his eyebrows, wanting just the slightest give from Robin
She glances at him, but won't yield
(') need to talk to you
Why would they tow your truck
was parked in day parking
Why call me
'm going to tear down the shack and build my house
You've been saying that for twenty years
While we were dating, you said it
There's nothing anymore to stop me
Money
Severance pay
And 'm going to cash in my life insurance policy
How many years did  live with your beams and boards
First in the garage, then in the living room
We're going to do it, Robin
Next year
Next year
Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena
Doors from a church in New Hampshire
love those doors
Where will you live
The garage
Look,  wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it
When's school over
Friday
God,  hate the thought of him home all day
'll be by Saturday to pick him up
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore
Not for the weekend
For the summer
Robin scoffs
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer
The garage is plumbed
'll put in a toilet
We'll survive
Thank you for at least sounding sincere
Sounding
need help
He's cheap labor
One of you would end up dead
At least we'll have a house to show for it
Forget it, really
'll survive
want him with me
No, you don't
Trust me
George rests a hand on the back of her neck
want Sam for the summer
Robin furrows her brow for a moment and glances at George
It takes a while for her to answer
Okay
George rests his hand on Robin's cheek for a moment, as the nurse had done with him
Robin turns her head and bites his finger
Hey, hey
'm married
George nods as he mock nurses his finger
- Sam is walking with Corey, who's wiry and wan with a red nose
The whole summer, man
Party in Tahoe
don't know
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends
All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude
(boasting) My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod
Income village is the place to hook up with hump
'll ask
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer
Sam stops which stops Corey
Sam glances around to make sure no one's listening
never said anything
haven't done anything
know what the deal is
Josh is a pimp
'm not stupid
You don't know what the deal is
There is no fucking deal
Sam walks away pissed that Corey knows what the deal is
'  - George is shirtless, the stitches still fresh on his side; he carries/drags his mattress into the garage
Alyssa walks from her house to the garage and peeks in
'  - George is making his bed, which is not easy because Guster is curled up on it
The one car garage is not dry-walled and the cement floor is clean but stained
Hi, Mr
Nelson
George steps away from the bed, slightly rattled by Alyssa
Alyssa
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage
'm living here while  build another house
Is that legal
Alyssa sits down on the bed beside Guster and starts to bounce up and down
George takes another step back
Don't you have school
Nope
Alyssa lies down on the bed, lifting the sheet to her nose
(') Are these clean
George is alarmed
Guster licks Alyssa's ear
What's today
Monday
George bangs his head with his hand and starts to search the room
My keys
What's that
Alyssa reaches out and slides a finger down his scar
Nothing
cut myself
George pats down his pockets
(') had them in my pocket
'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, 've decided
George opens the drawers of a small desk and a chest, not paying attention to Alyssa as she raises her leg and runs her hands down the stubby skin
(') Paula Cole isn't a vertical kisser
George dabs his keys from the floor beside the chest
Make the bed for me, would you
gotta run
George turns around to Alyssa's leg up and a great view of her underwear
(
) What are you, forty
George whirls around to face Colleen as Alyssa lowers her leg
forgot where  put my keys
And you thought they might be under her dress
was just showing him my hair
Alyssa miffed as she stands
(') think you need to rethink what you think of me
Alyssa walks around her mother and out of the garage
Colleen stares at George
Her leg hair
Colleen turns and walks out
'  - George drives the four miles North to Robin's house listening to Paula Cole
He turns into Emerald Bay, a guard-gated community and a Guard waves him in
'  - George rushes from his car and tries the front door, but it's locked
He rings the bell and , the maid, answers
Mrs
Webber is in the backyard
And Sam
In his room, packing
Oh
Good
'  - Sam has a  by   on loud as he packs a suitcase on his bed
The  on the door is barely heard draws his disapproval
(
) Sam
Sam's face turns sour as he yanks the door open
(') Ready
Sam shrugs and returns to finish his packing
(') think you'll have fun this summer
It's nearly impossible to hear George over the music
(') Don't forget your headphones
The music is quickly driving George crazy
(') Would you mind turning it down
This doesn't register with Sam
(') It won't all be work, you know
George is once again, seemingly unheard
He walks to within inches of Sam and grabs his head and yells into Sam's ear
(') It won't be all work, you know
Sam pulls away from the touch and turns the music off
heard you already
George walks to the sliding glass door and stares down at the boys and Robin in the pool
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime
To check up on me
'll be around to check up on you
Why would you be there
Because  live there
You live in Cory's parents' cabin
'  - Ryan and Adam are on their backs on rafts as Robin swims laps between them
Suddenly, like a  crashing to Earth, Sam's suitcase spirals downward straight into the pool, barely missing both Adam and Ryan
No fucking way
The boys are knocked off their rafts as Robin takes off her goggles and focuses on Sam up on his balcony
(') You liar
You stupid liar
hate you
George bursts out of the kitchen, onto the patio
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me
(
) No 'm not
Sam storms off the balcony, back into his room
What was  supposed to do
When you didn't show up Saturday,  tried to call
Your phone isn't working
don't have a phone
drove over and you were gone
can't leave the house
Last time you were gone for a week
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me
No
was going to let you do that
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe
Sam walks out of the kitchen to confront his father
Who are you, anyway
don't even know you
You'll know me by the time we're through
'm not going
'll get your bag
George walks to the edge of the pool and scoops up the suitcase, holding it out as it drains
Mom, tell him 'm not going
You already promised me
You have everything
Robin is in an uncomfortable position as she glances at Sam before focusing on George
did say he could go
Let's go
'm not going
You don't have a choice
Mom
please
Sam's eyes well with tears as his voice cracks
Robin is ready to concede
George -- (adamant) He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe
If he leaves, will follow him up there and  will drag him home by his nose ring
He can hate me
You can hate me
He can try to kill me while  sleep
You can call the police
You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me
He's my son
He's sixteen
That's it
Sam is crying now -- snot's running down his nose
Robin is shocked by George's forcefulness
Can we hate you
You can do anything you want
George walks to Sam and touches his arm
(') Go get in the truck, Sam
Sam jerks away from his dad as dramatically as he can manage
Go fuck yourself
George drops the suitcase and grabs Sam by the arms
As much as Sam tries to resist, he's clearly no match for his father
Your nose ring comes out of your nose
If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too
And there's no make-up at my house
No glue sniffing
Huffing
No pills, no grass
If you hit me, 'll call the police
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam
won't ever hit you
(beat) This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it
So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck
Now
'll hate you forever
You can't even begins to know how much hate my father
(upbeat) Think of it as a family tradition
Sam glares at his mother before grabbing his soggy suitcase and stomping out of the backyard
Robin is stunned silent by George's decisiveness
'  - Sam is pressed against the passenger side door
George walks from the backyard and opens the truck door to climb in but is stopped by Sam's suitcase
He lifts it out and sets it in the bed, then slides into the cab, sitting on the soaked seat
George rises up and turns to Sam, who is sullen and silent
'  - Sam is shirtless on his back on the roof of the shack, sunning himself as George struggles to extricate a sofa from a doorjamb
Guster is asleep on the grass, under a tree
Sam
'm
for like three minutes
After another bout of trying, George drops the sofa and steps back to glance up at Sam
(') That's okay
If  break my back, daddy's gonna buy you a naval ring
No reaction from Sam
(') And if that naval ring don't fit, daddy's gonna rub you down with the sun screen
Sam glances down at his father, puzzled by the verse
(
) (') want you wearing sun block
And  want you down here to help me
Now
Sam dismisses his father without a word - he simply adjusts his face back to the sun
George walks away
sudden spray of water drenches Sam, forcing him to his feet in a cold panic
George stops the hose water pelting
(') It works on Guster
George is still struggling with the sofa stuck in the door
Frustrated, he steps away from the sofa
(') You're in there not helping at all, aren't you
- Sam is leaning against a wall with his arms folded across his chest
(
) You know what else helped Guster
Neutering
The slightest alarm crosses Sam's face
'  - George is shirtless in shorts, boiling pasta on a portable stove as he heats a sauce in the microwave
dresser topped with plyboard serves as a countertop; other than a sink being across the garage near the toilet, this is a fairly well equipped makeshift kitchen
Do you want garlic bread
George waits a bit to make sure no response is no response
Then stuffs a hunk of garlic bread into the toaster oven
'  - Sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet to the ocean; Guster is whining for attention behind Sam
Well, get over here, then, stupid
Guster inches forward on his belly, which makes Sam smile
(') Are you afraid of heights, Guster
Sam drops to his belly and stretches out to pet Guster
(') The fall probably wouldn't kill me, anyway
Guster inches closer and licks Sam's face
George walks out with a tray filled with spaghetti, garlic bread and a Coke
Thinking of jumping
George sets the tray on the ground beside Sam
Pushing
George walks to the edge of the cliff
Only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock
The water will take you out
Let it
Swim a little North and you'll see the sand
Sam sits up and faces his father with a trace of alarm
(') First time  did it, younger than you, thought 'd break my neck and just sort of float to Catalina
(beat) You don't always get what you wish for, Sam
George suddenly leaps forward and disappears into the sea as a wave crashes against the rocks below
Oh, shit
Sam scurries to his feet and scans the ocean for his father; the only thing visible is darkness
(') Hello
Guster is lapping up the dinner, bread and all as Sam calls out again
In a bit of a panic, Sam runs from the cliff
- The traffic is heavy as Sam runs against it
Without a sidewalk and with parked cars blocking a reasonable path, this is a dangerous trek North
- Sam runs to the edge of the water and anxiously waits for his father to emerge from the sea
jogger startles Sam - he steps into a wave that soaks his shoes
George floats on a wave into view and stands in waist high water, only to be knocked way back down
He rises and falls and rises before making his way to the sand and Sam
Are you totally insane
almost saw Catalina
George coughs and drops onto the sand exhausted
Sam storms off, angry that he cared enough to get angry
'  - Sam is winded as he walks off the street to the middle of the yard
He glances around for Guster
Guster
Guster bounces out of the garage with spaghetti sauce covering his muzzle
(') You're so busted, dude
Sam sits down on the grass and plays with Guster, who yaps with joy as he breaks away and closes the distance with the abandon of a puppy
(') Where's my dinner, huh
Sam manages to pin Guster on his back
He looms over the dog as he kisses him on the nose
(') 'm hungry
Where's my dinner
Who ate my dinner
Huh
Who's in trouble now
(
) Hi
Sam rolls over Guster and stands, nearly stumbling in the process - way uncool
Hey
What are you doing here
Guster bumps against Alyssa for her attention; she kneels down to pet him
They're trying to make me spend the summer here
'm leaving in the morning
Where to
'm supposed to be in Tahoe
Your dad's really gonna build his house
don't know
Well, if you don't go,  guess 'll see you
Alyssa stands
Sam is clearly shy around her
(') You should stay
don't know
Where's your dad
He jumped into the ocean
Tell him  said "hi"
Alyssa pets Guster again before walking away
Sam is smitten
'  - Sam's curled up in a tattered lazy-boy near the toilet, watching television as George sits on the bed, brushing his teeth
Suddenly, Sam turns to face his dad
'm not taking a dump with you in here
George nods as he continues brushing
(') My brothers say it's the worst smell they've ever smelled
George nods again, which appears only to irritate Sam
(') think you have to have a door between where you cook and where you crap
Like even in the bush, tribal people and like that have a place for both
It's like a law
George walks around Sam to the sink and spits, rinses and wipes his mouth with a towel
He faces Sam
Which side of the bed do you want
Sam's jaw drops as he glances at the double-bed
(') Just kidding
The sofa's a pullout
George smiles and pats Sam on the shoulder before walking to the sofa and pulling it out to make a bed
Probably in the bible
Goodnight
George drops his pants and climbs into bed
He pulls the sheet up and fluffs the pillow before resting his head
have to take a dump
George twists around in bed to face Sam
After a beat, he tosses the sheet back, climbs out of bed, pulls back on his pants, slips on his shoes and walks out of the garage
'  - George is up on the roof, hacking through the shingles and beams with a chain saw
huge dumpster set on the lawn receives only about half the throws George makes
Sam is near the ocean in a chaise lounge, listening to music through his portable  player
Have you got sunscreen on
There's no chance he's been heard
and , two older neighbors of George's nearing home from a walk, stop on the driveway - both look pleased
It's about time this shack is torn down
Barbara appears surprised as George turns to face them - she obviously didn't realize he was the one up on the roof doing the demolition
Oh, hello George
Guess how many low-income apartments the city approved for this lot
Tom and Barbara react by trying not to react
(') Come on
ballpark figure
Tom and Barbara step back and walk away
George heads to the ladder and climbs down
Sam is grooving to the music with his eyes closed as George's hand, filled with a gob of sunscreen, plops onto Sam's stomach
Sam bolts up from the chaise lounge in a rage
What are you doing
warned you yesterday
Don't touch me
You can't touch me
(
) Hey, you stayed
Alyssa walks across her lawn to the feuding family
George holds out the bottle of sun lotion to Alyssa
Rub him down, please
George walks back to the ladder and up onto the roof as Alyssa and Sam stare at one another
He's a freak
You look better without make-up
can't even take a shower here
Come over to my house whenever you want
'll tell my mom
might not stay, anyway
'll get your back
No
That's okay
Sam reaches out for the lotion, but Alyssa hides the bottle
Have you ever had anyone but your mom or dad put it on for you
Sam thinks about it for a second before shaking his head no
(') It's weird how different it is
Lay down
George is back with the chain saw, hacking away at the roof
Sam is hesitant as he lies down on his stomach
Alyssa kneels and squeezes lotion on his back
She works it in, starting at his neck, working her way down to his pants
She squirts Sam's arm and as she rubs close to his pit, he squirms
(') Do you remember me from when you lived here
Yeah
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce
Really
wanted him to marry her
Why
Turn over
Alyssa grabs under his armpits and tickles him
Sam yelps and rises onto his elbows as Josh roars by the shack in his Porsche
(') Josh and  are going to South Coast
Wanna ride
Maybe see a movie
No thanks
Sam is disappointed as Alyssa stands to leave
Don't forget your front
Alyssa walks to the shack and waves goodbye to George
George waves her off
Sam curls onto his side as he watches Alyssa run across the lawn to Josh
She's pretty
for a girl
Sam appears irritated as he stands and walks into the garage
'  - Sam glances out the window to check on his father, then quickly rummages through every drawer and cabinet looking for what he finds: a prescription bottle
It's Vicodin
He checks on his dad through the window again, then opens the bottle and takes out five pills
He fills a glass with water and swallows two, saving three for later
He sets the bottle back where he found it before he drops on the bed with a grin
'  - Guster is in a full out run for a rubber ball
Sam is shirted, sitting at the patio table
With the ball gladly returned, Sam tosses it again
George walks out juggling two plates of sandwiches and two Cokes and sits down
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing
No
Get the inkling, Sam
'm getting tired of your attitude
Sam picks up the sandwich, examines it and sets it back down on the plate
hate turkey
No you don't
George takes a bite of his sandwich before responding
(') want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out
Why
It bugs me
You snore at night
That bugs me
Can take you out
Your brothers are right
It was the most god-awful smell 've ever had my nose around
George tightens his face and waves his hand in front of his nose
Sam stares at his father
black Range Rover pulls to a stop and Robin steps out with a pizza box in her hands
Thought you guys might be hungry
As Robin walks up the drive, Sam picks up the turkey sandwich and starts eating
George glances at Sam as Robin sets the box on the table and sits down
We're fine
Turkey sandwiches
Well, for later then
Robin focuses on the nearly roofless shack
Guster walks to the table and sits down by Robin, ready to beg
(') It makes me sad
What
used to live here
But you hated four out of the five you did
was here six years
And  only hated two
Which
The first and the last
George sets his sandwich down
don't even like turkey sandwiches
What kind of pizza
Sam's favorite
George opens the box and pulls out a slice
Sam appears disinterested as George starts in on the slice of pizza
(') (to Sam) Sure you don't want any
Sam shrugs off his mother, looking away
Robin nods and grabs a piece for herself
(') You're too thin, George
From what you used to be, anyway
George responds with a pleasant face; he's not going to explain his weight loss right now
Why the first and the last
Robin sets her slice of pizza down as she studies George
The first because  wasn't sure you really loved me
the last because wasn't sure  really loved you
George nods
Though it may appear that Sam isn't interested in the conversation, his ears are perked
was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has
That 'm happy today
What have you been before today
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves
It was simple, whatever it was
Then started thinking about the last time felt this good
(beat) It's been a long time
Do you remember
The only time  can think of for sure, was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves
George turns to Sam, who's caught staring at his father
(') You head was pressed against my chest could feel your heart racing
And remember  kissed your hair
We have it on video
Was that when
My parents were down for his sixth birthday
remember that
Robin inexplicably starts to cry
She instantly tries to take it back, pressing her hand to her mouth, wiping her eyes, but whatever emotion has her, has her good
Both George and Sam are confused and concerned
have to go
She stands and backs away from the table
What is it
'm fine
Nothing
(beat) 'll drop by your lunch tomorrow
Robin wipes her eyes again as she climbs into her car and drives off
Sam and George face one another
don't know
'm gonna take a walk
need some money
You'll have money when you work
You're so predictable
Sam sets his sandwich down and grabs a slice of pizza as he stands
He walks for a few feet, stops and turns around
(') You haven't been happy in ten years
He doesn't wait for an answer; as he walks away, Guster follows
George takes Robin's slice of pizza and drops it on the cement; that's all it takes to turn Guster around
'  - Robin is sitting alone at the table, doing nothing
The is on loud in another room
Adam walks into the room in his pajamas
He sits down across from his mother at the table
Robin smiles at him
He smiles back as he scoots his chair closer to the table and extends his arms straight out across the top
Robin extends her arms and they lock hands near the middle
Without a word, they hold hands
Adam lets go and climbs on top of the table, scoots across it with a kiss for his mother before he's gone, sliding off the table on his rear and running back to the
'  - George is on the patio, bending a thin piece of copper tubing
Sam storms out of the garage, fuming
No one would blame me if  left
'd blame you
want you here
'm not doing it
It'll be fine
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom
'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati
Sam screws his face down - huh
(') don't beg
And  don't take a shower in the middle of the yard
can promise you complete privacy
You can't promise me anything
You don't have anything to promise
You live in a garage
You don't have cable
You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer
You don't have a job
George finishes bending the copper into a circle
He stands and holds the copper circle out for proof of privacy
This will save you from prying eyes
Sam dismisses his father with a shake of his head
He heads back into the garage
'  - Sam quickly heads to where George's prescription bottle was hidden under a pile of underwear
He steals two more pills and swallows them before grabbing a towel and walking out
'  - If you had a stupid phone or  could use your truck, mom would give me some money
You'll have money when you work for it
Sam stomps down the driveway and across the grass to Alyssa's house
George walks around to the back of his garage with the rounded copper tubing
'  - Sam is standing on the porch with his towel and clean clothes
Colleen answers the door
Is Alyssa home
She's out with a friend
Oh
do you know when she'll be home
She didn't really say
Oh
okay
Sam nods and steps back as he prepares to leave
Sam
Uh huh
didn't recognize you
'm sorry
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there
Not a shower
Colleen takes Sam by the arm and nudges him into the house
'  - Sam is slowly making his way around the room, taking note of everything: some dried flowers; a yearbook; a cabinet full of 's; dirty clothes stuffed in a hamper
He walks into the bathroom before walking back out and making one more round
'   - Robin is sitting between her sons on the sofa, watching a movie
Peter enters the room, carrying his jacket
The goddamn traffic
Were we going out to dinner
Robin focuses on her husband, but the boys are riveted to the television
We've eaten
Is Lois still here
'm starved
'll make you something
Robin stands as Adam and Ryan try to hold her down
Did someone call to tell you 'd be late
Robin walks into the kitchen without responding
'  - Sam's in the shower, obscured by the sandblasted glass
(
) Bro,  need you tonight
Sam bumps an elbow against the glass as he opens the shower door enough to look out
Josh is sitting up on the marble countertop
locked the door
Josh holds up a tiny screwdriver
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes
Does Alyssa know
Nothing
You got any weed
You got the money
Sam waits a beat before closing the shower door
(') Alyssa sent me up to see if you wanted to hang around and watch a movie with her and her mom
'  - The round copper tube is braced and nailed to the side of the garage; on it hangs a shower curtain
George is making noises inside the curtain as he showers
Ah
Oh
(
) know there's an explanation
George pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see Kurt standing by in his police uniform
No hot water
George is shivering as he closes the curtain back up
Mr
Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house
Check the permits
It was built as a guesthouse
It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated
Without warning, the copper tubing holding the hanging curtain falls to the ground
George turns the water off and grabs a towel
Unfortunately, his ass is not what the towel covers
Now that should be illegal
'   - Alyssa and Colleen are curled up on the sofa as Josh and Sam stick their heads in to say goodbye
Thanks for the shower
want you both to stay
And candy too
Alyssa holds up a huge bowl of popcorn and the  case
'm gonna give him a ride in my car
'll see you tomorrow
Come over anytime you need to, Sam
Thanks, 'd like that
Thank you
The only thing keeping Sam from staying is Josh, who jerks him out by the shirt
'  - With Kurt in the only chair, George hands him a cup of coffee and sits down on the pullout sofa, which is pulled out
'm surprised he hasn't left
haven't forced him to work
only wet him down once
Why would he leave
Sam rushes in and grabs a sweater before starting out
'm leaving
Hey
hey
Sam stops at the door and waits impatiently
(') Where are you going
don't know
When are you going to be back
don't know
Well, until you know, you can't go
Oh, okay
Sam is gone in a flash
Kurt studies George for a second
'm not very good at it
Parenting
Kurt nods; agreed, he's not
'  - Robin arranges an attractive plate of food, which she sticks in the microwave
Peter walks in wearing different clothes but the same personality
hope your ex-husband is equipped for the havoc of Sam, because it seems absolutely blissful here tonight
He sits down at the table, opening up a newspaper as Robin stares at him
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you
Should
It would worry me
Peter glances up from the paper, focusing on Robin
If  let everything that should worry me, worry me, 'd be dead from worry
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you
'd be you
The answer bothers Robin enough that Peter can't concentrate back on the paper
(') 'll do it if that's what you want
Robin walks out of the kitchen
Peter folds the paper and shoves it across the granite counter
'  - Sam and Josh are parked on a street that overlooks the Valley East of Laguna Beach
They share a joint as Josh explains the specifics of the job
You don't have to do a thing
Just get in and get out
As quick as you can
Close your eyes and think of whatever
Sam hands the joint to Josh
What's your deal with Alyssa
Don't even
'm there
wasn't sure
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen
mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing
She like figures things out on her own and then that's it
black Mercedes Benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street
Josh hands Sam a cell phone
(') If this rings, run
Sam is scared and it shows
(') He already knows everything about what he can't do
You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want
'm thinking it's too weird now
Josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for Sam, who takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket
It beats working
Josh hands Sam the joint
(') Inhale and get out
Sam is quick to inhale, but slow to get out
Josh takes the joint and Sam steps out
He walks slowly to the Mercedes, opens the door and climbs in
Josh turns the  on to Guster's "
"  Sam closes the door to the Mercedes
'He said to only look up, he said to never look down, down is where we came from
' It's an odd song sung in a happy tempo; a whistling refrain overtakes the lyrics as Josh inhales
'He said to hope for the best and take a load off my chest
Soon,  could be happy, and go all the way up to heaven and go all the way back home
' With the music loud, Josh misses the police car as it stops behind him without the lights
Too late for a getaway, he fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open window
The  approaches the Porsche with his hand on his gun
What did you toss into the brush
Josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the officer with a guilty face
Nothing
'He said  might need his help, no one gets high on themselves
just seem so lonely; he's just trying to be nice and spread around his advice
could be happy
' Turn off the music
As the music stops, the door to the Mercedes opens and Sam hops out with his pants around his ankles
The officer notices and walks towards the Mercedes
The parking lights flash red as the car starts and flees the scene
Sam yanks up his pants and leaps down the hillside, falling and rolling in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop
Josh starts his car, but the officer dissuades him from leaving by removing his gun
Josh turns off the engine
Oh, it's working now
What did you toss into the brush
Before Josh can feign innocence again, the brush starts to smolder
Busted
- Sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way down the steep hillside holding up his pants
After he's sure he's safe, he sits down and rests his head in his hands
He starts to shake, frightened by his actions
He drops onto his back, buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry
Slowly, he stops crying, but keeps staring up at the sky, which is loaded with stars and a full moon
Mesmerized by the brilliant night, Sam can't stop staring
'  - George is removing the last of the windows, carefully prying it out of the casement as Robin pulls up in her Range Rover
She steps out dressed in Levi's, boots and a t-shirt, carrying a large bag
Lunch
She smiles and walks toward George, dropping the food sack on the patio table
It's not breakfast yet
dreamed about your house last night
Finished or unfinished
It was perfect, George
Amazing
It was so real
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though
That wasn't a dream
That was Sam
Oh
with his ear infection
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him
George isn't quite sure how to take her comment
Finally, he points to the Garage
Go in there and lick his attitude
The antibiotics weren't working
(beat) It's what  believe, George
George stares at Robin for a second before he nods
You were wrong about the first year, you know
It takes Robin a second to understand he's saying he loved her when they married
've been wrong a lot in my life
Hindsight
It's like foresight without a future
Robin almost smiles; George confessing love ten years dead
have three hours before  pick up Adam and Ryan
(beat) Where will  be most useful
Robin glances around, assessing the best use of her time
With your hands or your tongue
You're not well
Robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in the garbage bin
George nods
he's not
Robin and George carry a twelve-foot beam from inside the shack and set it down on cinder blocks
Both look exhausted as they head back in for another beam
Sam saunters out of the garage in shorts, sits down on the patio chair and opens the sack his mother had packed for lunch
He pulls out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as George and Robin emerge from the shack with another beam
Good morning
Robin and George set the beam down and turn to Sam as they both wipe sweat off their faces
Sam chews his sandwich, ignoring them both
'm late
Robin walks close to Sam, trying to capture his attention
(') Ryan has a game later
He asked if you'd come and watch
Sam glances up at his mother, just long enough to let her know he hates her, then drops the sandwich and walks back into the garage
city inspector's car pulls to a stop on the street and   steps out with a clipboard
Robin passes him as she walks back to her Range Rover
Mr
Stevens
've been dreading you
Bob and George shake hands as Robin drives off
Bob Larson
Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen
violation
Oh, yes
And if  enclosed it
An exhaust system or a window is code
sink
Allowed outside the enclosed area
Sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt
Where is it
friend of yours is here
Did you got through my pants
might have a solution
George grabs his chain saw and walks to the garage with Sam and Bob in tow
Where'd you put it
- George walks to an armoire and empties it
He grabs a hammer and bangs, pries and pulls the back off, then dumps the cabinet onto the floor
know you took it
want it now
George yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval cut a few feet deep on the cabinet base
He kills the saw, lifts the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet
Doors
Bob grimaces as George opens the armoire, revealing the toilet inside
hate to ask about a window
(to Sam) flushed it down the toilet
No
Oh my God
George jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small opening above the toilet, ripping through the studs, wire mesh, tar paper and stucco - fine dust invades the space like a storm
Bob coughs as he writes in his book
George kills the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work
(') If  had a gun, 'd kill you
Bob seems fairly anxious to conclude his business
assume you'll fill the
uh, window, with glass
If that's what it takes
What's in my pants is none of your fucking business
(a little rattled) would say you're in compliance
hope that makes the pain in the ass that called you happy
George is staring at Sam
Bob backs out of the garage
You and me both
With Bob gone, George walks to Sam and gets in his face
Everything about you is my business
What you smoke, what you swallow, what you sniff, it's all my business
Sam slams his fists against his own chest, maddened
've been using since  was twelve
You're all so unbelievably stupid
You didn't give a shit about anything  did until now
'll apologize for everything but today
Today  give a shit
You're too fucking late
The gloves on the table are for you
You can't make me do a thing
Sit down for a second
No
George gently guides Sam back onto the bed
Sam hops up mad
(') 'll call the cops if you touch me again
George sets Sam back onto the bed, not so gently this time
Sam is less eager to hop up in defiance
(') Oh, so you're in the big shit now
Child abuse
People go to prison for what you just did to me
My dad used to play a game
never really understood what it was until after he was gone
Sam appears immensely disinterested
was holding for someone
That wasn't even mine
The game was to make me smaller than he was
No matter what
He could be almost invisible as a human being, but  had to be smaller
So if  got good grades, was a pussy for not playing football
If cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough
If  shaved it,  looked like a psycho
never won the game
Not once
And if he couldn't make me smaller with words
Tears well in George's eyes
Sam is caught up enough in what his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of interest
'll have to pay him back
won't ever hit you
(beat) don't want you smaller
want you to be happy
You're not
Not here with me
Not home with your mother
Not up in Tahoe
Not alone
Not anywhere
(beat) You're what  was most of my life, Sam
see it in your eyes
In your sleep
In your answer to everything
You're barely alive
'm not even listening
You know that great thing, though
Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one
It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is
(beat) Or it can just blow you away
Make you something different in an instant
It happened to me
George walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes
He stops and turns back around to face Sam
(') Build this house with me
George walks out leaving Sam on the bed to think
'   - George gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them into the dumpster
He works while Guster sleeps
The sun is fierce, low on the horizon with a heat that distorts the distance
George is sweating and shirtless as Sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands staring at his father
After a beat, George notices him
have to pay back what you flushed down the toilet
(beat) want ten dollars an hour
then 'm done
George nods
He points out the roofless shell of a shack
It all has to come down before we can start again
(beat) Knock it down
George picks up a sledghammer and hands it to Sam
Sam hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort, slams it on a sideboard
He slams again and again as George picks up a slightly smaller sledgehammer
(') hated this house from the second my father cheated everyone and put it in my name
George takes a good hard whack at the wall, knocking a huge hunk of it down
Sam stops to watch
(') Twenty years of hating what you live in
what you are
This is the end of it, Sam
'm gonna build something of me here that  can be proud to give to you
Don't
don't want it
George  as he lands the hammer into the wall again
Sam is alarmed by his father's blatant rage
Do whatever you want with it
don't care
All  want from you is for you to remember we built this house together
We haven't build shit
You're just tearing down your father
Try it
It feels good
George strikes another blow to the house joined with a Sam starts low, a whisper of a scream, but quickly builds, soon rivaling George in volume as he pounds away
This soul letting, cleansing ritual is both impelling and frightening to watch
Tom and Barbara, Colleen and her maid step out of their houses, drawn and perplexed by the guttural noise
'  - Both boys are asleep as Robin enters and wakes them with the drop-and-bounce-back-to-your-feet-from-the-mattress method
It's morning, sleepyheads
They both wake with a groan
Robin leaps onto Adam and tickles him to life
'  - Robin is quickly finishing a breakfast of oatmeal and fresh fruit with Adam and Ryan, who are still dressed in pajamas
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early
just thought it would be nice
Are you going to see Sam again
thought  might stop by
All day again
Not all day
'll be home after lunch
Robin stands and dumps her dishes in the sink
(') You can go back to bed
or Lois might let you go swimming
wanna be with you today
Oh, honey
There's not much to do there
mean, it's all work
We can work
Robin focuses on her sons, both of whom seem willing to work
Ryan, would you rather swim or work
Can we really help build a house
Peter walks in, surprised by everyone being up
Why is everyone up so early
'  - George is knocking away the forms used to pour the foundation
Sam walks out of the garage with a towel; he shields his eyes from the morning sun as he watches his father work
Without make-up or a nose ring and with the black dye gone from his hair and the polish from his nails, Sam is a handsome kid
George looks happy, laying bare the foundation that will hold his home
Sam walks to Alyssa's house, unseen by his father
'  - Colleen is walking with Sam toward the stairs
If she's not up, you can use my shower
Thank you
You're here early today
We're getting out of the ground today
Sam looks fairly excited as he rushes up the stairs
'  - Sam stops at the door and
(
) Huh
can use your mom's
(
) 'm okay
'  - Alyssa is curled up in bed, cuddling a stuffed bear as Sam walks in and closes the bedroom door behind him
Were you with Josh when the cops arrested him
Alyssa sits up in bed, holding the sheet to her chest
(nervously) Not really
No
Kinda
He got busted
His parents took his car
They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer
Sam can't help but like that
Really
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it
Sam breaks into a full-on smile
This is serious
don't have my license
He was my ride
'm sorry
'm just here to shower
Sam walks into the bathroom; before he closes the door, he faces Alyssa with another smile - she tosses her bear at him
'  - George is prying off the last of the boards when he's hit with a pain that takes him to his knees
He drops the crowbar and sits down in the dirt as Guster walks over to comfort him
George takes deep breaths and closes his eyes as he tries to gain control over the pain
'  - The doorknob jiggles, jiggles and turns; Alyssa opens the door and walks in dressed in a t-shirt and panties
Once again Sam jumps and jams his elbow to the frosted glass as he partially opens the shower door
Is this like a past time with people
Go away
Alyssa sets a tiny screwdriver on the vanity
've seen lots of people
It's not a big thing for me
Hand me a towel
'm getting out
'm coming in
don't want you to
We're not gonna do anything
Why are you so stupid
Why are you so uptight
don't even
what do you mean
don't even know what that means
It means 'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way
Hand me a towel
Hand me a towel
Sam is anxious
Alyssa takes off her t-shirt and pulls down her panties before grabbing a towel; she hands it to Sam as she forces her way into the shower
Barely visible through the frosted glass, Alyssa wets her hair as Sam stares in her direction
The towel drops to the tiled floor
'  - George is curled up in bed, the prescription bottle and a glass resting on a table
He's holding onto his side, still in some pain
gets Guster  outside
'  - Ryan and Adam run to Guster with glee as Robin steps out of the Range Rover with a large covered basket and a boom box
She sets the basket and radio on the patio table and searches for George, ending up at the entrance to the garage
'  - George has hidden the prescription bottle and is sitting on the bed as Robin walks in
thought you'd be up with the sun
My stupid back
Robin sits down on the bed next to George, concerned
Do you need anything
'll go to the pharmacy
have some Demerol at home
No, 'm
thanks
took something
Robin runs her hand down George's spine
Where's Sam
He won't use my shower
don't get it
Outside, Adam and Ryan are each calling Guster
(') You brought your kids
kind of said that maybe they could do something
Help
'm sorry
They really wanted to come
really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me don't think they'll be too much trouble
'll find something that won't kill them
Or wound
Let them keep their eyes and fingers
You're a good mother
Robin smiles
With some effort, George stands
Do you need help
think so
Robin stands and wraps her arm around his waist and he drapes his arms over her shoulder as they walk out of the garage
woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep
Everyday think  see more of Sam than 've seen in years
(
) Sam
'  - Adam runs with abandon to Sam and Alyssa as Robin helps George to a patio chair
Hey
Adam runs into Sam with a hug, then steps back
(') What's that for
Mom said  should
Oh
would have anyway
Sam appears awkward as he rests his hand for a second on Adam's shoulder
(') Who are you
Who are you
'm his brother
'm his friend
Adam views her suspiciously as they walk across Alyssa's grass to the patio
Mom says we can build a house
Hi, Mr
Nelson
Hi, Alyssa
Hi, Mom
Good morning
It's clear that Robin is falling in love with her son again
Hello
Alyssa extends her hand to Robin and they shake
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower
He's got a standing invitation
Sam instantly flushes red
Hey, Ryan
Sam walks to Ryan, who's been standing back from the group
Hey
Sam drapes his arm over Ryan's shoulder and together they walk to the foundation
So, you wanna build a house
If we do, will it stay up
182   from the boom box on the patio table
Ryan and Adam slather paint remover on five old painted doors
They work with gloves and brushes and appear meticulous in their application
Alyssa and Sam nail and bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as Robin and George work on the stick framed door deck
While George is moving a little slower than usual, it appears that the pain is nearly gone
As the song ends, Robin rushes toward the radio
brought a few of my own
Someone stop her
Robin runs to her car and retrieves a few 's
She slips the  in and we  John Hiat's "
"  It's a slow, soft song that brings a smile to George's face
It's been a while
This was my very first slow dance
Did you know him before you knew Dad
Since seventh grade
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you
smiled at him
Watch out for the smile, boys
Robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles
George grins
The boys aren't sure what to make of the advice
'You are the beautiful love (my lover),  am the distant shore (so far away)
There is so much to uncover (love's hiding)
What is this distance for
What is it for
Who's up for a dance
Robin glances around for any takers, finally focusing on George
(
) Just don't hug me too tight
Adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance
Sam sits down to watch
George wears a smile that wipes the last of the pain from his face
(') That's all you get
'm busy today
Adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush
Robin stops dancing as she focuses on George
Let's see if you've gotten any better
Oh, 'm worse
Much, much worse
Robin waits to see how worse
George finally walks to her and takes her in his arms
He must have been better than this
The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding tighter
"We fill the air with silent stares
But still, no one there, we are strangers
"  Alyssa decides it's time to go
'll see you tomorrow
Sam watches Alyssa walk away, but he's quickly drawn back to his mother and father dancing
Ryan appears anxious, unsure of the music and George
When did you fall in love with my dad
The dance stops
George lets go of Robin as she focuses on Ryan
When  found out  was pregnant with you
'  - Sam is on the pull out bed, listening to music through head phones
We  a flush, the armoire doors open and George walks out of the cabinet, washes his hands, turns off the light and drops into bed
nightlight stuck in a socket above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room
Sam takes the headphones off
After a long silence: took some of your Vicodin
know
(beat) Why
like how it feels not to feel
George turns onto his side to face his son
know the feeling
How do you become something you're not
What would you like to be
What 'm not
What are you now
Nothing
That's not true
See, that's the thing
am what  say am
know parts of who you are
What do you know about me
George drops back onto his back
He takes his time to answer
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment
But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting
He's got nothing to do with me
couldn't imagine how  could compete with him for any part of you
So, didn't
He wanted you to have his last name
let him even take that
He was a prick when  was six, and he's a prick today
George turns onto his side to face Sam again
wish you had told me then
'm telling you now
gave up on you
'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up
What would you be doing now
Getting high,  guess
If  asked you to stop, would you
haven't used anything for two days
'm trying
'm proud of you, Sam
Don't be
And hide whatever that new drug is you have
like it
Sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on
The music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble
put a gun to my father's head once
George's voice is soft - there's no chance Sam can hear
(') Have you ever thought like that
've been thinking
watching you work
How much do you hate me
(beat) He was passed out
Just screaming at my mother before
About nothing
Under-cooked meat went back to my room
put the barrel close to his ear and chickened out again
Not my dad
Hid in my room
Not even me
(beat) Of course it was a  gun
But it still would have hurt like hell
Sam notices his father's mouth moving and takes off the headphones
Are you talking
was just thinking about my mom
She wouldn't leave him
remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses mean it was dark outside and in
But we never talked about it
Sun glasses
To hide a black eye
Why wouldn't she leave
think she was terrified of living with him
but maybe even more terrified of life without him
would have killed him
Everything would have been better if you had
You'd have liked your grandmother
And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother
remember reading about her in the paper
They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead
still feel guilty about that
Do you ever wish you had done it
George thinks about that for a second
loved him too much
After everything he did to you and your mom
After everything
That's so weird
Sam slips his headphones back on
George nods
it is
'  - Guster is squatting on the lush lawn of the mansion taking a dump
David bursts out from his house, rushes to his black Mercedes and tries once again to run over Guster
No such luck
Guster moves on to another lawn as Mr
Dokos drops over the curb and drives off down the street
'   - In the late June afternoon, with a clotted cloud sky, Robin, Adam, Ryan, Sam, Alyssa and George work at building a house
Adam and Ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped days earlier
George and Sam carry large wood beam to the foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post
Robin grabs a drill and screws the cast-in tie down to the wood beam
Alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks across the grass with a huge basket of food
Is anyone hungry
With  playing in the background, everyone is packed around the patio table eating pasta and drinking lemonade
like the color 'm making the doors
The absolute best color 've ever seen in my life
Adam lights up, pleased to be praised
How many bedrooms will your house have
Three
Will Sam live with you or us
With you
It's a quick response that draws Robin's attention
Sam lightly bops Adam on the head
So put your plans of my room in the trash
don't think Dad wants you home
Adam, that's not true
Yes, it is
Would you stop being ridiculous
Your father wants Sam home as much as  do
Sam starts laughing
George smiles
Sam can't stop laughing
(') It wasn't meant to be
Sam and George stand at exactly the same time and walk back to the house
Without a word, they work together as they continue to frame the house
Suddenly George turns back to the pack of people at the table and loudly proclaims: love you
That's it
He goes back to work as Sam glances at him, amused
Adam and Ryan are surprised and it shows on their faces
Robin smiles
'  - Robin's in bed reading as Peter emerges from the bathroom in pajama bottoms
You know what 've decided
Robin glances up from her book to Peter's hairy chest
To shave your chest
We should take a vacation
Peter grabs his pajama top and slips it on as he climbs into bed
Robin sets her book down
The biggest waste of time since television
Do you remember anything 've said that wasn't negative
Robin takes long enough to think that Peter forges on
(') Just the two of us
It takes Robin a few seconds to answer
'd love to drive through New England in the Fall
Sooner than the Fall
He closes in on her, kisses her cheek
After the kids are back in school
Lois will stay with them
Or we can pawn them off on your parents
Out of reasonable excuses, Robin opts for the truth
'm helping George build his house
What
've been helping for the last few days
Weeks
Sam's working
told you Sam was working
mean, he really is
Good
That was the plan
We couldn't stand him and George needed help
As true as it is, this still irritates Robin
can't go right now
You can't go because of Sam
We haven't been away together for three years
What difference does a few months make
You can't go with me because of Sam
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life
Once in a while he even talks to me
want to be around for that
So am , Robin
'm working at something, too
'm even talking
Do you want to be around for it
Peter is intense, close up, not giving her breathing room
don't know
Robin whispers her answer
Peter pulls away and settles down on his back
Robin doesn't move for the longest time
Finally, she eases onto her back and turns out the light
was talking about our marriage
know
Silence finishes the conversation
'  - With an extended plate and overhung rafters, the frame takes its form; rooms are roughed in; windows are framed; two gable dormers distinguish the common-rafter roof in the front and a frame for a balcony juts out over the ocean in back
Robin and Adam are locking in and hoisting the sheets of plywood on a pulley system up to Ryan and George, who are stripped down to shorts - George is thinner than ever
'  - Sam is showering as Alyssa walks in from the bedroom and joins him; no protest is voiced this time around
- Alyssa smiles at Sam as she grabs a wash cloth and slathers it with liquid soap
What's the point of this
Does everything have to have a point
It's freakish
don't get it
'm not really supposed to touch you, but  can look
Alyssa faces Sam as she washes her body with the cloth
Are you sure you're totally into guys
What are you talking about
Josh said
'm not gay
Sam glances down at himself; Alyssa looks too
(') mean, hello
They both look up
was wondering
You're driving me crazy
Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire
Not really
You're off, you know
You're way, way off
thought  was helping you
It would help me if  could kiss you
No,  don't
thought we were just friends
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality
mean,  hope 'm not the first to say that about you
Okay, but then we'll just be friends
Okay
Okay
guess
Sam stands still, unsure of his next move
Have you ever even kissed a girl
Sam appears shocked she would even ask; he hasn't, but she's not supposed to know that
Alyssa makes the move, closes the distance and kisses him
Apart, it appears to be something they enjoyed
Sam wraps his arms around her, presses himself against her and kisses her again
After a few seconds of making out, Sam jerks once, then again as he backs away
Alyssa grimaces as she glances down
(') Oh, yuck
Alyssa steps into a corner of the shower as Sam turns around and rests his forehead on the tile
(') You're scrubbing the shower down
'   - George and Sam are on ladders, reinforcing a window opening on the second floor with a 2x4 spline
Ryan and Adam are flat on their backs on the grass with Guster between them, dog-tired
Robin is at the grill with hamburgers as Alyssa prepares the table for dinner
You must have a really great husband
Robin glances up at Alyssa
Why is that
Just,  mean, well, you're here every single day
He's at work while 'm here
guess 'd just be jealous if  were him
Well, he doesn't need to worry
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, 'd worry
He's not the type to worry
Robin is slightly pissed at Alyssa grilling her; she flips the hamburgers and calls out: (') Let's eat
'   - Music is playing softly in the background
Peter is sitting alone in a chair with a drink in hand
After a bit, Lois walks in holding a can of Pledge and a rag
'd be glad to fix you something
No, 'm fine
Lois nods and walks away
For all the presence of the room, Peter looks small and frayed in it - lost in his own house
'   - Lunch is over
Adam is wrestling with Guster on the lawn
Robin is taking money from her purse as George hands Sam the keys to his truck
Nothing , okay
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy
And video games after
Home after
(to Sam) Will you come in and say "hi"
Sam shrugs, takes the money and keys as Ryan and Adam rush close to him
Do we have to take her
The three boys turn to watch as Alyssa, now dressed in a dress, walks across the lawn to join them
Definitely
It's literally frightening how beautiful Alyssa can look; with her tan and white dress, Sam shutters
- Josh is peddling down the highway on his bike, sweating in the full afternoon sun
'  - George is hewing a beam as Robin watches from a chair
should go
George stops and wipes the sweat from his forehead
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday
No
Why
like to be with Sam
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore
(beat) 'd hate to have them bored
Robin stands and walks to George
know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George
How much time do they get to spend with their dad
What is it with this
They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here
He has no time
Robin walks away, then back - she's frustrated
(') Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us
She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing
What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there
He's not there
And when he is, he isn't
(beat) So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George
'll stop coming
But it won't be because of Peter
It'll be because you asked me to stop
Say what you need to say, because 'm not leaving until hear it
'd rather you not be here
In the distance, on the street, Josh peddles past on his bike
thought we were helping
can hire workers to help me
Robin nods, gathers her things, walks to her car, climbs in and drives off
'  - Colleen is standing in the entry, talking to Josh
You can come in and wait if you'd like
What friends did she go with
'  - Robin pulls right back to where she was parked and parks again
She steps out of the car talking
Nothing is going on with us, is it
Going on
When  picked you up from the train station
what you said
What did  say
That thing about  was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known
What was that
That was the truth
You've never said that before
'll say a lot of things 've never said before
It's habit
It sounded like a pick-up line
can't pick you up
Robin sits down, weighted by the reason
'm married
You bit my finger
If  weren't married
George wants to answer quickly, dismiss the impossible and move on, but emotion catches him off-guard
He forces a smile
Let's not do this, okay
need to know
You need to know what
Do  still love you
Robin is surprised by the question
She nods her head
(') Absolutely
There's not a doubt in my mind that through all my anger
my ego, was faithful in my love for you
From seventh grade on
Robin raises her eyebrows - what a revelation
(') That  made you doubt it, that  withheld it
that's the greatest mistake of a life full of mistakes
(beat) But the truth doesn't set us free, Robin
can say it as many times as you can stand to hear it
And all that does, the only thing, is remind us that love isn't enough
Not even close
Tears well in Robin's eyes as she stands
should go
George nods - she should
Robin walks to her car, opens the door; she faces George before climbing in
George walks into the garage
'  - George rummages through his sock drawer
Pulls out a folded sock and opens it - the prescription bottle drops to the floor
He fills a glass and swallows three pills
'  - Robin opens the door and heads straight for the kitchen
(
) All  am is what  have
Robin jumps and searches for the voice
Peter's sitting alone in the living room
(') That sounds pathetic, doesn't it
What are you doing home
always felt  could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me
Robin takes a few steps into the room
You never really trusted me
You live a fabulous life, Robin
Despite you
never asked for more
That's the problem
Please don't leave me
Peter stands and walks to her
Robin doesn't respond
(') Where are the kids
Sam took them to a movie
'll be in the bedroom
Peter takes her hand and kisses her cheek before walking down the hall
Robin stands still, trying to assess the exchange
- In a bedroom we don't quite recognize, two people are in the throes of making love under a silk white sheet
(
) Oh God
It's hard to tell whose voice that is - Robin's
'  - George is in bed, awakened by a
fell asleep
Alyssa walks in, closing the door behind her
Sam's dropping Adam and Ryan off
George is slightly out of it with oral morphine; he tires to sit up, but settles for propping up his head
Can you keep Sam straight
He's not gay
found out purely by accident, believe me
mean drugs
(catching up) thought you said he was
He wouldn't use around me
don't like any of it
You're a good girl
need to ask you something, Mr
Nelson
Alyssa walks over and lies on the bed beside George
You have to ask like that
want you to try something with me, okay
've taken a lot of morphine
Oral morphine
for my back
Can  wait till can say no and sound convincing
Alyssa leans forward and kisses him; it's a real kiss that lasts a lot longer than it should
And when it's over: Did you feel anything
Maybe your tongue
don't know, my mouth is numb
Why did you do that
They both stare up at the ceiling
When you dated my mom,  saw you kiss her once
You looked like such a good kisser
- It's the couple making love again; this time we're close enough to make out Colleen's face underneath Josh, who is working with speed, if not exact precision
(
) My mother would die
(
) Let's shut up and not kill her
Oh my God
'  - Peter has changed and is on the bed; his head propped up by pillows; he stairs blankly at the door
'   - Robin is sitting alone in the living room, in the same spot Peter had been sitting earlier
'  - Alyssa and George are still beside each other in bed
It's not what  was expecting
What did you think it would be
don't know
(realizing) More like when  kissed Sam
Alyssa sits up in bed
(') More like that
She stands and grabs his big toe
(') Thanks for your time
Alyssa waves goodbye and leaves
George is confused by it all
'  - Josh looks as though he's been struck by a hammer as he lay on his back with his mouth slack
Under the sheet, low down, Colleen is swallowing her pride and showing off her technique
sudden blaring noise,  , pierces Josh's throaty groan
Colleen jumps off the bed, the sheet still haunting her head
Oh my God
Get dressed
Get dressed
'  - Alyssa closes the French door she entered through and rushes to the alarm panel as the siren blares
'  - Colleen and Josh are frantically pulling on clothes as the noise throws them off balance
'  - With the  , Alyssa walks to the entry
Mom
'  - Josh has pulled on his underwear backwards; only speed counts
'  - Alyssa glances around before heading up the stairs
Hello
'  - Without a knock, Alyssa opens the door
The room is empty, but the bed is messed
Mom
(
) Here, honey
Alyssa walks to the master bath, following the voice
'  - Colleen is standing above Josh, who is bent over on his knees, with a plunger in the bath
completely forgot
'm so sorry, Josh
(beat) What are you doing
Josh's face is flushed red and beaded with sweat
put him to work
What's wrong
It takes a second for Colleen to realize that Alyssa is talking about the plumbing
couldn't get it to go down
And why was the alarm on
Oh
set it to see if it would work
You'd better call and cancel
Oh God, we don't want the police
Colleen is anxious as she rushes out
Josh stands and wipes the sweat from his forehead
What's going on
Josh fumbles and fidgets, finally finding a way out
What's the deal with you and Sam
'  - Robin is fixing dinner as we hear the front door open
Adam is talking as he rushes into the kitchen
got to play one video game for three hours straight
Ryan enters right behind him
Wouldn't you move to another one if the one you were playing made you look stupid
Robin checks the entry to the kitchen - no Sam
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up
Huh, Mom
guess it depends on what you give up on
Robin's face lights up as Sam walks into the kitchen
There were no 's
So  just gave them money to play games
Can you stay for dinner
Depends on what 'd give up on
Robin opens the oven and shows Sam a platter of lasagna
(') It looks like a trap
Robin turns to Adam, excited at having Sam stay for dinner
Go tell your father we're eating
Dad's home, already
In the bedroom
Adam takes off in a run as Sam walks to the sink and washes his hands before grabbing a stack of plates for dinner
He arranges the five on the table and then heads back for utensils as Adam runs back in
He's not there
He's here
Check the bathroom
checked everywhere
He's not there
'  - Guster's at the door, whining
George and Sam are asleep
'  - Colleen is sitting alone at the kitchen table, drinking coffee as Alyssa walks in
What are you doing up so early
couldn't sleep last night
'm supposed to be mad at you, but 'm not
Colleen is trembling as Alyssa pours herself a big bowl of Lucky Charms
Why
What do you mean
Uh
using Josh like that
Alyssa eats her cereal as Colleen bursts into a confession
will never forgive myself
Never, Alyssa
know  took advantage
It's inexcusable
Oh, God
should have my head examined
Alyssa looks confused as she swallows her Lucky Charms
He said you asked him to tighten your toilet seat, too
That's so uncool
Colleen quickly nods
won't do it again
swear
Alyssa keeps an eye on her mother as she continues on with her cereal
- Guster is taking a dump on the immaculate lawn
David Dokos rushes from the house dressed in a suit and picks up the shit with a gloved hand and heaves it at Guster as the dog trots back to safety
Tom and Barbara, the old early walkers of the street, stop and watch as David picks up more crap and tosses it onto George's driveway
He notices Tom and Barbara
Mind your own fucking business
Tom and Barbara stay silent as David Dokos walks back into his house and slams the front door shut
- Josh is in eleventh gear on his ten speed peddling like a demon for the Beck's house
'  - Robin pulls to a stop and Ryan and Adam run from the Range Rover to Sam and Alyssa, who are helping an () install the outside boxes and sockets
Dad's disappeared
He was there and then he wasn't
Sam faces his mother as she walks toward the house
He hasn't called
Who are you
Robin shakes her head "no" to Sam
Dale turns to face Adam
'm the electrician
'm the builder
Sam turns back to finish what he was working on as Alyssa grabs Adam with a hug
'  - George is swallowing two pills as Robin knocks on the half open door, opening it all the way in the process
Is your back still killing you
didn't think you'd come today
kept thinking about it, what you said
hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me
No
Mostly me
Peter left me yesterday
Left you
No goodbye
No fuck you
No 'Are you in love with George
' What did he say
''ll be in the bedroom
' Robin walks to George and holds on to his shirt
(') couldn't walk in there
(beat) So he left
She rests the side of her head against his chest
He kisses her hair
Outside, a hammer beats a reminder that they're not alone
The ocean drowns the sound long enough for Robin to kiss George's chin; and in that instant, the instant where everything but the touch washes away, George kisses Robin with such punch that it knocks them onto the bed
They continue to forget everything as they roll with the punch
(
) Dad, Dale needs to know
Sam stops at the jamb of the open door as his mother and father scramble to their feet from the bed
had a kink in my
As George falters, Robin feels compelled to complete the lie
Back
Neck
Back
What
The door was open
(a quick confession) don't know what 'm doing
wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it
It won't happen again
George and Robin are flustered, embarrassed by being caught, something Sam clearly relishes
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside
Absolutely
(beat) Have him put it on a separate line
At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses
Sam laughs, grabs the door and closes it on his parents
Robin slumps, truly embarrassed
could die
So could
George touches Robin's chin, draws her head up
He stares at her, afraid to say what he needs to say
Are you going to kiss me
It's not my back that's killing me
Robin furrows her brow, not understanding
George surrounds her head with his hands and kisses her forehead
'  - Adam and Ryan are helping Dale run the electrical lines; Alyssa and Sam drill screws into the second story floorboards
is playing loud on the radio
Josh stops peddling quite a distance from George's house and gets off to search for Alyssa
Only seeing Adam, Ryan and Dale, Josh pulls out his cell and dials
'  - Frustrated and anxious, Colleen slips off the dress she's wearing and tries another one as the phone
'  - Josh is standing behind a tree, talking on his cell phone as he stares at George's house
don't see her
(beat) Please just open the door when  knock
He slips the phone back in his pocket, hops back on the bike and makes a beeline toward Colleen's house
(
) Josh
Busted, Josh has no choice but to join Alyssa
was hoping
you could
you know
Go for a ride
Alyssa and Sam are leaning out the framed second story window
On the handlebars or your shoulders
Are you afraid of heights
Sam walks away from the window and goes back to work
Not really
Can you help us out
My parents cut my allowance off
Without a car, 'm totally screwed
George is paying Sam ten dollars an hour
Sam sticks his head back out the window
Hey,  can get you three hundred cash for two hours
What
Josh is fuming as he stares at Sam
It's just a joke
stupid joke
could use the money
Sam turns away from Josh
George walks out the garage as he wipes his eyes
Hey, George
recruited some help for the roof
George walks to Josh and extends his hand
George Nelson
Josh
Adam races to George with a hug - something unexpected
Adam rushes back to work as George breaks into a smile
Alyssa rushes down the stairs and straight into George's arms
Me too
George is still smiling as he tucks a strand of Alyssa's hair behind her ear
Ryan sort of saunters over to George with his hands sunk deep in his pockets
Without asking, George wraps his arms around Ryan with a hug
Afterward: just wanted to know where Mom was
Oh
Sorry
It's okay
She needs to be alone,  think
Because Dad left
She's a little sad, is all
don't even care if he ever comes back
Ryan walks back to Adam, who's been standing still, listening
Josh, you look like you could use a hug
No
'm okay
'm okay
George is too quick with his hug
Josh is stiff as a board
Sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story window and resumes screwing the floorboards
George sets his eyes on Dale as he opens his arms wide
Don't even think about it
George walks toward Dale with his arms still extended
Well, they got me started
swear to God, 'll use these wires and shock you so bad your tongue will turn black
Adam and Ryan are excited as George closes the distance
Finally, Dale drops the harmless wire and takes off in a run
'  - Colleen is pacing the kitchen in a silky dress we haven't seen before
Finally, she grabs the phone
'  - George is propped up on the chaise lounge next to the patio table where everyone has dropped their crap
Sam and Josh are sheeting the roof with tarpaper
Robin is still in the garage
One of two cell phones on the table begins to
Would you get it for me
Dale is in the middle of wiring a box
(
) Just let mine ring
guess
don't know
George picks up the offender, unsure whose phone it is
(') (into phone) Hello
'  - (into phone) Where are you
You're driving me crazy, waiting like this
want you in me now
'  - George nearly drops the phone; he sits up straight
(into phone) Colleen
'  - Colleen sits down, panicked
(into phone) George
'  - George holds the phone out and examines it for a second
(
) Is it mine
God,  hope not
(
) That's not mine
(
) Oh, shit
Josh trips, slips and slides off the roof to the ground below as Alyssa lets out a loud
'  - Colleen tosses the receiver as though it were a ball on fire
'  - Everyone, including Robin, is circled around Josh, who is sprawled on the ground
'm okay
'm fine
Maybe 'll go home
Is that bone sticking out
Don't move
'm an idiot to have you up there
No
It's my fault
An ambulance is  approaching
Colleen runs from her house - she's now dressed more appropriately in Levi's and a blouse
heard a scream
If  could just stand up
Josh fell
Colleen stops a few feet short and covers her mouth with a trembling hand
think he might have broken a leg
The ambulance silences the siren as it turns onto the cul-de sac and stops in front of George's house
'  - Robin, George and Sam are sitting at the patio table as Ryan and Adam play catch with Guster
Two ribs, a finger, a leg, a bruised kidney and a mild concussion aren't bad considering he landed on brick
Neither Robin nor Sam attempts a response
Finally: better get the kids home
Not a perfect day
Robin stands
George stands because Robin's standing
Without warning, Robin begins to cry again
Ryan and Adam stop playing ball
Sam studies her before finally lowering his eyes
With her kids looking on, George stands still, hesitant to comfort her
There's a moment where all that there is, where the only thing seen or heard is Robin's pain
After an awkward amount of time, she wipes her eyes, wipes her nose, crosses around the table to Sam and kisses the top of his head, then his cheek
Without a word, she walks to her car and climbs in; Ryan and Adam quickly join her in the car
'  - George is brushing his teeth, dribbling and foaming over the only sink in the garage
Sam is propped up in bed with Guster, dressed on top of the sheets, fingering through a stack of 's
He glances over at his father twice before speaking
You look like shit, lately
George spits and rinses, facing Sam as he wipes his mouth
You look better than ever
don't think Mom cares that much that my
that Peter left
She seemed upset
What's wrong with your back
Sam tries to look slightly less interested than he is by continuing to flip through the 's
George sits down
(') mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what
Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain
And you're going through them quick
Are you taking them still
No, but  count them
In a sock isn't new, you know
This is not easy for George; he fumbles a bit before answering
'm having a problem with cancer
Sam stops flipping though the 's
don't know what that means
What kind of problem
The kind where there isn't really an answer
still don't know what that means
wanted you here so we could have a few months together
Maybe everything happens for a reason
Something bad to force something good
Sam looks somewhat panicked
What
Are you dying
This is not easy for George; he fumbles a bit before answering
'm having a problem with cancer
Sam stops flipping through the 's
don't know what that means
What kind of problem
The kind where there isn't really an answer
still don't know what that means
wanted you here so we could have a few months together
Maybe everything happens for a reason
Something bad to force something good
Sam looks somewhat panicked
What
Are you dying
George nods his head
(') And you told Mom today
Yes
Sam whacks the 's off his stomach; they scatter across the floor
Guster scoots off the bed in a panic
Fuck you
You knew you were dying from the start
Sam bounds out of bed in a rage
We're all dying from the start
(beat) just got picked for Advanced Placement
You lied to me
would have lied to me if  thought 'd believe it
This was all for your sake, wasn't it
Having me here
Trying to get me to like you
never tried to get you to like me
(beat) tried to get you to love me
Well, congratulations
You fucking pulled it off
Sam storms out of the garage
'  - Colleen pulls a robe around her nightgown as the doorbell again and again
She flips on a light and opens the door
Sam backs away from the door as he talks
Is Alyssa here
It's midnight
What's the matter, Sam
Nothing
My dad's dying
really need to talk to Alyssa
(
) Sam
Alyssa is leaning over the upstairs railing
Sam walks up the stairs as Colleen closes the door
- Sea lions romp on a rock offshore as gulls circle above
The sun sheets the morning on the water that's blinding
'  - Alyssa is under the covers holding onto Sam, who is still dressed
Both are asleep
'  - George is in bed in pain
prescription bottle is open beside him and pills are scattered on the sheet
on the door forces George to gather the pills and hide the bottle
It's open
Kurt the cop opens the door dressed in civilian clothes
It's my day off
thought 'd help with the plumbing
need you to do me a favor
(concerned) God, you look like crap, George
want you to find someone for me
'  - Colleen walks out her front door straight to her neighbor's house
After a bit of  and a bit of waiting, Tom (of the walking Tom and Barbara) answers the door in a bathrobe
Does your son still own a company that builds houses
'  - Dale is wiring with Adam and Ryan helping
Kurt, Robin and Colleen are setting up and sealing the plastic plumbing pipes
Two new men ( and ) are on the roof, finishing up where Josh fell down
is playing on the radio
George is asleep on the chaise lounge
Alyssa walks across the grass and stops to stare at George
Tears well in her eyes
Alyssa continues on to the house and walks up the stairs
He's been asleep for hours
Is Sam okay
He won't leave my room
Will he talk to me
No
Robin accepts the answer
Slowly, they all return to work
The day is productive as we see the black drainpipes and the copper water runs coming together like a maze
The roof is shingled and the wiring is nearly complete
Whether awake or asleep, George spends the day in the chaise lounge
'  - city inspector's truck pulls to a stop and Bob Larsen steps out with a clipboard and a concerned look on his face
George is dozing on drugs
You're not a plumber, Kurt
Kurt finishes hooking in a plugged tee at a turn and stands
worked every summer with my dad
Check out what 've done
It's not whether it's good or bad
You know that
It's whether your licensed
Frustrated, Kurt glances around at all his good work before answering
Are you still renting that illegal non conforming studio under your house for a thousand a month
Bob opens his clipboard and checks a number of items off
Okay
Looks good to me
Oh, that's embarrassing
That was too easy
At least look around
really did do it right
That isn't why 'm here, anyway
George wakes up and quickly hones in on Bob
've been dreading you
Bob walks toward George as he talks
Mr
Stevens
One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height
He's filed to have construction stopped immediately
It's thirty feet
Well, if it is, we have a problem
George stands, he appears slightly shaky
have the permit
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit
To the patio and one north-facing window
(suddenly realizing) And six inches to the height
George sits back down
Everyone emerges from the house to join George and Bob
(') David Dokos
Bob nods
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day
don't let him
He just loves to
He'll make you tear the entire roof off rather than give you any satisfaction
'm afraid you won't be able to continue until this is settled
You can always go back and file an appeal
That would take weeks
Months
Just so you know, we'll be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished
He'll call us again and then he'll call the police
He has an attorney on retainer
Just so you know
Robin turns and walks back into the house
Colleen, Alyssa, Adam and Ryan soon follow
If he hears a hammer, he'll have you arrested
Robin picks up the hammer and pounds a nail into a piece of wallboard
Dale, Miguel, Greg and Kurt walk back to the house and go back to work
Bob glances at George who shrugs
'   - Colleen is watching the news as Alyssa walks in to say goodnight
'm going to bed
Has he eaten anything at all
Alyssa shakes her head "no" as Colleen flips on the
(') 'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom
'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh
And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying
Colleen is embarrassed Alyssa knows the truth
(') Comfort doesn't mean that much when just getting through the night is the goal, Mom
Alyssa walks out
Colleen curls up and hides clutching pillows on the couch
'  - George is shaking and sweating as he tries to crawl off the bed to his sock drawer
Guster wakes up and hops off Sam's bed to lick George on the face
Please
can't
George is in real pain as he drops to the floor on his back
He winces and cries out as he pushes himself forward with his legs toward the dresser
George suddenly stops pushing; his legs slump flat on the concrete floor
His eyes flutter shut as Guster continues to lick his face
'  - Alyssa is dressed, combing through wet hair when the sound of construction distracts her
She opens her window and sticks her head out
Suddenly excited, she pulls her head back in
'  - Sam is in bed as Alyssa speeds out of the bathroom
There are like twenty people working on your dad's house
Alyssa bolts for the door, but stops short as she faces Sam
(') If it were my father, 'd wanna spend every second with him  had left
Sam doesn't face her, doesn't even attempt to look up
You hate your father
If he tricked me into loving him, is what meant
You'd hate him for the trick
Not if what he left me was real
Alyssa leaves, closing the door behind her
Sam stays put
'  - Colleen is talking to Tom and Barbara as they stand to the side of the house where a throng of men assemble the house
He pulled this crew off a tract in Newport
They're the best
Robin pulls to a stop on the street and Adam and Ryan run out to gawk at all the workers
What's going on
hired some help
Why
(
) Mom
Colleen glances back as Alyssa runs to join the group
Atonement
Who are all these people
Where's George
think he's still sleeping
Robin walks to the garage door and
Guster barks
Robin  again before opening the door
'  - Guster is beside George on the floor
Robin rushes in and kneels down
George
She presses her hand against George's cheek
(') Wake up
You're still warm
George's eyes flutter open
Robin leans down and kisses him on the cheek
George focuses on Robin; he tries to speak, stops, and tries again
Finally, in a weak voice, we hear: Stop licking me
'  - Alyssa bursts into the house and rushes up the stairs
'  - Sam is sitting on the edge of the bed as Alyssa enters
Your dad's going to the hospital
Sam doesn't respond
(') Come on
Alyssa holds out her hand as we  the ambulance approach
don't wanna go
He asked where you were
He wants you with him
don't wanna go
Sam is nearly pleading, frightened to move
Alyssa walks out
The siren stops
The front door closes
Sam sits still
'  - The house is coming together incredibly fast with all the workers
Tom and Barbara are supervising the crew
David Dokos whips around the corner in his black Mercedes and parks in his driveway, rushing over as he yells
Nothing is built until the Board of Adjustment hears the appeal
David is searching for George, finally settling for Tom
(') Where is he
should have reported you for tossing that piece of dog doo
Tom's face is flushed; Barbara calms him by grabbing his arm
Tom, let's not overreact now
David Dokos stomps his feet and thrusts his fist into the air, as a child might if he were overreacting
want this fucking piece of shit construction stopped now and  want that goddamn roof ripped off and lowered and don't care if  have to spend a shit load of money to get it done
will do it
Tom and Barbara simply stare at him in disbelief
David walks back to his house
Tom turns to his wife
want this house finished before he can stop it
Tom rolls up his sleeves and walks toward the house to help
'  - Colleen and Alyssa walk into the house listless - both look tired and sad
'  - Alyssa enters the room, walks into the bathroom
Sam is gone
Sam
'   - Adam and Ryan are sitting next to each other on the floor subdued, tossing a ball to Guster
The kitchen door opens and Peter walks into the family room
Adam is the first to notice but the last to react
Ryan stands as Guster barks
Guster, be quiet
Peter has a growth of beard and is dressed in Levi's and a knit shirt - he doesn't look like himself
Hey
Hey
You got a dog
It's not ours
It's George's
Peter nods
've missed you guys
Why
Ryan is tough - not giving an inch
Peter stares at his sons, ashamed that the question could be asked
Adam stands and walks to this father, takes his hand
(') 'll tell Mom you're here
- George is asleep, looking dead with tubes in his arms
We a bit of the song by Warren Zevon, " ' "  'Well,  went to the doctor/ said ''m feeling kind of rough'/He said, ''ll break it to you, son, your shit's fucked up
' '  - Sam is alone on the roof in the fading light, stringing party lights over the shingles and under the eves
'   - Robin couldn't look worse as she walks down the hall to the family room with Ryan
Peter is standing alone
Ryan joins Adam on the floor with Guster
Robin stops and stands ten feet from Peter
thought maybe
know it's late
but if you're hungry
'  - The sun has set as Sam stands at the edge of the cliff trying to garner the courage to jump
After the sound of a wave crashing against the cliff, Sam closes his eyes and leaps off the edge of the earth
'  - Alyssa is sitting on the edge of her bed as Colleen stops beside the open door
Are you doing okay
Alyssa shakes her head "no"
Colleen walks into the room and sits down beside her daughter
Alyssa rests her head on her mother's shoulder
- Robin, Peter, Ryan and Adam are in the middle of dinner as Adam excitedly tries to explain all that he and his brother have accomplished
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color  liked best
And he said he loved me
We did a lot of the wiring too
With Dale
Oh, and  got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through
've never heard you so excited about anything
Maybe you can come help us too
'd like that
Peter glances at Robin
- Sam is still wet as he walks down the hall
We  more of the Warren Zevon song
' had a dream/Ah, shucks, oh, well/Now it's all fucked up/It's shot to hell
' '   - Sam enters the room as a  scurries to catch up
'm afraid no one's allowed in here now
He's my dad
Sam is staring at George, who is either asleep or unconscious
The nurse finally relents and walks out
Sam sits in a chair beside the bed and begins to cry
Slowly, George's arm slides out beyond the railing of the bed, his hand open
Sam does his best to stop crying
(') brought you something
Sam pulls out a pair of sunglasses from his shirt pocket
George shakes death and drugs away as he manages to open his eyes
(weakly) don't wanna go, Sam
Here
Sam gently slides the sunglasses over his father's eyes; he rushes to the window and pulls the curtains back
(') Can you see
Sam walks back to the bed and pulls it toward the window, stretching the cords and tubes to their limit
He grabs the remote and raises George's head
Off in the distance, against the backdrop of an endless black ocean, George's house is seemingly on fire with lights
Pain can't stop a smile
(') It's almost done
George takes hold of Sam's hand with his own
They continue to stare at the lit house holding hands
'  - The door opens and Robin, Adam, Ryan and Peter are greeted by Guster, who bounces around like a wired rabbit
Go brush your teeth and get right into bed
It's late
Adam runs to Robin for a kiss, then grabs Peter with a hug
Goodnight
Goodnight
Adam runs up the stairs, Guster right on his heels
Ryan is staring at his father
Do you know anything about building a house
No
guess  could teach you some things
Okay
Robin sneaks a quick kiss on Ryan's cheek as he heads for the stairs
After he's gone, Robin turns back to Peter
hardly recognize you with a beard
That was my plan
to be hardly recognizable to you as me
feel in love with George again
Peter nods, something he already knows
'll see you tomorrow
Robin nods
There's a moment where it's clear that Peter doesn't want to leave and Robin doesn't want him to leave, but after the moment passes, Peter walks out and Robin sits down at the base of the stairs
'  - Colleen and Alyssa are asleep together on the bed
'  - Sam is up on a ladder, pounding copper nails into cedar shingles that face the house
Alyssa runs across the grass
Where are you
Floating to Catalina
What
Sam steps off the ladder
Alyssa wraps her arms around him
Sam removes sleepy bugs from Alyssa's eyes before he kisses her
police car stops in front of the house and Kurt steps out
Alyssa and Sam turn to face him
He said he heard hammering
Who
Before Kurt can answer, David Dokos storms out of his house and trudges toward them talking
My attorney is driving down from Newport Beach
If  hear one more nail being hammered,  swear to God before this is all over 'll end up owing this house
As Sam is staring at David Dokos, a hint of recognition crosses his face
Mr
Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered
Wait a minute
wave of fear rushes through David Dokos that's instantly visible
(') Do you drive a black Mercedes
No
Sam figures out why we knows David Dokos - from the aborted blowjob in the black Mercedes
(') 'm going back to my house to wait for my lawyer
David starts to leave, but Sam stops him with: Are you sure we need lawyers
David's face is sheet white as he forces himself back around
(') Because all we're really talking about is six inches, right
Are you threatening me
What are you talking about
'm sixteen years old
'm underage
How could  possibly threaten you
David Dokos stares at Sam for a long time before glancing at Kurt and his police uniform for just a second
(') Would you like to help us finish the house, Mr
Dokos
Yes,  would
What the fuck
Everything happens for a reason
That's what my dad said
Then you tell me, what just happened
The payoff
Sam walks back to the ladder and hammer, leaving Kurt and Alyssa confounded
David takes a step back
'll just
change clothes
Sam pounds in another shingle as David walks quickly back to his house
'   - George is unconscious as Robin enters and sits down beside him with a video camera
found the last time you were happy
Robin adjusts the viewfinder and presses play on the camera
George doesn't wake up
On the tiny screen, we see a younger George in the ocean, his arms wrapped around six-year old Sam; he shields Sam from the waves and kisses his son's hair
Robin rests the camera on the bed as the video continues to play
She takes hold of George's hand and begins to weep as she presses her head on his chest
An envelope with Robin and Sam's name on it rests on the nightstand beside the bed
'  - Twenty men along with Tom and Barbara, Alyssa and Colleen, Sam and David Dokos are painting; installing windows, floors or cabinets as the house begins to take its final shape
'  - Peter stops and steps out of his car as Adam and Ryan race for the house
It's almost done
Sam walks out the front door
Do you guys feel like painting
What color
Red
love red
That's my favorite color
Adam and Ryan walk into the house as Sam focuses on Peter, who keeps his distance
You don't look like you
Either do you
Peter glances down at his work clothes
thought  might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle
Do you like red
Peter nods, hesitates for a moment before walking up the driveway to Sam
'   - George's bed is empty, stripped of everything
Robin is still sitting in a chair beside the bed, a letter resting on her lap
stops at the door
Are you sure we can't call anyone
Robin shakes her head "no"
The nurse moves on
'  - From the outside, the house is finished: windows in, doors on, roof shingled
The sun drops behind the house, causing a halo of bright light to envelop it
'  - Most of the workers have gone home, because most of the work is done
All the floor are hand-scrapped cherry; huge beams and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling
The kitchen cabinets are in; the bathrooms are complete
Sam, Ryan, Alyssa, Adam and Peter are the only ones left
Outside, we hear a car pull to a stop
Mom
Adam and Ryan run down the stairs
Peter stops cleaning a brush and walks to the window as Sam stands still
'  - Adam runs to Robin and meets her mid-yard with a hug
When does George get to come see his house
It's so beautiful
Adam and Robin are staring at the house
Ryan can see the strain on his mother's face
Is George okay
All Robin can do is shake her head "no"
'  - Sam backs away from the window
Peter turns to face him
Standing straight as he can, being as brave as he can, tears well in Sam's eyes as he softly shakes
Peter walks to Sam and wraps his arms around him
(
) always thought of myself as a house was always what  lived in
It didn't need to be big
It didn't even need to be beautiful
just needed to be mine
became what  was meant to be
built myself a life
built myself a house
Sam clings to Peter, completely lost in sorrow
'  - Adam and Ryan have their arms wrapped around their mother as we pull back and watch the sun set the sky off in dazzling hues of orange and red
- Robin is driving with Sam beside her in a low-middle income neighborhood in Santa Ana
Sam is holding the letter
You're sure about this
Yeah
You could keep it and rent it out
This is what he wants
read the letter
You read the will
He wants you to keep it
To live in it some day
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for
(beat) Maybe it's what  want
It's clear to see that Robin's proud of Sam's decision
She checks an address on a piece of paper and pulls to a stop
Sam steps out of the car, holding the letter
- Sam is shaking slightly as he walks up the cracked concrete walk to the door
He  the bell
(
) Twenty-one years ago, my father crossed a double-line
He changed my life and the life of a little girl forever with that mistake
just can't stop thinking about her
in her mid-twenties opens the door in her wheelchair
Hello
Sam is very nervous as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a set of keys
My father built you a house
The woman is confused as Sam holds out the keys
'  - The house is majestic in its setting among the trees and grass, on the jagged just of rock that accepts the constant crash of ocean against it with a solid permanence
This is where, if you were a house, you would want to be built
