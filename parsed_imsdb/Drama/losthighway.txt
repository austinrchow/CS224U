terrifying ride down the lost highway
David Lynch 21 June 1995 -  - We see a clean moving  illuminated by headlights
We're floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape
This gliding, eerie  continues as credits roll
when the credits end, the headlights seem to dim and soon we're moving through
: : -  - in the blackness, a man, , is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette
we see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him
In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen
As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly
Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning
'     - Blank expression - face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette
0N '   - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes seem empty, glazed over
Fred is 32 years old, with dark hair
Fred looks up, startled by the noise
He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a
m
, goes to an  on the wall next to the mirror
He pushes a button
comes over the intercom
Dick Laurent is dead
Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house
He is on the upstairs level
He looks through a narrow slot window, but can't see the front door below
He goes further in the house to a picture window that overlooks the street below
There is  there
: - We can see Fred standing at the picture window, looking out
: : -   - Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, buttoned up white shirt
He picks up a music case
woman comes into the room
This is Fred's wife, , 30 years old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand
You don't mind that 'm not coming tonight
What are you going to do
thought 'd stay home and read
Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying
Read
Read what, Renee
Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink
Fred comes over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh
It's nice to know  can still make you laugh
like to laugh, Fred
That's why  married you
Wake me up when you get home
Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to linger for a moment on her face
: - blue neon sign reads:
: - Fred is on the bandstand
He takes a solo on his saxophone
Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop
The  wails madly behind him
The  explode onto the dance floor, making it a wild scene
Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, driving everyone nuts
: - After the band quits to take a break,   come onto Fred, but he moves away, refusing their attentions
: -  - Fred dials a pay phone
: The   - We move through the empty living room - empty bedroom, etc
The ringing telephone goes unanswered
: -  - 0N '  as he listens to the ringing
Sweat is still rolling off his face
His eyes are blank
: - Fred's car pulls up in the driveway in front of his house
Fred gets out, and goes into the house carrying his music case
: - Fred puts down his music case, goes to the bedroom, and sees Renee sleeping soundly
: : -  - Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the mail
She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the step
She picks it up
- No stamp, no writing, blank
She takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house
: -   - Renee opens the manila envelope
She's noticeably nervous when she sees a videotape inside
She stares at it
Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe
He sees Renee staring at the videotape - before she hears him enter
When she does hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape
What's that
videotape
Who's it from
don't know
There's no return address on the envelope
In fact, there's no address on it
Does it say anything on the tape
(looking it over) No, nothing
Fred walks over and picks up the tape
Well, let's see what's on it
Fred takes the tape to the
He inserts it into the machine, and turns it on
Fred goes toward the couch
(') (to Renee) Come on
They sit on the couch in front of the television
The  monitor: We begin on the , then the videotape fills the entire frame
The videotape shows the front of , the camera panning slowly over it
The picture is accompanied by an eerie
After the camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow
Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments
Renee looks relieved
It must be from a real estate agent
Maybe
We see a   encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy image on the
: : -   - Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and grapefruit in front of her
She is wearing glasses, reading a book
Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or acknowledge him
Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just off the dining room
He comes back into the dining room with a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee
He lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her
Good book, huh
(she looks up) Huh
oh, yeah, it is
Same one you were reading the other night
What night
When you didn't come to the club
Oh
Oh, yeah
No
This is a different one
called, you know
Called
When
From the club
You didn't answer
must have fallen asleep
was asleep when you got home, wasn't
You were asleep when  got home, yes
Renee goes back to her book
Fred sips his coffee and smokes
(without looking up) told you you could wake me up if you wanted to
Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares at him
'  - a disturbed expression
Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her glasses back on and resumes reading
: : -  - Fred is in bed waiting for Renee
He hears noises from the bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing
Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before getting into bed
Naked under the covers, she switches out her bedside lamp
The only light in the room comes from the outside, through the windows
Fred moves closer to Renee, puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast
She does not respond
Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her passionately
Renee accedes to his demands, but does not participate willingly
He makes love to her voraciously, but her lack of passion disturbs him
Fred can't stop, however, and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him maternally while he calms down
He climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed
'  - which express his horror and humiliation
They lie there in the dark silence for a while
Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness
had a dream about you last night
Yeah
You were in the house
calling my name
but  couldn't find you
: - ' Fred is walking slowly across the living room
Fred's : moving - searching
Fred stops and listens
(tentatively - distant and off screen) Fred
Fred, where are you
The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it drifts it   following along the hall and turning slowly into the bedroom
Renee is lying below in the bed
0
Then there you were
lying in bed
but it wasn't you
It looked like you
but it wasn't
The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a Her face registers
: -  - Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her bedside lamp
Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not Renee's face
It's a face Fred has never seen before
Fred quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own
Fred, are you all right
Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face
Renee covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes
: : - Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep
She opens it, pulls out a videotape
large dog is  incessantly somewhere in the neighborhood
Renee looks around to see if she can see the dog
: MADIS0N  -   - Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the mail
She is a bit puzzled and unsettled
She puts the tape down on a table
She stares at it
Fred comes in
You're up early
That dog woke me
lay there for a while, then decided to get up
Who the hell owns that dog
Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table
What's that
Another tape
Yes,  just found it on the step
Fred picks it up
Don't you want to watch it
guess so
Fred goes to the  and inserts the tape
He turns the television on
He is about to start the tape - he looks up for Renee
She's hanging back
Well, do you wanna watch it
Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the couch
Yeah
Renee sits on the couch
Fred starts the  and joins her
As before, we first see it on the , then the videotape fills the frame
This tape shows the front of the house, as before, then shows the  of Fred and Renee's house - The eerie   goes throughout
The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping
The tape image then goes to snow
Fred and Renee stare at the snowy  picture
After a few moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set
She is visibly shaken, trembling
She stares fearfully at Fred who seems less disturbed
We've got to call the police
All right
: -   - Renee is on the telephone
Fred is pacing, smoking, behind her
yes, 've been on hold for ten minutes
can't
All right, thanks
Renee looks around anxiously
Fred gives her his cigarette, which she puffs on
He lights another and continues pacing
Hello, yes
Good
My name is Renee Madison
My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician
we	live at 442 Hollis Street
Right
442 Hollis
near the observatory
Someone's been in the house
at night
while we were sleeping
know because they sent, dropped off a videotape
two videotapes
to show us
That's right
Yes
it
the second one
shows us asleep
Someone broke in and taped us while we slept
Isn't that enough
Okay, sure
We will
442 Hollis
Yes, we'll be here
Renee hangs up
So
Two detectives are coming out
: -   - Two men in suits - the Detectives,  and , are seated on the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape
The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several moments, until Fred shuts it off
That's it
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom
: -  - All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look around, especially up toward the ceiling
Very strange
What is
The angle
The high angle shot on the tape
How'd the camera get so high like that
And smooth
Almost no movement - back and forth,  mean
Like you'd get if it was hand held
Right
This just glided along
: -  - The Detectives enter the bedroom
Fred and Renee follow
This is the bedroom
The Detectives look around without touching anything
Do you always sleep here
In this room
Both of you
This is our bedroom
There's no other bedroom
No
There is,  mean,  use it as a practice room
it's soundproofed
You're a musician
Yes,  thought my wife
What's your axe
Tenor
Tenor saxophone
Do you
(shakes his head) Tone deaf
(to Renee) Do you own a video camera
No
Fred hates them
The Detectives both look at Fred
like to remember things my own way
What do you mean by that
How  remember them
Not necessarily the way they happened
Do you have an alarm system
Yes, actually we do
but we haven't been using it
Why not
It kept going off for some reason
False alarms
Might be a good time to try using it again
Anybody else have a key to the house
No
Maid
Relative
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in
Nobody else has a key
(to Al) Let's check the doors and windows
See if there's been a break-in
They all leave the bedroom
: - Ed is checking the door for marks
: - Fred's : He's watching Ed and Al with Renee who are outside the house, walking around the property, checking it out
: -  - Ed and Al are standing by an unmarked police car with Fred and Renee
The Detectives are about to depart
We'll keep a watch on the house
As best we can
If anything else happens, you'll call us
Al hands Fred a card
Ed hands Renee a card
We will
Thanks, guys
It's what we do
Ed and Al get into the car and drive off
Renee and Fred look at each other, warily, then go back into the house : : - Fred is on the bandstand, sweating, and honking his saxophone
He handles the horn roughly, braying like a beast as the  gathered in front of the stage gyrates as one swept away in the madness of the moment
: - At the back, near the side door, Renee can be seen with , only one of whose faces we see
The trio are going out the side door led by one of the men; we see only the back of his head
Renee glances briefly at the bandstand before she exits with the two men
: -  - as he plays, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings
His eyes open and shut as he clamps down on the horn
: - In the back of the club, the side door slowly closes
: : -  /   - Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction of the stairwell
We  someone's steps coming up the stairs
It's Renee, who eventually comes into view
She is holding another manila envelope
She arrives at the top step
She and Fred lock eyes
Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third videotape
without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to the
He inserts it very carefully, slowly
He hits play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on the couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension
Again we begin with a   and then the  monitor fills the screen: We see the interior of the house at night
The camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are sleeping
Again, the   plays throughout
in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, , Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera holds on him
He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the room
He comes to a sitting position, his head straining upwards, looking in the direction of the camera
At this point, the videotape image turns to snow
: -   - Fred and Renee are on the couch
The  remains on, showing snow
Renee is very upset, crying
What the hell is going on
(equally horrified - frightened) wish  knew
Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his
She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not respond
Suddenly, she jumps with fright
What was that
What
On the tape
There was something else on the tape
Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image
(') There
Play it
Fred runs the tape forward
We see snow - then a half-second long   of Fred on his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed
He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly grimace, contorted
His eyes are
Fred runs it back again and  the tape there on his tormented image
This image fills the screen
He and Renee stare at it
: -   - The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and the couch
The three videotapes in their manila envelopes are stacked on a coffee table in the center
You don't remember being awakened
It looks like you were aware of someone
Or something
No,  don't remember anything
it looks like
but
don't remember
Why would anyone do something like this
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently
Or not so recently
No, not to me
Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee
no
No
No threats
We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you
Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their agreement
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled
don't know if  want to stay here don't feel safe
Where would you feel safe
don't know
maybe a hotel
Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee with keen interest
There is a strained silence between them
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last
The first night
Not the last two
Why not
(shrugs) forgot
Anyway,  hate the idea of acting paranoid
Acting paranoid
Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid thought you set the alarm
Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces
'll make sure the alarm is set from now on
But that doesn't solve the problem
Who is doing this
And why
Ed and Al rise from their chairs
Ed picks up the envelopes
We'll find out, Mrs
Madison
Renee stands with the Detectives
Fred stands apart - his expression, pained and bewildered
: '  - swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee
, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed
The  here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain- wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses
Through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people cavorting in a swimming pool
Everyone has a drink in his or her hand
Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it
Andy grabs Renee, and dances with her
They laugh and talk
Renee appears to be a bit intoxicated
Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks
When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar
Then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass
, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than Fred, approaches him
We've met before, haven't we
don't think so
Where was it that you think we've met
At your house
Don't you remember
(surprised) No, no  don't
Are you sure
Of course
In fact, 'm there right now
(incredulous) What do you mean
You're where right now
At your house
That's absurd
The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a cellular phone and holds it out to Fred
Call me
Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke
The Mystery Man puts the phone into Fred's hand
(-) Dial your number
Fred hesitates, puzzled
(-) Go ahead
Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number
We  a pick up as we stay on '
told you  was here
Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in front of him
How did you do that
The Mystery Man points to the phone
Ask me
Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now of the videotapes
He speaks into the phone
(angrily) How did you get into my house
You invited me
It's not my habit to go where 'm not wanted
Fred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into the phone
Who are you
The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person
Give me my phone back
The man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone
Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket
It's been a pleasure talking to you
The man walks away from Fred
Renee appears and comes up to Fred
thought you were getting me a drink
Just a minute
He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the party, Andy
He grabs Andy and points across the room toward the Mystery Man, who is engaged in conversation with Andy, who is that guy
(looking at the Mystery Man) don't know his name
He's a friend of Dick Laurent's,  think
Dick Laurent
Yes,  believe so
(remembering something) But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he
He is
didn't think you knew Dick
How do you know he's dead
Andy and Renee exchange a worried look, which Fred does not notice
don't
don't know him
(angrily) Dick can't be dead
Who told you he was dead
Honey, who
Who's dead
Fred takes Renee by the arm away from Andy
Let's go home
But
Now
We're leaving now
didn't want to come here in the first place
Fred drags the reluctant Renee out of Andy's house
: - Fred is driving fast and recklessly
Renee is drunk and is smiling at him
How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway
Renee stares out the front window - thinks back
It was a long time ago
met him at this place called Moke's
We
became friends
He told me about a job
What job
don't remember
Anyway, Andy's okay
He's got some fucked up friends
: -  - Fred and Renee's car pulls up in front of their house
Fred jumps out of the car
Stay in the car
Fred enters the house, careful to turn off the alarm first
: - There are only a couple of dim lights on, the house is mostly dark
Fred moves slowly and carefully through his house - searching each room for a possible intruder
Fred's  - moving creepily room by room through the dark house - past the telephone - down the hall to the bedroom
There is   there
He goes back outside for Renee
: -  - Renee is standing next to the car, shivering
told you to stay in the car
Why
what is it
Why did you make me wait out here
thought there might be somebody inside
Was there
No
of course not
They enter the house
: - Fred switches on more lights
It's so odd
Waiting out there,  had the strangest feeling
Like this had happened before
mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that
Fred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, disturbed, seriously disquieted
Renee, still tipsy, follows him, moving from room to room
: - ,
- Fred and Renee are preparing to go to bed
Renee goes	into the bathroom off the bedroom
Fred takes another look	out into the hallway
: -  - Fred walks down the hallway
: -   - Fred looks around the dark living room
Then absentmindedly, he begins to inspect objects
He picks up an ashtray and studies it - lost in thought
: -  - Renee is washing her face, standing at the sink in her slip
: -   - Fred is staring at himself in a mirror
: -  - Renee comes in
Fred is not there
She goes to the door and peeks down the hallway
(tentatively) Fred
Fred, where are you
: -   - No one is in the living room now - but a  moves slowly across a wall
: -  - Renee's  - down the hallway
There is just darkness at the end of the hall
It is
After a moment, Fred slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee
He walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall
: : -   - Footsteps can be heard on the stairs
Fred's head appears at the top of the stairway
He comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously received
His expression is strained
He is alone
Fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the , turns it on
He sits on the couch and watches
We go from a   to a    of the video
On the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, accompanied by the
The camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle
The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down
is splattered over the floor, bed, walls
The camera drifts
lies on the floor at the foot of the bed
She is badly mutilated
Fred is hovering over her on the tape,   ,  , On the tape, Fred turns away from Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood
His movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure
He looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow
: -   - Fred, sitting in front of the , shudders as the tape ends
He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and finally releases a tortured, warbly cry
Renee
Fred looks up as if seeing something, he starts to stand, -staggering, partially paralyzed
(') (Shouting) : -   - Fred's :    slams into Fred's face, knocking him back in a chair
Ed and Al are standing in front of Fred
Stay put, killer
The Detectives' : Fred's face is a bloody mask
He is crying, whimpering
didn't kill her
Tell me  didn't kill her
: - Fred, his lips and eyes swollen, sits on a cot, dressed in jail clothes
He studies his hands, which appear crippled
He flexes the fingers, slowly, painfully
: - We are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom and living room windows
Inside the house,  and are moving around, measuring, scraping samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture
: - Renee's  on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an
The entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall
The Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a rack of instruments, positioning the corpse
As he is doing these things, the   enters, accompanied by his The
is dressed formally, in a tuxedo
The young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, pearls, spike heels
The couple are close; she has an arm through his, and she laughs, nervously
He is smoking a cigarette
Hi, doc
Workin' late tonight, huh
Party at the mayor's house, George
This is his daughter, Joyce
Howdy, Joyce
Howdy, George
The Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled:
, ,
(misspelled)
(looking at the packages) Just like Christmas
He begins to unwrap them
don't know if  can watch this
The
tosses his cigarette down on the floor
The camera goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's filter screen
(Voice-over) Leave any time you want, lover
won't take it personally
The camera stays on the drain as we  the
unwrapping the packaged body parts
Joyce's high heels enter the frame around the drain
She is stepping nervously, like a spooked horse
The clatter of her heels is very loud
We hear the chuckle
(Voice-over) Easy, girl, easy
You talking to me or
her
(laughs) corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce
: - The camera is behind a female  in the jury box
The shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she stands
Over her left shoulder we see Fred standing at the defense table
Over her right shoulder the  is seated
Have you reached a verdict
Yes, we have, your honor
Please hand it to the bailiff
The  goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, then takes it to the Judge
The Judge opens it and reads it to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it to the Foreman
And what is your verdict
The camera moves to Fred, registering his tension
The camera goes to the Foreman's face
We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree
Fred faints
Fe is lifted up by his  and  in attendance
Fred revives slightly
Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair
We see Fred's eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and upwards, looking at the video camera high on the wall of the courtroom, pointing down on him
: - and , two exquisite young women, are looking over the merchandise
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces
How could  miss it
The  won't quit with that stuff
They're gonna cook him
Andy's from Utah
He says there you have a choice
You can die by hanging or by firing squad
Which would you choose
Marian holds up a black teddy to her body
Andy would go for this, don't you think
Firing squad, definitely
Do they aim for the head or for the heart
The heart,  guess
wouldn't
The brain would know what's going on
Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity
Savage pain, Marian
Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest
Oh, that's hot
So you'd rather be hung, huh
They both giggle at the obvious joke
Absolutely
Soon as your neck snaps, you black out
It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it
Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch
You might be right, Raquel
Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it
The girls giggle
Raquel sees Andy walking into the store
He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything
When Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her eyes
Guess who
: -   - Fred, in the custody of , wearing handcuffs and leg irons, is being escorted to his cell
He appears zombie-like as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his shackles, and lock him in
Make yourself to home, fella
The guards leave
Fred stands near the cell door, begins to look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat
He hears the muffled,   -  from the surrounding cells
Lost voices - the voices of death row
Fred realizes where he is now
He walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge
Fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean
: : -   - is pushing a meal cart along the row
At each door, the Trustee stops and takes a tray off the cart
He shoves the meal tray through a slot in the door
We watch him distribute the trays down the long row of cells
: PRIS0N -    - The hallway is quiet - distant sounds reverberate
: - '  - Fred sits on the edge of his bed, a tray of prison food sits on the floor - uneaten
: - ' Fred lies awake on his cot   he stares at the ceiling
: -    - The hallway is quiet - distant sounds reverberate
: -   - This is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for population
This yard is for use by death row prisoners only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself
Fred is released into the area, which is more like a dog run
The Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise yard
: -   - There is more activity on the row tonight than usual of  in suits walk through with an air of authority
There is a building murmur among the prisoners
: - '  - Fred sits on the edge of his bed, listening as sound of the prisoners builds
He's shaking
: PRIS0N -   - are standing at the guard station
#1 (very quietly - solemnly) Here he comes
Several of the men in suits, along with several , and a , a  in the middle of the group, enter the hallway
They proceed past the guard station down the hall
As the procession files by,    come to their doors and talk to the prisoner
#1 See you soon, Sammy
Don't think takin' a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me back the twenty you owe me
#2 Don't take it personal, pal
#3 Un fuerte abrazo, amigo
As the men march down the hallway, they pass Fred's cell
His window panel is empty
The camera stops on Fred's cell door, as we  other prisoners talking to the inmate on his way to the
#4 Hang in there, honey
#5 Keep an eye out for me, Sammy
: - '  - Fred sits on his bed, listening fearfully
The camera stays on Fred as we : #6 Show 'em you got big stones, bro
: -   - The prisoner is strapped into the electric chair
Behind a glass partition  are seated
One of the men in suits, the , goes to a telephone on the wall and stands with his hand on the receiver
He picks it up
(into phone) Line check
(pause) Okay
The Warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it
We see one of the condemned man's  being clamped with an electrical device
The other wrist is clamped
metal halo is placed around the condemned man's head large electrical cable leads off from the halo
Electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas where the clamps have been placed
The Clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to give the man his last rites
When he is finished, he nods to the Warden
The Warden approaches the condemned man
Any final words, Sam
The condemned man shakes his head "no"
The Warden and the others clear the room and the doors are locked
The  steps into place near a huge lever
He looks to the Warden
The Witnesses sit in silent anticipation
The hands of the clock on the wall have moved past midnight
The Warden takes one last look through a window at the condemned man - then nods to the Executioner
: - '  - Fred sits frozen at the edge on his bed
distant but    begins
Fred's head jerks upward to the light on his ceiling
It has dimmed to almost nothing
Fred sits in the humming darkness
: PRIS0N -   - The Guards release Fred into the yard for his exercise
At first the sunlight is blinding, and Fred covers his eyes
He moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way
Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face
Very soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is bathed in shade
Fred stands up, but is almost immediately hit by a searing pain in his head
Fred holds his head with his hands, sinks down to his knees
The Guard, who has been observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him
Something wrong
My
My head
Headache, huh
Too much sun,  guess
You want to come in
Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it
No, no
want to go in
The guard assists Fred back inside the building
: - '  - Fred is on his cot, holding his head
He is obviously in pain
He gets up and staggers to the cell door
Fred pushes a  button next to the door to summon a guard
The comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening
What's botbering you, Madison
The pain is getting worse
need more aspirin
can't give you anymore
'll talk to the doctor
The guard leaves
Fred collapses to the floor of the cell, writhing in pain
: - Fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a on either arm
He is placed on a chair in the middle of the room
The guards stand one on each side of him enters
He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows
Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest
The Doctor lifts Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing
The Doctor takes a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's eyes
He feels Fred's forehead
After this, he allows Fred's head to drop down again
The Doctor takes Fred's pulse
He drops Fred's wrist
He next takes Fred's blood pressure
You sleeping okay
(strained whisper) can't sleep
The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and removes a large blue pill
He fills a paper cup with water from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in Fred's mouth
The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of Fred's shirt
The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make sure he swallowed the pill
You'll sleep now
(to Guards) Take him back to his cell
The guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out of the infirmary
: - '  - Fred awakens on his cot
He turns and sits up in the darkness
stream of light through the slot window illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and discolored
He staggers up and shuffles over to the call button, which he leans on
few moments later, a appears on the other side of the mesh
What is it
Aspirin
fly head
gotta have more aspirin
The doctor said not to give you anything
You can see him in the morning
But my head
The guard looks at Fred through the window, and what he sees disturbs him
The guard makes a strange face
: -    - The guard walks away from Fred's door to the guard station, where another  is sitting at a table, reading a magazine
#1 Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up
#2 (not looking up from his magazine) Which one
They both laugh
: PRIS0N - '  -  - Fred is on the floor lying on back
The camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing on his head
Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now
He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, making grotesque, otherworldly sounds
As the camera moves into a  , the last image of Fred's head shows the discolored swelling has increased
Fred looks up, sensing something
: MADIS0N  - There is a "For Sale" sign posted in front
The camera pans slowly as in the videotape across the front of the house
The interior of the house is dark, but fleetingly we are aware of movement, shadows inside
: '  - Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store is  from a stereo
Marian and Raquel are dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be
Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body
His eyes are closed at first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur
He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he collapses again
Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance
Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically
The girls' breasts tumble out of their teddies
Raquel drops her end of Andy, turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy
Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around
Andy makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches for her but falls back, dead to the world
Raquel and Marian don't quit
: - '  - Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock his body
He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his nostrils
His head is badly swollen
Fred vomits repeatedly, and drags around in his mess
Fred turns, straining upwards as we've seen him do before
His face and head are hideously deformed
Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead
He pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes
As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets
We move into the eye sockets and beyond
: -  - We see a clean moving  illuminated by headlights
We are floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape
This gliding, eerie  continues until the headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the road
This figure is a man,
Pete turns, unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to him
The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete
There is a girl, , standing on the lawn in front of the house
She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete
Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly at us
Now Pete seems to move toward us as we move toward him
His head fills the screen
: - '  - Fred's blank face begins to contort and take on the appearance, feature by feature, of Pete Dayton
Fred Madison is becoming Pete Dayton
: : - We watch the sun rise outside the prison, ascending over the strands of barbed-wire above the wall
: -   - is making his early morning rounds
He stops at each cell and looks in, making a mark with a pencil on a piece of paper on a clipboard
when he comes to Fred's cell, he is about to make a check-mark, but looks in again and appears confused
Who are you
What are you doing in this cell
The  in the cell sits still on the cot, staring straight ahead
The man is thin, younger than Fred
: -    - The guard hurries over to the guard station
He picks up the telephone and dials
He begins to sweat
This is Johnny Mack at station 8
Yeah, look, somethin' crazy's happened
No, mean, Madison ain't in his cell
No, there's somebody in there, but it ain't Madison
Right, right
Okay
Captain Henderson's comin''
Right
Johnny Mack hangs up
He sweats
He walks back down the row and looks in again at Fred's cell
-u-u-u-ck me
He walks back to the station
supervisor arrives, Now, Mack, what's the situation
'm not entirely certain, Captain
You'll have to see for yourself
Together they walk quickly to Fred's cell and look in
That's not Fred Madison
No, sir, it's not
Who is it
couldn't say, sir
Captain Henderson
Yeah, Mack
J0HNNY Captain
this is some spooky shit we got here
: - '  - Captain Henderson is standing in front of a desk, behind which the Warden is seated
nameplate on the desk reads: Repeat that, Bill
Warden, it's not him
It
was not Fred Madison in that cell
Of course, it's Madison
Who else could it be
don't know
The guards say they've never seen him before
Where is he now
He's in the infirmary, being examined
Did you ask him who he is
He
He can't talk
it appears as if he can't talk, anyway
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison
've got men searching the building and the grounds now
The Warden stands up and comes around the desk
want to take a look at this man myself
: -  - The man from Fred's cell is just finishing being fingerprinted
The doctor with serious eyebrows -
- is inspecting the man's face
The Warden enters with Captain Henderson
are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the room
What is this, Rogoff
don't know yet
Dr
Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm
He takes several vials
The man watches the blood coming out of his arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is happening to him
Who is this man
He's just been fingerprinted, and 'll run these blood tests right away
We'll find out soon enough
Dr
Rogoff opens the man's mouth and peers in with a pencil light
He's not Madison
(slowly, deliberately Not even close
Dr
Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket
(') examined Madison last night, Marshall
He had a headache
headache
did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill
've never seen this man before
Neither have the guards don't think he's in the system
The Warden moves closer to the man - he looks closely at him
Where the hell did you come from, mister
- he's staring straight up
: - '  - Present are the Warden, Captain Henderson and  other The Warden is looking at a computer next to his desk
Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton
He's twenty-four years old
His birthday is April 21st
He was born and raised right here
He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue
Pete Dayton was arrested five () (cont'd) years ago for auto theft, for which he was put on probation for one year
That was his first and only offense
No record since then
Warden Clements looks up, takes a deep breath and stares at the men in front of him
(-) How about Madison
Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts
Nothing, Marsh
Vanished
There's an out on him
His photo's been faxed nationwide
#1 had a call from the governor's office about this
How the hell does she know
#1 There's press outside right now
How the hell
7 One of the guards must have leaked it
What's the word on the street
#2 Only that Madison has apparently escaped
Nothing about the other guy
Good, let's keep it that way
Keep a lid on Dayton
Nothing gets out about him
: -   - Johnny Mack walks down the row and enters Fred's cell
: - '  - Johnny Mack looks around, up and down the walls, half peers under the cot, then - checking first to see no other guard is watching him - he looks inside the toilet bowl, then gets down on his knees and really looks under the cot
He gets up and sits down on the bed
He rubs a hand over his face
Johnny Mack is clearly perplexed
: -   - press conference is being held
Present are , cameras, et al
The Warden and Captain Henderson represent the prison
have a statement to read
Fred Madison, an inmate being held on death row has, apparently
has escaped
An all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide, but nationwide
We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon
No further details are available at this time
Thank you very much
Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before
How did he get out
The Warden and Captain Henderson leave the room without answering
: -   - Pete's parents,  and  , escorted by a , are approaching the Warden's office
It is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office
The Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple
Bill Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled up
His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck-tail
He's working-class, ex-biker
Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze
She retains the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast
Claire is wearing sunglasses
: - '  - The Daytons are ushered in by the guard
The Warden is standing behind his desk
Dr
Rogoff is standing to one side, and next to him is Captain Henderson
The Daytons stand just inside the room for a moment before the Warden extends his right hand
'm Warden Clements
This is Captain Henderson and Dr
Rogoff
Please, sit down
Bill and Claire move to the chairs in front of the desk and sit down
The Warden, Dr
Rogoff and Captain Henderson all sit down
(') Mr
and Mrs
Dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, Peter, is here
Claire Dayton removes her sunglasses
She and Bill wait - the warden is searching for words
(') He
He was discovered this morning
in a cell on death row
Bill and Claire look at each other - bewildered
(') cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison
The wife killer
Yes
How is this possible, Warden
The warden shakes his head
Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him
Bill and Claire look at each other again - briefly
His condition
What do you mean
His physical condition
(hesitates) Same as always
Pete takes care of himself
Bill and Claire look at each other once again
saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday
He's a mechanic
Look, is he okay
Can we see him
The Warden looks at Dr
Rogoff
He has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis
that's redness and swelling around the eyes
Was he in a fight
These conditions don't indicate a fight
But what is the cause then
And how did he get in that cell
He can't talk
Or won't
That doesn't sound like Pete
Your son has experienced some sort of trauma, 'm afraid
We were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here
You don't know Fred Madison
No
Only what was in the news
Do you think Pete knows him
wouldn't know how
(to Claire) You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday
When he went to work, right
What about yesterday
He didn't come home
Sometimes he stays at a friend's
Any particular friends
girl's, a buddy's
don't know
He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases
want to see him
Yes, and we need to talk to him
if we can
(to Dr
Rogoff) Mel, let's get Peter in here
Dr
Rogoff leaves the room
While he's gone, nobody talks, increasing the tension
Dr
Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt
Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen
He can walk, but unsteadily
Pete looks around the room - sees his parents
Claire jumps up
(tenderly) Pete
She and Dr
Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair
Bill is taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing
(') Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this
Pete, what happened to you
Pete has a dazed look on his face
He starts to speak, then stops
(') It's okay
Take your time, honey
Pete's gaze drifts from his mother's face around the room and back to her face
(afraid - quiet) Where
am
The Warden and Captain Henderson look to Dr
Rogoff
You're in the state penitentiary
You were found in a cell on death row
My head hurts
Pete rubs his head like it's about to explode with pain
man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell
He's missing
we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him
don't know
Do you know Fred Madison
(straining) No
There is a silence in the room, as Pete massages his throbbing temples
(worried) Warden, can we take him home
The Warden looks at Dr
Rogoff
(to Warden) From a medical standpoint,  don't see why not
We need to find out what happened here
(standing up) Have you made any charges against him
No
Then he's coming home with his mother and me
All right
but you see our predicament
Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us
perhaps later
For now, he's free to leave
Bill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of the warden's office
With a nod from the Warden, the guard accompanies them out of the room
The Warden, Captain Henderson and Dr
Rogoff stand but remain in the office
(to warden) You just gonna let him go
We'll get a tail put on him
: -    - Bill, Claire and Pete pull into the driveway of a bleached out, 60's ranch-style house on a street lined with many more of the same
Bill and Claire get out of the car first, then help Pete out and up into the house
: - Bill and Claire take Pete to his room, which has a bed, desk, two chairs and a sea of disassembled motorcycle parts belonging to a classic Indian motorbike which Pete is rebuilding
Each part is shiny and clean
Pete sits down on his bed and looks up at his parents - shaking his head with confusion and embarrassment
Just rest easy, Pete
You're gonna be okay
Are you hungry, honey
'll fix you something
No
don't feel so good
would like some aspirin
Coming up
: - Pete sleeps
In the living room, Bill is drinking a beer and watching television
In the kitchen, Claire is finishing the dishes
She goes into the living room and leans down and whispers something in Bill's ear
Bill nods and Claire walks quietly down the hallway and opens Pete's door
She looks in on him sleeping
: - An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the Dayton house
In the front seat are the Detectives, Ed and Al
Al, who is on the passenger side, is holding two styrofoam cups filled with coffee
Ed removes from his inside jacket pocket a 5" x 7" photo of Pete Dayton, which he props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both himself and Al
Al hands one of the cups to Ed
Thanks, Al
Al studies Pete Dayton's face in the photo
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to
Yeah
Ed and Al sip their coffee and stare at the house
: : -  - Pete Dayton is lying on a chaise lounge
His forehead is still swollen, but his eyes are less red
He stares up into the sky - a hot breeze blows over him
: - The camera moves slowly through the interior of the empty house cast with shadows
The refrigerator running is the only sound
: -  - Pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands
He stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, unwatered lawn on his bare feet
He walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence
His eyes fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic swimming pool
He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows it lazily in a circle
small plane drones overhead
In the distance, a  finishes hanging out some wash and goes in the back door of her house
The slamming of her screen door sounds a thousand miles away
Pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him
: - Pete is eating a sandwich - he is looking much better
Claire opens a bag of chips and sets them in front of Pete as Bill comes in the front door
'm in the kitchen
Bill comes in and pops a beer - looks around
Where's Pete
Out in back
You talk to him
(urgent) No
Here he comes
Their gazes follow a path from the backyard into where Pete has been sitting all the time
How're you feelin'
Pete looks at his parents - he can't figure out what has just happened
(unsure - brow furrowed) Better
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'
They miss you pretty bad down at the garage
told 'im you still had a "fever"
Okay
Thanks
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya
Yeah
You really don't remember the other night, do you
What night is that
The night before you showed up in the slammer
Do you remember
No
don't
Why
Bill and Claire just stare at him
Pete shakes his head and takes another bite of his sandwich - but inside the worrisome feeling returns
: - '  - Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television
He hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his friends, ,  and  ("") saunter in
"" Where the fuck have you been
Pete pulls himself up to a sitting position
Hey
You look like shit
What happened
Just haven't been feelin' well
"" You're not contagious are you
don't think so
"" Good
You up for a drive
Where to
Hey, Lanie,  heard you were out of it for a while, too
They found a cyst on my god damn ovary
Had to cut it out
You wanna see the scar
Lanie pulls up her shirt and pulls down her pants a ways revealing a fresh scar about three inches long
(winking) Hadn't slowed her down none
(smacking him) Shut up, bone-head
Then Lanie laughs good-naturedly
"" Just goin' up'ta "Tops"
Maybe the "Ten Pin"
Sheila'll be at "Tops"
"" Sure, what's wrong with that
Okay
Pete hauls himself up off the bed and throws on a black leather jacket
The four of them go through the living room where Bill and Claire are drinking and watching
(to Bill and Claire) Goin' out with these clowns for a while
Do ya good
After Pete leaves with his friends, Bill and Claire look at each other
: "'"  -    - "" drives a black, beat-up '66 Grand Prix
Carl and Lanie are in the back seat, and Pete rides shotgun
The four of them
, are cruising down Van Nuys Boulevard along with many other   and - filled with  looking for action

"" (') Oh my, oh my
Keep it in your pants, ""
Some big cars nearby rev their engines

The sound of the rough running engine reverberates in Pete's brain
This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment, Carl
Whatiya burn in this thing, ""
"" Texaco
What's wrong with that
Listen
"" You gotta be kiddin'
This is the boulevard
You can't hear yourself think
Pete shakes his bead with disgust

Sheila leans in closer to Pete

Sheila's girlfriends saunter over and lean on the car around her - looking in at Pete
#1 What happened to your face
Nothin'

Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin"
You want some company

Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance
"" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her
Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance
The music is fast, but they dance slow

Sheila looks around and moves closer to Pete
She whispers urgently, worried

You were acting like a different person
Pete laughs, but Sheila doesn't
Who else could  be7 Sheila stares seriously at Pete, but then laughs too

Sheila leans in very close to Pete and whispers in his ear
(') You still care about me
Sure
Sure  do
Sheila pushes her mouth on Pete's and they kiss

: - Mr
Eddy takes the big Pullman along the scenic Mulholland Drive - cruising smoothly
silver-gray Infiniti is moving up fast behind the Mercedes
: ' 600  - Mr
Eddy looks into his rearview mirror
Oh, shit
Is that what  think it is
Pete turns and looks back
car is  them, the silver-gray Infiniti
The two assistants in the backseat turn nonchalantly to take a look - then they return their look to Mr
Eddy
Mr
Eddy starts to take a slow burn - keeps looking at the Infiniti in the rearview mirror
The assistants look to one another take a deep breath
Mr
Eddy slows slightly and then keeps the Pullman steady at 32 m
p
h
The Infiniti moves up ten feet behind the Pullman, and blows its horn
Mr
Eddy rolls down his window
The assistants are paying close attention - they buckle their seatbelts
Pete notices a tension in the car
He watches Mr
Eddy's face
Mr
Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out the window and waves the Infiniti by
The Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman
When the cars are side by side, the irate  in the Infiniti gives Mr
Eddy "the bird" and flies past
'   as it slams down on the gas pedal
The Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti
Pete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support
The Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash
The Infiniti tries to go faster, but Mr
Eddy's Pullman has much more power
(clenched teeth) This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off
Mr
Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland
The Driver of the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber
At a turn, Mr
Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a mountain and into a little glade of trees
Dust and brush fly everywhere
Mr
Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make for the Driver's side of the Infiniti
Mr
Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll
Mr
Eddy pulls out his
44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips the Driver to the ground
He smashes the butt of his gun across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood
Mr
Eddy's assistants each draw
45's and point them at the Driver
Mr
Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man
'   '
Mr
Eddy hits the Driver in the side of the head with his gun
(') (scared shitless) didn't say anything
#1 Tell him you won't tailgate
won't ever tailgate
' 35
No
'
' ' ,
'    , ' , ' (hitting the driver once again - hard) '
'
'll get a manual
(almost a whisper) and study it
(kicking the man) ' ""
Mr
Eddy and his assistants return to the Pullman - get in and slam their doors
Mr
Eddy throws the Pullman into reverse and pulls back off the hill onto Mulholland Drive
He eases the car into "drive" and leaves the crying and beaten tailgater behind
: ' 600  - Mr
Eddy rotates his neck - shaking out some adrenaline remnants
Pete is visibly shaken by what he has seen
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing  can't tolerate
can see that
'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at
say 45 m
p
h
Eight, nine car lengths
hundred and sixty-two feet
At sixty
Fifteen car lengths
About two hundred and seventy feet
(to his companions in the reariew) What'd  tell ya
Mr
Eddy smiles and they continue along their way
: /
'  - The Pullman pulls off the street into Arnie's
Mr
Eddy and his assistants stay in the car
Pete opens his door
Wait a minute
Mr
Eddy takes out a couple of one hundred dollar bills and puts them into Pete's hand
Thanks, Mr
Eddy
No
Thank you
'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow
Mr
Eddy reaches into the glove compartment and takes out a videotape
He holds it out to Pete
(') You like pornos
Pornos
Yeah
Give ya a boner
No thanks, Mr
Eddy
Mr
Eddy tosses the tape back in the glove compartment
Suit yourself, champ
Okay
Well, 'll see ya then
You will
: '  - Ed and Al are staring at the Pullman
They see Pete get out
They notice the man driving the Pullman
You recognize that guy
Yeah
Laurent
: : - Pete walks out his front door with a lunch box and jumps in the Camaro
He fires up the big engine and heads off for work
Ed and Al follow
: '  - Pete is on a skate - working under a car
The radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it gives him a headache
The tune is one of Fred Madison's be- bop saxophone pieces
Pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio
He changes the station
, another mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete
Why'd you change it
liked that
Well,  didn't
Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car, he lays on the skate - unable to work
car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage
Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors
He sees a car door open and Mr
Eddy's feet appear and walk in his direction
Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car
He stands as Mr
Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees - back behind Mr
Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car - a beautiful blonde-haired , who looks exactly like Renee
- she looks exactly like Renee except she is about eight years younger
The girl is staring right into Pete's eyes
Mr
Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from Pete
Mr
Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between Pete and the girl
'm leavin' the Caddy, like  told you
Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today
(regaining his composure) Sure
Sure, Mr
Eddy
You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow
If you think you can finish it, 'll be back later today
It'll be ready
You're my man, Pete
Mr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but aliows
Mr
Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the Pullman is waiting
Pete watches her walk and move
He watches her until Mr
Eddy drives her away
She steals one last glance back at Pete before she disappears
When she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this beautiful girl over again in his mind
The scene is accompanied by Lou Reed's version of "This Magic Moment"
: : - Pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed
He  a succession of highly-amplified  at intervals with eerie stretches of silence:  in fractured cadence a distant  - a  buzzing slowly in the room a ' wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of
Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion
Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady
Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily
He moves toward his bedroom door
As he moves the amplified  shift
He can hear laughter
The laughter seems to be , but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter - to hide it
Pete opens his door and peers out
Pete's  down the hall toward the living room - his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction
They are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth
They are not looking directly at him
They seem to be looking, but not seeing
Pete's parents  down the hall toward Pete's room
There is no one there - just an empty hallway
Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again
Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no one in the living room
It's empty
: - '  - Pete turns from the hallway and comes back in his room - unsettled and confused
He can hear laughter coming from the living room
: - Ed is behind the wheel
Al is in the passenger seat
Ed is looking at the Dayton house
Al's head is bent, looking down
At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss streaming into an empty coffee cup
The camera stays on the top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition
Al's head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street
He closes the door and zips up his trousers
: - '  - Pete paces the room
Finally he stops himself, throws on his black leather jacket and opens his bedroom door
He looks down the hall
No one is in the living room
He walks out of the house
: - Ed and Al watch Pete get in his Camaro and drive off
They follow
: - Pete drives through the night - up Ventura Boulevard with the "Cruisers"
He looks in the other cars and looks at the on the street
He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows
He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando valley neighborhood streets
He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn
He lights a cigarette while he waits
In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window
What do you want
Nothin'
You want to go for a drive
don't know
Come on
get in
Sheila hesitates for a moment, then gets in
: - Pete and Sheila drive along dark streets
Come here
Sheila slides across and sits close to Pete
Pete puts his arm around her
She takes a drag from his cigarette and puts her head on his shoulder
Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the car
He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her
She breaks away
Why don't you like me
do like you, Sheila
Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers
How much
Pete kisses her and she kisses him back
They start to feel each other and Sheila takes off her tight sweater
She's wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she unbuttons his shirt
They continue to kiss hard throughout
: - Ed and Al are stopped a half a block behind Pete and Sheila
They're watching the couple as they make love in the front seat of Pete's car
: - Pete and Sheila are naked in the front seat
Sheila clings to Pete as they make love
She's hopelessly in love with him
: : '  - Pete and the other  are working in the garage
The clock on the wall reads: 4:45 p
m
Some of the guys are cleaning up - washing their hands - putting tools away
Pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he notices a  pull up to the front of the garage
The beautiful blonde steps out of the cab and comes up to him
Pete's heart races - she smiles at him
() Hi
'm Alice Wyatt
Pete Dayton
was here yesterday
Yeah,  remember
How would you like to take me to dinner
(laughs uncomfortably) don't know
Okay, then, 'll take you to dinner
Pete hesitates - thinks
Look,  don't think it's a good idea
Alice looks hard at him, then smiles
Where's your phone
have to call another taxi
(pointing) Over there
Alice walks to the office inside the garage - picks up the phone and dials information
(into phone) Can you give me the number for United Cab
She turns and looks at Pete while she's speaking, then listening
(') (into phone) Thanks
Alice dials the number
(') (into phone) Yes,  need a taxi at Arnie's Auto Repair, the corner of Fifth and
Pete has walked over
He takes the telephone out of her hand
(into phone) We won't be needing a cab, thanks anyway
He hangs up the phone
Why don't we just skip dinner7 : '   - Pete and Alice pull up to the cheap motel in Pete's Camaro
Pete gets out and leaves Alice in the car
She waits and watches him go into the office
: '   -    - Ed and Al are watching Pete and Alice
They watch Pete come out of the office and take Alice into one of the motel rooms
'Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat
Al shakes his head with anger mixed with a lot of envy
: '   -   - Pete and Alice enter the room
There is a double bed, a little desk, two bedside tables with lamps, a floor lamp, and a bathroom
They don't notice any of this
Just inside the room Alice takes Pete's hand and they turn to each other
Alice puts Pete's hand between her legs
She moves up close to him and closes her eyes
They kiss tenderly at first - then hotter
(whispers) Take off my clothes
: '   -   - Pete and Alice are naked on the double bed in just the glow of the motel's neon lights coming in between the window curtains
They're up on their knees - right next to each other
They look in each other's eyes as their hands move and touch
Alice smiles with a wild, dreamy look in her eyes
Pete puts his hand between her legs and Alice kisses him with a frenzy
They fall back on the bed
: '   -   - Pete and Alice make violent love on the bed
Alice is hungry
: '   -   - Alice and Pete are dressed
Alice is still breathing hard
She moves up close to Pete by the motel room door
Her hand is shaking as she touches his cheek
(whispers) want more
Me, too
Can  call you
Yeah
Call me at home
'll give you the number
(kissing him) Okay, baby
: '   -    - Ed and Al watch Pete and Alice leave the motel room, get in the car and drive off
Ed starts his car and he and Al follow them
: '  - Pete and Alice are riding side by side - Alice's head is on his shoulder
Alice looks up at Pete as he drives - she smiles
The light from headlights behind them catch Alice's attention
Her eyes dart back to a car that could be following them
(fear) Is that car following us
Pete glances in the rearview mirror - sees the headlights
At the last moment he pulls a hard right and accelerates down the street
The car follows - they both see it
'll lose 'em at the light
Alice steals a look back
don't recognize the car
At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly peels out between on-coming cross traffic
He swerves between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view
Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier and trap them
lean on their horns
Pete and Alice have lost them
: : - Establish
: - - it starts to ring
(voiceover) 'll get it
Pete enters the kitchen where his mother goes for the ringing phone and gets to it before she does
(into phone) Hello
(phone voice) It's me
Hi
can't see you tonight
(disappointed) Okay
have to go somewhere with Mr
Eddy
Sure
think he suspects something
We have to be careful
miss you
Pete is silent
(') Pete
Me, too
'll call you again
Alice hangs up
Pete throws the phone back down on the cradle
It bounces off and he has to hang it up again
He slams it down
What's the matter
Nothin'
: - Pete kick-starts his big Harley and roars angrily out of the driveway
: - Pete rides his cycle fast through neighborhoods
: - Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers"
He spots "'s" car parked at "Tops"
He pulls in beside "'s" car and shuts down the engine
The usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila
Pete goes up to "" and Carl and says hello
He lights a cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the awning above
"" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad mood
Sheila is over with her girlfriends
She hasn't seen Pete arrive
Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction
She looks like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything
She keeps looking - staring
Sheila's  she sees "", Carl and a lot of , but Pete is not there
Pete looks at Sheila
He's unsettled and confused by her staring, but not seeming to see him
He watches her turn away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out to dance to the  music
Pete watches her dance
Suddenly, he can't see her
He thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the building - out of view
He moves to look and his head is struck by a violent pain
He grabs his head with his hand and leans forward
"" grabs his arm
"" You okay, man
What
"" You okay
What's wrong7 Pete looks up at ""
He doesn't seem to recognize him - "'s" head is a featureless blur
Pete shakes his head trying to drive out the pain
He looks over again for Sheila
He sees her there dancing with her girlfriend
"" Pete
You okay
Yeah
Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "" - recognizing him
(') 'm, okay
You okay
"" Sure, 'm okay
Some drunk  move over to Sheila and her girlfriend
They cut in on the girls
The guy with Sheila puts his hand around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind
She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter - laughing with his buddy
"" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post
Pete crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila
He slams his fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in the process
The man goes down bleeding
Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready for a fight
He hits the man in the gut - the man's head goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's face
The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then continues on as the man falls to the floor
Pete picks him up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off
Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger
Sheila is there beside him
Where'd you come from
've been here
You were lookin, right at me
was
Yeah
Sheila sinks into his arms
didn't know you cared
Come on
Pete takes her to the Harley and they blast off
: '   -   - Pete is making desperate love to Sheila in the same room - the same bed, as with Alice
(whispered pain) Pete
Pete
Pete keeps on - harder - obsessed
When he comes, he crashes down on Sheila, who wraps her arms around him tight
She doesn't know what is going on with him
Her eyes are open wide as she listens to his frantic breathing
She doesn't know what to say - or what questions to ask
: '   - Ed and Al are staring silently at the motel and the Harley parked out in front
What a fuckin' job
His or ours
Ours, Ed
: - Pete enters through the front door
His parents are sitting as if they have been waiting for him
Hey
Sit down a minute
What's up
Sit down
Pete sits in a chair opposite Bill and Claire
(') You don't look so good

What's goin' on
The police called us
Yeah

They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night
They wanted to know if you remembered anything
But  don't remember anything
What did you tell 'em

Bill and Claire just stare at Pete
(') Please tell me
No
: : - The clock on the wall reads: 1:30 a
m
The house is completely quiet, except for the refrigerator motor
Pete is on the phone in the kitchen talking quietly
Why didn't you tell me you brought me here that night

Eddy smiles
How ya doin', Pete
Okay

Good lookin' blonde
She stayed in the car
Pete just stares at Mr
Eddy
His heart begins to race
(') Her name is Alice
You know  love that girl to death
If  ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, 'd take this
(he opens his coat and pulls out his
44 Ruger Blackhawk and holds it up in front of Pete's face) and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth
Then you know what
(very quietly) What
'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes
Abruptly, Mr
Eddy becomes cool - he holsters his pistol and smiles at Pete
(') So, Pete, you're lookin, better
What have you been up to
'  - staring at Mr
Eddy
: - The phone rings in the kitchen
(voiceover) 'll get it
Pete moves into the kitchen and picks up the phone
Hello
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore
'll be there in twenty minutes
(hesitates) Okay
Alice hangs up
Pete stares at the phone for a moment, then hangs it up slowly
: - Pete pulls his Camaro into the parking lot
When he gets out of the car, he hears a voice and looks
up
Up here
Come on
Pete takes a stairway past a "Coke" machine and meets Alice in front of a second floor room where the door stands open
(') already got the room
Pete follows Alice into the motel room and she shuts the door
: - Ed and Al are parked across the street - watching
: -  - Pete and Alice are sitting on the bed - dressed
bedside table lamp is on
He'll kill us
Are you positive he knows
'm not positive
but

So what do we do
don't know
We should stop seeing each other
No
no
Alice moves closer to Pete and melts into him
She places his hand on her breast and looks in his eyes
(') don't want to live without you
She kisses Pete and pulls up her sweater to let him feel her bare breasts
Pete kisses her back - lost in his longing for her
Alice breaks away
(') We have to get away
We have to get some money
Pete just stares at her
(') know a guy
He pays girls to party with him
He always has alotta cash
Alice puts her band up to Pete's cbeek and lets it drift around
(') He'd be easy to rob
Then we'd have the money
and we could get away
We'd be together
Alice kisses Pete's lips over and over - looking in his eyes
Have you partied with him
used to
Inside, Pete goes crazy with jealousy
You like it
No, honey
It was part of the deal
What deal
He works for Mr
Eddy
What's he do
He makes films for Mr
Eddy
Pornos
Yeah
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people
Pete
Don't
How'd it happen, Alice
It was a long time ago
met someone at this place called Moke's
we became friends
He told me about a job
In pornos
No
job
didn't know what
He set up an appointment for me to see a man
: ' We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room
It feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an office building
Alice is waiting nervously
in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door
There is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a   in tiny briefs is doing bench presses
No one is saying anything
(voiceover) went to this place
They made me wait forever
There was some guy guardin' the door
started gettin' nervous
In another room  could see some guy liftin' () (cont'd) weights
Both these guys gave me the creeps
They never said anything to me
So  just smoked cigarettes and waited
We move in on a nervous    to a   of Alice waiting
We see a   of the man guarding the door
We see a   of the man bench pressing a lot of weight
Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door
The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack
He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through
Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking
She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room
There are about   in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls
There is only one chair in the room - Mr
Eddy is sitting in it
No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room
She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair
They all just stare at her silently
She looks around nervously - her eyes return to Mr
Eddy's
Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and cocks it against her head
Alice goes weak in the knees
Her eyes fill with fear
The men continue to stare
Mr
Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well
"
Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't asked for it with words
Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she knows how
The men just stare without expression
When she is completely naked, Mr
Eddy gestures her over to him
Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making herself available for whatever he wants
Mr
Eddy's  - Alice looks in his eyes
She reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek
: -  - Alice's hand reaches up and strokes Pete's cheek
Why didn't you just leave
Alice doesn't say anything
She drops her hand - looks down
(') You liked it
If you want me to go away, 'll go away
The feelings shift inside Pete
Alice looks in his eyes
don't want you to go away
Alice smiles a little - leans in and they kiss
(whispers) love you, Pete
They kiss some more
(desperate whisper) love you, Alice
They start to make love - undressing each other and kissing all the while
Alice stops
So, should  call Andy
Andy
That's his name
Andy
Our ticket out of here
Yeah
Call him
Alice gets serious
'll set it up for tomorrow night
You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock
Don't drive there
Take a bus
Make sure no one follows you
His address is easy to remember
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place
It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street
'll be upstairs with Andy
The back door will be open
That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there
At eleven fifteen, 'll ask Andy to fix me a drink
When he does, you can crack him in the head
Okay
Okay
Lemme call him now
Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night
Okay
Still entwined with each other, Alice reaches for the phone and dials a number
It starts to ring and she smiles at Pete when she hears it being answered
Andy
It's me, Alice
How ya doin
(whispers) Andy

could come to your house
That sounds good
Around nine
Yeah, me too, Andy
Great
See ya then
She hangs up the phone
(') Set
Why are ya goin' so early
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby
What if Andy tips off Mr
Eddy
Are you kidding
've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny
What about tonight
Whatiya gonna do about Mr
Eddy tonight
'm not goin' home tonight
'm goin' somewhere else
(off his look) To a girlfriend's house
(she smiles) But, we still have a coupla things to take care of
Oh, yeah
What else
Alice reaches down between their legs
Pete smiles
This
and this
They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly - then wildly
Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete
(') Are you my man
(getting hotter) Yes
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete
Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means
(') Are you
Pete stares at her - then nods
: - Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway
When he gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front step
She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to see him
She  turns and looks up the street - she (total horror) '
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this time
Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step
(frightened) Sheila
She heads toward him
Sheila, what is it
What are you doin' here
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you
Sheila
You fuck me whenever you want
You don't call
Tell me who she is
Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his shirt
Hey
Sheila
What's the ' name
Look Sheila
'm sorry
'
Go home, Sheila
Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest
'
'
She starts crying and hitting him harder
(') Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood
'  the  are even
Bill comes out of the house
Claire is behind him waiting on the front porch
Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground
She is sobbing as she tears at him
Sheila
Stop
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders
Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill
Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly
Come on
Come on in, Sheila
Sheila gets to her feet - crying
She looks down at Pete, who remains lying on the front lawn
For Pete, every word and every sound is  and
The   returns
(to Pete) You are different
Sheila
(to Bill) The phone inside the house starts to ring
Claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it
Sheila
Don't
don't care anyway
'm sorry, Mr
Dayton
won't bother you or any member of your family again
Sheila runs off crying
Pete and Bill watch her go
Claire comes to the door
Pete
There's a man on the phone
He's called a couple of times tonight
Pete pulls himself up
Who is it
He won't give his name
Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it up
Hello
(phone voice) Hey, Pete
How ya doin'
Who is this
You know who it is
Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching Pete
Pete is going crazy with Mr
Eddy on one end, and his parents staring at him on the other
He waves his parents away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly
Mr
Eddy
Yeah
How ya doin', Pete
Okay
You're doin, okay
That's good, Pete
Look
It's late, Mr
Eddy
'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete
Pete doesn't know what to say
You sure you're doin' okay
Everything all right
Yeah
That's good, Pete
Hey
want you to talk to a friend of mine
Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone
There is a long silence
Pete can hear breathing
We've met before, haven't we
Pete freezes
His mind is scrambling
don't think so
Where was it that you think we've met
At your house
Don't you remember
No
No,  don't
We just killed a couple of people
What
Pete can hear Mr
Eddy laugh in the background
You heard me
We thought we'd come over and tell you about it
Pete is getting pale with fear
What's goin' on
Great question
In the east
the far east
when a person is sentenced to death
they're sent to a place where they can't escape
never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head
it could be days
weeks
or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced
This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think
It's been a pleasure talking to you
Pete can hear the phone being passed again
Pete
just wanted to jump on and tell you 'm really glad you're doin' okay
The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his fate
He hears a  and turns
Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him
staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something, but not seeing
- The hall and living room beyond
There is no one there
: -   - City Bus pulls up to the stop
The doors open and Pete climbs on
: - Pete rides along in the empty bus
He stares at his reflection in the dark window
: -   - The bus stops and Pete gets out
He starts walking
: - We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place"
Pete walks up the street looking at numbers
He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House
He stares at the house from the sidewalk
Lights are on upstairs and down
The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house
Pete looks at his watch
It reads: 11:05 p
m
He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back
He stops and listens
He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side
He freezes - listening
He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece
He hears echoing sounds of love making
He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door
It opens
: '  - Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room
Pete stops short and stares
movie projector is running in the living room
porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end
Alice is in the porno film
man is fucking her from behind - with of flesh banging flesh
Her face is in the foreground
Her eyes look out directly at Pete
She is loving every minute of it
Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control
He looks around
He sees clothes scattered about
He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it
He looks up the stairs
Feet appear at the top of the stairs
They start down
Pete runs for the bar
Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar
He can hear Andy approaching
He can hear Andy gather two glasses
He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film
He clenches his teeth with rage
Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him
They see each other
Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head
Andy falls
The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead
Pete turns
Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties
Lipstick is smeared around her mouth
She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase
Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her
These images jump and spin in Pete's mind
He moves unsteadily toward her
You got him
(still holding the figurine) Alice,
Pete starts to tremble
He drops the figurine
He tries to embrace her
There is a crashing noise behind him
Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head,
Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down
When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms
This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table
There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead
'  - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor
(amazement - no feeling) Wow
Pete pulls himself off the floor
Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body
While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on
On the sofa next to it lay Andy's trousers
She goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band
Alice hands the roll to Pete
(') Put this in your pocket
Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck
These items she puts inside the empty pillowcase
Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on
Pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything
She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating
(') You all right
, We killed him
You killed him
Alice
Alice slides up close to Pete
It was an accident
Accidents happen every day
Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding on for dear life
Alice
(pushing back) We gotta get the stuff and get out of here
Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase
Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur
He looks around the room, which spins in and out of focus
His eyes land on, a  in a frame on the wall
This photo troubles him
Pete squints, then points to the photograph
Is that you
Are both of them you
- Four people appear in the frame: Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr
Eddy
Alice stops and comes back
She looks at the photo, walks closer to it, and points at herself
That's me
She turns to Pete
Pete is staring at the photograph - at Alice and Renee in the photograph
His nose is bleeding profusely
(') Pete
Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt
Where's the bathroom
Up the stairs - down the hall
Pete runs up the stairs	- about to get sicker
Alice watches him go with a nuance of	disdain
: '  -  - Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the hallway
, Pete wanders down this "changed" hall
On his left, he identifies a door with the number 25 on it
He pauses for a moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he comes to a door with the number 26 on it
He enters through this door
Inside is a  in front of a mirror with a
Her arms are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her from behind
The man's face is blank, featureless, and is buried in the woman's back - we can't see it
Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror
He's looking at her reflection in the mirror
Pete's head is pounding
/ (to Pete) Did you want to talk to me
Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe
/ (') (laughs) Did you want to ask me "why"
Pete staggers out of the room
He closes the door
The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's hallway
The doors no longer have numbers
Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering
He starts down the stairs
: '  -   - Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at the desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and jewelry
She has a  in her hand
Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's face as Pete makes his way to her
His head is still throbbing with pain
His focus goes from her face to the gun - which is pointing right at him - back to her
Alice smiles
Don't you trust me, Pete
She laughs and hands him the pistol
(') Stick that in your belt
She shows him the pillowcase filled with loot
(') (going through the loot) Look at all this shit
know a fence
he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car
(looks up at him) We can go anywhere
Alice
Alice grabs Pete's arm and hurries him toward the door
Come on, baby
: '  -  - Alice takes Pete to Andy's car and throws him the keys
You drive
Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase in the back
Pete takes the revolver out of his belt
He opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits inside
He sets the pistol on the seat between them
He looks up at her
She smiles wildly
Pete slalms the door - starts the car and they drive off
: -     - Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the end of a street at the edge of a desert
Alice gets out into a hot wind
Pete stays in the car as she goes up to the house
Pete's : He watches Alice ring the doorbell
She waits in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in the wind
opens the door
Alice says something to him - Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his driver's side window is down
All he can hear is the hot wind blowing
The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in the car
The Houseboy and Alice exchange information
The Houseboy points out toward the desert
Alice turns back to the car
The Houseboy watches her
: '  - Alice gets into the car
Come on
Pete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive
The Houseboy is still standing - watching them
(') We have to go to the desert
He's at his cabin
Pete and Alice drive off
The Houseboy continues to watch them
: - -  - We see the clean moving  illuminated by headlights
We're floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape
: - Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert
: - Pete and Alice drive up to a    built on stilts next to a dry lakebed
They both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door
There is no answer
Alice opens the door, but there is
We'll have to wait
The hot wind continues to blow
Alice and Pete walk back down to the car
The  are on and Alice reaches in through the window and switches on the
She can't get anything in but static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out
She hits the "seek" button
The radio starts to search
Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her
Alice walks slowly to him
The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then drifts toward them
Why me, Alice
Why choose me
The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with longing
Alice begins to dance
She takes Pete's hand and pulls him close to her
So we can be together
You still want to be with me, don't you Pete
Alice gives Pete that wild smile
(') More than ever
She kisses Pete over and over
He begins to kiss her back
She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them
The scene is out of a dream
Alice and Pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind whips at their bodies
They sink down on the soft ground and start making love
The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, bathing them in a pristine glow
The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static for another station
The music it finds now is  and Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with Pete
She is the aggressor, highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not giving, insatiable
The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light
They become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light
Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her
The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static
The radio strains to hold the station
Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice
He chokes with emotion
want you
want you
With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness
The wind billows a black cloud of dust around them
Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear
You'll never have me
Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him from above
She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears within it
Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness
He's holding his head and shaking
As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the headlights and we see that it is   -
As Fred stands up, the car's   and the
Fred looks at the car
He sees some movement inside
Fred looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat
- it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party
Hello
Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now standing in the doorway
Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty
He looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the doorway
Here  am
Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion
He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside
Fred stops in the doorway
He looks around
Where's Alice
Alice who
Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room
Fred stares at him
(') Her name is Renee
If she's told you her name is Alice, she's lying
(filled now with anger) , Fred freaks, scared to death
He bolts down the stairs to the car, stumbling more than once
Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical charge by the use of the headlights and radio
The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin
He starts toward Fred
The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically
The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car, The engine catches
Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is reaching for him
Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes off across the dark desert
: - Fred pulls up onto the two-lane highway
An old, rusted roadsign is posted there
It reads: " "
: Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway"
The wind is picking up even stronger than before
big storm is blowing in
Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it
Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it
He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story building
: -  - Fred walks up to the registration desk, where a  is smiling at him in a half-baked way
You just got in before the big storm hits
Fred pulls the roll of bills from his pocket
need a room
: -   - The hallway is strangely similar to Pete's vision upstairs at Andy's
Fred comes to the door numbered 25, looks at his key which says "25" and unlocks the door and enters
: -  25 - Fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under the pillow on the bed
He sits on the edge of the bed
He takes a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches
Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow
Lightning cracks outside the window
Fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside table
As the last of the blue smoke drifts away, Fred falls back on the bed
Fred closes his eyes
: : -  - The camera moves in on the door numbered 26
: -  26 - Renee is in bed with Mr
Eddy/Laurent
He and Renee are feverishly making love as the storm rages outside
: '  - criminal investigation is under way
Ed and Al are present, among a fleet of    who are busy dusting for fingerprints and examining the murder site
Hey, Al, look at this
Al walks over to where Ed is looking at the photo on the wall
Al looks at it
It's her, all right
Fred Madison's wife
with Dick Laurent and Mr
Dent- head over there
- that shows , standing between Andy and Mr
Eddy/ Laurent
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place
You know what  think
What's that, Ed
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence
: -  26 - - Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings
Mr
Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her
Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps
Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her
As the door , Mr
Eddy/Laurent wakes up
He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed
: -  25 - - Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up,      - the same attitude he had on the videotape
He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room
He gets up and crosses slowly to a window
He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back
The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel
Fred's : He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away
Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out
: -  - - Fred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door
: -  26 - - Mr
Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears the knock
/ Renee
He goes to the door and opens it a crack
As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr
Eddy/ Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room
Fred hits Mr
Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun barrel
Mr
Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose
/ What the fuck
What's going on
(pointing the gun at him) You're coming with me
Fred puts the pistol up against Mr
Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye
The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr
Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot
Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr
Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car
Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr
Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman
As Fred drives away, a  appears in our window foreground
The hand moves the window curtain further to one side
The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man
The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks
: - Fred is driving along the road
Suddenly he pulls the car off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted spot, stops and gets out
Fred opens the trunk
When he does
Suddenly, Mr
Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred - knocking them both to the ground
Mr
Eddy/Laurent tries to strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great
Fred tears loose and gets Mr
Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head back
Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, searching
appears
it comes into Fred's hand from another
Fred slices Mr
Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down
Mr
Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped around his throat - trying to hold his neck together
Blood is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound
Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right at Mr
Eddy/Laurent's forehead
/ - he lifts his head and stares at Fred
Blood is rushing out of him
/ (wet and jagged) What do you guys want
The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is holding the gun, not Fred
The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a little watchman
He turns it on and hands it over to Mr
Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it
Mr
Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen
Mr
Eddy/Laurent's : As he watches the  screen, we move in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former videotapes
The full frame of the  screen reveals - '  -   - We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room
Marian, Raquel and ' images are being projected on this screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two men
Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several people in shadows behind the light of the projector
Among them we see  and
/ standing next to
Mr
Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up under her skirt
They are watching the porno film
They are watching murky images of sex turning to violence
In a   we see Renee and Mr
Eddy/Laurent in the shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, aroused
The image on the Watchman changes now
- On the Watchman  screen Mr
Eddy/Laurent sees an image of Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him
The Mystery Man's image speaks
(on  screen) Now you can hand it back to me
Mr
Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a hand
Mr
Eddy/Laurent looks up
The Mystery Man has his arm outstretched just as it was on the video image
Mr
Eddy/ Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the Mystery Man
/ (wet and jagged) You and me, mister, we can really out- ugly the sumbitches, can't we
The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr
Eddy/Laurent, who jerks and dies in the dust
The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his ear
The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a '  as he listens
The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun
He is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man
Fred turns to go back to the car
: -  - Fred drives up to his house in Mr
Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes 600 Pullman and stops in front
He gets out of the car, goes to the front door and
There is a  sound
(into intercom) Dick Laurent is dead
: -  - As Fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing Ed and Al pull in to the curb just up the street from Fred and Renee's house
: -  - Fred turns and sees the cop car
He jumps in his car, fires it up, and peels out
The cops give chase
: - Fred is behind the wheel of his car
Behind him are the cops
'  - through the front windshield
The shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit
Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as he races into the vortex
His tormented  blends with the howling  of the police car gaining on him
