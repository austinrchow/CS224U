Dad was a Yankees fan then, so of course  rooted for Brooklyn
But in '58 the Dodgers moved away, so we had to find other things to fight about
We did
And when it came time to go to college,  picked the farthest one from home  could find

She smelled weird, but we loved her anyway
Then Annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm

) 'm thirty-eight years old and 'm about to become a farmer
love my family, love baseball, and  miss New York
Moving in on Ray's face
(

) But until  heard The Voice
'd never done a crazy thing in my whole life
2   - It is dusk on a spring evening
The sky is a robin's-egg blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick
Ray Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him
'If you build it, he will come
' Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the source of this sound
All around him are empty fields
He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to work
'If you build it, he will come
' Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away, the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three sides
On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming
() Annie, what was that
( ) What was what
That voice
What voice
2 Just now
Like an announcement
Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray
We didn't hear anything
Oh
Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work
'If you build it, he will come
' Again, he bolts upright and looks around
Again, he sees nothing
This is beginning to bug him
He calls: Okay, you must've heard that
3 Annie and Karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug
Annie extends her arms palms upward, and calls to Ray
Sorry
Come on
Dinner
Annie leads Karin inside
4 - Ray looks all around him with an "Okay, fellas, what's the joke
" look on his face
But there is no one there
He puts down his tools and walks toward the house
5 Ray enters, looks at his wife skeptically and joins his wife and daughter setting the table
Was there like a sound truck on the highway, or something
Nape
5 Kids with a radio
Nope
You really hearing voices
Just one
Ah
God
More like a
ballpark announcer
Annie shoots him an "Are you kidding
" look
Ray responds with a shrug
They sit down to eat
What'd it say
'If you build
it, he will come
' If you build what, who will come
() He didn't say
Ooh,  hate it when that happens
Me too
6   '  - They are snuggled together, asleep
All is quiet
Then: 'If you build it, he will come
' Ray's eyes pop open
He looks at Annie, who does not stir
Without moving, he looks around the room
There is no one there
Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks out
He whispers out toward the cornfield: Build what
For who
6  6 Behind him, Annie stirs
Ray
It's okay, honey, 'm just-talking to the cornfield
He sighs and goes back to bed
Annie cuddles up to him
Her eyes are closed, but Ray's eyes remain open
He is puzzled and concerned
7 scene from the 1950 movie Harvey, in which James Stewart insists he is conversing with an invisible rabbit
8   ' ittle Karin is watching Harvey while she eats her breakfast
Ray enters, looking like he had very little sleep, and promptly turns the  set off
Why'd you do that
It was funny
Trust me, Karin, it's not funny
The man is sick
He's very sick
Annie enters, putting on her coat
Karin, if you're finished, get your coat and school bag
Let's go
Karin bolts from the table
Uh honey, 'll take her today
'v-e got some errands in town
Far out
She takes off her coat and kisses Ray as he takes-the car keys and heads outside
Annie sits at the kitchen table
What if the voice calls while you're gone
Take a message
Right
He exits
She grins, turns on the  and watches Harvey
9
-  9 Ray's car pulls up, Karin runs out and Ray drives off
10
'  -  10 Ray is plugged into some weird-looking contraption, having his hearing examined
Then the Doctor shines a penlight into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away
Well,  can't find anything wrong could recommend a shrink, but hey, people hear things all the time heard a voice once
was still living with my parents, 'then
They worked in the circus, so  was raised in the circus, and  was training to be a clown
This one day, 'm putting on my little red nose and  hear a voice, tells me to go to medical school
Here am
Ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run
11    -  11 Farmers are loading up with seed, fertilizer, and other farmer stuff
This is the kind of place where people also linger to exchange gossip, swap lies, and pass the time
Ray is off to one side, chewing the fat with an old-timer
11  11 In all those years, did you ever
() 've heard that sometimes farmers out in the field
hear things
Voices
- You hearing voices
() No
It's just that  heard some farmers do, and
, of course, don't, so  was wondering if  was doing something wrong, or something
Did you ever hear voices out there
(calls from her ) Who's hearing voices
- Ray is
Out in the fields
Now, everyone in the store turns to look at Ray
No
No, 'm not
Really
But the people still stare
Ray addresses them
Noises
That darn tractor, it's
(forces a nervous ) Well, 'll just get some 3-in-1 oil, that should
( -) Nice talking to you
12 '  -  12 Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work
breeze picks up
He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks around
All he sees are the empty fields
Insects make the only sounds
He goes back to work
Then: 'If you build it, he will come
' 12  12 He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around, but there is no apparent source of the voice
Ray is pissed
All right, who are you, and what the hell do you want from me
All he hears is a faraway echo
'If you build it, he will come
' This is serious
Ray shakes his head and repeats the words to himself
If you build it
As he thinks about these words,,some unexplained impulse causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion of the cornfield between him and the house
13    L3 For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares in over the lawn
Standing on the edge of the field, is the figure of a man with his back to us
Before we can see anything else, the image disappears
14  14 Ray's eyes widen
he will come'
i5      1 5 The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the man
He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind
He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see his face, the image disappears
10 16 16 Ray's mouth opens
He half-laughs, as if to say "This can't be
" But whatever is in his mind won't go away
he will come
17 17 Now we see him in head-and-shoulders
He has the muscular neck of an athlete
As he slowly turns we start to see a bit of his weathered face before the image flares out
18 18 Wheels are turning inside his head
He is trying to figure all this out
In the distance, a bell is ringing
He looks
19
- 19 Annie is on the veranda ringing the dinner bell hanging by the front door
Yo, Ray
Food
20     -   20 We see Ray emerge slowly from the fields, the twilit sky changing colors behind him
21 21 Annie leans against a post, lazily watching Ray approach
She likes how he moves, and how he looks
Hiya, cutie
Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto the swing
He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes
Annie
11 21 21 ( ) Ray
You're not going to believe this
You heard the voice again
Wait, this gets better,  just saw a vision
Get out of here
swear to God
An actual vision
We're going to have to burn you at the stake if this keeps up
know
22
- 22 family is eating dinner
Ray seems lostin thought
Hey, you don't suppose this could be like an acid flashback, do you
never took acid
Maybe you will someday, and it's a flash forward
Annie, there's more
You're subscribing to the Enquirer
think  know what 'If you build it, he will come' means
12 22 22 Oooh, why do  not think this is a good thing
think it means if  build a baseball field out there, Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to come back and play ball again
You're kidding
Uh uh
She whistles
This is serious
Yeah
23
'  - 23 Ray and Annie are putting little Karin to bed
Boy,  thought my family was crazy, but this
this is the craziest thing 've ever heard
know
It's totally nuts
mean, Shoeless Joe, he's
() Died in '51
And he's the one they suspended, right
- Right
He still dead
Far as  know
13 24
' - 24 Ray and Annie in their pajamas, brushing their teeth, getting ready for bed
You know what amazes me
No one could ever get you to believe in astrology, or , or reincarnation, or heaven, or any of that stuff
But this
think this shows real personal growth, Ray
Thank you
Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled
She hugs him
Oh, sweetie
hope you know that even though  make jokes, 'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you
He offers her a weak smile and exits
25
''  - It is dark
For a few seconds it is quiet
Then: Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing
If  did, 'd forgotten it
Ray sits up in the dark
always felt cheated  never got to see him play
He was supposed to be so graceful, and agile
So to actually get to see him play again
to let him play again, to right an old wrong
He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it
Annie turns on the light
Wait a minute, Bosco
Are you actually thinking of doing this
14 25 25 No
() mean,  can't think of one good reason why  should,-but
(takes a breath) 'm thirty-eight years old,  have a wife, a child, and a mortgage, and 'm scared to death 'm turning into my father
What's your father got to do with this
Ray tries to picture his father in his mind
He speaks softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him
never forgave him for getting old
By the time he'was as old as  am now, he was ancient
He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them
For all  know, he may have even heard voices, too, but he sure didn't listen to them
The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years knew him
Annie, 'm scared that that's what growing up means
'm afraid of that happening to me
And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it
(looks at her) want to build that field
Do you think 'm crazy
She looks at him with great understanding
Yes
He smiles wanly
She touches his face lovingly
also think that if you feel you really have to do this
then you should do it
They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much
He takes her in his arms
Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting
15 26   - 26 Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze
bee buzzes near one
The light is yellow
Suddenly, the stalks bend violently to the ground as Ray's tractor plows them under
27    27 Ray drives, Karin rides shotgun, holding the large detailed diagram Ray has drawn of the ballpark's dimensions
Ty Cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time
His glove was called 'the place where triples go to die
' 28   28 The tractor turns to plow under more corn, and we can see the size of the area Ray has staked off with marker sticks
(
0
) Could he hit
(
) Lifetime 356 average
Third highest in history
Karin whistles
29   29 By the side of the road, an old man and woman stand and watch these neighbors-plow under their
corn
They look at each other as if to say "Could it be Communists
" (
0
) Why'd they called him Shoeless Joe
30    -  30 It is days later, an area the size of a baseball field has been plowed under, and Ray is seeding it
(
) When he was still in the minors, he bought a new pair of spikes and they hurt his feet
About the sixth inning he took them off and played the outfield in just his socks
The other players kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and the name stuck
16 31    - - 31 We can see roughly where the grass has been planted, and where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths
Ray stands stock-still in the moonlight, water hose in hand, patiently misting the baby grass, little Karin at his side
(
0
) Then in 1919, his team, the Chicago White Sox, threw the World Series
(
0
) What's 'threw'
(
0
) They lost it on purpose
Gamblers paid them to
32 32 Now, dozens of families stand to watch silent and dumb-eyed, at what has obviously become a daily spectacle among the townspeople
Some snap photos
(
0
) Except Shoeless Joe
33     - Ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller, as Annie and Karin follow behind with rakes
On either side of the base paths, the infield and outfield grass is growing
(
0
) Nobody could prove anything one way or another, but he was the one guy who probably wasn't in on it
34
- 34 Ray, Annie and Karin wait as the cashier totals up their load of lumber and hardware
mean if he was supposed to be throwing it, how do you explain the fact he hit 375 for the series and didn't commit one error
Huh
can't
17 34  34, Twelve hits, including the series' only home run
And they said he was trying to lose
It's ridiculous
That's 855 dollars, sixty-four cents
From
, we hear oooh
Ray turns and notices for the first time that a crowd of spectators -- employees and customers -- has been watching him and whispering among themselves
They look at him as if he had two heads
Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his purchases
He deadpans to Annie: We'd better notify Mars to send us more money
( ) Remlak won't like that
That's his problem
And tell him to make it in Earth dollars this time
Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier
Thank you
Have a nice day
Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin
The farmers watch, obviously trying hard to figure this one out
35     -  35 Ray hammers the braces that will support the outfield wall
Karin hands him nails from a bag she wears around her neck
(
) There's a famous story about when he came out of the courtroom, a kid ran up to him, tugged his sleeve and said 'Say it ain't so, Joe
' And Jackson looked down t him and said ''m afraid it is, kid
' 18 35  35 Then what happened
36    36 Annie helps Ray lift a board to what will be the top row
The Commissioner of Baseball suspended eight of the players -- including the great Shoeless Joe Jackson -- for life
What's suspend
They never let him play the game again
They continue to work in silence
37
7 Ray writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc
He appears slightly annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store
He turns to catch the Store Owner staring at him the most intently
What
What
You're the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond, right
Yeah
What about it
(shakes his hand) Greatest damn thing  ever heard
The other employees beam their agreement
At these prices, 'm not surprised
19 37 He wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen
They smile and pat him on the back
Ray cannot decide if they're crazier than he is
Thank you
thank you
38    -  38 Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky
In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green, cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket
Annie and Karin watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night
My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina
He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit
Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe
Ray is smiling wistfully
That's the first time 've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father
Ray considers that
How come
Come on, you
Bed time
Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers
Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps
Careful
Moonl ight butters the Iowa night
They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops
He looks at the field
20 38  38 have just created something totally illogical
That's what  like about it
Am  completely nuts
Not completely
She looks out over the baseball field
It's a good baseball field, Ray
It is kinda pretty, isn't it
Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside
Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field
39   '  -  39 Annie opens her eyes and sees Ray not beside her in bed, but in th window seat, looking out at the empty field
Barely awake, she gets out of bed, shuffles to his side and curls up against him
Any sign
Something's going to happen out there
can feel it
Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep
Outside, the trees are fully leafed
40 '   -  40 The trees are almost bare now, and there's a Halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house
The cornstalks 21 40 40 ,rustle like crumpling paper in the Indian-summer breeze which blows fallen leaves across the empty baseball field while Ray sits in the stands
waiting
41    -   41 it is covered with snow
42
'  42 Ray looks forlornly out the living room window towards his snow-covered baseball field, the merrily blinking lights of the Christmas tree behind him belying his true mood
43  - baby robin tries to pull a worm out of the around
Inside the house, Annie is doing spring cleaning
She looks out the window to see: 44 Ray mowing the outfield grass
He stops, looks around, listens, hears nothing, and continues mowing
45 45 just watches him
46   46 We see the first exhibition game of spring training from Florida, as the announcer talks about a "southpaw" pitcher
47
'   -  47 Little Karin watches the , while Annie and Ray sit at the living room table, financial ledgers spread out before them as they struggle with their accounts
Daddy, what's a southpaw
22 47 47 left-handed pitcher
( ) How bad is it
Well, given how much less acreage we have for corn, 'd say we'll probably almost break even
Jesus
We've spent all our savings on that field
(
) Daddy
Just a minute, Karin
( ) So what are you saying
We can't keep the field
() It makes it real hard to keep the farm, Ray
Ray closes his eyes
(
) Daddy
(a little testy) In a minute, Karin
(
) There's a man out there on your lawn
Ray opens his eyes and turns to see Karin kneeling on the kitchen counter, looking out the window
Ray and Annie exchange a quick glance, and Ray walks to the window
48 48 seen from outside, as Ray's head appears and looks out
He sees something out there and just looks at it
23 49 ' 49 There is a Man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield
Hi es wearing a baseball uniform
Anold-fashionedone
50 50 Ray turns to Annie
She looks out and nods thoughtfully
Annie stays very calm in emergencies
We'll put up some coffee
You go ahead
Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda
The night sky seems close enough to touch
51 51 On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath, flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life
52 52 steps onto the field
On his uniform is a large "" with an "" in the top crook, an "" in the bottom, and an American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve
53 53 walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field
54 ' 54 Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in left field
Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the waist, hands on hips, he waits
55 55 Ray's mouth is dry
He reaches home plate and picks up one of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls
The back of his neck tingles
Then, he picks up one of the balls
56 56 The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style glove, and waits to field the ball
24 57    57 Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at it
And misses
His face reddens, he clears his throat, and tries again
This time he connects
58   58 He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and falls into left field
The Man runs in for it, scoops it up cleanly and throws it back to the plate
Ray is thrilled
He hits another ground ball, and this too, is fielded cleanly
Then another, which the Man deftly short-hops
Ray hollers out to him
How's the field play
It's good
The ball bounces true
Ray smiles with pride
He tosses up another ball, gives it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually lofted one into the air
But into center field
The Man sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in short center
Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man runs it in, loping toward home plate
Ray's heart thumps
Hi
The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel its weight
Ray Kinsella
Joe Jackson
Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken
It is Shoeless Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from him, trying out all the bats now
Ray isn't quite sure if he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there
Finally, he can't help himself
bet its good to be playing again, huh
It was like having part of me amputated
25 58 Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain his steady voice tries to conceal
've heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs that've been dust for fifty years
That was me
'd wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet
The thrill of the grass
He has found the bat he likes
Can you pitch
( ) Yeah, 'm not bad
Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls
Ray can barely contain his excitement as he races to the mound
He stands on the rubber and faces Joe at the plate
Don't we need a catcher
Not if you can get it near the plate, we don't
Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during which he says aloud to himself: am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson
He makes a pitch
It's not a very good one, and Joe has to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful
He drives the ball against the fence
Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch
Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball
See if you can hit my curve
He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear
26 58  (2) 58 Yes, he can hit the curve
Stick with fast balls, kid
You bet
Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down the third base line
Then a smoker down the first base line
Ray is mightily impressed
Wow
Damn, this feels good
Put it right here, huh
Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot
Jackson hits it out of the park, and beams
Ray brightens up with remembrance
Right, you were a low ball hitter
Oh man,  did love this game
You know, 'd have played for food money
it was the game, the sounds, the smells
You ever held a glove or a ball to your face
Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound
Yeah
And it was riding the trains from town to town
And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms
And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep
Shoot, 'd have played for free
The sound of a screen door turns their
attention to the house
Annie and Karin are coming out to them
My family
Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights
27 58  (3) 58 What's with the lights
"All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field
Makes it harder to see the ball
The owners found that more people could attend night games
( ) Owners
By now, Annie and Karin have joined them
Mr
Jackson: my wife Annie, my daughter Karin
Joe
Ma'm
( ' hand and winks ) Hi
Are you a ghost
Ray and Annie are instantly embarrassed, and try to cover with forced, nervous laughter
Karin
(to Shoeless Joe) She's just kidding
It's okay
( ) What do you think
- You look real to me
Then  guess 'm real
Would you like to come inside'
28 58  (4) 58 Uh, thanks, but
don't think  can
Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite understanding the ground rules here
Joe senses their discomfort and changes the subject
Hey, can  come back again
Yeah
built this for you
There are others, you know
There were eight of us
It'd sure mean a lot to them
Oh man, anytime
They're all welcome here
Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come
Thank you, Ray
appreciate it
See you later, huh
Yeah
See you later
Say it ain't so, Joe
Joe laughs and walks to the outfield
Annie puts her arm around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest
Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night
Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut into the fence
Where's he going
() Through that door in the fence
Since when is there a door in the fence
29 58 ( ) don't know
didn't put one there
Joe reaches the door, opens it, and turns back to Ray, his voice carrying effortlessly through the night air
Hey
Is this heaven
No
It's Iowa
Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks through the door in the fence
Ray and Annie looks at each other in absolute wonder
We're keeping this field
You bet your ass we are
59
'   -  9 You're going to lose your farm, pal
It is Sunday afternoon, and Annie's family is visiting
her mother, pink-faced and white-dentured, sits ramrod straight in an antique rocking chair
Also present are her brother, Mark, and his wife Dee
Come on, it's so big
How can you lose something so big
You misplaced the house once
Yeah, but it turned up two days later, didn't it
Ray, this stupid baseball field is going to bankrupt you
Everybody knows it
All 'm saying is if you wait till you default on your loan, you lose everything
Sell now, my partners'll () 30 59 59 (') give you a more than a fair price and you walk away with a nest egg
Thanks, Mark, but no
What are you holding on to this place for
You've never even liked Iowa
You don't like farming, you don't know the first thing about it --- Hey;  know a lot more about farming than you think
How could you plow under your major crop
( ) What's a crop
Karin enters breathlessly
Daddy, the baseball game is on
Ray beams
Karin returns the smile and reaches her arms out to be picked up
She scissors her legs around her father at belt level, hugging his neck
Excuse us
He exits, carrying Karin
Mark shakes his head
don't believe this guy
'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television
Annie stifles a laugh
He used to be so normal
Does he beat you
What
31 59  (2) 59 He's drinking, right
He doesn't drink, and he doesn't beat me, okay
Now 'll grant you, he has gotten me to worship Satan with him, but just a little
Her mother gasps
Kidding
'm kidding
Her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever
think we need more cheese
She goes into the kitchen, and when she has rounded the corner, she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters: Families
60   6 0 Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice
(Three, including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats
) The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five years to the game they love
Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder
Watch Joe
Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch
good left fielder knows what pitch is coming, and he can tell from the
angle of the bat where the ball's going to be hit
At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches up, and the ball smacks into his glove
Karin cheers
One of the players good-naturedly boos
Showoff
32 60 60 Aw, stick it in your ear, Felsch
Yeah, if you'd run like that against Detroit 'da won twenty games that year
Oh for Pete's sake, that was sixty-five years ago
Give it up, will ya
Hey
, you guys wanna play ball, or what
you muscle-bound jerk
Oh yeah
At least  got muscles
No
At most you got muscles
Come on, asshole, pitch
The good-natured banter stops short, and the other players glare at Weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl and her father in the bleachers
Sorry, kid
It's okay
All right,'Karin
The players resume their practicing and ribbing
61 61 Annie emerges with-her Mother, Mark and Dee, walking toward the bleachers where Karin and Ray are still watching the spirited practice
Ray
Mom's leaving
Oh
Well, it was
you know, thanks for coming
33 61 61 Think about what  said
just want to help
know
Mark just stands there for a moment, the only sounds coming from the players on the, field
thought you two were going to watch some game
Oh,  guess it's not really a game
It's more like a practice
Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern
Ray doesn't understand this reaction
See, there's only eight of them, so they can't play a real game
Eight of what
Ray points to the noisy players on the field
Them
Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into mourning
Mark kneels next to Karin
Karin honey
what are you watching
The baseball men
Do you see any baseball men right now
( ) Of course  do
Mark stands up and shoots Ray an accusing look
Annie's Mother starts to walk away
34 61  (2) 61 don't think it's very polite to try to make other people feel stupid
Annie questions Mark and Dee as they pass her on the way to catch up with Mother
You don't see it
That's not funny, Annie
Her family leaves in a huff
They couldn't see it
Interesting
He and Annie sit beside Karin and watch the players
Each slowly starts to smile
62    -  62 The practice is over, the players are perspired and exhilarated
Ray is over at first base talking with Swede Risberg, the shortstop
Here, look at this
Sixty-five years since  worn this uniform, still fits me like a glove
You must keep in pretty good shape
() died in '75
So  ain't had a cigarette in, what, thirteen years
You don't smoke, do you
No
() Felt good out there today, huh, guys
35 62  62 Fuckin'
Weaver
Buck realizes that once again he has cursed in front of Karin
Oh shit
mean, sorry
'm sorry
Annie calls from the house
Ray
Dinner
() Ra--ay
Dinner
They all laugh
Ray clearly loves being part of this locker room-style comradery
Karin runs to the house
Come on, fellas
Let's hit the showers
( ) See you later, Ray
Right
See you guys
The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the door in the outfield fence
Ray watches them fade out as they go through the door
Then he takes a moment to look around him
The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite beautiful
Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back toward his house
He is the very picture of contentment
Then he hears The Voice
'Ease his pain
' Ray stops short
What
No response
36 62  (2) 62 'm sorry
didn't understand
'Ease his pain
' Ray stops short
What
No response
'm sorry
didn't understand
'Ease his pain
' Whose pain
What pain
No response
Why me
But there is no response
63 63 Ray enters as Annie and Karin are putting dinner on the table
Ray plops- into his chair at the head of the table
Come on, wash up
We've got a meeting after dinner
They're talking about banning books again
Really subversive books like, Wizard of Oz, Diary of Anne Frank --- She notices Ray is strangely silent
What happened to you
The Voice is back
Oh Lord, you don't have to build a football field now, do you
37 63 " 63 (shakes head no) He said
'Ease his pain
' Ease whose pain
asked him
He wouldn't tell me
Shoeless Joe's
don't think so
One of the other players
don't think so
This is a very non-specific voice you've got out there, Ray, and he's really starting to piss me off
Ray nods as Annie serves the meal in silence
64 -  64 Parents stream in past the " Meeting Tonite" sign
Ray and Annie stand by the doorway, talking with Miss Corser, Karin's teacher
(Ray is too distracted by his own thoughts to pay this much attention
) Karin has such a wonderful imagination
Lately, she's been making up these charming little stories about ghosts who play baseball in a cornfield
wonderful imagination
( ) Yes
She gets that from Ray
Miss Corser smiles approvingly
Ray realizes both women are looking at him, now, and he emerges from his thoughts
38 64 64 Hmm
Annie leads Ray inside
65
- 65 Ray and Annie -- along with a hundred or so other grownups -- are sitting in chairs too small for their grownup backsides
Ray is still lost in his own thoughts, doodling "Ease his pain" over and over again, while an Irate Mother has the floor, holding up a novel
and  say smut and filth like this has no place in our schools
large portion of the audience applauds
Annie whispers snarlingly to Ray: Fascist
'd like to ease her pain
Ray is still lost in thought
Mrs
Perkins, the book you are waving about is hardly smut
It is considered by many critics as the classic novel about growing up in the 1960s
(whispers to Ray) read it four times
Funniest book ever read
It's pornography
The Supreme Court said its not
And its author, Mr
Mann --- -- is sick
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer prize-winner, and was widely regarded as the finest satirist of his time
Well  think he's a pervert, and quite probably a Communist, too
39 65  65 The crowd murmurs its assent
( ) What planet are these people from
Ray looks as if he is starting to realize something
( ) The se-called novels of Terence Mann endorse promiscuity, godlessness, the mongrelization of races, and disrespect to high-ranking officers of the United States Army
And that's why right- thinking school boards all across the country have been banning this guy's shit since 1969
( ) Terence Mann
You know why he stopped writing books
Because he masturbates
( ) can't take this anymore
( ) ,Terence Mann
Annie stands and smiles disarmingly
( ) Excuse me, madam, but you're speaking of something about which you don't know squat
Terence Mann was a warm and gentle voice of
reason during a time of great madness
He coined the phrase 'Make Love, Not War
' When others were chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was writing about love, and peace, and understanding
He helped define an era
And a generation
And he helped us laugh at ourselves
cherished every one of his books, and  dearly wish he'd write more
And if you had experienced even a little bit of the Sixties, you might feel the same way, too
40 65  (2) experienced the sixties
No
think you had two Fifties, and moved right on to the Seventies
Oh yeah
Well your husband plowed under his corn and built a baseball field
The crowd "oohs" and "aahs
" Now there's an intelligent response
The weirdo
Ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants to leave immediately
He tugs Annie's sleeve
Annie
But Annie mistakes her husband's intentions
She thinks he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble
( ) It's okay, 'll be cool
(aloud, to the ) At least he's not a book burner, you Nazi cow
Now the crowd erupts
You're both a bunch of weirdos
Annie pulls herself up to her full 5'4" and thrusts an angry finger at
the woman
All right Beulah, you wanna step outside
Huh
The other woman takes a half-step backward
No one has ever seen sweet Annie like this
got a better idea
Let's put it to a vote
Come on
Who's for Eva Braun () 41 65  (3) (') here
Who wants to burn books
Who wants to piss on the Constitution of the United Sates
Anybody
The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise their arms
Little Annie is on a roll, now
All right
Now: who's for The Bill of Rights
Come on
who thinks freedom's a pretty good thing
Let's see those hands
Some people start raising their hands
Who thinks we have to stand up to the kind of censorship they have in Russia
Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands
Annie is thrilled
There you go
All right, America
'm proud of you
mean it
You're beautiful
() Annie, we gotta go
(to the crowd) We gotta go
Ray pulls her from the room
Each is proud as hell, each for a different reason
66
- 66 as they burst out, bubbling over with their enthusiasm
Oh Ray, was that great, or what
it was like the Sixties again
figured it out
( ) 'Step outside, you Nazi cow
' Ha-ha
42 66 - - 66 know whose pain 'm supposed to ease
( ) What
know whose pain 'm supposed to ease
Ray,  just halted the spread of neo-facism in America, and you're talking about --- Terence Mann
What about him
That's whose pain
How do you know that
don't know
just know
was right about building the field, wasn't
What's his pain
don't know
Then how are you supposed to ease it
don't know
None of this questioning has dampened Ray's pride and excitement
Annie shakes her head
Ray
Annie
43 66  (2) 66 (tries to put ) He's my favorite writer too, but
what's Terence Mann got to do with baseball
Ray's smile freezes
Then disappears
He hasn't a clue
67
-  67 montage of Ray at the library: checking indices, reading old magazines, finding newspaper interviews on microfilm, s couring old anthologies, and taking copious notes
Some of the articles include: "Where is Terence Mann Now That We Really Need Him
"
"20 Rumors About America's Greatest Living Ex-Writer"
and , "Terence Mann: Still Ignoring Us After All These Years "
The photographs show Mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes
(
) Annie, it's incredible
68 6 8 Ray and Annie run down the steps to the street for their car, Ray's words racing as fast as his feet
By the early Seventies, the guy decides people have become either too extremist or too apathetic to listen to him
So he stops writing books
He starts writing poetry
About whales and stuff
Then, he starts fooling around with a home computer, and gets hooked
Know what he does now
Annie shakes her head no
He writes software for interactive children's videos
They teach kids how to resolve conflicts peacefully
What an amazing guy
Right
So what's it got to do with baseball
44 68 68 In the April 1962 issue of Jet Magazine, there's a story of his called 'This Is Not  Pipe
' Annie laughs at that
Ray is so excited, he laughs too
It's not his best work, but the hero of the story, a character that Mann created twenty-six years ago, is named John Kinsella
My father
She stops short
-Wow
He gives her a "See
What'd  tell you
" look
What can  say
Big wow, but
what's it got to do with baseball
They are standing by their car
You drive
69 69 Annie drives as Ray excitedly consults his notes
Okay
The last interview-he ever gave was in 1973
Guess what it's about
Mmm
Some kind of team sport
Annie, he was a baseball fanatic
Listen to this: He finds a page and reads from it: 'As a child, my earliest recurring dream was to play at Ebbets Field with Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers
Of course, it never happened, and the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and they torn down Ebbets Field
But even now, still dream that dream
' 45 69 69 That's sad
70
'  -  70 They have arrived home and are walking into the house
He is still spouting things to her his research has uncovered
The man wrote the best books of his generation, he was a pioneer in the civil rights and anti-war movements, he made the cover of Newsweek, he knew everybody, he did everyting
he helped shape his time
He hung out with the Beatles
But in the end, it wasn't enough
What he missed
was'baseball
Annie takes a look at Ray's handful of Xeroxes
Oh my God
What
() As a small boy, he had a bat named 'Rosebud
' Ray disapprovingly grabs the Xeroxes back
from her
Sorry
( ) He hasn't been to a live baseball game since 1958
So to ease his pain, you have to take him to a ball game
Yes
71
71 as they enter and put away their things
46 71  71 Ray, this is nuttier than building the field
No it's not
It's pretty weird,  grant you, but building the field was weirder
Five, ten percent weirder
'm sorry, pal, but  have to nip this one in the bud
We are having moderate to heavy financial difficulties here
You cannot take off for Boston while you're going broke in Iowa
Annie, this is really new territory for both of us,  know, but we're dealing with primal forces of nature, here
When primal forces of nature tell you to do something, the prudent thing is not to quibble over details and --- (starting to get ) But why do you have to go
Why can't the voice send someone else
What's wrong with Shirley MacLaine, she too busy
What does this have to do with you
Ray hears her anger and sits her down
That's what  need to find out
Ray, we're behind on the mortgage
That field ate up our savings
We could lose the farm
won't even stay in motels
'll sleep in the car, and 'll beg for food
No
This is too much
-  understand your need to prove to the world you're not turning into your father, but you've done it
You believed in the magic, and it came true
Isn't that enough
47 71  (2) 71 Annie, it's more than that
know this- is nuts, but there's another reason 'm supposed to do it
feel it
feel it as strongly as 've ever felt anything in my life
There's a reason
What
Just tell me what it is
think something's going to happen at the game
don't know what, but
there's something at Fenway Park in Boston, and  have to be there with Terence Mann to find it
Something he just said changes Annie's mood
Fenway Park
Is that the one with the big green wall in left field
Yeah
dreamt last night you were at Fenway
Uh, was  sitting on the first base side
Yes
About the fifth row
(nods, -) You were keeping score and eating -- a hot dog
had the same dream
'll help you pack
48 72
72- Ray is throwing clothes into a suitcase as fast as he can
Annie reads from a road map she has marked for him
you take that to 93, and then it gets all squiggly, and after that you're on your own
How are you going to find him, anyway
He won't exactly be in the phone book, you know
The article says he has a storefront on Harvard Street next to some place that sells Kosher food
Shouldn't be too hard to find
don't need a tie, do No, dear
Not for a kidnapping
73
73 Ray has packed the car and is getting ready to leave
You'll be okay, right
'll try to sell the combine
We sure don't need it anymore
Karin runs up, grabs Ray behind each ear and hugs and kisses him
So long Tiger
He get into the car and looks up at Annie
'll call you every night
If the team shows up while 'm gone, just tell them
(shakes his head) On second thought, stay away from them
Those guys haven't been near a woman since 1922
Ray, they're not going to make a pass at me
They're'ghosts
They're jocks
Keep away from them
49 7 3  73 She laughs, kisses him, and watches him drive off
74    74 Ray's brave little Datsun chugs along the interstate between eighteen-wheelers, busses, gasoline tankers, auto-transport trucks, and other monsters
75   75 Driving
gas stations
boring roadside restaurants
getting lost
looking at the map
signs that announce the "Entering" and "Leaving" of various states
days turning to nights and back again
Finally, the green hills of Massachusetts
76  -  76 He emerges from a tunnel and enters traffic, the likes of which he has not seen in a very long time
On one side of the expressway there are sweaty factories, and on the other, old wood-frame apartment buildings with advertising for long-forgotten products painted on the sides
Lunatic drivers abound
We are not in Iowa anymore
77
-'  77 He rehearses as he drives
Hi, 'm Ray Kinsella
'm really a big fan of
() How do you, Mr
Mann,  have to take you to a baseball game
( ) All right, put your hands up and get in the trunk
() Good
78   -  -  78 Ray drives slowly, looking for a store that sells Kosher food
But in this old newish neighborhood, there are dozens: butcher shops, delis, bakeries, groceries
50 79-
79 Ray is asking the spritely Jewish Butcher for directions
He lives right around here
Do you know him
'm a friend of his
The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion
He's sort of a tall, black man
If you was much of a friend, he'd of give you the directions himself
Ray nods
He knows this is useless
That's a good point
Thank you
Ray exits
80    80 Ray has stopped an Ancient Jewish Woman on the street
She looks from Ray's Iowa license plate to Ray's face
don't know where he lives
But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it is clear that if she did know -- which she probably does -- she certainly wouldn't tell him
81   81 Ray has pulled his car to the edge of the gas station -- he is not buying gas -- and slips a five dollar bill to the ruddy-faced, teenaged Irish Pump Jockey
Two blocks down
Right hand side
First store that don't have a chicken in the window, is his
51 82
- 82 In between a deli and a Kosher butcher shop, Ray finds a storefront with blacked-out windows
He enters an open hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as well as stairs to the apartments above it
There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall
Ray checks the names
He smiles
83 - 83 All but one have immigrant names
The first one reads: #1: -
84 84 Ray turns to the storefront door
Instead of a buzzer there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from a hole at the top of the door
Next to the wire is a handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell
" Ray laughs
This guy is great
He pulls on the wire
On the other side of the door, a bell rings
Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness
He takes a breath
He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door
He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of meeting one of his cultural heroes
The door opens
Terence Mann is menacingly huge
He glares at Ray and roars: Who the fuck are you
- Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead
Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's a great pleasure 'Co finally --- The door slams in his face
It takes Ray a few seconds to realize the interview is over
He rings the bell again
The door opens
Manns large frame fills it
We got a learning disability here
52 84 84 ( ) Mr
Mann, 've come 1500 miles to see you at the risk of losing my home and alienating my wife
If  could just have a minute
Please
Look
can't tell you the secret of life, and  don't have any answers for you
don't give interviews,  am no longer a public figure,  just want to be left alone
So fuck off
Just one minute
'm begging you
Mann looks him over
Then he sighs
One minute
Mann turns and enters the storefront
Ray follows
85
' It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable
There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and a postage scale
few workbenches have software and spread sheets strewn across them
In the back are a couple of personal computers
On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther King
with Bob Dylan
with Timothy Leary
rann being arrested at some demonstration
Mann at Woodstock
Mann's gruff voice pulls Ray's attention away from these relics
Your minute ain't getting bigger
Okay
understand your desire for privacy, and i wouldn't dream of intruding if this weren't extremely important
Oh God
don't do causes anymore
53 85 - 85 This isn't a cause
don't need money, or an endorsement
Refreshing
You once wrote: 'There comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place, and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds, to show you what is possible
' Oh my God
What
You're from the Sixties
Well, actually --- Out
Out
Just wait a second --- Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect
Back to the Sixties
Back
He is backing Ray out the door
If you'd just --- There's no place for you here in the future
Get back while you still can
He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut
Ray slams it open
He's pissed
You've changed, you know that
54 85  (2) 85 Mann stops fuming and considers that
He sighs, sadly
Yes
suppose  have
How's this
(smiles and makes the peace sign) 'Peace, love, dope
' () Now get the fuck out of here
And he slams the door shut again
Ray is flabbergasted
He is thinking furiously
Then he notices that in slamming the door, the latch has not locked in place
He thinks, makes up his mind, and quietly opens the door
Mann has returned to work, his back to the door
Ray enters the loft, his left hand in his jacket pocket
When he is halfway across the loft, he clears his throat
Mann spins around
Now you've pissed me off
Okay, hold it right there
He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in his jacket
was hoping  wouldn't have to do it this way
What the fuck is that
It's a gun
What'd you think it is
It's your finger
No it's not
It's a gun
Yeah
Let me see it
Get out of here, 'm not going to show you my gun
Mann sighs, and stands
55 85  (3) 85 Now look
'm not going to hurt you, just need you to go with me for a little while, then -- what are you doing
Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing toward Ray
'm going to beat you with a crowbar till you go away
Understandably, this makes Ray nervous
Whoa
Wait
You can't do that
( ) What, are there rules
There's no rules
Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his head
You're a pacifist
Mann stops
He thinks
He lowers the crowbar
Shit
Ray breathes a sigh of relief
Thank you
All right, are you kidnapping me
What's the deal here
'm sorry
was hoping  could-just convince you to come with me
Then you are kidnapping me
have to take you to a baseball game
You what
56 - 85  (4) 85 Tonight's game
Red
Sox, Twins
Why
Something will happen there
don't know what, but we'll find out when it does
Mann now has no idea what to make of all this, so he just looks Ray over for a few seconds
My name is Ray Kinsella
You used my father's name for a character in one of your stories
John Kinsella
You're seeing a team of psychiatrists, aren't you
() don't blame you for thinking that, but no, 'm not
swear to God 'm the least crazy person 've ever known
Then why are you kidnapping me to a baseball game
read an interview you gave a long time ago about how you always dreamed of playing at Ebbets Field, and how sad you felt when they tore it down
(shakes head no) never said that
You didn't
don't even remember thinking it
Now Ray is ndt sure what to do
This whole
thing is so weird
57 85  (5) 85 Then why go through with it
It's a long story
and 'll tell you on the way
Please
'm not going to get rid of you, am
If you just come to this game with me, 'll never bother you again
Not even a Christmas card
Mann picks up a hat, plops it on his head and heads out the door
86 86 Mann sits tensely beside Ray, who drives with his right hand, while his left hand remains in his pocket, substituting for a gun
You do this often
No
It's my first time
So be gentle
Ray laughs nervously, and is embarrassed to see Mann not sharing the humor
You used to have a sense of humor
Things used to be funny
Ray pulls up at an intersection
He has to choose between left and right
Behind him, cars are honking
Ray doesn't have a clue which way to go
He sighs
'm sorry
This is really humiliating
Which way is-Eenway
Mann shakes his head, then tilts it to the left
Thank you
58 86 86 Ray makes the turn, and heads off down the street
You're really inept at this, aren't you
Ray grins sheepishly and nods
Mann laughs
mean you're like a total bumbler
Ray chuckles his reluctant acceptance of the truth
'Bozo the Kidnapper
(no longer so ) Okay, okay
After a few moments, Ray decidesto break the ice
Can  ask you a question
Something 've always wanted to know
Mann nods
He's been asked this question a million times
No,  never slept with her
You never slept with who
Whoever you were going to ask me about
If 'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said  was with, 'd be in formaldehyde by now
() You slept with a lot of famous women
() What's your question
How'd you get a name like Terence
Mann cannot believe that's the question
Rastus was taken
59 86  (2) 86 Ray knows now to shut up
He returns his attention to his driving, glances up to his rearview mirror, and sees something that causes his eyes to widen in horror
87 - 87 Boston police car on his tail, red lights flashing
(
) Oh no
88
'  88 Mann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back to Ray
Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the ignition
Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle
Nice going, Boze
Okay
don't really have a gun
So don't say anything to this guy, okay
swear to God there's a reason we're supposed to be at this game
Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look
Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them
Ray is desperate
If  get arrested, the press'll be all over you, you'll have to appear in open court, you'll be the lead story on Entertainment Tonight, and your picture'll be on the front page of every tabloid in America
The Policeman knocks on Ray's window
He is young, fresh-scrubbed and earnest
Ray holds up one hand to him
Just a second
(- ) 'Terence-Mann Kidnapped
Also seen in with Elvis
' Mann's eyes narrow
The cop knocks again, more insistently
Ray rolls down-the window
" ' 60 88 88 Sorry
License and registration
Nervously, Ray complies
Mann turns his face toward the passenger side window
Ray's mouth dries up
He has no idea what Mann will do
The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the felonlike photo
Then he looks at Mann
And what's your name,-sir
Mann keeps his face averted
Terry
Where is it that you and Raymond are going, Terry
Fenway Park
We're going to the ball game
(turns to cop) Actually, Officer, 'm being kidnapped
Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the "Entertainment Tonight" theme song
'Entertainment Tonight, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Mann winces
The officer looks at him questioningly
, What  mean by that is,  don't care much for baseball, but Raymond insisted
Yeah,  hate baseball
(hands Ray back ) Your right taillight is out, Raymond
want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity
61 88  (2) 88 Yes
will
Thank you
The Policeman walks away, and Ray heaves a sigh of relief
'Terry
' 'Raymond
' Ray
My
hostages call me Ray
Can call you Terry
Sourly, Mann nods
Ray smiles and drives off
And thank you
didn't do it just because  don't want the publicity
Then what else
envy you your craziness, Ray
It's been years since  did something completely crazy
Well, you want to hear something really crazy
Do  have a choice
Nope
live on a farm in Iowa
One day, out in the cornfield,  heard a voice
89 89 It glides through city traffic
90
- 90 Ray slides the Datsun into a parking place, and he and Mann walk the short sleazy block to Fenway, and old-fashioned center-city ballpark
62 90  90 ( ) But can't you accept the probability that it's all just a hallucination
Annie and Karin see it, too
They have reached the ticket window
Two, field level, first base side
The elderly Ticket Seller pulls out two tickets
Section seventeen
Twelve dollars
Ray takes out his wallet and turns to Mann
It's on me
You're damn right it is
Ray pays the man and receives the tickets
Game don't start for a while, but you can go in, watch batting practice
Great
They enter the stadium
91
91 They walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand toward their section
So what do you do with yourself these days
live
work
've learned to cook
take walks
watch sunsets
Don't you miss being
involved
63 91  91 () was the East Coast distributor of 'involved
'
ate it, drank it, and breathed it
Then they killed Martin
They killed Bobby
And then they elected Tricky Dick
Twice
And now, people like you think  must be miserable that 'm not involved anymore
Well, 've got news for you:  spent all my misery years ago
have no more pain for any of you
gave at the office
They approach the refreshment stand
So
what do you want
want them to stop looking to me for answers
Begging me to speak again, write again, be a leader
want them to start thinking for themselves
And want my privacy
Ray looks slightly embarrassed
No,  meant what do you want from
Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the front of the line
Oh
( ) dog and a beer
(to the vendor) Two
( ) Okay,  agree, you should be entitled to as much privacy as you wane
But why stop writing
haven't published a word in seventeen years and  still have to endure assholes like you all the time
What do you think it'd be like if  suddenly came out with a new book
64 91  (2) 91 Ray nods
Mann is making sense
They'd bleed me dry
92 92 Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the aisle toward the field
God, this place is so beautiful
The grass is so green you can almost smell it
Looking around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice; a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage as one player hits to several others in the field
few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts
Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk
It could be 1912 out there, for all this place has changed
Babe Ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs
Same mound
Why are we here, Ray
Something
about the game
93   - 93 The game is in progress
Ray and Mann are in their fifth row seats
They do not speak
At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that something is about to happen
He looks at Mann who is just watching the game
Then he looks at the scoreboard
94   94 Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant replays of some of the action
65 94 94 Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing message
The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the crowd fade out
There is only the message: "" Chisholm, Minn
New York Giants : 1 Game, 0 At Bats The message does not just glow, it pulsates
It looks almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard
95 95 Ray looks around him
The sounds of the game return, and from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he realizes that no one else can see the message
He opens his program and starts writing it down
Mann notices this, but cannot see what Ray is writing
Then Ray hears The Voice
'Go the distance
' Oh my God
What's the matter
Nothing
You okay
Ray sighs
Yeah
;) Whenever you wanttogo,wecan go
66 95 95 What
If you want to go, we can go
Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new attitude
Then let's go
Mann rises and heads up the aisle
Ray looks down at the program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham, who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark
96      96 It is nighttime, and Mann drives
Ray slumps, dozing, troubled
Mann looks curiously at Ray, but says nothing
They ride in silence
97 '  - 97 The street is blue with moonlight as they park in front of the storefront
Where are you goingfrom here
Home
What is it you're not telling me
(shakes head no) 've taken up too much of your time
Mann gets out of the car
wish  had your passion, Ray
However misdirected it may be, it's still a passion
used to feel that way about things, but
67 97 97 Ray slides into the driver's seat
You got another message, didn't you
You'll think 'm crazy
already think you're crazy
What did it say
After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly
It said 'The man's done enough
Leave him alone
' Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to head back up the street
But he stops short when Mann's form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the headlights
Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path
Or why he appears tense, almost frightened
'Moonlight' Graham
Ray's jaw drops
You saw it
Saw what
New York Giants, 1922
He played one game, never got to bat
Mann looks spectrial in the high-contrast glare on the headlights
What did  see, Ray
Chisholm, Minnesota
We were the only ones who saw it
Did you hear the voice, too
Mann glances at Ray, then looks away
68 97  (2) 97 It's all right to admit it
That's what told me to find you
No response
Did you hear it too
'Go the distance
' Do you know what it means
Yes
What
It means
we're going to Minnesota to find Moonlight Graham
() We
Yeah
What do we do when we find him
We'll know that when we find him
Ray opens the passenger door of the Datsun and Mann jumps in
Ray releases the brake and peels out, burning rubber
The two men look happy as kids with bats over shoulders, gloves dangling, on their way to a sandlot
98 98 Once on 1-90, they begin the long haul across the Great Lakes states
Ray drives, Mann dozes in the reclined passenger seat
(
) Annie, 'm really sorry, but 'm going to be a few days longer
69 98 98 (
0
) (; ) Oh, Ray
Is everything all right
(
0
) Everything's great, and''ll tell you all about it when  get back, but 'm going to Minnesota now
99     99 Now Mann drives, and Ray tries to sleep, his stockinged feet propped up on the dash, occasionally sliding with a thud against the steering column
(
) (; ) don't believe this
What's in Minnesota
(
0
) An old ballplayer
'll explain when get home
How are things with you
100 100 Ray is using the pay phone on the wall of the office, while the car is being gassed
(
0
) (; ) Uh, fine
Hey, guess what
Terence Mann is with me
We're going to Minnesota together
(
0
) (; ) Are you kidding me
Oh, Ray, that's unbelievable
know
gotta go
Hug Karin for me
love you
(
) (; ) love you too
You guys behave yourselves
Hurry home
70 100 100 Ray smiles and hangs up
101 ' 101 She hangs up, and loses her smile as she turns back to the kitchen table, where her brother Mark sits with two men in business suits
Why didn't you tell him
For the same reason 've never pissed on your birthday cake
Annie, you don't have a choice in the matter
Annie looks vertroubldye
102    - -02 1 They are north of Duluth,andthelandscape hasgrown harsher, the trees shorterandmore gnarled, thegrass tougher and wirier
After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred
Above the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the cliffs,- stern and silent
Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder
It looks like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs
It has been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at weird and unnatural angles
But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny it might be a scene painted on a glass plate
sign reads 103 , 103 Ray and Mann have parked on the main street next to a corner phone booth
Ray is flipping through the thin phone book attached to the booth by a chain
71 103 103 Half a dozen Grahams
no Archibald, no Moonlight
Follow me
104 104 The local newspaper is located in a small storefront that was probably once a confectioners or a dry-goods store
105 105 Ray and Mann are talking with the paper's publisher, Veda Ponikvar, a handsome woman in her sixties, with a sweet, innocent smile, and eyeglasses hanging from a fine chain around her neck
We're trying to find an ex-baseball player named Archibald Graham
You mean 'Doc' Graham
No,  think his nickname was 'Moonlight
' Yes, that's Doctor Graham
Doctor Graham
This is interesting news to Ray and Mann
His baseball career never amounted to much, so he went back to school
His father was a doctor
Do you know where we can find him
It's nothing bad
We're not from the , or anything --- 72 105  105 Doc Graham is dead
He died in 1972
Ray and Mann look at each other, unsure of what this means to their quest
106    106 Ray and Mann sit at a table in the newspaper's back room, the "morgue" file on Doc Graham -- a collection of clippings, pictures, and the obituary -- strewn before them
Right now, their attention is on Veda, who has put her glasses on, and is reading from an editorial
'And there were times when children could not afford eyeglasses or milk, or clothing
Yet no child was ever denied these essentials, because in the background, there was always Doctor Graham
Without any fanfare or publicity, the glasses or the milk or the ticket to the ball game found their way into the child's pocket
' You wrote that
The day he died
You're a good writer
The compliment is just right, and she smiles warmly
Excuse me
She exits
Mann spreads out the clippings and shakes his head
Something's missing
Ray is looking at a photo of Doc Graham as a man in his late sixties
Half the towns in North America has a Doc Graham
What makes this one so special we have to come halfway across the country to find him fifteen years after he died
There's got to be more
Veda enters with a piece of paper from a yellow legal pad
You might want to talk to some of these people
They knew Doc pretty well
Mann takes the list and looks it over
107  07 Two old Codgers on a park bench
Oh, that man had an arm on him
One day over at the ballpark, he said 'Lemme see that ball', and one of the boys threw him the ball, and he walked over behind home plate, reared back, and fired that ball over the left field fence
And he was at least fifty years old when he did it
It was still rising when it disappeared
108 woman, an older Nurse
i went with him to make a housecall at one of the camps
mining camps
The husband was sick, and they had no stove, so they had no heat
() 74 108 (') When we got back to Chisholm, Doc went to the hardware store and bought a stove for them and paid to have it delivered
And  know that wasn't the only time he did something like that
109    -  109 Several tables have been pushed together, and Mann sits surrounded by townspeople, mostly men past retirement age
He didn't smoke or drink,
but he used to chew up paper and spit it out wherever he went
If you were around Doc very long, you learned to duck
He'd even chew up his prescription slips, so sometimes we'd have to dig into our pockets for a piece of paper so Doc could write us prescriptions
- He always wore a black overcoat, even in the summer, and it was always flapping open, even in the winter and it was fifty below
And he had white hair, like me, and he always carried an umbrella
'Cept he was always,  mean always, losing them
Stores 'round town would just lean his umbrella somewhere near the door, and if anybody asked, they'd just say 'Oh, that's Doc's umbrella'
What was the umbrella for
- Oh,  think it got to be a habit, something to hang onto
But if you'd ask him, he'd say it was to beat away all his lady admirers
This, as much as the other remembrances, brings warm chuckles to the old men
Tell me about his wife
75 109 Alicia
She moved to South Carolina after he passed
She passed a few years later
She always wore blue
bet you didn't know that
() No
didn't
110   - 110 The woman Manager of the motel is having a'cup of coffee with Ray
You know, everybody's talking about you two
Our neighbors came over last night and we just told Doc'Graham stories until after midnight
even wrote some of them down
She takes out a piece of paper
That's very nice of you
Well, it's funny
It's like all these memories we have of Doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us
But once you started asking about him, and started us talking about him, why they swum back up to the surface again
Ray smiles
111 111 Ray and Mann are sitting in their beds, comparing their notes
No screwing, no drinking, no opium, no illegitimate children
No-midnight abortions, no shady finances
Ray puts down his notes and picks up the Chicago Tribune
You sound disappointed
76 111 111 Shoeless Joe had a problem
That's why he needed you
This guy doesn't need us
Suddenly, Ray straightens with a start
Oh, My God
Ray hurries over to Mann, offering the opened newspaper, and points out an article to Mann
It is headlined: Damn
() 'His son, who lives in New York City, notified police after receiving no answer to repeated telephone calls
' Shit
'd better call him
He pulls the phone onto the bed and dials What the hell do  tell him
You want me to
He motions outside with his head
Thanks
Ray exits
112
-  112 Ray walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge of a residential street
The Godfather is playing
He nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street
He passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some kind in its unlit front window
He takes another two or three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at the sign
77 113 113 It takes a second to make out the image in the dark, but it is a head shot of Richard Nixon
Above, it says "Four More Years"
Below, it reads "Re-Elect The President"
114 1
14 is puzzled
He turns and looks at the theatre marquee
115 115 Under the letters that spell out "The Godfather", are smaller letters that read "Nominated for 10 Academy Awards"
116 116 frowns
He says the word to himself
Nominated
Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him
117 :
17 It is an old Mustang
The annual tag on the license plate reads: 1972
118 118 - 119 119 All the cars on the street are pre-1972
And still walking down the block away from him, is the elderly man Ray passed moments earlier
The man is about sixty-five years old, stooped a little, but the body is still lithe, an athlete's body
He is wearing a dark overcoat
120 120 and he carries an umbrella
78 121  121 The little hairs on the back of Ray's neck stand up
His mouth is dry, and for a moment, he cannot speak
Then, he calls to the man
Doctor Graham
Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray
Ray starts to trot to him
Who's that
My name is Ray Kinsella
'm from Iowa
Are you Moonlight Graham
The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more clearly
No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham for fifty years
Well, 've come
( ) a very long way to see you
Funny
couldn't sleep tonight
Usually,  sleep like a baby
So  told Alicia  was going to take a walk
Mind if i join you
'd like to talk to you
Doc nods and they start to walk
Let's go to the high school
We can sit in my office
What do
you want to talk about
Well, first of all, how'd you get to be called 'Moonlight'
'Cause of a night like this, long ago
'd just gotten to the minors, and went out to the ballpark
() 79 121 (Cont'd} There's nothing as peaceful as a ballpark at night
Like a church
Yeah,  know what you mean
Anyway,  fell asleep
Next morning, they found me in the on-deck circle, all curled up like a baby
Someone called me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck
122
122 Doc fumbles out a key, and lets them in
When you got to the majors, you played only one inning of one game
What happened in that inning
123
123 They enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of varnish and chalk almost palpable
It was the last day of the season
Bottom of the eighth, and we were way ahead
'd been up with the club for most of a month, but hadn't seen any action
Just then old John McGraw points a bony finger at me and says 'Right field
' Well sir,  jumped up like  was sitting on a spring, grabbed my glove, and ran out onto the field
They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and enter
Doc Graham's office
124
, '  124 Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray to the black-leather sofa a few feet away
Did you get to make a play
Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins chewing
80 124  124 Nope
They never hit the ball out of the infield
Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little spitball towards him
Heads up
It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs there, like a white fly
was warned about you
Anyway, one inning later the game was over, and so was
And what was that like
It was like coming this close to your dreams, and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd
Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on his face
He looks out the window, focused on faraway
Except, at the time, you don't think much of it
Hardly anybody recognizes the most significant moment of their life when they're happening
Back then just figured there'd be plenty more days
didn't know that would be the only one
Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious
Now, let me ask you a question, Ray Kinsella
What makes that half-inning so interesting that you come all the way from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five years later
Ray chooses his words carefully
81 124  (2) 124 didn't really know till just now
But think it's to ask you if you could do anything you wanted to
if you could have a wish
Ahh
Doc nods
his understanding
He smiles wryly, takes a new piece of paper, and bites off a little section
And are you the kind of man who could grant me that wish
don't know
'm just asking
Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the Polo Grounds in New York
never got to bat in the major leagues
'd have liked the chance -- just once -- to stare down a big league pitcher
Stare him down and then just as he goes into the windup -- wink
Make him wonder if  know something he doesn't
That's what  wish for
The chance to squint my eyes when the sky is so blue it hurts to look at it, and to feel the 'tingle that runs up your arms when you connect dead-on
The chance to run the bases, stretch a double to a triple, and flop race-first into third, wrapping my arm around the bag
That's my wish, Ray Kinsella
that's my wish
Ray begins to smile
Graham is staring intently at him
Is there enough magic floating around in the night out there for you to make that wish come true
What would you do if  said 'Yes'
think  might actually believe you
82 124  (3) There is a place where things like that happen
And if you want to go there, can take you
Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear
If it means leaving Chisholm
He shakes his head
no
Ray is surprised
understand, but  think you're supposed to come with us
This is my most special place in the world, Ray
Once a place touches you like this, the wind never blows so cold again
You feel for it like it was your child
can't leave here
Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his dream
But your wish
It'll stay one
was born here, lived here, and 'll die here
That's okay
'll have no regrets
But sixty-five years ago -- for five minutes -- you came this close
(holds up two ) It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it
They'd consider it a tragedy
Son
if 'd only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes
now that would have been a tragedy
Those words fill up the room, and Ray sinks back against the couch
83 124  (4) 124 Well, 'd better get home before Alicia starts to thinking 've got a girlfriend
And Doc Graham smiles at him
(
0
) And he smiled
125
-  125 It is later that same night, and Ray has been recounting his experience with Doc Graham to Mann, who appears quietly troubled
And then  figured maybe we're not supposed to take him with us
So now don't know why the hell we were supposed to come here
Maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world
Did it
It did for these people
If he'd gotten a hit, he might've stayed there
() Your wife called before
She wants you to call her tonight
126
'  -  126 Annie is asleep
The phone rings, and the speed with which she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone call prevented her from sleeping very deeply
84 126  126 Ray
() asked the bank if we could miss a payment or two, and they told me they'd just sold the note on the farm to Mark and his partners
So they own the paper now, and he says if we don't sell to them, they'll foreclose
Ray, we don't have the money
127
-  127 Ray holds the phone, pained
Okay, look
They can't foreclose for thirty days, or something like that
've got to take Terry back to Boston first, so it'll be --- No
Ray looks over at Mann
'm going to Iowa with you
We're coming home
- 128    -  128 Ray drives with purpose and speed
Mann looks relaxed
Hell,  couldn't quit now
've got see this ballpark
Not everybody can see it
You might not
'll give it a try
As they turn onto the highway near the lake, a Teenager with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road, his arm raised in
a hitchhiker's stance
Ray pulls the car over to the side of the road
85 ---128 - - - 128 need all the karma  can get right now
The car stops, and the Teenager runs for it
He tosses his dufflebag in the backseat and squeezes in after it
Thanks
You're the first car by didn't expect to get a lift so soon
Ray starts the car back onto the highway
How far are you going
How far are you going
Iowa
Well, if it's okay with you, 'll ride along for a while
play baseball
Ray and Mann exchange brief smiles
'm looking for a place to play, and heard that all through the Midwest, towns have teams, and in some places they'll find you a day job so you can play ball nights and weekends
This is your lucky day, kid
We're going someplace kind of like that
All right
'm Ray Kinsella, this is Terry Mann
Hi
'm Archie Graham
Mann and Ray just look at each other
And the little Datsun heads off down the highway
86 129
- Archie sleeps in the backseat
'm dying to ask him if he has a nickname
Don't
He didn't get it till he was in the minors
Maybe we can give it to him
Funny, the way he described towns, finding you a job so you can play on their team
they haven't done that for years
My Dad did that for a while
But that was in the Twenties
What happened to your father
He never made it as ball player, so he tried to get his son to make it for him
By the time  was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage, so when  was fourteen,  started to refuse
Can you believe that
An American boy refusing to have a catch with his father
Why at fourteen
That's when  read The Boat Rocker, by Terence Mann
Oh God
never played catch with him again
() See, that's the kind of crap people are always trying to lay on me
It's not my fault you wouldn't play catch with your father
87 129 129 know
Anyway, when  was seventeen, we had a big fight,  packed my things, said something awful, and left
After a while  wanted to come home, but didn't know how
made it back for the funeral
What was the awful thing you said
said  could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal
Who was his hero
Shoeless Joe Jackson
Mann considers this all very carefully
You knew he wasn't a criminal
Ray nods
Then why'd you say it
was seventeen
Mann nods with growing understanding
So this is your penance
know
can't bring my father back
so the least you can do is bring back his hero
Ray nods
Well now we know what everybody's purpose here is
except mine
Ray looks at him
He hadn't thought of that
After a few moments Ray points to something in the distance
88 130 130 Something down the road, in the midst of all this flat farmland, is glowing in the night
It is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield
131   '  - Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and, with a rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock from escaping to the roadway
He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and pink pedal pushers
She flings herself into Ray's arms, and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy
Daddy
Then Annie appears too
They kiss while Mann and Archie wait to be introduced
Finally, Mann clears his throat
( () Karin, Annie
This is Terence Mann Terry
Hiya Terry
Annie steps forward, wining some curls from her eyes with ahand that has recently been immersed in flour'
She smiles, wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans, and shakes his hand
Welcome
Thank you
And this young fellow is Moon -- uh, Archie Graham
Karin and Annie shake his hand
He's come to practice with the team
89 131 131 He'll be able to do more than just practice
What does that mean
Come on
They walk towards the field
Let's enjoy this place while we still have it
132
- 132 Ray and Annie walk silently with their arms around each other as they lead Mann, Archie and Karin to the bleachers
Mann's eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings to Ray
Hi, Ray, welcome back
Thanks, Joe
Good to see you
Oh my Lord
What
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson
Well of course it is
've seen pictures
Those are the White Sox
You mean you still didn't believe me
thought  did, but
Oh my Lord
They have reached the foul line where Shoeless Joe waits for them
90 132 1321 Terry, 'd like you to meet Joe Jackson
Joe, this is Terry Mann
Mann and Jackson shake hands
It's a pleasure to meet you
Pleasure's mine
( ) Ray,  hope you don't mind, but we got tired of just having practices, so we brought another team out with us so we could have some real games
He points to the visitors' bench, and, indeed, there are a dozen or so more old-time baseball players in old-time baseball uniforms
don't mind
Where'd they come from
() Where'd we come from
Man, you wouldn't believe how many guys wanted to play here
We had to beat 'em off with a stick
( ) Hey, that's Mel Ott
And Carl Hubbell
Those are the New York Giants
With a couple of Cardinals and 's thrown in for good measure
Ty Cobb wanted to play, but none of us could stand the sonofabitch when we were alive, so we told him to stuff it
( ) Hey, are you Graham
Yes sir
Ray and Mann are astonished that Shoeless Joe knows who Archie is
91 132  (2) 132 What the hell you doing on the sidelines
You came here to play ball, didn't you
Yes sir
Go warm up
() Yes sir
Archie quickly scampers down the bleachers, onto the field, shakes Joe's hand, and runs to the dugout
Unbelievable
It's more than that
It's perfect
133 133 The White Sox are in the field, the Giants at bat
Giant hitter bunts, and the runner on second takes third despite a close throw
Mann, Ray, Karin and Annie are in the stands, Mann keeping score
Does he get a hit for that
Karin
Um, no
The batter was trying to sacrifice
So how do you score it
Fielder's choice
Very good
92 133 133 Mann is impressed
He lifts Karin up from her seat on the row below them, and places her next to him to help him
You better sit here
Karin beams
Ray taps Mann and points to the plate
Look
Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle, and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream
He plants himself in the batter's b
ox, then cocks the bat, the top end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and waits for the pitch
' The pitcher looks in for his signs
Archie stares back
As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him
There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it is aimed right at Archie's head
He dives out of the way and hits the dirt hard
The Catcher chuckles through his mask
Good thing for you that wasn't his fastball
Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a little
Now his look to the pitcher is one of determination
Come on, let's see your fastball
The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws
Very fast
And right at Archie's chin
Again, he has to dive out of the way
This time, however, he gets right up and immediately appeals to the Umpire
Hey, ump, how about a warning
Sure
Watch out-you don't get killed
Both benches laugh at that
Archie holds up his hands to call time, and steps out of the batter's box
The on-deck batter, Mel Ott, comes over
93 133  (2) 133 Okay, kid, first two were high and tight, where do you think the next one's going to be
Either-low and away, or in my ear
He don't want to load the bases
Look for low and away
Archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate
But watch out for 'in your ear
' Archie takes his place in the batter's box again
He still looks determined, but a little less cocky
The next pitch is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him
But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it
The ball sails in a high arc to right center
The center fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to his left, and makes the catch
Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores
As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering
In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him a standing ovation
In return, he touches the brim of his cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation
() Look at that
Mr
Cool
But when Archie gets to the bench, he can't contain himself anymore
He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy
134   -  134 The game has ended, and players are rough-housing and joking as they slowly make their way to the door in the outfield fence
Ray and Mann are talking to some of the players over the fence
Where do you go when you walk through that door
What do you do
94 134 We sleep
And wait
We dream
You can't leave the field any other way, can you
Not if we want to come back
'd love to go with you sometime
The silence that follows is long and ominous
'd like to see what's out there
There is still no response
'll take that as a no for now
He spots Archie jogging off the field
Hey, slugger, congratulations
Archie jogs over
Thanks
can't stop shaking 'm so happy
'Course,  would've liked a base hit
But you got a
sure did, didn't
( ) rookie's luck
They all laugh at that
Well come on, this calls for a drink
95 134  (2) 134 Archie hesitates
can't
'm
He motions with his head toward the other players disappearing through the outfield door
Ray nods understandingly
Good game, Archie
Thanks
Good night, kid
Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players
When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them
Mr
Kinsella
Ray turns toward him
Archie looks as if he knows more than he's saying
Thank you for bringing me here couldn't have wished for anything more
Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than just a teenager's pleasure
But he decides not to ask any questions
know
You're welcome
Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes
135
- 135 Mann and Karin eat their country breakfasts at one and of the table, while at the other end, Annie and Ray sit in front of the bank books, ledgers, and the sheaf of bills puffed up around the paper spike
Once we fell behind in the payments, the full amount of the mortgage became due
96 135 135 And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose
Unless we sell
Either way we lose the farm
Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up
Forget it
They're buying up single farms all around us, make it one big farm
First thing they'll do is plow under your field
Ray just sits there, letting that sink in
136
- 1
36 Ray and Mann walking
don't have a lot of money, Ray, but maybe  could pitch in a little
Fine
You can put in twenty bucks for groceries
That's not what  meant
Maybe the reason you were supposed to find me was so  could help you with this
More likely it's that you're supposed to start writing again
About this
Don't change the subject
You promise to publish and 'll let you chip in from your royalties
Mann's expression suddenly turns to one of indignation
97 136 136 One thing has nothing to do with the other
'm not sure  agree with that
You're not only stubborn, you're stupid
That  won't argue with
Annie emerges from the house and calls to Ray
Honey, that was Mark
He's coming tonight
He needs a decision tonight
137 137 Again, it's ,oe Jackson's Chicago White Sox against the New York Giants, now featuring rookie Archie Graham
In the stands, Mann keeps score, Karin munches on a hot dog, and Annie and Ray snuggle together to watch the game
Everything is so perfect here
Whatever  have to do to save this place, 'll do
know
Suddenly, Ray snaps his head to the side, as one does to pick up a-distant sound
He's here
They look and see Mark's car heading up the gravel lane
He parks the car at the edge of the field, and the game stops as he walks right across it, completely mindless of the players
Since he doesn't see any of them, a few actually have to move out of his way
He approaches the bottom of the bleachers
You're interrupting the game,
Mark
98 137 137 Mark shakes his head sadly at the thought that these otherwise sensible relations have lost their minds
Ray, it's time'to put away our little fantasies and come down to earth
It's not a fantasy, Mark
They're real
Mark obviously do
esn't see anyone on the field
() Who's real
Shoeless Joe Jackson
The White Sox
The Giants
( ) He can't see any of it
And who's that
Babe Ruth
Ray smiles, savoring the moment
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann
Ah, how do you
'm Michael Jackson
( ) Ray, we have to settle this thing right now
'm not selling you my home
You have no money, you've got a stack of bills to choke a pig, and come fall, you've got no crop to sell
But  have a deal to offer you that will allow you to stay on this land
This has Ray's attention
Mark climbs the bleachers to stand closer to him
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm
But no one pays her any attention
All eyes are on Mark
99 137  (2) 137 Let us buy you out, and we'll leave the house
You can live in it rent free as long as you want
What about the baseball field
Do you realize what this land is worth
Over $2200 an acre
Then you must realize we cannot keep a useless baseball diamond in the middle of rich farmland
No deal, Mark
We're staying
We don't have to go
() You're virtually bankrupt, and 'm offering you a way to keep your home because  love my sister
've got partners who don't give a damn about you, and they're ready to foreclose right now
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm
Karin, please
Wait
They all turn to Karin
People will come
What people, sweetheart
100 137  (3) 137 From all over
They'll just decide to take a vacation, see, and they'll come to Iowa City, and they'll think it's really boring, so they'll take a drive
And they'll drive down our road, and they'll see the lights and they'll think it's really pretty
Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision
So, the people in the cars
They'll drive up and they'll want to pay us, like buying a ticket
Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy
You're not listening to this seriously, are you
Yes
Why would anybody pay money to come here
Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton
To watch the game
And it'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago, and it was summertime, and they'll watch the game and
remember what it was like
Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than they are right now
What the hell is she talking about
She's talking about people seeing their memories
touching their past
() People will come
101 137  (4) 137 It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign
You find it by instinct
They'll be drawn
Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell
'm sorry, but you have no choice
He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen
Ray looks at it
He doesn't know what to do
Ray
Ray looks at Mann
138 - 1
38 speaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence Mann, master of words, spellbinder
People will come, Ray
They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom
They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past
'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say
'It's only twenty dollars per person
' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it
For it is money they have, and peace they lack
139 139 pushes the papers
forward
Just sign the papers, Ray
140 140 is not one to give up
102 140 140 They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines -- wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes
They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters
The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces
141 141 Spellbound, Ray has put the papers down
Mark picks them up again
He is battling Mann for Ray's attention
Listen to me
Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose
People will come, Ray
You're broke, Ray
Sell now or lose everything
The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball
America has rolled by like an`army of steamrollers
It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again
But baseball has marked the time
This field, this game
it's a piece of our past
It reminds us of all that once was good
And that could be again
People will come
People will most definitely come
Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his words, and the passion in his
voice
Behind him, the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud
(-) That was beautiful
The other players nod, also teary-eyed
103 141  141 () fuckin' beautiful
The players on either side of him jab his ribs with their elbows, but Mann, Ray and Annie laugh with pleasure
Ray
You will lose everything and you will be evicted
Ray looks at the paper with dread
He looks at Shoeless Joe and the players
He looks at his family
Then he turns back to Mark
It's decision time
'm not signing
Mark shakes his head sadly
Annie hugs Ray
The players breathe a great sigh of relief
Mann smiles
Ray
Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head, directs Ray's attention to the house
Ray looks behind him toward the house
142 '    -  142 have parked in front of the house
More are coming quietly down the driveway
Dozens of cars
Cars with out-of-state license plates
Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait patiently
One or two families sit on their hoods, or have set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates
143   143 Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are deeply happy -- but not terribly surprised -- to see these people
(-) They're he-re
Mark looks at the house and then back at Ray
Who's here
104 143 143 (with an edge) You don't see those cars
All those people
Don't do this, you son of a bitch
There's no cars, no people
Uncle Mark,  can see them
We all can
You're crazy
You're all bat-shit crazy
Watch your language, Mark
You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere, you sit around here and stare at nothing --- It's not nothing
Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she were "Exhibit
" And you've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron
Get your hands off her
Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him
In so doing, he twists little Karin off balance
'm trying to help you, goddamnit
In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers
Karin
105 144 144 Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in midair
One small sandal bounces end over end and lands at the foot of the bleacher
It takes forever for her body to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards of one of the bottom rows
145 145 rush down to where she lies, face up
Ray is first, but he does not know what to do
Annie and Mann hover
Mark is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do
Oh my God, 'm sorry
Annie
didn't mean to
Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath
Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish
Should we move her
Get the car
146 146 springs for the house
The tourists by their cars watch quietly
Is there a doctor
nurse
Any of you
They sadly shake their heads no
Annie races inside
147 147 Most of the White Sox players stand by the left field fence, staring silently
How long
Its a twenty-minute drive
Mann winces
He knows that could be fatal
Ray kneels by Karin
Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped by the fall
Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across her cheek and down her neck
She is becoming bluer and her cough is faint, as though she is in another room
106 147 147 Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray
Ray takes the jacket and covers Karin gently
Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more strained and distant
Karin
Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field
The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay around their bench
All except one: young Archie Graham
148 148 has noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts to lope across the field
149 149 Annie has pulled the car over and honks
Ray holds up his hand to her to wait
His eyes are on young Archie Graham
150 3
50 As Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and his step slows
He reaches the end of the fence -- around which no player can pass -- and when he emerges from the shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago
but Doc Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota
His baseball glove has turned into a black doctor's bag
151 151 as Doc Graham approaches
What have we got here
She fell
Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong
This child's choking to death
107 151 151 He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and turns her face down
Supporting her chest with one hand, he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder blades with the heel of his other hand
Annie honks again
Ray waves her to him
Mark cannot believe what he is seeing
Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air
Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a sizable piece of hog dog and bun
As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing from her face as she continues to breathe deeply
Doc peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a few seconds, and lets the eye close
She's okay
don't think the fall really hurt her, just the dog in her throat
She'll be coming around in a minute or two
( ) Thank you, Doc
Doc looks deeply into Ray's eyes
No, son
Thank you
It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed to save the child
Ray looks to the field, and then back at the Doctor
'Oh, my God, you can't go back
It's okay
( ) It's okay
152 152 Mark is slack-jawed
He has seen something magical happen and cannot explain it
saw
A11 of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns
into
108 152 152 He looks questioningly at Annie
She smiles reassuringly
There's hope for you yet, Mark
153 153 Doc Graham stands, and picks up his black bag
Well,  best be getting back home before Alicia starts to thinking 've got a girlfriend
He walks around the edge of the fence, and heads for the outfield door
The players respectfully make way for him
Good work, Doc
Way to go, Doc
Thanks, boys
Win one for me, someday, will you
He passes them
Hev rookie
Doc Graham turns
You were good
Only now do Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears
He smiles, and disappears through the door
154 154 Karin is coming to, Ray and Annie by her side
Some of the players start to gather up their equipment
Shoeless Joe calls to Ray
We're gonna call it a night
We'll see you tomorrow
Okay
109 154 154 Good night
Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns back to the bleachers
Hey
You wanna come with us
Ray's jaw drops
You mean it
Not you
(points to Mann) Him
Him
Come with you
Out there
What is out there
Come find out
Wait a second
Why him
Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join them, ignoring Ray's question
built this field
You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me
Ray, for God's sake, 'm unattached
You've got a family
This takes Ray down a peg or two
But  want to know what's out there want to see it
110 154  (2) There's a reason they chose me, just as there was a reason they chose you to find me
Oh yeah
Why
Because, you big jerk,  gave that interview
What interview
The one about Ebbets Field
The one that charged you up and sent you all the way to Boston to find me
Then you lied to me
You were kidnapping me at the time, you asshole
Think of it, Ray: maybe there's an Ebbets Field still floating around out there somewhere
And maybe 'll get to sit in the stands, and watch a twenty-year-old kid with a smooth face and kinky hair try out for the 1948 Dodgers
(to Shoeless Joe) So  do all the work, and all  get is to see everybody else's dreams come true
Is that it
What are you saying, Ray
'm saying 'm happy for you, and 'm happy for him, but after all this what's in it  for me
Is that why you did this
For-you
There's something out there for me, Ray
And what a story it'll make: a man being able to touch the perfect dream
111 154  (3) 154 Then you'll write about it
You bet  will
Annie walks Karin over
Ray bends down to Karin's face
How you feeling, honey
Stupid
Ray laughs and hugs her
He looks up at Annie
Terry's been invited to go-with the players
You mean 'out'
() Out
( ) Doo-doo-doo-doo
Be careful
She smiles brightly and gives Mann a kiss on the cheek
Mann shakes Ray's hand
-- want a full description
-You take care of this family, Ray
Mann joins several of the White Sox as they leave the field
155 155 is absolutely dumbfounded as'he sees the players fade out upon walking through the outfield gate
He turns to Annie
He just
Where'd he
112 15
5 155 You go inside and lie down
'll explain later
Mark walks off toward the people in their cars outside the house
Where'd all these people come from
156 2
56 Only a few players are left on the field
We're keeping this field
You bet your ass we are
Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a shit-eating grin on his face
What
Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling
What're you grinning at, you ghost
'If you build it
He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate
'
he will come
' Ray looks at the Catcher
The hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up
Oh, my God
What is it
Its my father
113 157 has taken off his mask
He is in his early twenties
He is in the same pose as the photo we saw in the prologue
158 Ray blanches and turns to Shoeless Joe, his voice a strangled whisper
Say it ain't so,- Joe
'm afraid it is, kid
The Catcher is now walking toward Ray
( ) 'Ease his pain
' (smiles and nods) 'Go the distance
' When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The Voice
It was you
159 159 No, Ray
It was you
Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the door in the outfield fence
160 160 The Catcher is halfway across the field
Ray turns to Annie
He cannot even swallow
My God,  only saw him later, when he was worn down by life
Look at him
The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass
Ray walks down to the edge of the outfield
114 160 160 He has his whole life in front of him, and 'm not even a glint in his eye
What do  say to him
Introduce him to his granddaughter
Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is
The Catcher has reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray and Annie
Hi,  just wanted to thank you folks for putting up the field and letting us play here
'm John Kinsella
They shake his hand
'm Ray
My wife Annie
And this is my daughter, Karin
( ) Karin, this is
He almost says "My father
" Ray and Annie are beaming
Annie takes Karin's hand
We're going to let you two talk
have to go look after our guests
Someone's gotta start collecting admission if we're going to keep this place
(to the Catcher) Very nice meeting you
' am
161 161 hoists Karin up and totes her toward the tourists waiting in front of the house
115 162 162 watch them for a while, then start to,stroll across the field
You catch a good game
Thank you
It's so beautiful here
Its like-well for me, it's like a dream come true
Ray cannot speak
He nods
Can  ask you something
Again, Ray nods
Is this heaven
Ray smiles and shakes his head no
It's Iowa
Iowa
could've sworn this was heaven
163 16 3 stops and looks intently at John
He asks this question as if he were asking the secret of life
Maybe he is
Is there a heaven
164 164 takes time to answer that
He looks up at the night sky and searches it
Oh, yeah
Then he looks square into Ray's eyes
Heaven's where dreams come true
116 165 165 looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night above them
He smiles
He finally understands
He turns back to John and nods
Then maybe this is heaven
166 166 smiles wisely in return
Well
good night, Ray
Good night
167 167 John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield fence
Hey
John turns back
Ray is holding a ball
You wanna have a catch
John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them; there is the hint of moisture
Does he know Ray is his son
'd like that
Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and puts it on
They throw the ball back and forth
And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son bathed by white floodlights and car headlights
on the silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of a cornfield
