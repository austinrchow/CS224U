Written by Tom McCarthy - , sixty-two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished Colonial house
He is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes
After a few moments an   pulls up
slightly overweight  gets out of the car
She starts to walk up to the house
Walter steps back from the window and waits
The doorbell rings
Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table
And then he goes to the door and opens it
Mr
Vale
Yes
Hello
'm Barbra Watson
Nice to meet you
Yes
Come in
Thank you
She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door
They both stand there awkwardly
Barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness
Can  take your coat
No, thank you
Would you like anything to drink
No
(Beat) Shall we get started
' ,   - Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close proximity
Let's try it again
The same thing
Yes
Remember, fingers curved
Like a tunnel
Walter starts to play the piano
It's a lesson in progress
They are sitting at a beautiful   but Walter is only a beginner
And not a very good beginner
Don't flatten
Walter keeps playing
(') Make room for the train
Walter stops
What
said "make room for the train
" It's something that  tell my kids
If you curve your fingers like this
(She demonstrates) Then the train can pass through the tunnel
She passes her pencil through her curved fingers
Walter looks at her for a long moment
'  - Walter walks Barbara to the front door
He opens it and then hands Barbara some money
Here
Thank you
Next Tuesday at the same time
No
don't think 'm going to continue with our lessons
Oh, no
Are you giving up
No
Barbara gets the point
He is stopping with her, not the lessons
Oh
Goodbye
Goodbye
Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts it
Mr
Vale
If  may ask, how many teachers have you had before me
Four
Well, for what it's worth, it's difficult to learn an instrument at your age
Especially if you don't possess a natural gift for it
'm not saying this to be mean
But if you do decide to give up then would really like to buy your piano
It's a beautiful instrument
Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment
(') Goodbye
Barbara turns and leaves
Walter shuts the door
,   - Walter stands before a half-empty class
He is wrapping up a lecture on economic theory
There is nothing inspiring about it
East Asia's experience is really the exception to the rule, because the conditions there that made trade liberalization for the Middle East successful weren't present in the developing countries in sub- Saharan Africa, and in Central and South America

(') Sorry it's late
Why is it late
had some personal things to deal with
Walter hands back the paper
'm sorry
can't accept it now
But
'm sorry
Walter goes back to work

He catches sight of of him and  , smiling
' ,      - Walter sits at the piano and practices
It is still going badly
The wine glass sits on top of the piano
He lifts his hand and inspects his "tunnel"
, '  - Walter is at his computer
He pulls up his   on the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006
He saves it
His work is done
There is a knock at the door
Yes
The door opens and Walter's colleague,    steps in
Hello Walter
Charles
'm sorry to interrupt
That's
Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the  conference to present your paper
'm going to need you to cover for her
Why can't she go
She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby
Walter is caught off guard
When
Next week
We'll cover your class and make the arrangements
wish  could, but now is not a very good time, Charles
understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented
He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure
just don't think  can with the start of classes and my book
You're only teaching one class, Walter
So  can stay focused on my writing
'd really rather not go right now
'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point
Walter is trapped
He comes clean
Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper
just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to
'm not really prepared to present it
That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go
Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend,  wouldn't advise it
Not with that argument
Walter just stares him
(') Good bye
And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him

So  thought you forgot about me
Where've you been hiding
Karen automatically refills his wine glass
Just busy with work

This is my apartment

(to Walter) Did you call the police

Who is he

That's not gonna happen
It's already happening
One day our kids will be going to China for jobs
Ask Walter
Darren and Tarek look at Walter
You think that's true
Walter is put on the spot
Well
if China continues to threaten the wage earners in the first-world economies by keeping wages down, then it's really just a matter of time
What they buy they inflate
What they sell they deflate
But then you have to ask the question `who's paying the cost
'
And the answer is the Chinese people
Beat
You see
Tarek continues eating

How much
Thirty-five dollars
Will you take thirty
No
thiry-five

Here
She hands her the money
Zainab takes it and drops it into a small pouch
(') Where are you from
Senegal
Oh

It was just beautiful
(Handing her the bag) Thank you very much
Thank you
The Woman walks away
young Israeli man,  is sitting at a nearby stall selling -shirts
How far is Senegal from Cape Town
Far

40 Zainab smiles
Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder
(') Hey, look who it is
What's up Tarek
Tarek and Walter are approaching
Zev
How are you
Good man
Hey honey
He kisses Zainab
Hello
Hi, Walter
Hi
How's business
Ahh
You know
Walter looks at the Zainab's jewelry
Her stuff is great, right
She made me this
Tarek holds up his wrist, revealing a bracelet
(') You should make one for Walter
Zainab nods noncommittally
(') So Walter and  are going up to the park to play for a little bit
Tarek,  told you we have to pick up my new table today
He said he would only hold it for today
41 know

No problem
Tarek
You always say "no problem" and then you are late or you forget
Tarek smiles

We'll go up and play and then we'll come back to help you

He kisses her and starts to walk away
Yes
It's always "habibti" when you want your way
It closes at five p
m
Not Arab time, Tarek
No
Not Arab time
Real time, habibti
Don't "habibti" me
They turn and start to leave
What does habibti mean
Habibti
It means "beloved one"
Does she know that
Tarek laughs
- Tarek and Walter are waiting for the subway is playing on the opposite platform
He's been playing here for a long time
42 Is he good
have no idea but it's cool
always wanted to play down here
It's supposed to be good money
So why haven't you
Tarek shrugs
Maybe some day we can do it together
Split the profits
Walter watches the Chinese Musician
-
Walter and Tarek stand in front of the      in Central Park
What do you think
Walter sizes it up and makes his assessment
think 'll just watch
Come on, Walter
(') It's easy
You just wait until you feel it
Let's go
Tarek joins the drum circle
Walter lingers
-
Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel it"
Tarek is next to him playing away
Tarek looks at Walter and nods
Finally Walter starts to play
Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit
Tarek encourages him with a smile
43 - Tarek and Walter are leaving the park
Tarek checks his watch
Shit, we have to get home
Zainab is gonna kill me
'm on Arab time again
What is Arab time
It means 'm late by an hour
All Arabs are late by an hour
It's genetic
We can't help it

They can hear the train arriving
That's our train
They pick up the pace
Walter puts down his drum to take out his
Tarek quickly picks it up
(') got your drum
My card is empty
Can you swipe me
Walter swipes his card for Tarek to pass through and then he swipes his own turnstile
Walter passes through
Tarek struggles a bit with both drums
He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks
He's stuck
(') (Laughing) Hey
You paid for the drum and not me
Here take this
44 Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the turn style that Walter just paid for
(') (Re: the train) think we missed it
Zainab is not going to be happy if
Suddenly a  takes Tarek by the arm
Excuse me, sir
Could you please step over here
Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away
What are you doing
Could you please step over here
He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm again which agitates the Cop
Another  enters into the action
#2 Just step over here, pal
Please, what do you want
#1 You jumped the turnstile
did not jump it
paid
paid
It just didn't work
Walter steps up
Sir,  did pay his fare
#2 Could you step back please
But  paid this man's
#2 Sir, stand over there
45 #1 (To Tarek) Can  see some
Tarek takes out his wallet
He shows them an
Walter steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down
Cop #2 stands between him and the action
Walter can barely make out what is being said
#1 (') You got anything else, Tarek
No
#1 Where are you from
Syria
Why
Tarek is starting to panic
The two Cops share a look
Another train passes
Cop #1 asks Tarek a few more questions which Walter cannot hear
Suddenly Cop #1 starts to handcuff Tarek
(') Why
'm sorry
What did  do
Walter steps forward to intervene
don't think that's necessary
#2 Well we do
You can come down to the station and make a statement
But he didn't mean
#2 Sir, that's all 'm saying
Now step back or we are gonna take you in too
Where are you taking him
#2 Ninth Precinct
46 Walter take the drum
Tell Zainab what happened but don't let her come for me
will call you
The two Cops lead Tarek away
Walter watches helplessly
(') Don't let her come
will call her
Walter watches him go
'  - Walter enters and shuts the door and Zainab is sitting on the couch working on her jewelry
She stops when she sees Walter standing alone, holding the two drums
Where is Tarek
He was arrested
What
Yes
In the subway
Zainab immediately starts to panic
Arrested
Yes
It was just a misunderstanding
They said he would be released later tonight
Zainab really starts to lose it
Her reaction is more than Walter was prepared for
47 How could this happen
He knows better
He would not do anything wrong
He didn't
'm sure we it will be She begins to pack up her work
No
It won't be
Yes it will
went down to the precinct and made a statement
(Snapping at Walter) That doesn't matter
He is illegal
As am
We are not citizens
Do you know what that means
Do you
Of course you don't
How could you
She picks up her things and walks down the hall to her room
Walter sits, stunned
' ,   - Walter is talking on his cell phone and pacing
Yes
His name is Tarek Khalil
Khalil
That's right
Yes
came down and made a statement
They said he would be released
That was six hours ago
Well when should we know
Tomorrow
Why
But he
Thank you
Walter hangs up
- Walter walks out of the police station
He crosses the street
Zainab is standing there
Well
48 They've moved him
To where
To a detention center in Queens
He was turned over to immigration
They said we can see him during visiting hours tomorrow night from five to ten
Zainab shakes her head
can't visit him or  will end up in that place too
Zainab fights to restrain her emotions
She turns and walks away
Walter watches her go
'   - Zainab's bedroom light is on
' , ' & '  - Zainab is sitting on her bed and talking on her phone
Yes
We are going tomorrow
The appointment is at eleven
don't know, he found him
What
No don't want to
just don't, Tarek
Yes
've already called him know
know
just want you to be here with me, Tarek
,  - sea of skyscrapers near One Center Street
,   - Zainab and Walter exit an elevator and walk down the hall
49 - Walter and Zainab talk to an,
, an who is jotting down notes
He is clinical, almost cold in his approach
Zainab, you're also undocumented, right
Yes
You know you can't visit Tarek at the detention center, right
Yes
know
How long have you known Tarek
Almost a year
Mr
Vale
week
week
Walter nods
(') Does Tarek have any family living here
Walter looks to Zainab
His mother lives in Michigan
This is news to Walter
She's also undocumented, correct
Zainab hesitates
50 (') It's
This is all confidential
Yes, she is
Does she know that Tarek is in custody
No
Tarek told me not to tell her
He doesn't want to worry her
Has he ever been convicted of a crime
No
He has had no trouble
He is a good person
Do you know if they ever applied for asylum
Walter looks at Zainab
She is very uncomfortable
Yes
When he first arrived from Syria
But he didn't get it
When was that
Seven years ago
And did they appeal it
don't know
Mr
Shah jots something down
Why wouldn't they appeal it
51 Fear of being deported
It used to be that when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal
lot of people didn't bother with it
Getting denied once was enough to spook them
So what happens if that's the case
Then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he won't even go before a judge this time
He'll just be deported
They had to leave Syria
They had no choice
This is also news to Walter
Look, one step at a time
Let me talk to him then we'll have a better idea of his status and what our options are
Is there anything  can do
Visit him
The lawyer slides a card across the table
Walter takes it
- Walter rides the subway
He looks down at the lawyer's card
- Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial neighborhood
Factories and fences
He checks his piece of paper and starts walking
52 - Walter is still walking
The area is very deserted
He stops and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous factories
He checks his sheet of paper and continues walking
- Walter is standing in front of the
It looks like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a bit more barbed wire
He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens
He walks inside
Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room
few and
In one corner is a guard booth with
One   is wearing a Muslim headdress
Walter approaches the window and waits in line
The other people waiting comprise a mix of nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian
The Guard talks to a  in front of Walter
The Man has a Slavic accent
That detainee has been moved
To where
don't know
He was here yesterday
But now he's not
That's all know
You can call
The number is on the wall
Next
Sir, step aside please
The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of paper
Walter steps up to the window
He sets a piece of paper on the window sill
53 Hi
'm here to see Tarek Khalil
The Guard takes it
You been here before
No
Can  see your license please
Walter takes out his wallet
- Walter is let through a large metal door
There is an - immediately in front of him
Walter empties his pockets and steps through
Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open
It does and he steps into a small room
The door slides shut and he is alone in the small white room until a door on the other side slides open
He steps through and walks down a small hallway
On the left side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for lawyer consultations
Walter enters into a large bright room
It resembles a prison visitation room
Along the perimeter of the room is a clear fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles
Each cubicle has one seat and a phone
On the other side of the fiberglass is another seat and a phone
Walter looks around the room at the  and
,   - Walter is still waiting
After a moment a door opens and Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit
He sees Walter and smiles
They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant seat
They both pick up the phone as they sit down
Walter
Thank you for coming
54 Of course
How is Zainab
She's upset
have a letter from her
You can't give it to me
It has to be sent to me by mail
But you can put it up to the glass
Walter hesitates
(') Go ahead
Open it and place it up to the glass so  can read it
It's It's allowed
Walter complies
He sets down the phone so that he can press the letter up against the glass
Tarek reads the letter
Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some privacy
He watches the various immigrant families speaking to one another
Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's phone
Walter picks it up
(') Thank you, Walter
Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back into his coat
How are they treating you
The place is very depressing
There is no privacy
The lights are always on
Do you need anything
No
just want to get out of here
Zainab and  met with a lawyer today
55 Yes
What did he say
He is going to stop by to see you tomorrow
They both sit for a moment
Unsure what to say next
Finally Walter's curiosity gets the best of him
(') Tarek, Zainab said you were denied asylum
You mean when we came here
Yeah
Did you go to your deportation hearing
Yeah
You did
Yeah
We did everything they told us to
Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say
(') Hey, could you tell Darren didn't call him
walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks to him
We can't hear what is being said
(') (To Walter) have to go
They have to do a bed count
Usually,  can visit for one hour
Can you come tomorrow
Yes
Good
And tell Zainab  will call her as soon as  can
56 Walter nods
Tarek gets up
(') Goodbye, my friend
Goodbye
Tarek walks away
Walter watches him go
' ,  / Walter and Zainab are sitting at the kitchen table
Zainab is holding her letter
Did you ask him if he went to his hearing
Yes
He said that he did
Zainab stands up
Walter, 'm going to leave now have a cousin in the Bronx
will stay with him for now
You don't have to leave
You can stay here
think it's best if  leave
When Tarek calls me then  will tell him
You know how to reach me if you need to
Is it  if  leave Tarek's things here for now
My cousin's place is not very big
Yes
'  - Zainab walks away from the apartment
57 - Walter drinks at the bar and watches Tarek's band play without Tarek
'  - Walter practices the drum
'   - Jacob walks Sprinkles in front of the apartment building
Walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past
'  ,   - Darren and Tarek are talking
Walter sits and listens
- Walter eats alone
- Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk
He walks to the corner and waits to cross the street
large group of led by a   step up next to him
He is surrounded by them
'  , '  - Tarek talks to Mr
Shah
' ,   - Walter is playing the drum
He finishes with an "end beat"
He looks around the quiet apartment
,   - Walter is waiting for Tarek
The visiting room is empty
Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and a     walks out tentatively
She almost looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit
58 She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach the glass and talk to him
Walter just stares back, also unsure of what to do
They are caught in awkward moment
Finally Walter manages a nod
She nods back and smiles
It is the innocent smile of a child
Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons the Young Girl back inside
The Young Girl looks at Walter one last moment before disappearing behind the door
'  ,   - Walter is talking to Tarek
But  thought you said you went to the hearing
We did
remember it
So why is there a final order on you
Did he say
No
He didn't know yet
He just said that unless he can find a way to reopen the case quickly they're going to deport me
Maybe you should call your mother
She might have
No
don't want her to worry can handle this
Tarek shakes his head
Did he say anything else
Yeah
Three years ago  was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk
But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case
don't even understand it
59 Walter nods
(') Walter, there are guys who have been in here for years
can't do that Walter
'll go crazy
He's trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible
Tarek goes silent
(') Tarek
have to go back to Connecticut
'll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything
Tarek's mind is racing
He shakes his head
Just please
don't forget about me in here
won't
Are you still practicing
Yes
You should go back to the drum circle
(Quickly) No
Tarek laughs
But listen to that Fela
That will help you,  promise
will
So show me what you've been working on
60 What
Show me
On that
Come on
need some music, man
Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter
Now
Don't worry
They can't arrest you
At least not yet
Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top
Tarek watches and listens for a moment
Ah
There it is
Good
Good
You are getting better
And then he joins in
The two men continue to play together
' ,  - Walter is packing his suitcase
Suddenly there is a knock at his door
He exits the room
' ,   - Walter opens the door
Standing there is a strikingly attractive forty-five year-old
She seems startled to see Walter
Hello
'm sorry
must have the wrong apartment
She starts to walk down the hall
Can  help you
61 'm looking for my son
Are you Tarek's mother
Yes
Oh
This is Tarek's apartment
share the apartment with him
The Arab Woman is cautious
He did not mention that he lived with someone
'm not here very often
live in Connecticut
Is Tarek here
No
He's
uh
he's not here
But please come in
Mouna hesitates
(') Please
Thank you
Mouna walks into the apartment
She stands by the door
'm Walter
Walter Vale
'm Mouna Khalil
'm sorry to show up unannounced but my son calls me everyday
He has not called me now for five days
have tried his cell phone but he does not answer
Would you like to sit down
62 Thank you
Mouna sits
Would you like something to drink
Coffee or water
No
Is my son alright, Mr
Vale
Tarek was arrested
He's being held in a detention center in Queens
They are trying to deport him
Where is Queens
It's not far from here
Twenty minutes
You have been there
Yes

He's
How did this happen
He was stopped in the subway station
He didn't do anything wrong
would like to go there
To Queens
But Mrs
Khalil
The lawyer mentioned that
don't think that you can
know  can't visit Tarek, Mr
Vale
just want to see where they are holding him
63 can take you if you'd like
Thank you
Let me get my coat
Mouna nods
Walter leaves
Mouna breathes deeply in an attempt to control her emotions
She looks around the apartment and spots Tarek's drum
The sight of it is almost enough to push her over the edge
- The Chinese Musician is playing on the platform
Mouna and Walter are watching him
- Walter and Mouna are sitting side by side on the subway
,  - Walter and Mouna exit the subway station and walk down the empty street
Have you been to New York before, Mrs
Khalil
No
Tarek wanted to come to New York to play music
did not want him to go but
do you have children, Mr
Vale
have a son
He lives in London
And your wife
My wife passed away
'm sorry
64 - Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention Center
That's it
This is where the prison is
Yes
That's it
Walter points to the Detention Center
It does not look like a prison
think that's the point
How many people are in there
Tarek said about three hundred
(') There is a coffee shop on that corner
It's not very nice but
'll wait there
Here
She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter
(') Thank you
Walter turns and walks into the facility
Mouna lingers, taking in the building
,   - Walter is waiting for Tarek
He is watching as a holds her  up to the glass as her  taps on it from the other side
Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out
He waves and smiles
Walter picks up his phone
Tarek picks up his
65 Walter,  thought you were leaving
was
Tarek, your mother is here
This stops Tarek cold
What
My mother
Where
She is waiting outside
When did she arrive
Today
Oh man
Why did she come
She can do nothing for me
She said she hadn't heard from you
Walter
Listen to me
She can not stay here
She doesn't know anyone in New York
'm sorry but you must get her to go back to Michigan
Here
have a letter from her
Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass
,  - It's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory workers
Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea
She looks very out of place
Two    enter and sit down in a booth
Mouna watches them
An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter
He keeps looking at Mouna
Do you need anything else
66 No
(In Arabic) Where are you from
(In Arabic) am Palestinian from Damascus
(In Arabic) Ah
knew it
am from Egypt
Alexandria
'm Nasim
Why are you here
(In Arabic) am visiting my son
(In Arabic) He is in detention
(In Arabic) Yes
The Waiter shakes his head
(In Arabic) It's a bad place
'm lucky

He nods to the Guards
(') (In Arabic) They're the ones taking care of your son
They come here everyday
They don't tip
Mouna is uncomfortable
(') (In Arab) Don't worry
They can't understand us
Walter enters and walks over to Mouna's booth
67 (') Hello, sir
Walter nods and sits down
He hands Mouna her letter
How is he
He's good but he's concerned about you being here
will not leave
Mrs
Khalil, 'm not sure that your being in New York will do any good
We have a very good lawyer working on Tarek's case
(Politely but forceful) Mr
Vale,  cannot go back to Michigan knowing that my son is in that building
Even if  can't see him,  will stay
She stands up, ready to leave
(') Shall we go
Walter stands
Mouna digs in her purse
(In Arabic) The tea is on me
(In Arabic) Thank you
(In Arabic) Is that your lawyer
Or your husband
(In Arabic) Goodbye
68 (In Arabic) See you next time
Walter follows Mouna out
'   -
Walter and Mouna arrive back at Walter's apartment building
Jacob emerges from the front door with Sprinkles
Oh
Hello, Mr
Vale
Hello, Jacob
He sees Mouna
Oh, hello again
Did you find your son
Yes
Thank you
(To Walter) let her in earlier
(To Mouna) 'm Jacob, by the way

And this is Sprinkles
Nice to meet you, Jacob
'm Mouna
So you two know each other
There is an awkward pause
Yes
Mr
Vale knows my son
Oh
Who is that
Tarek
69 Oh
Tarek
He is very nice
And so is his girlfriend
They are both so polite
Thank you
My mother and  are planning a trip to go to Israel next summer
She's always wanted to go
hope you enjoy it
Now if you'll excuse me
Mouna nods and heads into the building
Oh sure
We need to go on our walk and do our business
Very nice to meet you, Mouna
You too, Jacob
Mouna continues up the stairs
Walter follows her
Goodbye, Mr
Vale
Goodbye
' ,  - Walter and Mouna enter the apartment
Mouna picks up her suitcase
Thank you, Mr
Vale
Walter turns
Where are you going
will find a hotel
70 You can stay here
You can use Tarek's room
Thank you for your offer but cannot accept this
don't want to impose on you
You're not imposing
Please would like you to stay
Again, thank you
But  will manage
Goodbye
Walter finally steps aside and opens the door
(') Goodbye
She leaves
'  ,  - Mouna walks down the stairs
Mrs
Khalil
She turns
Walter is standing at the top of the stairway
(') Please
was with Tarek when he was arrested
He was in the subway in the first place because of me
Please
Stay
Even if it's just for the night
Walter's plea is heartfelt
Mouna looks at him and then she looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her options
' , '  - Walter enters the room and sets down Mouna's suitcase
She follows him into the cramped bedroom
71 The bathroom is just across the hall
Thank you, Mr
Vale
You can call me Walter
And  am Mouna
Walter nods
Do you need anything else
No
Thank you
Good night
Good night
Walter leaves, shutting the door behind him
Mouna sits on the bed and looks around the room
- Desolate streets
The sound of an airplane taking off breaks the night quiet
' ,  - Walter walks out of his bedroom
He hears talking from the living room
He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in Arabic
He turns and walks back down the hallway
' , Walter pours a cup of coffee
He notices two newspaper's on the counter
One is the Financial Times and the other is Al Hayat, an Arabic newspaper
He picks up the Financial Times and reads the front page
Mouna enters
Good morning
72 Good morning
Tarek said hello
How is he
can't really tell
He wants me to leave
But  am not leaving
Well, you can stay here as long as you need to
Thank you
That is very generous of you
Thank you for the newspaper
Mouna nods and pours some more coffee for herself
Walter
Did Tarek and his girlfriend, Zainab, live here together
Uhm
Yes
They did
And where is she now
She's staying with her cousin in the Bronx
would like to meet her
We can go by her stall
Her what
Her stall
She sells jewelry in a stall
73 Oh
- large office building in downtown Manhattan
- Walter and Mouna are standing in silence
Do you spend a lot of time in the city
No
Not really
just came down to present a paper at a conference
You wrote it
Yes
Well  coauthored it
Congratulations
Walter shrugs
'  - Walter and Mouna are talking to the Mr
Shah
And what happened after the hearing
We appealed
It took two years
And your appeal was denied
Yes
74 Then they should have sent you a bag-and-baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be deported
Mouna nods
(') But you didn't receive it
No
You sure
Yes
would remember this
Did you move
Yes
Eventually we had to
But we had our mail advanced
Mr
Shah is satisfied
Well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened
And pre 9/11 it wasn't much of a priority tracking people down
Mouna bristles at the implied connection
So if they didn't get the letter then does this help us
It keeps our chances alive
If they got it and just ignored it then we couldn't push to reopen the case
So you can help him
It's still a long shot
Like said, the Government's approach has changed radically
() 75 (') It's very black and white now
Either you belong or you don't
Which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention
(He starts writing) Tarek's lucky
Most of them don't even have lawyers
Mouna blanches
Lucky
(Without looking up) Relatively speaking
We just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration
Then, we'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application
Mouna and Walter share a look
They're lost
Can you explain what that means
Actually,  don't have the time right now
have to be in court very shortly How long will he be in detention
(Without looking up) can't predict that
'm sorry but am gonna have to wrap this up
Walter looks at Mouna
Mouna stares at the Mr
Shah
Do you have children, Mr
Shah
Yeah
Two kids
And for what it's worth my uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty- three years
If  can get Tarek out,  will
76 Mouna softens
Thank you
Where are you from
Queens
- Walter and Mouna are standing at the fair
Which one is she
There
In the middle
(surprised) The black woman
That is Zainab
Yes
She is very black
- Zainab is sitting at her table when Walter approaches
Zainab smiles
She is genuinely surprised and happy to see him
Walter
Hi Zainab
This is Mouna Khalil
Tarek's mother
Zainab blanches
Oh
She quickly stands up
Hello, Zainab
77 It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs
Khalil
Please
Call me Mouna
'm sorry
did not know you were coming
Neither did
Mouna looks at her for a long moment
Then she inspects her jewelry
Zainab is uncharacteristically nervous
(') Your jewelry is very beautiful
Thank you
Do you have time for coffee or a walk
Zainab looks around at her table
Yes

But  have to watch my table
Mouna and Zainab both turn to look at Walter
, - Walter is sitting behind Zainab's table in the fair
It's a long way from the classroom

Have you spoken with Tarek
Yes
He called me this morning
He is doing all right
wish that  could see him
Just for a minute
Me too
How long have you been here
Two years
was in detention when first arrived
Three months
It was horrible
would probably still be there but they closed the facility for poor conditions
They released some of the women on parole because we were
low risk
met Tarek one year later
(Beat) am sorry for what happened with Tarek
hope you do not blame me
Blame you
No

Zainab starts to break
Tarek was doing nothing wrong miss him so much
don't know what am going to do without him
He said the same thing about you
He did
Yes
Zainab smiles
79 (') Zainab,  would like you to do something for me
What
would like you to show me something that you and Tarek liked to do
Some place that you like to go
Like what
Anything
Whatever you want
But maybe we should get Walter first
They both smile at the thought of Walter still at Zainab's table
- Walter and Mouna walk down the street listening to Zainab who is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her
- Walter, Mouna and Zainab are standing at the railing of the Ferry which is making its way across the harbor
The    looms large; the ferry route providing a perfect vantage point
So what is in Staten Island
don't know
We never got off
We just would go to the other side and then come back
Why
80 It's free
And it felt like we were going somewhere
Mouna smiles
(') That is where the towers were never saw them but Tarek did
Zainab crosses to the other railing and points
(') And over there is the Statue
And behind that is Ellis Island
Zainab smiles
(') Sometimes Tarek would point at the statue and jump up and down like we were arriving to New York for the first time
It was very funny
Can you go up in the Statue
Yes
think so
You haven't been
No
Oh
Walter's cell phone rings
He looks at it
Excuse me
(Into the phone) Hello

My mother too
Yes
She liked it
Did Zainab tell you how we used pretend we arriving in New York for the first time
Yeah
She told us

Really
Yeah
It's crazy stuff
Tarek looks around the room
(') And they seemed to get along
Zainab and my mother
Yes

82 Tarek smiles
Then it fades
My mother's not going home, is she
don't think so

He spent seven years in jail in Syria for something he wrote in the newspaper
By the time they released him he was very sick
He died two months later
That's when we came here
'm sorry
She thinks the same thing is gonna happen to me
Tarek thinks for a long moment
He shakes his head
(') You know  have never seen them together
Zainab and my mother
, Walter and Mouna are walking home

We can stop for dinner

Should we stop at a market
Yeah
That's probably a good idea

Walter seems caught off guard by the question
My teaching
Yes
Well

Your book
What is it about
Well, it covers quite a bit, so it's hard to explain
Walter drinks his glass of wine
Are you almost finished
85 'm close
You don't like to talk about your work
No
It's just a bit complicated
Why is that
Walter is agitated
It just is
It's just not a process that's easy to talk about with someone who's not a writer
Walter's cheap shot lands
Mouna is stung
didn't mean to pry
There is an awkward silence
shouldn't have spoken to you like that
It's
Walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass

Walter, you do not have to do this for Tarek

But you have to be in Connecticut
You have your teaching
And your book
It's fine really
This is not your problem, Walter

He is no longer with us
What does that mean
'm not sure
You're not sure
Was he moved to another facility
Another state
What
don't know
just know that this detainee is no longer in the facility
Well can you ask someone who does know
Hold on
The Guard picks up the phone and dials
He has a long conversation that Walter cannot hear
There are a few other visitors in the waiting room
They watch Walter
(') Sir
Yes
Did you find him
He's been removed
Removed
To where
Deported
100 What
When
He was deported this morning
He

Is there any way to contact him

You don't think so
What kind of answer is that
'm sorry, sir
That's all the information that  have
Now please step away from the window
You can call the  if you have any further questions
The number is on the wall
Walter's wheels are spinning
He is helpless
He looks around the room at all of the other immigrants visiting friends and family members
They are watching him with blank faces
(') Sir
Please step away from my window
Walter doesn't move
He checks his watch
(') Sir
For the last time, step away from my window
Finally, Walter turns and starts to walk out of the detention center
He reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back toward the guard booth
He completely loses control
(Angrily shouting) You can't just take people away like that
Do you hear me
He was a good man
good person
He had a life here
You can't just take away whoever you want
() 101 (') It's not fair
We are not just helpless children
Do you hear me
The Guard just stares back blankly
The other visitors watch in disbelief
They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the room
It's as if something inside him snapped
Something that he has been holding on to for a long time
He is suddenly adrift
Unsure of what to do next
(
) (Gently) Walter
Walter turns
Mouna is standing there
He looks at her
Helpless
(') Walter
Let's go
There is nothing we can do
Let's go
Walter looks a bit lost
He looks back at the Guard who just stares back at him
(') Come on, Walter
She reaches out and takes Walter's hand
And then she leads him out

She turns and walks toward her room
Walter watches her go and then looks back onto the street
' ,  - Walter is lying awake in bed
There is a knock at the door
He sits up
Yes
The door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room
Mouna stands in the doorway
103 Walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed sheets
Mouna walks over and lies down next time
Walter pulls the sheets back over her
They sit in silence for a long moment holding each other
It's my fault
What happened to Tarek
did receive the letter telling us to leave
threw it away
never told him
Walter can only listen
(') We were here for three years by the time the letter arrived
had found a job
Tarek was in school
Everyone told me not to worry
That the government did not care
And it appeared to be true
And then, after time, you forget
You think that you really belong
Walter gently touches her
It's not your fault
He puts his arm around her and she collapses into him
(') It's not your fault
They lie together
- Mouna and Walter are sitting in the airport
Have you visited your son in London
No
Not yet
You should visit him
Mouna takes a small decorative pouch out of her purse
104 (') Here
Walter takes it and opens it
It's a   from Zainab's collection
(') Zainab and  picked it out especially for you
Thank you
It's very nice
Let me see

The both stand up
,   - Walter and Mouna arrive at the security check point
Mouna sets down her bag
Thank you, Walter
For everything
She leans in and they hug long and hard
don't want you to go
Mouna kisses him
105 (She whispers) don't want to go, habibi
Then she picks up her bag and walks off
Walter watches her go
She turns and waves
Walter waves back and then she disappears into the security check point
- Walter walks quickly along the street with his drum
- Walter approaches the subway and enters
- Walter swipes his card and walks down into the subway
- Walter walks along the subway platform
He stops about midway and sits down on a bench
The uptown subway train enters and obscures our view of him
Finally the train pulls away
Walter is still sitting but now he is playing his drum
He is fully committed
Another train wipes frame
- Zainab sits behind her table, staring straight ahead
We hold on her for a long moment and then
