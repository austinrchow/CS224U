Written by Kelly Marcel & Sue Smith -  -  (1906) : - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening and then a voice - male
(
) () Winds in the East Mist coming in-- : whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst white fluffy clouds
shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella) dances amongst the nimbus
(
) --Like something is brewing, about to begin-- The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance
(
) --Can't put me finger on what lies -- Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens
There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod
She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her concentrated face
This is the young
(whom we will also know as
) (
) --But  feel what's to happen, all -- Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real
- '  -  -  (1961) sits in her rocking chair (in the same position as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the sky
Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of stiff and steely determination
Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled
Buddha smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding
Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful, white
Downstairs the doorbell rings
Pamela closes her eyes, breathes
It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts
She stands up, smooths down her skirt with flat palms
Breathes
-   - Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold
(45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked inside
Pamela is not pleased to see him
Mrs Travers
'   - Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence
Diarmuid looks at her, she looks out of the window
You're ready to--
Like pink clouds on sticks
Excuse me
The cherry blossoms () was trying to think of what they-- Diarmuid looks at his watch
The car should be here, may  use-- ( ) () cancelled it
You--
() What
Pamela
Mrs Travers
Mrs Travers, please, why-- (sugaring his tone) Why would you cancel the car
shan't be going
Diarmuid buries his face in his hands
We've been through this-- 've changed my mind
You can't
With all due respect Mr Russell am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making capabilities
Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long frustrated breath
You made an agreement
Do you understand
verbal agreement
Why in the world are you speaking to me as if  am a neonate
'-- He'll what
Sue
He is most welcome to every penny  don't have
-- ( ) --'ve represented you for a long time
like to think of you as a -- Pamela snorts
(') like to think of it, believe me know it's not reciprocated
() would never suggest you do something that would cause you anguish but there's no more money Pamela-- Mrs Travers
Simply no more
Sales have dried up, no more royalties
You refuse to write further books so-- () Do you understand
'm frightened that you don't understand what that means
Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus
know what he's going to do to her- - she'll be cavorting and twinkling
Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze-- --We've been trying to do this deal for twenty years
He's agreed to both your stipulations
No animation, script approval-- -- Use her to pay my bills
If believed in a hell 'd be sitting in its waiting room-- () --script approval
He's never granted anything like that before
don't know what else to-- He looks around
(') Where is Polly
fired her
Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs
(') It's just as well
It seems  can't afford her anymore anyway
Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes
(') ( ) You don't know how much she means to me
Polly
Of course not Polly
Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug
(') (it's a filthy word) Los Angeles
You have only to go there and work for two weeks
Collaborate
That's it
You haven't signed the rights over, yet
Yet
You must make it work Mrs Travers-- Oh  must, must
You need the money
don't want you to see you-- (broke)
() Stop saying money
It's a filthy, disgusting word
am picking up the telephone Mrs -- Diarmuid gets up
have final say
You do
( ) have final say
( ) () (') And if  don't like what they are doing to her
You don't sign the papers
He cannot make the film unless you grant the rights
() It's an exploratory trip-- Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away from the tree and sticks to her living room window
(') What do you say
( ) want to keep my house
- large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and smiles
(35) is handsome and rugged, a wild poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas
Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter
was quite sure  had left her around here somewhere
Ginty giggles
(') Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm- - goodness
've quite forgotten
Could it be Prunella
No
Pamela
No
You're right still doesn't sound quite-- 'm sure  have a special name for her-- Ginty
Why, thank you ma'am
Ginty it is of course
() Now, have you seen her
It's me
Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her face
Gosh
So it is
Well, thank goodness for that
was positive was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy
You can't lose me
Never
promise
will never lose you
He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through the park, neighing like a horse
(') Hurry now
We mustn't be late
The adventure is about to begin
- Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet bag into an overhead locker
Can  help you
'm perfectly capable thank you
The flight attendant tries to help anyway
(') They've used all the space; so greedy
She glares at the people around her
'll take it Madam
can put it up here - don't want it up there
want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat
The flight's closing in just a few moments Ma'am
'll have to take it
Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say ` dare you
'  woman, with an infant, stands up
( ) You can put my bag up front instead
The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the woman's bag with Pamela's
( ) Will the child be a nuisance
It's an eleven hour flight
( ) Er-- no, -- Jolly good
Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac
She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together
She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead
(') ( ) hope we crash
The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified
-  -  (1906) (3) and  - the girls mother, delicate, weak - stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home
Suitcases bulge at their feet
Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from his shoulders and plops her on the ground
The carriage
Who needs a carriage my love stroll is a gift
(beat, excited) Everybody ready
& Yes
Yep
Margaret takes her youngest child  (1) from the nanny
Come along my team
We mustn't miss the train
(to her staff) Thank you so much
For everything
( ) See you soon Katie Nanna
She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away, heartbroken
Walking bus
The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in the lead
(') Don't forget Andrew
Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps her sister too
(') Ready
And off we go
Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as Travers and the girls march down the street
(') Left, right, left, right
Coming through
Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a picture of the home she leaves behind
- The procession continues into the bustling downtown
- It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a  marks a chalkboard with destinations and mileage
Ginty stops, looks at the list
The last city is-- -- - The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake of Allora
- As it disappears
Ginty stands on the last train platform, watching her home, her past, fade into the distance
Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame
- Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open
She's disturbed by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if somehow batting the memories away
She sighs loudly and digs her heel into the carpet of the plane
-  - bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals area
She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies: she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, , finally falling upon her own name -
Travers - underneath "Walt Disney Presents"
Oh does he indeed
She approaches the uniformed driver ( - Mickey Mouse on his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile
Travers
Travers
Mrs
Welcome, Mrs
Travers
Welcome to the City of Angels
Pamela sneers
He grabs her bags
(') Let me take those
'm perfectly capable of-- Oh, nevermind
Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors-- - --and into the sunlight
Sun came out to say hello just to you
Don't be preposterous
Pamela sniffs the air
(') It smells
Like-- Jasmine
--chlorine and sweat
Ralph chuckles
(') It's dreadful
- The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish billboard advertising
- Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car
She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in- car bar
( ) Absurd
Ralph looks at her in the rearview
You okay back there Mrs
Travers
It's not Mrs
It's just Mrs-- Oh, it's so hot
No problemo
We got a brand new air conditioning system, Missus; cool you right down in no time
Just about make you feel like you're in good old Engerland again
Things they can put in cars these days-- (he shakes his head in ) Gosh almighty
Pamela presses her fingers to her temples
She looks around, finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's natter
(') (happy as a clam) No problemo
- With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun
The limo glides into the forecourt
-    - porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway
Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am
Unpack
To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe ma'am
Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments  suggest you take employment in a launderette
The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door
(') Yes
His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela
She closes the door on him
(') Odd
She turns and for the first time takes in-- (') Oh my
--The  suite she has been assigned; it is opulent beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across every surface of the room
(') Oh no, no, no
Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable
Imagine it
Nope
Pamela cannot contain her horror
She stares at it in disgust for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket
She stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out
She turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her
(') (muttering to the pears) This won't do
She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight-- -  - --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight
Travers, Margaret and the children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway
From their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home
The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush greens of Maryborough
The house is ramshackle and meagre
swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch
palace
Complete with mighty steed
And chickens
-- Travers puts an arm around her shoulder
We'll build beautiful memories here my angel
Margaret offers him a trusting smile
Yes
Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards their new home
The chickens scatter
(in the distance) --in this house you get to share a bedroom
Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles
-  - green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another
We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free swimming pool
-  - Good riddance
She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors
(') ( ) Well, first things first
She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in a closet
She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where the  stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the entire bed
Imagine it
Nope
(') Good Lord
Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the floor, facing the wall
(') ( ) And you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety
Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack
She takes from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night stand, followed by another bottle and another and another
The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up, the bag is endless
Things, things and more things come streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature Buddhas
Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed picture of herself
She holds it up, admires it, takes down an existing painting and replaces it with her own image
(') There
Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in front of a full length mirror, admiring herself
She turns her face slightly to catch it at its best angle
She leans forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly unlined for a woman of her years
She smiles, full of vanity
(') () Yes
(answering an imaginary ) Well, no,  don't suppose  do mind
She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort
(') Now, really
Flatterer
(then scolding herself) Silly girl
She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement
She points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the bursts into life
(') Oh
She clicks again, the  goes off, again and it's on housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented
(') Soap for the brains
She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen
It takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of    (58) on The Wonderful World of Disney Show
Pamela raises an eyebrow-- (') Well, well-- There you are
: Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out
Don't worry
There's nothing wrong with your television set
This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears
Tinkerbell flies into shot
(') Oh there you are Tink
She covers Walt in fairy dust
(') () Hey
Get that stuff off of me
( ) You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly
Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and switches him off
Off
That's how we deal with you
- tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door
-    - Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there
The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her bed
- Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately, not a hair out of place
The limo pulls up to the curb and Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car and rush round to open the passenger door
Good morning Mrs
It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do bother
We're just not going to get it right are we
Hm
Will it be the same driver every day
(oblivious to her tone) Yes ma'am
'm all yours
() Sun came out again
You say it like you're surprised
Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for
It seems you think that  am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day
For goodness sake, it's California
It certainly is
He gestures for her to get in
(') (trying a British accent) Madame
Pamela grimaces
- Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap
Ralph climbs into the driver's seat
(as much to herself as ) would so much rather be accountable for the rain
Oh, that's sad
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion
shan't bother explaining why; ' (she makes gesture for flying over his head) Zip
Okey dokey
The rain brings life
So does the sun
Be quiet
Yes ma'am
Ralph starts the engine and drives away
-  - in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a very twee forecourt
They are:   (45) and the  , (34), he leans on an old worn cane and  (31), who has a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face
Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help her from the vehicle but she pushes it away
Pamela
Good morning
It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name
Mrs Travers
Please
The Sherman's look at each other
Uh oh
do apologize, Mrs Travers
() am Don DaGradi, the script writer
Co-script-writer
shall certainly be having my say Mr
DiGraydi
Gradi
Wonderful
welcome it
If indeed we ever sign off on a script
Bob and Dick flash each other a look
What the fu
Uh
Okay, so this is the rest of your team, Dick and Bob Sherman
Music and lyrics
( ) Boys, this is the one and only Mrs Travers, creator of our beloved Mary
Poppins
Who else
Mary Poppins
Never ever just Mary
(to Dick and Bob) pleasure to meet you, though fear we shan't be acquainted for too long
Excuse me
These books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing
No
Certainly not a musical
Now, where is Mister Disney
'd very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible
Don
Not a music--
If you'll point me in his direction
Uh-- erm
Ha
We had planned a little tour of the studio for you -- No thank you
--Wanted to show the place off
No one likes a show off
Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building
Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to-- Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing
-  - The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios on a golf buggy
am perfectly capable of walking
couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to the golf cart, waving brightly
Goofy opens his arms to Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror
(') Shoo
Go away
The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod meaning `beat it'
(') Ghastly
Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock
-   - Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office, where  - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at her
( ) Could you let-- (over, to Dolly) Would you let Mister Disney know have arrived please
Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and picks up the phone
(whispering into phone) She's here
word of advice Mrs Travers, if may
You may
Whether  heed it or not will be another matter entirely
Wow
Uhm
It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney
We are all on a first name basis here
( ) Dolly
Is he--
We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms outstretched
Well, there ya are at last
Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to greet her
(') Oh my dear gal
Pamela is open mouthed
(') You can't imagine how excited  am to finally meet you
Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of enthusiasm
She extends a formal hand before he manages to get her in an embrace
Oh
He squeezes her tight and then lets go
Pamela struggles to compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in decades
(') Hum-- ah
It's an honour, Mister Disney
Disney winces
Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya know
`Mister Disney' was my old man
There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old man
' (') Come here
Come here
He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads her into his interior office past an imposing floor to ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards
-   - He smiles at  - who mans the second desk
Tommie, say hi to the one and only Travers
Hi there
It's so nice to-- But Pamela has already been whisked through to Disney's personal office
'  - Disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with pictures of his daughters and wife
Framed posters of his films provide splashes of color to the cream walls
Have a seat, sit down
He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign above it: We Can Make Them Live
Walt perches on the edge of the desk, close to her, gazing at her
(') Ya know,  can't believe it
Travers, right here, in my office, after all these years-- almost twenty of `em
(shakes his head) Twenty
Long
Years
Pamela narrows her eyes
(') Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam
As lean as a whippet  was
race horse
Interestingly, she doesn't pull him up on using her first name and shortening it too
(') But now, here you are
Look at you
could eat you up
That wouldn't be appropriate
He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to face Pamela
When Diane here was seven years old -- can  get you a drink
Coffee
Soda
pot of tea would be most welc-- () She was seven years old and  was walking past her bedroom and there she was on her bed reading to Sharon, and well, they were just giggling their little socks off
(he picks up the phone, presses a button) Tommie, pot of tea please dear-- You're a doll
(he puts the phone down) She's a doll
Anyways  asked them "Girls, what's so funny
" And Diane said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy
" Well,  had no idea what a Mary Poppins was
And then she gave me your book
And by gosh
He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his point
(') My imagination was caught on fire
And  mean
And those embers have burned ever since-- as you know
do
Twenty years
Yes
Twenty
So you keep 've been asking, asking, -- -- Pamela stops talking and waits for Disney to calm down
(') got old asking
He sits back down on his desk
What a charming story
About my getting old
About your daughters
Yeah  suppose it is
(he looks at the picture) They're both women now
Gosh
Can you believe it
Children grow up
Now Pam, a man can't break a promise to his kids
No matter how long it takes to keep
No matter how long
You might've kept me dangling all this time but now we gotcha
Gotcha indeed
Mister Disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself
-- was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years
Honestly,  feel corralled, ensnared-- Pam, Pam, the last thing  want is to make you feel-- My name, if you please, is Travers
You see,  promised them
That's a fact
You got kids
-- () have never,  swear, never broken a promise to either one of my Disney girls
Well, that's very honourable of you -- That's what being a daddy is all about right
( ) Is it
This movie isn't just going to make my kids happy
It's going to make kids happy
You see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary
He's up again
(') ,Pam
-- Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the room
Mary Poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books
The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him
(') Now imagine
This magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing
Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room
Walt picks up the tea pot
Yes, this singing,  am glad you've come to that
(addressing his tea ) Milk first
Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and picks up the milk jug, he pours
(') That's right
Now the tea-- He picks up the pot again and pours the tea
(') And a spoonful of sugar
He stirs
(') You don't mean for this film to be a musical
( ) absolutely do
He presents her with the cup
No
No
No
She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good
(') Not bad
No, Mister Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing
Oh yes she does
When
In your books
Those aren't songs
They're recitations
She is not a giddy woman, she does not jig
Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress
No
It would just ruin it
Walt is baffled
He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs loudly
Pamela's jaw drops
(') won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons
Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the smile back on
Tell ya what
You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then 'm the King of England
Pamela rolls her eyes
If you're the King of England then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you  do;  shouldn't think you would like that very much
Bet you would
She smirks, as does he
() do quite like Greensleeves
Greensleeves huh
Come to think of it
That's a song wouldn't object to
Greensleeves
Yes
He's not sure if she's playing with him
Pam,  want you to know that the last thing  would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story have cherished
He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her teacup, it's awkward
(') (gazing into her eyes) The pages are worn down to tissue, dog eared and falling out
have poured over them gripped, tormented
Because  love Mary Poppins, you got to share her with me
Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally barking
(') course nothing happens without your say so
Absolutely Nothing
Quite right
She extricates her hand
It's all in the rights agreement
As approved by your agent, Dermot
Diarmuid
Darmitt
Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, Pamela takes it without looking and folds it up
(waving the agreement) live action film
No animation
Live action
'd like that on tape
Hm
Your promise-- and all the discussions we have here-- on tape
Tape you say
She pops the rights document in her bag
Walt's joviality, his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second
Ah there you are
() Mary Poppins and the Banks's, they're family to me
understand
do
Well then
She stands up and smooths down her skirt
(') Shall we begin
He holds out his hand for her to shake
Let's make something wonderful
She leaves his hand hanging in mid air
Let's see if that's at all possible
Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face that Disney does not see
() Woah
() Damn
- Travers sits, looking out at the dimming sky, playing a mournful air on his tin whistle, Ginty curled up in his lap, Andrew the dog asleep beside him
Margaret steps out onto the veranda an almost imperceptible glance at the half-empty bottle at his feet
It's rather late-- Travers continues to play
(') Biddy and Moya are already asleep
Travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs
Ginty
He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap
Good night father
() `night mother
Good night dear
Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty's hair as the little girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door, watching her parents
Travers pats his knee and Margaret perches on it
'll make us a good life
() promise
() 'll make you proud again
Margaret strokes Travers face and turns her face to the sky
Look at the stars
- Pamela sits at a large meeting table as Dolly bustles around her placing refreshments
Pamela lays out her pencils one by one, makes sure her notebook is `just so
' bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she snatches it away, glaring at the table which is now laden with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels to candy, coffee to soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous bouquets of flowers
(peering around a vase at ) What is all this jollification
We have a whole script to get through
It's gonna be a long day Mrs
She shoots him dead with a killer stare
(') --ravers
We could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone
Ugh, It's so vulgar
She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of Dick's piano
Bob moves it from the piano to the floor
() That is a very expensive piano
And these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive
Bob hasn't a clue what to say
Pamela smoothes down her skirt and re-takes her seat
Everybody waits
Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly turns on
(') Let us begin
She perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script - "Walt Disney's Mary Poppins

No, No, Mrs Travers please go ahead
Yes,  do think it's best

Readings of my books you know
Anyway-- () Scene one

17 Cherry Tree Lane, London
Day
She nods
(') Yes
That's good, that can stay
() That's just the scene heading
--Though  do think we should say number 17, instead of just 17, yes
It's proper
& No one's going to see it
will see it
She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who are dumbstruck
(') Write it down, write it down, chop chop
Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is staring at Dick and Bob
They dutifully pick up their pencils and note their scripts too
(') Is that on the tape
Don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods
Yes
Good-- onwards
They are interrupted by  carrying a new tray of refreshments
'm sorry to interrupt
Is this a joke
Excuse me
Do you think you are a comedienne
'm sorry  don't understand
Dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers, distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance
Unbelievable
Pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore Dolly and carry on
(') Scene One
Exterior
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane
London
Day
() (') Bert, a one-man band-- (she looks up) The rumour is that this is to be your Mister Van Dyke is it
We do hope so
Hmmm, we'll see about that
He's totally wrong, totally and utterly
Dick is one of the greats
Dick Van Dyke
Robert, my dear, Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness - greats without question
(speaking loudly into the ) can assure you Dick Van Dyke is not
(back to script) Bert, a one-man band plays to a small gathering outside the gates to the park
() -- (she looks to Don) You can do Bert
(through gritted teeth) Thank you
( ) Alright Ladies and gents, comical poem, suitable for the occasion-- Dick jumps up and sits at the piano
(') --extemporized and thought up before your very eyes
Alright, here we go-- Dick begins to play and sing, he pounds the keys with gusto, smiling away, acting it out with all his heart and soul, almost unable to contain himself with glee
Bob occasionally joins in for a word or two but is much more serious, eyeing Travers for her every reaction
() Room here for everyone gather around, ' / "responstable
" Now, how does that sound
No no no no no no no
Dolly winces on everyone's behalf and leaves the room
(') Responstable is not a word
() We made it up
Well, un-make it up
Dick quickly hides the next set of sheet music entitled: (') 've a thought
've always liked Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay
Now, that would be a wonderful song for the film
Oh
And Admiral Boom could sing it
Do you see
Dick's fingers crunch the piano keys
-    - Pamela's door opens a crack and another half-eaten room service meal appears as she kicks it into the hallway
She shuts the door quickly behind her
- Pamela lies awake staring at the ceiling
Irresponstable
-    - : tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden clothes-peg people
Ginty puts the finishing touches to the bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder
The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears, atop his horse
Ahhh, there's my girl
The horse moves up to her
(') That's it Albert
Give Ginty a smooch
There's a good boy, give her a little smooch
The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and ear as Travers climbs down from the nag
(') Poor old Albert; he's your secret uncle you know
But a miserable, horrid witch turned him into a nag
Why did she do that
Because she hated the sound of his laugh
Poor Uncle Albert
How can we fix him
We have to teach the witch how to be happy again
How
'm not quite sure darling
() Your mother's been calling you for a good hour
shouldn't go if were you, she's after little slaves for housework
( ) Ah,  must scrub and bake and sweep Till stars are beginning to blink ; And the young lie long and dream in Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head
Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the end of daughter's nose
(') Do you want to know what it feels like to fly Ginty
She nods
He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings Ginty up so she is facing him
(') You trust me
She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder
He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms
(') Gee up, Albert
Yah
Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars
(') Yah
Ginty squeals with delight
- Pamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty sidewalks
She looks dazed, extremely tired-- Nobody walks
() Leisurely stroll's a gift
- The limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista
Beautiful ain't it
(refusing him the ) If you like that sort of thing
do
-  - Travers and Ginty gallop at great speed
The horse kicking up great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance
- Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row of storyboard illustrations for the film
Dolly trundles along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from
We do find it helps to have a visual
It's fun
She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house
No, no, no
Goodness no
No
The Banks house doesn't look like that
My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable
The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink -- (gesturing to the tape ) Did we get that
(to herself, slightly ) Oh dear, it's all a big mistake
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's too grand
The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people
This isn't normal
It isn't everyday
They're not aristocrats
Interesting
Don allows a tiny smile
She is right
Pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on
( ) Okay
She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a suffragette ribbon
(') () Do  even have to say it
Um-- yeah
Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette
wonder if Emmeline  would agree with that adjective-- Quite possibly, looking back
Dick mouths `oh my god
' It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of-- Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful
Yep
No
Of course not
We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining-- Being a mother is a job
very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place
The boys see that Pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment, until-- (') will  have her called Cynthia
Absolutely not
It feels unlucky
Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob
(') No it should be something warm, a bit sexy
They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her mouth
(') How about Mavis
Sybil
Sure
Prudence
Gwendolyn
Great
Winifred
could go with Winifred
Yes, that's because it's very good
She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face
(') This isn't Mr Banks
She turns to face Don and the boys
(') This isn't him
Ahm, yeah, that's him-- He has a set of moustaches
In the books he-- told the illustrator  didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me
This is  film and this time around  shall have way
(clearing her throat) Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt
Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly flushes
(to the boys) Why
Everyone shrugs, they don't know why
(') He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven
Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud, unashamed moan
Does it mattterrrrrrr
Bob, Bob, Bob-- Pamela stares at Bob
You can wait outside
She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger
Bob is literally stunned
Dick stifles a laugh
(') shan't say it again Robert
Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear: (
) ( ) What is wrong with his leg
He got shot
Hardly surprising
Pamela smiles sweetly
(') Can  expect anymore drama from anyone else
/ -    - Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator
She spies the bar, full of people laughing, exclaiming, enjoying one another's company
She takes it in melancholically for a second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved when the doors finally slide open
-  -  - Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on from the doorway
He picks up his razor and begins to scrape away the stubble
Why do you do that
For you my dear
(he flicks the blade in the air like a swordsman) Swish
Which kind of kisses do you prefer Gintamina
Swoosh
Scratchy ones or silky ones
() Silky ones
man must shave for to spare his daughter's cheeks
Swish
-  - Pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror
She runs a finger through the steam on the glass
Swish
And again
(') Swoosh
-  - Dolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the rehearsal room door where fractious voices ring out
(
) Stop
Stop
Stop
What on earth are you talking about
Supercali--
Supercali-- or whatever the infernal thing is
It's something to say when you don't know what to say
Well  always know what to say
The slamming of a piano lid
Dolly pushes the door open with her foot
(
) (') If you so much as step one foot in here with that tray  shall scream
One cannot live on cake alone
- Dolly stands in Disney's office
Hit me with it
She has a lot of-- ideas
Ya
What kind of ideas
About how she, uh, sees things
And just how does she `see' things
Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad
() The name Cynthia has been changed to Winifred
Okay that'll work
She won't approve Dick Van Dyke
Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too
(') The sketches of the Banks house make it look too opulent, there must be no hint of romance between Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to know why Mr Banks has been given a moustache, the-- asked for that
Yes
They did tell her but she wants to know why
Because  asked for it
Right
Of course
Uh-- the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape, not a ruler, we must add gravi-- gravitas, she says
Gahd
Anything else
She only wants green vegetables and broth,  don't know what that is but she wants it in the room from now on and oh
She doesn't want the colour red in the film-- at all
- Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table
Bob hovers by the door in a right humph
Disney prefers to stand, grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy
've simply gone off the colour
Their mouths are agape
(') You did say  was to have final say did you not
We can't make the film without the colour red
It's set in London for pete's sake
And
There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms-- heck
The British flag
Pamela, 'm not sure why '-- understand your predicament Mr Disney,  do
just-- hm--  don't know what it is, 'm just suddenly very anti-red
shan't be wearing it ever again
Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks eyes with her
Is this a test Pam
Are you requiring proof of how badly wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together
Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly recovers and eyeballs him right back
took you at your word Mr Disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied
There will be many more, so-- perhaps we should just call it quits and  should hand you back these
She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him
Disney smiles at Pamela
Alright
No red in the film
Pamela glances at the tape recorder
What
Walt
Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in
Disney strides out of the room
-  - Disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal room
He stops, turns, goes back to the door, puts his hand on the handle, stops himself and moves on
- Dick, Don and Bob are left astounded
They look at one another
He doesn't have the rights-- All three turn their heads to turn to her
Quite
Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths down her skirt and opens the script
(') Now, If you're insisting upon this musicality you feel is  important for my film then  suggest  hear one of your ditties
No one is in the mood to sing for her
(') shall keep an open mind
Nanny
Yeah, do nanny
Dick begins to play-- () Wanted a nanny for two adorable children
Pamela sighs, so do Don and Bob
(') If you want this choice (expecting Dick to stop) position, No no
They can't make deman-- have a cheery disposition-- But Dick ignores her and carries on
-- No warts
Who in the world put that in
(') Play games, all sorts
Hm
(') You must be kind, you must be Well of all the ridiculous--
very sweet and fairly pretty (') Take us on outings, give us Completely defeats the-- Bob and Don are trying to stop themselves from laughing as Dick barrels right over everything Pamela says, almost as if the two of them are doing a duet
(') Sing songs, bring sweets No sweets
(') Never be cross or cruel Who would give a child cast-- Never give us castor oil or
Dick grimaces (a la Michael Banks
) (') Love us as a son and daughter And never smell of barley What in the world does water smelling of barley water have to do with anything
You wrote that in your book
She wrote that in her--
Yeah,  think-- (over) You can't say that-- If you won't scold and (') We will never give you cause Hate is too strong a wor-- to hate us-- We won't hide your spectacles (into tape recorder) so you cant see Nobody's listening to me
Put toads in your bed-- Ridiculous
(') Or pepper in your tea No
Hurry, Nanny
Sincerely, Jane and Michael Banks: Jane and Michael Banks
Well  simply don't know what to say
That's the worst song 've ever heard
() Ever
Alright
'  - Walt stands looking out of his window
: Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms clasped around her body, her face to the sky
She sits perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out, patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her
Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello
He opens the back door for her and she climbs in
Tommie
Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to Walt
Scotch Mist
What do you think
What do  think -- what
You're a woman
That's a canny observation Walt
What am  missing
You think the female of the species has some kind of psychic insight when it comes to others of her kind
Walt continues to stare out of the window
(') We don't
() You'll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling
Give it up
Tommie waits for a response but he's still window bound, filled with intrigue as he watches the car disappear
() That woman
/ -    - Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator
She spies the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails
The elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar instead
Good afternoon Ma'am
What can fix you
pot of tea
Sure thing
Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs Travers
The tea pot arrives
Thank you
Tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree
But the barman has already moved on to another patron
Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go
The barman talks with another customer further along the bar
Nobody notices Pamela
In this setting she looks like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring into her empty cup
-  - Ginty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive in front of the huge double doors to the bank
An upright, top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open chivalrously for her
-  - Ginty and the man enter the bank
Thank you
bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman
Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett
Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously
Ginty and   are startled for a second by a loud crash
Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers' office
The etching on the glass reads: - - Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on the floor
He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been drinking
( ) Belhatchett
Bell
Hatchett
Ha
It's a ridiculous moniker
-- And Mr Belhatchett has complained that  opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he
Hahaaa
(in a comedy voice) Time's Money, Goff, y'know
Time's money my man
The clerk laughs nervously
(') Bell Hatchett
Beautiful hatchet
That's what it means
And  suppose if the poor dumb lambs on his downs, are five minutes late with their calving, or they don't drop dead on schedule when he wants a roast, he takes to them with the business end of his beautiful hatchet
Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks
(') There, whack
That'll teach you for not dropping your bairns on schedule
Whack
Whack
Whack
Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his eyes widen
(') Whack
Whoops
(through the door) Mr Belhatchett
Allow me to-- Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and is felled
(') Ginty
want you gone
All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to have forgotten
Travers is overcome with embarrassment and guilt
Sweet thing
What are you doing here
Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager
You said today was-- Ice cream day
Yes
did
What kind of father am
() Are you fired again
Ah, yes it does seem that-- ( ) No
No sweetheart-- he isn't
( ) Just wait in my office for a second darling
Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear
If you can't straighten up for your own sake
Do it for your daughter
(muttering to himself) Irresponsible
Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them
Ice cream is so rare because it only comes from Siberian cows
Did you know that
() Brrrrrrrr
-  - Ginty and Travers sit by the river
Ginty eats an enormous ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask
We share a Celtic soul, you and
This world is just an illusion, Ginty old girl
As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us
Money, money, money
Don't you buy into it Ginty
It'll bite you on the bot
How did we end up here eh
Look at it
Barren
Breathless
Get as far away from this place as possible my love
Find yourself a patch of green
( ) It's a chimera you know
The world, the bank, you and , Mr Randolph- whackety-whack-Belhatchett
All an illusion
He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep melancholy
Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound unhappiness, but unable to understand its source
-    - Another untouched meal in the hallway
-    - Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear
( ) loathe this place, Mr Russell
How can a place so sunny be so cold
We don't hear what Diarmuid says
(') meant heartless
'm afraid a jumper wouldn't suffice
It's bringing up these-- it's so hot and stuffy  feel like  am being attacked
These odd dreams, like my subconscious is after me
Punishing me for entertaining the idea that might hand her over
am at war with myself Mr Russell
() The script is ghastly, exactly as -- () Yes, a few more days and then 'll -- () know,  know  need the money
The money
The money
( ) Money
It'll bite you on the-- ( ) It's all an illusion you know Mr Russell
All an illusion
() Very well
Good morning and goodnight
She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright
Wide awake
Staring into the darkness
Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for something to help her
Nothing
She groans as she drags herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps
(') Serves me right
Money, money, money
Bit me on the bot
Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse
She drags it onto the bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto the stuffed toy for comfort
- The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast and models of the sets all about the place
And of course, the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a fluorescent looking soup
Bob and Dick are at the piano
Don sits in the corner, sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers
It's gotta be like a slogan
Her prescription for life
Yeah
Yes
stitch in time
An apple a day
(from across the room) Time and tide wait for-- Sugar
Sugar
(') What
That's not-- Jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday
Ouch
No ouch
No ouch
Sugar
They put it in a cube
Medicine in sugar
Cube's an odd word
(') Spoonful
Dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off his stool
() Yeah, we have sugar
-  - Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her
May  walk with you
'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement
As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot
- Dick is playing about with a verse
Go back to the chorus
& (singing it incorrectly) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Wait
She always does what's unexpected
She goes  the bannisters
Dick is confused
(') So go up
Dick plays a high note
(') Try
He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet music
Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano & (singing `down' in an up ) Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Don looks up from his sketching
Yes
The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival
Man is in the forest
Pamela and Walt enter the room
(') ( ) want you to hear this
(to the boys) Play him what you got
Walt takes a seat beside the piano
Pamela folds her arms across her chest defiantly
It's just a chorus-- Tell us what you think
He knows dum dum Will help dum dum dum duuuum
Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the song
() Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down-- the medicine go do-own, medicine go down Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down In a most de da dee daaa
We'll work out the other lyrics
You see how it goes up on the word down
On the word down it goes up
() Up
It's ironic
Is it
Forget ironic, it's iconic
Pamela rolls her eyes
() Bravo
won't be able to stop singing that for weeks
It seems enormously patronising to me
The very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park  daresay
All giddy and carefree, encouraging children to face the world unarmed
All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life's tools
Wonderful
Dick is completely deflated
What's your point Pam
Travers
My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy
She is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know
She prepares them for it, she deals in honesty
One must clean one's room; it won't magically do it itself
She waves the script in the air
(') This whole script is flim flam
Where is its reality
Where is its heart, where is the gravitas
She opens a window and flings the script out
(') No weight Mister Disney
See
Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot
No whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children
You think Mary Poppins is saving the children Mr Disney
Pamela sighs, shakes her head
(') Oh dear
- Pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for Ralph
She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her eyes
( ) It goes up
-  - Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately shushing her screaming infant
There there
Shush shush now-- Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the girls
(') (to the girls) If you could just-- () Ahoy Goffs
The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so early
Father
She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one arm, catching Biddy with the other
What a lovely surprise
Did you finish early
couldn't stop thinking about my beautiful girls on this beautiful day in this beautiful place and thought to hell with it
(to Ginty and Biddy) And what do we say about beauty ladies
// thing of beauty is a joy forever
-- Buts are for goats my love
He dips her and smooches her
& Urgh
(whispering to Margaret) 'll put in extra hours tomorrow
( ) What are we playing
The hen got out and we've been trying to catch her
Travers spies the clucking demon
That's no hen
That's Aunt Ellie, your mother's horrendiferous sister
() That's a made up word
Really
Not the aunt
() Quick
Catch her before she flies away on the-- / East Wind
Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them into the ground
Oh
'll wash them again my love
Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs
The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life
Even the dog joins in, Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it back inside - out of sight, out of mind
(') Go Sergeant Ginty
Fell the beast
Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and scarpers
It's chaos
Travers, the girls, the dog and the evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other, cursing and laughing
Aunt Ellie
Oh she's a foul fowl
' /'  - Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled firmly under her arm
She can hear the tense voices of her parents
--darling, it's just that um-- a -- --Meg sweet,  had a throat scratch- --the bank is getting you down again
Perhaps my sister-- God no
No
can endure
will endure
For the girl's sake-- Just, please-- not Ellie
Oh my dear-- Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little face in the hens feathers
() Foul fowl
-    - Pamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face is screwed into a twist of unhappiness
-  - Disney sits on Pamela's bench, deep in contemplation
Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a -- All around the cathedral the saints and apostles look down as she sells her wares Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the sound
(') Although you can't see it you know they are smiling Each time someone shows that he -- - Walt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song, a cough rattling in his throat
- Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano
Bob asleep on a couch in the corner
Walt pushes the door open, Dick knows he's there but keeps tinkling away
Though her words are simple and few listen, listen, she's calling to -- "Feed the birds, tuppence a bag tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
" That'll work
Dick nods, still playing
Walt makes his way to the piano, sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool
(') She's going to say no isn't she
() Woman's a conundrum
Dick stops playing and flicks to a new page of sheet music
man has dreams of walking with To carve his niche in the edifice () Before the mortar of his zeal Has a chance to congeal The cup is dashed from his lips The flame is snuffed aborning He's brought to rack and ruin in -- Walt laughs out loud, he sings with Dick reading the lyrics from the music sheet
& My world was calm, well ordered, Then came this person, with chaos in her wake And now my life's ambitions go with one fell blow It's quite a bitter pill to take
Inspired by someone we know
( ) You'd have to ask Bob
The men smile, bittersweet
(') She might surprise us all
She won't
You don't know that
do
know it,  know it only too well
() 've fought this battle from her side
Pat Powers, he wanted the mouse and  didn't have a bean back then
Dick raises his eyebrows
(') He was this big terrifying New York producer and  was just a kid from Missouri with a sketch of Mickey but-- it woulda' killed me to give him up
Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob
(') Honest to god killed me
That mouse, he's family
() Go home
Walt leaves the room
-  - Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at the stars
The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the water making it look like a chalk painting
(
) The world is an illusion Ginty
-  - Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped around her body, face to the sky
The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last deafening chorus of the birds
Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened
His shirtsleeves are marked with sweat
His face is a study of something close to despair
He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of greeting
Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick
Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on
am laying eggs
Really
Fabulous
Today  am a hen
Indeed
can see the feathers sprouting as we speak
Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her husband and knows he is drunk
Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please
'm not Helen
() She can't possibly lay a table; she's busy laying eggs
need-- (help
) She's laying
(her face contorts in ) 'm sorry
She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her
Ginty gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm
He swallows hard, eyes welling
(urgent, his voice ) Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love
You can be anyone you want to be
Anyone
want to be like you
Don't
( ) Don't leave yourself always searching for-- something-- He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the porch
Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around to the side of the house where she watches her father appears in the window of the washroom
She doesn't know what to do as he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing
- Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind
Her arms wrapped around her chest, her face turned to the window
Ya alright Mrs
Pamela doesn't even hear him
- Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush in her hand, dripping colour down her arm
She is nudged to the present by her teacher,
Helen Goff
Wake up dear
You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you
Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads: Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its bridal
-  - Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground
Tents are erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal
Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals
(a flutter of pride) He is indeed
On behalf of the bank
- Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on what's going on in the room
Mrs Travers
Again, she doesn't hear
(') Mrs Travers
Pamela looks at Don
(') We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank
() Would that be good
Pamela nods, noncommittal
(') (as Dawes Snr) So you have tuppence
May  be permitted to see it
(changing voice to Michael ) No,  want it to feed the birds
(back to Dawes Snr) Fiddlesticks boy
Feed the birds and what've you got
// Fat birds
(singing more sotto than ) But
If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank -  - (
) Safe and sound-- small stage and dais stand central of the event over which a large sign reads: (
) Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank will compound-- The Allora townsfolk are out in force
Ginty walks with her family
Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as they pass through the crowds
(
) And you'll achieve that sense of -- Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family walk past
(clears his throat) Mr Belhatchett
Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on
Margaret looks upset by this
(
) As your affluence expands-- Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them to Ginty and Biddy
Travers, Biddy's stomach-- Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you
Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut
Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent
() Father-- will you ride the carousel with me
But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip
Meet you there in a blink of an eye
- As before
() In the hands of the directors who invest as propriety demands
-  - Ginty stands with her family at the carousel, eyeing the refreshment tent
( ) 'll take Biddy to get ready for her dance
() Where's your father
Margaret sees the direction of Ginty's gaze
Her face falls but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage
(') Come on Biddy
- Ginty appears in the tent's entrance
On first glance she sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers
Relief begins to dawn and she turns away
It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre
Indeed, a published poet-- She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers hand
Father, come and look
Biddy's dancing
In a moment, my princess
'm talking
() Back in Ireland,  miss her green -- But she's-- she really wants you to watch, Dad
You'll miss it
Not now Biddy
'm Ginty
Ginty
Shoo
Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his shirt sleeve again
You said don't give up
waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her away
Excuse me, Miss
It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent
think you'll be more comfortable at the far end
() Are you alright sweetheart
( ) 'm scared my father is-- Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya, in the entrance
Her mother's face falls and crumples
-  - Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium
Margaret and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware
Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff
Why is he speaking for the bank
He's the manager
'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia
Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers
But before  begin, 'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community
Ginty allows herself to breathe
So far, so good
He's using too many `verys'
He always says `very' too much when '-- She can't say it
Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret pushes the hand away
- Pamela turns away from Don and the Shermans and takes herself to look at a sketch of Mr Banks, pinned to the wall, he still has a moustache
(as Dawes Snr) Very well, my boy, give me the ( ) No  won't  want it to feed the birds
(as Dawes Snr) Banks
( ) Yes sir
Now Micheal
When you deposit tuppence in a bank account, () (') Soon you'll see that it blooms into credit of a generous amount -  - Travers is now in lip synch with Dick Sherman
(
) And you'll achieve that sense And you'll achieve that sense of stature of stature As your influence expands as your influence expands To the high financial strata To the high financial strata That established credit now That established credit now -- -- - Don is up and singing with the boys
They are enjoying themselves so much that they don't notice Pamela's eyes well slightly

England stands
-  - There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged, Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful
But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front of the dais
Uhmm
Thank you kindly
Thanking you
Now-- what, what am  doing next
Oh
It's a marvellous idea to encourage children to open accounts
My daughter, the Princess Ginty-- she's-- uh
(looks at Ginty) How old are you
Come up here
Ginty - what
Me
Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs, makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais
Margaret watches, growing uneasy
(') Ginty has a bank account-- and that's good
Give her a drink
The audience is shocked
(') () mean give her a hand
Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable
(') shall return in just a moment to present the awards
But right now must-- relieve myself
Gasps from the audience
Margaret - dying
(') Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you
'm busting
There's a good girl
Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage, Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder
The shameful glare of Allora burning into them
(
) When fall the banks of England, England falls
Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps and topples off the stage
There's an audible, horrible snap as he lands in an undignified pile
But, despite his ugly injury, Travers cannot stop laughing
- The boys are laughing, congratulating one another
love it
You think Walt's gonna like it
Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins around viciously
Why did you have to make him so cruel
The boys jubilance is halted immediately
(') He was not a monster
Who are we talking about
'm confused
You all have children yes
Yes
Yep
Yes
And do those children write you letters, make drawings for you
Of course
Mine like to make folded paper-- (cutting him off) And would you tear up those gifts
In front of them
Silence
They know where this is going
(') It's a dreadful thing to do don't understand
Why must father tear up the advertisement his children have written and throw it in the fireplace
Why won't he mend their kite
Why have you made him so unspeakably awful
() For all the world to see, in glorious technicolor
You claim to make them live-- if that happens can't he
Can't they at least live well
Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress
(') can't bear it
() '-- The boys are shocked at the level of upset
(') Please don't-- 'll feel like  let him down again-- She leaves the room, head hung
-   - Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster
He is shaking badly with 's, his mood is poisonous
Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the  packs up his bag
don't suppose there's any more you can give me for the pain
The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more
(leaving the room) When will enough be enough Travers
've brought you something father
Be a darling Ginty my old pal
Help father out won't you
Ginty is wary
(') In my washroom-- there's a bottle of medicine that father needs-- Mother took it away
Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty
Godammit
Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper from her pocket
wrote a poem for you
It - it won first prize, at school
Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his shaking hand
(') Would you like me to read it to you
The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand
Finally, the humiliation is too much for Travers
He scans the page rapidly and lowers his hand
It's hardly Yeats, is it
Ginty is devastated
But more than this there's a hardening in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far she's held in check
Here are the first signs of the Pamela to come
-  - Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure
Don rushes out after her
Mrs Travers
He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed
-   - Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash but doesn't find what she's looking for
-  - Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria - and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of a soundstage
- Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what it is she's looking for
-   -  - Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into the dirt and lawn
-   - Ginty creeps into her father's room, he sleeps fitfully, and presses the half-full bottle into his hand
Covering both hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room
-   -  - Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in the grass
Mrs
Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not crying
(') , uh, brought you a tea
He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup
It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup
Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot
He's not quite sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea
Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the area around her
Everything okay Ma'am
Would you like me to drive you home
All the way to England
Yes, please
Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches
You got family back there Mrs
You're an impertinent man you know
You ask an awful lot of questions that have no relevance to you being able to carry out your duties
() know
do, do that
Yes
And you have no barometer
Ralph is confused
(') Let us say that  haven't family who'd notice whether  was halfway across the world or sitting in my living room
She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs together
'; -- Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he looks around for some more
Pamela takes a stick and digs a small line through the grass then hands it to him
Make a little furrow, there
Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil
Ralph pokes the ground, thinking
gotta kid
Well, most people do
Jane-- she's got all kinds of troubles
Pamela raises an eyebrow
(') Handicapped you know
Myelitis-- transverse
() She's in a wheelchair see
That's why  concern myself with the weather-- sunny day she can sit out in the garden
Rainy day  have to leave her cooped up inside
() Worry `bout the future, but then stop cuz you can't do that
Only today
Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes holes in it
Now look
She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig struts forming a roof
(') It's a band stand
She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park
river
( ) Lake
Lake
() Hey
wish  could take her there
He points at the miniature park
Wouldn't that be nice
& '  - Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem to her chest
The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes
There's just nothing there-- () know you gave it to him
(squeezing Ginty's hand) All the hope is in the bottom of that bottle, Helen
Mother
want you to take care of the children
Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand
(') Watch over them
Ginty sits up
(') know you love your father more
But one day you'll understand
What
Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed following her
Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is crying
-  - Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden like some ethereal ghost
Mother
She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy
(
) Ginty
Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness
() Mother
Mother
The baby is screaming now
& '  - Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in it, she scoops Moya up from the crib
Where's ma
Once upon a time there were three little girls alone in a house
They were frightened of the big wide world just outside the door
She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily outside the door to her fathers bedroom
It is slightly ajar and he looks incredibly frail and delirious
(') They were so afraid
She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting her mother to be standing there any minute but there is nothing
- The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of the creek
One step, two, three, the water coming up over her ankles, soaking the nightgown
(
) But the stars were guarding them, they glittered as they spoke "We shall send a guide to show them the way to the magical ladder which will bring them all the way up to " -   - Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front of the fireplace
And who do you think those sparkling messengers sent
Who was it that came flying through the starry, starry sky to carry us up to see them
Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms
An elf
-   - Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to the girls through the window
Their old Uncle Albert of course
(beat, to Biddy) Stay right here, be good-- Ginty climbs atop the horse
Are you going to the sky
'm going to find the end of the story so  can bring it back for you
Is it happy
- Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp still burns on the porch
- Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the creek
Shivering cold
She wills herself forward into the water
She wants to sink down and simply float away
From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves
Margaret turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty
Margaret begins to weep
Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother, wading into the water to grab hold of her
Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep water
Sometimes a person we love, through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose
It's time to go home, ma
She reaches out her hand-- - Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting something down on a piece Beverly Hills Hotel stationery every now and then
Presently, the phone rings
Pamela almost jumps out of her skin
She rushes to grab it
( ) Mrs Travers
Hello
'  -  -
Walt sits at his desk, flicking through cartoon drawings of penguins
(coughs into phone) Pam
() Mr Disney
Callin' to check up on you
Are you a doctor
Hm
Check ups are for medical practitioners no
Pam, are you always so battle ready
Travers in her breast plate and chain mail, sword up in the air and off with your head
What can  do for you Mister Disney
Please,  beg of you, please please call me Walt
Walt-- er
heard things didn't go so well today
They went as well as they've gone every other day that 've been here
don't recall `special' phone calls from you on any of those other evenings
What's this all about Pam
Really
Silence
(') 'm wondering what  have to do to make you happy
Ha
Aren't you wondering that too
Silence
(') (he has an idea) You know, you've never been to Disneyland
It's the happiest place on Earth
(shouting away from the ) Tommie
Cancel my morning tomorrow
'm taking a ride with my favorite author
( ) Any excuse
cannot tell you how uninterested, no, positively sickened  am at the thought of going to see your dollar printing machine Mr-- Walter
She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently turns his face away
Oh come on
When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself
Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air
Walt slams the phone down
Pamela stares at it in shock
(') Hello
Hello
He hung up
'm can't believe he hung up
Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters
'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs
Travers were to get hit by a large truck -- (he doesn't allow himself ) - Dick, Bob and Don are drained
They stare at each other in silence
Just the look tells us how much this all means to them
It's desperate
Walt flings the door to the room open
Okay boys
We gotta fix this
-   -  - Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge
The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence
(
) Oh my
And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell
(
) Margaret, my poor child
simply had to come
We must fix this
Travers eyes spring wide open in horror
The Aunt
-  - parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair
An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries - plonked on the living room table and there beside it, upright, imposing and matronly is   herself
Hair scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket - a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same
Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag
Now, 've brought every new fangled treatment available in Sydney
Biddy is open mouthed
(') Close your mouth please Biddy, we are not a codfish
(to both girls) spy a multitude of jobs to be done
They've been so worried-- 've-- Do stop babbling nonsense
'm here now and  shall fix everything
() Girls
() Feverfew and camomile to lower his body temperature
Garlic, sorrel, sage
Deadly nightshade
And if those don't work-- well  shouldn't like to say
Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance as item after item emerges from the carpetbag
(') --tincture of horseradish-- -- (to Ginty and Biddy) () (') thought  had made it quite clear you were to begin helping
Ellie claps her hands together
(') Spit spot
- Ralph drives along solemnly
Pamela looks out of the window, confused
Where are we--
This isn't the way
Change of venue this morning apparently
(realizing where she's ) Ugh
was thinking about our-- tea party
'm sure  don't know what you're-- () Yesterday, the little park
Little park
haven't a clue what you're talking about
-- Concentrate on the road
Always chitter chattering
- Ralph drives Pamela up to the entrance to the park
Two security guards stop the car briefly and then the gates pull open to reveal Walt Disney waiting for Pamela
- Ralph is goggle-eyed at seeing Walt
Oh
Isn't that nice
Holy mackerel
Wowzers
Never met him myself but there he is
Right there
Real
Living, breathing
Oh boy
- Ralph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but Disney is there first
Welcome to the Magic Kingdom
Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour and excitement
Is it all like this
Pamela pops a headache pill
Yup
Isn't it wonderful
Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away
Do you always get everything you want Walter
Pretty much
With the exception to the rights to my books of course
War ain't over yet Pam
Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp breaks free and rushes up to Walt
love you so much
Can --
She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and hands it to the woman
() Pre-signed
( ) You should get hers too
(gesturing to Pamela) This woman's a bona fide genius
The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts
she realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part like the red sea for Walt and his guest
-  - Walt and Pamela make their way down Main Street
Walt stops anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out postcards to anyone who gets near
In Adventureland there is a tree-- this is a fun fact
titbit
Tidbit
() It has three million leaves, four million flowers
Gosh
And they said only God could make a tree
Pamela rolls her eyes
There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed by their own thoughts
The sunshine, the joyful crowds just background colour
They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window
It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est
1895
Pamela notices the look but doesn't say anything
(') Where did she come from
Who
think you know who
She flew in through the window one day
Through the window huh
Pamela nods curtly
(') It's just that easy isn't it Mrs Travers
He sees right through her
(') know you don't wanna be here so 'm gonna take you to one ride-- my favourite amusement and then 'll set you free
Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance
'  -  - The carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children climb down from the horses and disappear into the park
Mrs Travers,  would be honoured if you would ride Jingles
She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse
He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's bridal
No thank you
'm happy to watch
No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child
Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel
(') There's a child in us all
Maybe in you Mister Disney, but certainly not
Get on the horse Pamela
Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse
(') When we first met, you said to me `they're family
' said what
Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're family
() The boys have had an idea for your Mister Banks
think it'll make you happy
You brought me all the way out here to tell me that
No
brought you all the way out here for monetary gain
Had a wager with the boys that  couldn't get you on a ride
win
He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride controller and off they go
Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney spilling out
The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars
(') Yah
'  -  - Travers has a violent coughing fit, he looks to his hand, disturbed to see blood there
He grimaces at Ellie who has her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep satisfaction on her face
Well begun, is half done
His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside the window, sweeping
Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness
- All the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela's tea
Good morning Mrs Travers
She looks at the new arrangement of the room
What horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today, hm
Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep calm
Now, Mrs Travers you sit here
He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room
He hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly
Don and Dolly drop to their knees so that they are half the height of Bob
Pamela raises an eyebrow
(') We thought about what you said Mrs Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel
He isn't
We've got a new ending for the film
Oh god,  hope you like it
Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back
(') ( ) Michael says, "He mended it
It's wonderful
" ( ) However did you manage it
( ) He mended it
Dick strikes a chord on the piano
() With tuppence for paper and strings You can have your own set of wings With your feet on the ground You're a bird in flight with your fist holding tight To the string of your kite Oh oh oh oh Bob takes the hands of Don and Dolly and he dances around with them (awkwardly as they are still on their knees and Bob has a limp
) Pamela's eyes on the fixed kite
& Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite Don notices Pamela's foot tapping, he stands up
And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon
(as Mrs Banks) " proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think
" Don drops to his knees again
/// Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Is Pamela humming too
/// (') Let's go fly a kite and send it Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz
Pamela is surprisingly elegant and accomplished
//// Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite Everybody is up and dancing, it's like something out of a Disney movie
When you send it flying up there All at once you're lighter than air Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room
(') You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees-- - Dolly pants her way to the top of the stairs, and sees Walt just about to enter his office
Mr Disney
Walt
Walt spins around
(') 'm sorry to interrupt
It's just she-- she's dancing
Mrs Travers
She's dancing with Don
He cracks a great big smile
(
) With your fist holding tight To the string of your kite - As before
/// Oh Oh Oh Oh Let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite
They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled
Well
Well
Yes
He fixes the kite
Oh,  love it
Dick punches the air
(') Though proper English would be `Let us go and fly a kite
' Bob glares at her
(') But  might be willing to overlook that
Did we get that on tape
Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth
-   - Ginty sits with her father, he's a shadow of his former self, extremely ill
The shaking has stopped, his lips are parched and blueish
Look at you-- all ship shape
Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's perfectly plaited hair
re-wrote the poem father
Travers doesn't respond
Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes out tuppence
(') The aunt gave me tuppence
She shows it to him in her open palm
(') Shall  buy you something father
( ) -- -    - Pamela sits bolt upright in bed, panicked
Father
-  - Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence
Chattering to herself about pears
- The limo crests the top of the hill
- Ralph admires the view as he always does
Do you know you're quite right
It is beautiful
Exquisite
It's always new
- Pamela leans on the piano peering at her script
The boys are dotted about the room; all are mid-work
( ) So Jolly Holiday's in
As you wish
Pamela is genuinely curious
(') Now, how in the world does Mister Disney propose to train penguins to dance
Are you serious
've heard about his implausibly leaved trees so  assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched
Can you train penguins
() No  don't think you can train an -- () They're animated
Pamela is confounded
Sorry
Dick
Cartoons
He draws a little squiggle in the air to illustrate his point
Dick
Pamela's face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her
(') Crap
What
Are we getting real penguins
-   - Pamela comes storming into the offices suite
Dolly smiles up from her desk
Good afternoon Mrs Travers
Where is Mister Disney
If you'd like to take a seat-- would not like to take a seat thank you
would like to-- She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running after her down the corridor
Mrs Travers, please
Pamela blows past Tommie's desk
'  - Pamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit cigarette in his pen hand
Walt, 'm so sorry
Don't worry Tommie, please close the door
Disney gestures to his cigarette
(') Never let anybody see me smoking
'd hate to encourage bad habits
Please, sit down
shall not sit in the seat of a trickster
fraudster
sneak
-- Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so
Penguins
Walt is confused
(') Penguins have very much upset me Mister Disney
Animated, dancing penguins
Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney, yes you have
Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head but  shall not be moved on the matter of cartoons
Not one inch sir
It's a sequence-- You promised me
You promised me that this film would not be an animation
And it isn't
So they're real penguins
No they're animated
( ) Oh
(to herself, smiling ) You foolish old woman
Pamela reaches into her purse and pulls out the assignment of rights papers and leaves them on the table
(') Good day Mister Disney
She turns on her heel and leaves
Disney stares at the pages aghast
Pam
Pamela
Mrs Travers
Wait
-   - Pamela flies past Dolly's desk
Please call my driver and have him pick me up
Yes ma'am, when
- Pamela flees to her bench, wrapping her arms around herself
Disney comes after her
Please Mrs Travers-- You must listen
You shouldn't make promises you can't keep, especially to children, they hold on to them you see
And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever
Pamela
don't understand why this is so hard for you
Please, make me -- The books weren't written for the children
They were written for the promise breakers
The promise breakers
Mrs Travers - But she's gone, face to the sky, eyes closed, breathing
(') Mrs Travers
Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car
Woah
Mister Disney
Hi
Hi
'm such a huge fan
It's such an honour to-- He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in herself than usual and his priority becomes her
(') ( ) Excuse me
Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder, she opens her eyes, relieved to see him
(') You ready to go Mrs
Yes
Thank you
-- ( ) 'm so sorry Mister Disney
To have put everyone to so much trouble
You must reconsider
You must
simply can't give her up
Not yet
Perhaps not ever
don't know You do know why
can't, he's-- He's
just-- Goodbye Mr Disney
She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it
The lady's ready to go now sir
Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car
He's
Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and confusion
He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky
- Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for Pamela
He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and opens the trunk of the car
It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs
No one likes a fibber
() really have enjoyed it
Didn't know who you were at first and then guess what
You found out
was telling my daughter all about my day and how  was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and-- -- -- (he leans into the ) And she makes me go to her bedroom and get this
(he pulls out a Mary ) Can't stop reading it
'm very slow mind you
Pamela smiles
Would you like me to sign it
() Would you
'd be honoured
Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write
(') Your daughters name
Jane
Really
Uh huh
Like the girl in the book
(reading as she writes) To Jane and her dearest father-- (she looks at him) 've just this instant realized don't know your name
Ralph
She shakes his hand
Pamela
Pamela
You're the only American  have ever liked, Ralph
Ralph is chuffed to bits
May  ask why
No
Now take this-- She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery with her notes on
() Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo-- () What is this
They all had difficulties
Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand
Ralph looks at her in awe
(') Look at the bottom
Walt Disney
Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior
Explains everything
Pamela turns to leave
Thank you Mrs
Pamela doesn't look back
-   - Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and broken Walt Disney appears in front of them
She's gone
Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt apologetically
Flight left 10 minutes ago
Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it
(expecting to read her ) -- () Goff
Who's Helen Goff
Her
That's her real name
Walt is confused
Yuh, didn't you know
She's all hoity toity
British this and British that and she's really an Aussie called Helen Goff
Stuck up-- Then who's Travers
Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug
(') (smiles to himself) 've been talking to the wrong person
- Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag
She ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house
- Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and emotional voices in the hall
She pokes her head into the hallway
There, huddled together, whispering are her mother, the doctor and Aunt Ellie
Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets
Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of her heart
Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo
There are flecks of blood on her dress
She is ashen, shattered
She comes down to Ginty's level
-- Ginty cannot react
Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor
Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the chair, drawn into its beady black eyes
want to see my father
No, you mustn't
want to see him
Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing, biting, screaming
Nothing will stop her seeing Travers
Let her go Margaret
Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's bedroom
'  - Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed
She stands there, it seems, for an eternity
Then, finally, step by step she draws closer
The empty bottle on the floor
The sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted with blood
The front of her father's nightdress is also bloodstained
Ginty's eyes reach his face
Travers lies, eyes open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither peaceful nor distressed
Just-- nothing
dropped the pears
She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand
(') 'm sorry daddy
Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without turning around
(') You promised you would fix everything
-  - black London Taxi pulls up outside the house
Pamela climbs out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out too
-  - Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase
Hello house
'   - Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in darkness
She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and a lifetime's despair
There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside
She gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will take her
She swings it open
Oh dear god
Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney
Pamela is, quite literally, speechless
It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you
But, you always get what you want eventually
Isn't that right Walter
He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking
How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of tea
'   - Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups
These he places on the table and proceeds to pour tea
Milk
The milk goes in first
He attends to it
remember
And whiskey
'll have whiskey in mine
Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter
She takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup
() Oh
() Oh well, when in Rome
He pours a slug into his tea too
You've come to change my mind
To beat me into submission
No, 've come because you misjudge me
How do  misjudge you
You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas
() (') You think 've built an empire and that  want to use your Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom
You think  see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks
And don't you
If that was all it was would  have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years
'd've have saved myself an ulcer
() No, you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure  did
You see,  think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers
think it's done that a lot
Maybe Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't
Mary Poppins isn't real
Oh, no, that's not true
She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children-- adults too
She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people
Well, Where is she when  need her
Hm
open the door to Mary Poppins and who should be standing there but Walt Disney
He laughs
Mrs Travers,  am so sorry
hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us
But  let you down-- and in doing so, 've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls
() 've been wracking my brains, trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and -- () You see,  have my own Mr Banks
Mine had a moustache
Ah
Not true then that Disney created man in his own image
But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes
She doesn't answer
Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little
(') Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers
Do you know Missouri at all
Can't say  do and as  have no plans to ever set foot on American soil again 'm afraid  never will
It's mighty cold there in the winters
Bitter
Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then gives in
His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela
(') (it pours out) My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there
Thousand papers
Twice daily
Morning and evening edition
Elias, he was a tough businessman
save- a-penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother Roy
was eight then-- eight years old
() Like  said, those winters were harsh and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so-- () Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow would be up to here-- He gestures to his knees
(') You'd push through it like wading through molasses
() (') And the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces-- and sometimes 'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz  must've passed out for a moment--  dunno
Then school, too cold to figure out an equation
And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth
My mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition
() Best be quick Walt, best be quick or poppa's gonna show you the buckle end again boy
Walt smiles at Pamela, sips his tea
(') Now,  don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers,  don't
love my life - it's a miracle
And  loved my daddy, boy  loved him
But, there isn't a day goes by where  don't think of that little boy in the snow and old Elias with his fist and strap and 'm just so tired-- 'm tired of remembering it that way
Aren't you tired Mrs Travers
We all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story
Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past
() It's not the children she comes to save
It's their father
() It's your father--
() Travers Goff
don't know what you think you know about me Walter-- You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name-- -- Mrs
Travers
It's all about him isn't it
All of this
Everything
Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking
(') Forgiveness
It's what  learned from your books
don't need to forgive my father
He was a wonderful man
No, you need to forgive Helen Goff
Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself
Pamela looks down at the table top
(') Give her to me, Mrs Travers
Trust me with your precious Mary Poppins
won't disappoint you
swear that every time a person goes into a movie house - from Leicester to St Louis, they will see George Banks being saved
They will love him and his kids, they will weep for his cares, and wring their hands when he loses his job
And when he flies that kite, oh
They will rejoice, they will sing
In every movie house, all over the world, in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come, George Banks will be honoured
George Banks will be redeemed
George Banks and all he stands for will be saved
Maybe not in life, but in imagination
Because that's what we storytellers do
We restore order with imagination
We instill hope again and again and again
Trust me, Mrs Travers
Let me prove it to you
give you my word
'  - Pamela is alone
The unsigned rights papers in front of her on the table
She looks at Mickey who occupies the chair opposite her, her face softens under his gaze
Enough
-    - Disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads: -
Walt exits the building
He's but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind him
Walt
She hands him a sheet of paper
(') Invitation list for the premiere
Is that everyone
Not everyone
She looks at Walt questioningly
() We'll premiere in London as well
It'll be more convenient for her
Tommie holds his look
(') There'll be cameras, press, interviews--  have to protect the picture
Okay
Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam
Tommy watches him go
'  -
Pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto
She pings the return and breathes, satisfied
should say so too
The doorbell sounds, voices
Pamela begins to tap again
(
) Mrs Travers
Pamela tuts, tries to carry on with her work
(
) (') Mrs Travers
Pamela rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt
For goodness sake
She rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt and makes her way to the front door
(') Please don't screech like an alleycat
'   - Pamela and Diarmuid sit together
Pamela is quite changed, she looks younger, radiant, worry free
am so pleased to hear that Mrs Travers
should think you'll have a draft very soon
( ) Polly
Where's that tea
( ) It's coming along marvelously
Polly kicks the door open with her foot and plonks the tea down in front of Pamela and Diarmuid
She sneezes twice, doesn't bother to pour and turns to leave
(') ( ) Would you pour please
You're perfectly capable of doing it yourself
Polly leaves, Pamela rolls her eyes
She's quite the worst maid 've ever had
So why do you keep her
don't know-- she reminds me of me
Diarmuid laughs
Do you have a title
Mary Poppins in the Kitchen
Wonderful
Should we start talking about the film rights
Pamela narrows her eyes at him
again
Okay
() Now, tell me, Have you got your tiara for the premiere
Oh, 'm not going
Why not
Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me
Anyway, it's not -- He hasn't invited you, has he
Pamela doesn't reply
(') Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for that
- Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin baggage into an overhead locker
The same flight attendant from the top of the film appears
Can  help you
'm perfectly capable thank you
The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to horror
Suit yourself-- ma'am
() shall
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome aboard this flight to Los Angeles
Just a few announcements before we begin our taxi for takeoff-- Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac
She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together
She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead
-   - Walt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own office
Morning Dolly
Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past and -- ' Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt
(') What
Tommie nods toward his office
Pamela is sitting in a chair, back to them
Me again
- Walt semi-recovers as quickly as possible and enters his office
Mrs Travers
How wonderful to see you
What brings you to-- 'm here for my premiere
Great
didn't receive my invitation, but just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual
She smiles sweetly
'll have a-- uh, replacement sent to your hotel right away
That's very kind, Mr Disney
knew you wouldn't have forgotten me
Pam, how could
How indeed
You did, after all, assure me that  wouldn't be disappointed
-    - The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother hovering for a tip
Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the chocolates, the champagne, a  invitation to the premiere of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins
And, of course, the ubiquitous stuffed Mickey Mouse
( ) thought  left you in London
-  - Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her shoulders
( ) Would you call me a taxi please
Absolutely
The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo pulls up to the kerb
Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person in America
Had a feeling a certain friend of mine might be needing me tonight
Ralph
She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug
You look like a million bucks
Let's get you to the ball
He opens the back door for her and she climbs in
'   -  - It's spectacular
Disney's biggest Hollywood opening
Bulbs flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red carpet
Ushers are dressed as English bobbies
Reporters stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their hearts out in front of the theater
Pearly Kings and Queens play for the onlookers
Crowds and crowds of fans scream every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and posters in the air
Every Disney character imaginable bounces up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing for them, signing their booklets
Hollywood Blvd is completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest party you could ever go to
- Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds
Onlookers press their faces against the windows trying to make out who is inside
Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone
'   -  - The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out
He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car
Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm up to shield her eyes
It's too much
(in her ear) This is your night
None of this would be possible without you
She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is that
" "Is that anyone
" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead
Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment
He holds out his gloved hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air
'   - Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her
'   -  - The auditorium is jam packed
Pamela is seated in front of Walt Disney
Don, the Shermans and their families are in the same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her
The lights begin to dim
The overture begins-- We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers old melody's rings in her ears
We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain with Pamela
She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing, humming, sad, happy, joyous
Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices of Bert and Jane - Ellie's parrot head umbrella-- You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father
The carousel horses at the Allora fair-- (') There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money
The tuppence and rolling pears-- (') don't like to see any living thing caged up
Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river soaked mother back to the house-- Father in a cage
Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand-- They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know
The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed-- (') Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all
: Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards
Rapt
You won't ever leave us will you
Whatever would we do without you
shall stay until the wind changes
And then an image from the film: George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined London street, on his way to be fired from the bank
Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction
Pamela however has tears coursing down her face
Her shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud but people are noticing, looking at her
Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder
She reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak
It's all right, Mrs Travers
It's alright
Mr Banks is going to be all right
promise
Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs
It's all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis
No, no
It's just that--  can't, can't abide cartoons
We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the film: Let's Go Fly  Kite
The audience around her are smiling, laughing, singing along
Pamela, the tears, silent now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics
And in her head one final image appears
Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window, sweeping
Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness
(
) Never
promise
will never lose you
: - The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her face
