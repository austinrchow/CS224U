href <b>// --> </b> Blood Simple " " By Joel Coen and Ethan Coen An opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas landscapes--broad, bare, and lifeless
- The world is full of complainers
But the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee
don't care if you're the Pope of Rome, President of the United States, or even Man of the Year--something can always go wrong
And go ahead, complain, tell your problems to your neighbor, ask for help--watch him fly
Now in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else-- that's the theory, anyway
But what know about is Texas
We are rushing down a rain-swept country road, listening to the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt
- And down here
you're on your own
We are looking at the backs of two people in the front seat-- a man, driving, and a woman next to him
Their conversation will be punctuated by the occasional glare of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing by
The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat
The conversation is halting, awkward
He gave me a little pearl-handled 38 for out first anniversary
Uh-huh
Figured 'd better leave before used it on him
don't know how you can stand him
Well, 'm only an employee,  ain't married to him
Yeah
Pause, as an oncoming car passes
Finally: don't know
Sometimes  think there's something wrong with him
Like maybe he's sick
Mentally
Or is it maybe me, do you think
Listen,  ain't a marriage counselor
don't know what goes on,  don't wanna know
But  like you
always liked you
Another car passes
What're you gonna do in Houston
'll figure something out
How come you offered to drive me in this mess
told you
like you
See,  never knew that
Well now you do
Hell
Another pause
Another car
Suddenly: Stop the car, Ray
Stamped on
Low three-quarters on the car as it squeals to a halt
car that has been following screeches to a halt just behind it
Both cars sit
Rain patters
Close on the man, from behind
He looks at the woman
Abby
She doesn't answer
He turns to look back and we see his face, for the first time, in the headlights of the car behind
The car behind them waiting, patiently
Rain drifts down past its headlights
Finally it pulls out and passes them slowly, their headlights showing it to be a battered green Volkswagon
First the car itself, then its red taillights, disappear into the rain
Cutting between him and the woman, each from behind
You know that car
No
What's the matter
don't know
just think maybe 'm making a mistake
She looks at the man
What was that back there
Back where
Sign
don't know
Motel
Abby-- Ray
Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman
Abby,  like you, but it's no point starting anything now
Yeah
mean,  ain't a marriage counselor-- Yeah
The man is uncomfortable
What do you want to do
The woman is uncomfortable
After a long pause: What do you want to do
Pulling back from  and  in bed, making love
The only light is from cars passing along the highway outside
Each sweeping light-by ends in black
The pullback ends in a wide shot of the motel room
The black following the last car lingers
telephone rings
Ray and Abby are asleep
On a nightstand next to the bed, the telephone is ringing
Ray stirs, reaches for the phone
Hello
Having a good time
What
Who is this
don't know, who's this
silence at both ends
You still there
Yeah, 'm still here
Ray listens to another silence
It ends with a disconnect
Abby is stirring as Ray gets out of bed
Ray
Yeah
What was that
Your husband
We are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has just been slapped down on the desktop
The picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the motel room
know a place you can get that framed
The voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie
We cut to him
He is settling himself into a chair facing the desk
He is , a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow leisure suit
He smiles at the man behind the desk
Sits staring down at the photograph
Behind him a window opens on the bar proper
Country-western music filters in from the bar
Marty is not pleased
What did you take these for
What do you mean
He removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette
Just doin' my job
You called me,  knew they were there, so what do  need these for
Well,  don't know
Call it a fringe benefit
How long did you watch her
Most of the night
He lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop
It is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out "Loren" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is "Elks Man of the Year
" They'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again
Quite something
Marty stares down at the photograph
You know in Greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news
smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen
Now that don't make much sense
No
It just made them feel better
Marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk
Visser laughs as he watches Marty
Well first off, Julian,  don't know what the story is in Greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that
Marty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope
Second place  ain't a messenger, 'm a private investigator
And third place--and most important--it ain't such bad news
mean you thought he was a colored
(he laughs) You're always assumin' the worst
Visser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at Marty
Anything else
Yeah, don't come by here any more
If  need you again  know which rock to turn over
Marty scales the pay envelope across the desk
It hits Visser in the chest and bounces to the floor
Visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat
Then he roars with laughter
That's good
"which rock to turn over"
that's very good
Sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope
He rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot
Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head
He pauses at the door, cocks his head, then turns back to the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter
Returning to the door: can crawl around without it
The door slams shut behind him
Marty scowls at the back door
After a moment he rises and crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar
Over Marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the window in perpendicular
The camera is tracking forward, past Marty, to frame on the window
black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, over onto the customer side
: ' Tracking back with him as he lands on the customer side and heads across the bar
This shot, from the other side of the back-office window, reveals the window to be one-way glass mirrored on this side , the black bartender, is muscular, about 200 pounds, dressed in white pants and a sleeveless -shirt
He is making his way through the crowd towards the jukebox
Another man stands in front of it examining the selections
He deposits a quarter
Hold it, hold it
What's tonight
What
What night is it
(studying Meurice) Friday
Right
Friday night is Yankee night
Where're you from
Lubbock
Meurice shakes his head and punches the selector buttons on the jukebox
Right
'm from Detroit (turning to leave) It's a big city up north with tall buildings
Motown song drops
We track behind Meurice as he makes his way back toward the bar
When he reaches it, he claps a couple of people on the shoulder, who make way for him
He vaults back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping a brandy
Where was
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire
Yeah, well,  may be getting in over my head here,  mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of
Enough to light Las Vegas for how long
How many years
Course, 'm no mathematician but-- Meurice
Marty is approaching from the direction of the office
Yeah,  know
Pour 'em short
Has Ray come in yet
No, he's off tonight
Where was he last night
(glaring) How would  know
don't know, didn't he call
Marty loses his glare and his gaze drifts over to the woman
After an awkward pause, Meurice clears his throat
Marty, 'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Debra
Debra, this is Julian Marty, the dude 'm always talking about
She is unselfconsciously returning Marty's stare
If he does come in 'm not here
What were you drinking, Debra
Remy
You've got a very sophisticated palate
Thanks
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual
Meurice walks down the bar
What's a palate
Marty studies her for a beat, she studies him, he smiles
Listen,  got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome
Ever sat on the fifty yard line
don't follow baseball
Marty laughs
You won't have to
'll explain what a palate is
You won't have to
just wanted to see if you knew
Marty smiles bleakly
Debra drains her glass as Meurice returns
He sets another Cognac in front of Debra, and a glass of milk in front of Marty
What's this
You said the usual-- Red Label
(picking up the milk) Right
Sorry
Pour that back
What
Don't throw that out
Right
He wanders on down the bar; Marty's attention returns to the woman
So how long have you know Meurice
About ten years
Marty's attention is caught by something down the bar
He half-rises from his stool
What--Waitaminute--What
Meurice is pouring the milk down the sink
He looks innocently up
What
Angry but not knowing what to say
He glances around the bar, sinks slowly back onto his stool
Deuce in the corner needs help
Right
Marty sits staring across the bar for a moment, nods a couple of times at nothing in particular, then looks back at the woman
So what're you doing tonight
Going out with Meurice
Marty tosses a beer nut into his mouth
Tell him you have a headache
Debra gives him a level stare
It'll pass
We don't seem to be communicating-- You want to hustle me
don't want to be hustled
It's as simple as that
Now that 've communicated, why don't you leave
own the place
Christ, 'm getting bored
'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years
They both fall silent as Meurice enters frame
He takes a bottle from the bar and pours himself a drink
What's this
What
(pointing at Meurice's drink) This
Jack Daniels
Don't worry, 'm paying for it
That's not the point
What's the point
The point is we don't serve niggers here
Where
(he looks over his shoulder; up and down the bar) 'm very careful about that
Marty tosses back Meurice's drink, then turns to Debra, smiling
He thinks 'm kidding
Everybody thinks 'm kidding; (as he turns to leave) if Ray comes in 'm not home
Debra watches him go, then turns back to Meurice
Nice guy
Not really
What'd you say your last name was
' We are following a large German shepherd as it pads down the hall toward a warmly lit room at its end
We hear only the sound of the dog's paws on the hardwood floor, and the faint clicking of billiard balls
It is a paneled, carpeted room with black leather furniture and a nine-foot billiard table
Various stuffed animal trophies are scattered around the room, including a moose head mounted on one wall
Ray stands alone in the foreground, shooting pool, an unlit cigarette in his mouth
The room is very quiet
In the background the German shepherd enters from the hallway, sits down in a corner, and benignly watches Ray
It is expensively appointed; a brightly lit woman's bedroom
Abby is opening a hinged drawer in a white antique bureau
She pulls out a leather handbag, gropes nervously through its contents, then puts it aside
She crosses the room to a vanity table, takes a purse from underneath, and spills its contents out on top of the table
Ray pockets a couple of balls, looks over at the dog, then up at the wall at the far end of the room
' Hanging on the wall are a couple of framed photographs of Marty and Abby, taken a long time ago
Staring at the pictures
He looks back down at the pool table
Abby is sitting on a large double bed
She puts aside another purse, rises and crosses the room hurriedly, and pushes back the sliding doors of a long wardrobe closet
The upper shelf is lined with handbags--fifteen or twenty of them
She grabs the first one, looks in, tosses it aside; grabs the second, looks--and stops
Inside the purse, a small pearl-handled gun
Ray is now standing in front of the pictures on the wall, looking from one to the next
' picture of Abby and Marty standing together on a Gulf beach
Marty is wearing a long velour beach robe, Abby is in a swimming suit
Ray's hand enters frame
He traces a finger down her leg
His head cocked to the side
After a moment his eyes shift
Of Marty's face
He is staring into the camera, at whoever took the picture
His head is thrown back slightly; he is laughing
From offscreen in the quiet room we hear a static hum and then Abby's voice over an intercom
' Ray
He turns from the photograph and walks to an intercom speaker next to the mounted moose's head
He presses the speaker button
Yeah
He idly takes his unlit cigarette and sticks it in the moose's mouth
You get what you wanted
' Yeah
Let's get out of here
' We are looking across a dark, high-ceilinged foyer toward the front door
Ray leans against the doorjamb, in silhouette in the open doorway
He is facing a curved staircase that descends into the foyer
Abby appears at the second-floor landing and starts down the stairs
Why d'you wanna leave all this
You kidding
don't wanna leave all this,  just wanna leave Marty
As she reaches the bottom of the stairs: Drive me to a motel
You can stay at my place, 'll drop you there
Where
where you going
See a guy
(nervously) Don't go to the bar, Ray
know him, that ain't a good idea
just gotta see a guy
' The crowd has thinned out
Meurice and Debra are in the foreground
Ray enters from the street and makes his way over to them
Howdy stranger
Meurice
Sorry  didn't show last night
Wasn't too busy
You missed a good one, though
This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics
tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and  can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea
He pours Debra another drink and starts to set one up for Ray
Ray, this is Debra
She's a geologist
That's the theory of rocks
Ray nods at Debra
Is Marty here
Not here tonight
Wasn't here last night
He's especially not back in his office
(leaving) Thanks Meurice
For what
' Marty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his back office to a graveled back parking lot; he is framed in the open doorway of his brightly lit office
He stares fixedly at something offscreen
' In the middle distance a huge incinerator operates full blast
Orange flames lick out the sides; white smoke billows out the top
Two figures in silhouette are chucking garbage in through a large gate
Behind him, in the office, we see the door from the bar open, and Ray entering
Marty
Marty looks over his shoulder, then back toward the furnace
Ray descends the stoop and stands in front of him
Well
What
Marty stares past Ray across the parking lot
What "what"
Am  fired
You wanna hit me
What
don't particularly want to talk to you
Well
if you're not gonna fire me might as well quit
Fine
Suit yourself
(still staring fixedly at the furnace) Having a good time
Ray tenses
There is a pause
don't like this kind of talk
Marty still stares at the furnace
Then what'd you come here for
(no more conciliation) You owe me for two weeks
Marty shakes his head
Nope
She's an expensive piece of ass
He finally looks up at Ray
You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing
want that money
If you wanna tell me something, fine-- What're you, a fucking marriage counselor
Ray breaks into a strained half-smile
Marty grins humorlessly back, mimicking Ray's smile
What're you smiling at--'m a funny guy, right, 'm an asshole
No, no, that's not what's funny
What's funny is her
What's funny is that  had you two followed because, if it isn't you, she's been sleeping with someone else
He grabs a knee in each hand and leans forward, still looking at Ray
He is becoming only slightly more animated
What's really going to be funny is when she gives you that innocent look and says, What're you talking about, Ray,  haven't done anything funny
He leans back again
But the funniest thing to me right now is that you think she came back here for you--*that's* what's funny
Ray moves forward and Marty's eyes follow him as he approaches
Marty's smile abruptly turns to a look of apprehension
Ray enters frame and brushes past Marty as he walks up the stoop, and crosses the back office toward the bar
Marty relaxes, and his gaze returns to the furnace
Come on this property again and 'll be forced to shoot you
Ray opens the door to the bar and shuts it softly behind him
Fair notice
' At the cut the music and all other bar noise drops out
We hear only the rhythmic whir of the fan
We tilt down from the ceiling fan to frame Marty, tilted back in his desk chair, staring up at the fan
(
) Marty
Meurice is standing in the door to the bar
Far behind him we can see Debra waiting in the dimly lit, deserted bar
thought you were dead
Going home
No
think 'll stay right here in hell
(turning to leave) Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty
Meurice
Meurice pauses in the doorway
don't want that asshole near my money
don't even want him in the bar
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty
Meurice and Debra can be heard leaving the bar
Marty looks down at the telephone in front of him on the desk, then picks up the receiver and dials
He tilts back in the chair and stares back up at the ceiling
' The ceiling fan, turning slowly
'    ' In the foreground Ray sits behind the wheel of his parked car, slumped back against the seat
He is staring at his one- story bungalow, in which a couple of lights are burning
Inside we can faintly hear his telephone ringing
It rings for a long time
' Abby's hand enters frame, hesitates, then after another ring picks up
Hello
The is no answer
From the other end we hear only the rhythmic whir of a ceiling fan
' Marty listens
He says nothing, still tilted back in his chair, staring at the ceiling
' Abby listens
She shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard to the sound of the fan
There is another long pause
Marty
The phone goes dead just as we hear the front door opening
Abby looks up as she cradles the phone
Ray is standing in the doorway
Who was it
What
On the phone
Was it for you
don't know, he didn't say anything
Uh-huh
So how do you know it was a he
(smiling) You got a girl--am  screwing something up by being here
Ray leans against the door and folds his arms, watching Abby
No, am
Abby looks at him, puzzled
After an uncomfortable pause: can find a place tomorrow, then 'll be outta your hair
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it
You, uh
you want the bed or the couch
Abby shifts uneasily, looking at Ray
Well
the couch would be all right
You can sleep on the bed if you want
Well
'm not gonna put you out of your bed
You wouldn't be putting me out
Well, 'd be okay in here-- Ray walks toward the bedroom
Okay
' Still tilted back in his chair, Marty stares glumly at the ceiling
The bar itself is completely still except the rhythmic whir of the fan
Turning slowly
We tilt down from the fan to frame Abby, lying under a sheet on Ray's couch, staring up at the fan in the darkened living room
The room is still
We hear only the whir of the fan and the distant sound of crickets
Abby turns her head, looking offscreen
ray of light slants up the hallway from the direction of the bedroom
The light is snapped off, leaving the hallway in darkness
We hear a faint cough and the creaking of bedsprings
' Ray lies in bed, staring at the ceiling
'   / Abby sits up
She stands and walks across the moonlit room toward the hallway
We pull her back down the hall toward the bedroom
She pauses in the bedroom doorway and looks down toward the bed
' Ray in bed, his eyes closed
We pull her as she enters the room, then tilt down with her as she hesitantly sits on the edge of the bed
' Close shot, Ray asleep
Framed against a moonlit window from the shoulders up
There is a long pause
Ray's hand enters frame and pulls Abby down out of frame onto the bed
We hold on the moonlit window
: - Through the window the slow dissolve gradually defines the front lawn and the street beyond in the flat pre-dawn light
Abby rises into frame and quietly gets out of bed
The camera tracks behind her as she walks up the hallway into the living room
We follow her across the living room and move into a close shot on her hand as she reaches into her purse and withdraws a small plastic compact
- She flips open the compact, then, hearing something, looks up, squinting across the room
' In the shadows at the far end of the room we can just see two pointed ears and a glittering pair of eyes
The German shepherd is panting softly
' As she peers into the shadows, her face reflected in the mirror of the open compact
Opal-- In the mirror something moves just behind her
Abby starts to turn
Marty's hand clamps over her mouth from behind
His other hand circles her waist
Abby struggles
(quietly) Lover-boy oughta lock his door
Marty's hand drops from her waist to her thighs and slides under the robe
Lotta nuts out there
Still holding her from behind, Marty forces her down on her knees
Abby's cries are muffled by the hand clamped over her mouth
Marty shoots a glance down the dark hallway
There is no movement
Abby's hand is groping forward out of frame
' She upsets it
The contents spill out, among them a small pearl-handled revolver
Her hand gropes for the gun
Marty yanks her to her feet, looking down the hallway
Let's do it outside
He is dragging her to the front door
in nature
He pushes her through the screen door
' The neighborhood is deserted and still
The streetlamps are still on
Marty and Abby stumble down the front stoop onto the lawn
His hand is still clamped over her mouth
She reaches up, grabs a finger, and bends it back
We hear the bone snap
Marty screams
His hand drops
His other hand cuffs her on the side of the head, spinning her around
Marty is now clutching his broken finger with his good hand
Abby kicks him in the groin
He sinks to his knees, drops forward on one hand, and vomits
Ray is coming out the door, hitching up his pants
In his right hand he hold Abby's pearl-handled revolver
Slowly gets to his feet, looking at Ray
She has backed away from Marty and now stands on the lawn, breathing heavily
She looks from Ray to Marty
Backing toward his car, a Cadillac parked at curbside, still looking at Ray
He turns to get into the car
The German shepherd lopes across the lawn and takes a clean leap into the car through the open window on the passenger side
Marty turns the ignition
The engine coughs and dies
He tries again; it starts
The car roars up the street
Watching the car
He looks at Abby
Still panting
Up the street we can hear Marty's car alternately racing and stopping, shifting in and out of gear
His engine rumble starts to grow louder again
Like to have seen his face when he found the dead end
In the background we see Marty's car roar by in the opposite direction
Moving past a row of cars parked on an overlook near the top of the mountain
Below we can see the lights of the city of Austin
The lot is littered with beer cans
We hear the sound of rock music coming from various car radios
Several teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars we can see the vague forms of others
Hey mister, how'd you break your pussyfinger
His friends laugh
Ignoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently looking for someone
His right index finger is taped up in an aluminum splint
' At the end of a row of cars we see a green Volkswagon bug
Leaning against the hood is Visser, still dressed in his rumpled yellow suit
He is smoking a cigarette, talking to a sixteen-year-old girl in shorts and a tube top
When he notices Marty: (to the girl) Sorry sweetheart, my date is here
The girl drifts off
Marty enters frame and Visser turns to him
She saw me rolling a cigarette and thought it was marijuana
(he laughs) guess she thought  was a swinger
Visser open the back door of the car
Marty ignores the invitation, walks around to the front on the passenger side and gets in
' As Visser gets into the driver's seat
small topless doll is suspended from the rearview mirror
Visser gives it a tap
As it swings back and forth two small lights, one behind each breast, blink on and off
Idnat wild
Both men sit watching the doll intently
Finally Marty reaches up and stops its swinging with the rounded end of his splint
Visser eyes the splint
(genially) Stick your finger up the wrong person's ass
Marty is silent, but Visser is in a good mood
You know a friend of mine broke his hand a while back
Put in a cast
Very next day he takes a fall, protects his bad hand, falls on his good one, breaks that too
So now he's got two busted flippers and say to him "Creighton,  hope your wife loves you
'Cause for the next five weeks you cannot wipe your own goddamn ass
" Overcome by laughter
Finally: That's the test, ain't it
Test of true love-- Got a job for you
(settling down) Well, if the pay's right and it's legal 'll do it
It's not strictly legal
Visser shrugs, lights up another cigarette with his fraternally inscribed lighter and drops the lighter onto the dashboard
If the pay's right 'll do it
It's, uh
it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife
The more think about it the more irritated get
Yeah
Well how irritated are you
Marty doesn't answer
Finally Visser laughs
Gee, 'm sorry to hear that
Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret
Listen, 'm not--this isn't a joke here
Visser eyes him, still smiling
Finally he shrugs
You want me to kill 'em
didn't say that
(a pause) Well
Well what
What do you think
You're an idiot
Marty's shoulders slump
He seems less tense, almost relieved
So, uh
this wouldn't interest you
didn't say that
All  said was you're an idiot
Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple
They are staring at each other
Ten thousand dollars 'll give you
Visser laughs again
'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid
mean real stupid
Now why should  trust you
For the money
(sobering) The money
Yeah
That's a right smart of money
He turns and gazes out the window
In Russia they make only fifty cents a day
He falls silent again, still staring out the window In the closeness of the car Marty is starting to sweat
(hoarsely) There's a big-- (abruptly) want you to go fishing
What
Go down to Corpus for a few days
Get yourself noticed
'll give you a call when it's done
You just find a way to cover that money
Marty is slumped in his seat, not responding to the fact that Visser has just ended the conversation
Finally he rouses himself and gets out of the car, leaving Visser staring at the door he has left open behind him
After a moment we hear Marty's footsteps approaching again, and he leans back into the open door with an afterthought
'll take care of the money, you just make sure those bodies aren't found
There's a
These words are difficult to say
If you want, there's a big incinerator behind my place
The two men look at each other
Marty leaves
After a moment, Visser leans over to grab the handle of the still open door
(under his breath) Sweet Jesus, you are disgusting
The door slams
The apartment is dark
We are looking across a shadowy floor towards a large window, through which cold blue street light shines
Through the window we can see the facade of the building across the street; we are three or four floors up
We can hear the animated, accented voice of an Hispanic woman approaching the apartment from the hallway behind us
(
) --big windows, paneleen and everytheen
So you want, like your own place
Like a Town House
crack of light shoots across the floor as we hear the apartment door open behind us
figure enters frame
As it crosses into the shaft of light we see that it is Abby
She moves across the dark apartment, in silhouette against the window
(
) No one will bother you here, sweetie-- An overhead light is switched on and the room is bathed in light
Several feet from Abby, an old man in a dirty undershirt is asleep on a cot
Abby starts
The old man grumbles, slowly sits up, squints
With the light, the window behind Abby has become a mirror of the entire room, in which we now see the matronly Landlady standing by the wall switch
The Landlady roars at the old man in Spanish
The man glowers at her
The Landlady looks back at Abby
(cheerful again) show you around
We follow Abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the short hallway-entrance foyer
Abby glances back at the old man
Are you sure this is
Are you sure this apartment is vacant
Mrs
Esteves
The Landlady laughs cheerfully
Oh yes
She gestures to a kitchen alcove on the left
That's the kitchen
She turns and throws a few more barbs in Spanish back toward the old man, then opens a door on the right side of the foyer and enters the bathroom
This is the bathroom
She flushes the toilet
The toilet works and everytheen
She bustles out of the bathroom and takes the two short steps back into the main room
She gestures expansively
And here we are back in the liveen room
She gives one vigorous stomp
Good floors
Gas heat
She points
That's Mr
Garcia
The old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking a cigarette, looking for a place to put the ash
The Landlady snaps at him again in Spanish, and is again cheerful as she turns back to address Abby
was just esplaineen to him that he moved out of here yesterday
She walks to the apartment door
You look around
Don't mind Mr
Garcia; he use do be my brother-in- law
She walks out and shuts the door
The room is quiet
Staring at the door
She looks at Mr
Garcia, looks nervously around the apartment
She looks back at Mr
Garcia
Staring vacantly at Abby
He blows a stream of smoke across the room
The ash falls off his cigarette
' Hunched over the public address microphone in his small cubicle of exhortation, is the middle-aged strip-bar barker
Years of service in the bar have left his exhortations depressingly bereft of conviction
How 'bout it, gentlemen, let's show out appreciation for Lorraine up there, a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas, how 'bout it gentlemen, yeah
Meurice is one of a line of men sitting at the bar, all looking intently at the same point off left
All of the men except Meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently well-to-do
An audio loop is blaring a bump-and-grind version of "Yellow Rose of Texas," punctuated by the crash of cymbals and the thumping of toms
Abby enters and sits into an empty chair next to Meurice
Looks like the state legislature is out of session
Meurice continues to stare intently off
thought this is where they met
All of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including Meurice's
couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks off the bar
In the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of the bar into frame
We crop her just above her white high- heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves
The conversation continues with Abby looking at Meurice, but Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point somewhere above the stripper's calves
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem
am
The stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in the foreground
The audience cheers
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens
It won't
Two sheriff-star pasties drop onto the bar
The audience cheers
Ever occur to you, Abby, that maybe 'm the wrong person to ask
Into his microphone
Let's not sit on our wallets, gentlemen
Lorraine is up there dancing her heart out, and if you let that cash money set on your hip, you might just as well be broke
She is rising to leave; he is still staring off
Thanks, Meurice
Any time
But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while
Marty went down to Corpus yesterday
An old-west gunbelt hits the bar
The audience roars
Into his microphone
And remember, gentlemen, we're always here, two to two,
to
, three hundred and sixty-four days and Christmas, God willing and the creek don't rise
' The room is dark
We are looking across the room toward a moonlit window
Beyond, across the lawn, the lamplit street is empty
Suddenly Abby sits bolt upright into frame from the bed below
He's in the house
Offscreen we hear Ray stirring in bed
What's the matter
Abby twists around to look down at him
could've sworn  heard something
Door's locked
Nothing there
He pulls her down out of frame and we hold on the window and the empty lamplit street
Then Abby rises back into frame, in silhouette against the window, looking down at Ray
knew it
'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him
He's real careful
Fact is, he's anal
Huh
Yeah, he told me once himself
He said to me
She taps herself on the forehead
"In here, Abby
In here
'm anal
" Looking up at Abby
(yawning) Well 'll be damned
couldn't believe it either
Framed against the window, looking down at Ray
Me on the other hand,  got lots of personality
She drops down onto the bed out of frame
The camera holds on the window through which we see the empty lamplit street
Marty always said  had too much
'Course he was never big on personality
She rises back up into frame, in silhouette against the window
He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some
Yeah
What happened
Psychiatrist said  was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him
(sleepily) don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly
Well,  didn't see him anymore, 'll tell you that much
His eyes half-closed
Uh-huh
said, Marty, how come you're anal and  gotta go to the psychiatrist
What'd he say
Framed against the window
Nothing
He's like you, he doesn't say much
(murmuring) Thanks
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty
Mm-hmm
When you don't they're usually nice
You ever get tired
Huh
Oh, yeah,  guess
Mm-hmm
Ray's hand rises into frame and coaxes Abby back down onto the bed, revealing, through the window, a green Volkswagon now parked at curbside on the lamplit street
We hear the rustle of sheets
As we hold on the window, we begin to hear the faint, distant sound of metal scraping against metal
/ We track down the dark hallway into the living room
As the camera advances the sound of the scraping becomes louder
We are moving across the living room up to the front door of the bungalow
The scraping is louder still as we finally frame on a close shot of the doorknob, which is jiggling ever so slightly
We hear a click as the lock finally releases
The door swings slowly open, revealing a man's hand on the outside doorknob
We follow the hand as the man advances slowly and quietly across the living room
Abby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to it is a large tote bag
The hand rummages through the tote bag briefly, then the purse
The man withdraws Abby's pearl- handled revolver
He breaks it open
-     ' It is Visser
As we hear a click offscreen, his face glows a dim orange
His right holds the revolver, cylinder open, inside the purse
His left holds his cigarette lighter as he inspects the chamber
Three of the holes glint silver, the other three are black--empty
We hear the faint creaking of bedsprings
Visser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway
He takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the bungalow
We follow him outside onto the lawn
' We track behind him as he rounds the corner of the house and approaches the open window to Ray's bedroom
He slows, moves more cautiously, then sinks to his knees under the window
As he reaches into his breast pocket the camera continues tracking up to and over him, finally framing his  through the window
On the bed inside we can dimly see Abby and Ray, asleep
We have been hearing a faint rumble, becoming louder and louder as if approaching from a distance
Just as the rumble becomes deafening a sudden bright flash of light illuminates the room, seeming to polarize the image of Abby and Ray in bed, and we: huge truck roars by on the street behind Visser, and with it the deafening rumble recedes
It is a painfully bright day
Visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the receiver pressed to his ear
We hear the phone ringing at the other end
Finally, it is picked up
Hello
Marty
Yeah
Is it
Ya catch any fish
What
Ya catch any fish
Yeah
What kind of fish
Listen, what is it
Is it done
Visser forces a chuckle
Yessir, you owe me some money
' Being plopped down onto Marty's desk
Visser sits facing the desk
He lights himself a cigarette and sets the lighter down on the desk in front of him
Marty settles, fidgeting, into the chair behind it
The bar is quiet, shut down
We hear only the whir of a fan somewhere offscreen
Marty and Visser are lit by a lamp on the desk between them
Light streams into the room from a bathroom in the background
Visser is looking at the dead fish
(dully) They look good
Marty half-rises from his seat and picks up one of the strings
Want a couple
He drops them on Visser's side of the desk
Visser's head draws back: he was only being polite
Just the ten thousand'll be fine
Got something to show me first
Visser hands a 9 x 12 envelope across the desk
Marty stares at it for a moment, then quickly bends back the flap and takes out an 8 x 10 photograph
It is a black-and-white shot of Abby and Ray in Ray's bed
The sheet that partially covers them is pocked with three dark bullet holes and is stained with blood
Staring dully down at the picture
Dead, huh
So it would seem
Visser is pushing the fish away from his side of the desk with the eraser end of a pencil
What did you
Still looking at the picture
He traces the outline of Abby's body with his finger
What did you do with the bodies
It's taken care of
The less you know about it the better
Jesus,  don't believe it
Marty slips the picture back into its 9 x 12 envelope
His face is pale
think 'm gonna be sick
He rises and heads for the bathroom, still clutching the envelope
As his eyes follow Marty's exit
The bathroom door doesn't close all the way; a narrow shaft of light slices the office from the bare bulb in the bathroom
'll want that picture back
He turns to look across the desk
' The standing safe behind the desk
Still looking at the safe
Beads of sweat have popped out on his forehead
He fans himself with his cowboy hat
and you did say somethin' about some money
We hear a toilet flush offscreen
' As he reenters the office
Your money, yeah
Visser stares dully down at the desktop
Something  got to ask you, Marty
've been very very careful
Have you been very very careful
Of course
Nobody knows you hired me
Marty is hunched over the open safe, still holding the envelope
Blocking Visser's view of the safe with his body, he slides the picture of Abby's and Ray's corpses from under the envelope into the safe, then withdraws two packets of money
Don't be absurd,  wasn't about to tell anyone
He shuts the safe and spins the dial
This is an illicit romance--we've got to trust each other to be discreet
He walks across the room and throws the money and the envelope down on the desk
For richer, for poorer
Visser looks from the money down at his hands
They are sweating
Don't say that
Your marriages don't work out so hot
He wipes his hands on his pants
How did you cover the money
Marty sits and props his booted feet up on the desk
It's taken care of
The less you know about it the better
He smiles
just made a call about that
It'll look fine
(shaking his head) must've gone money simple
This kind of murder
He nods toward the envelope on the desk
it's too damn risky
Then you shouldn't have done it
Can't have it both ways
He pushes the money across the desk with his boot
Count it if you want
(reaching into his coat) Nah,  trust ya
His hand comes out with a gun pointing at Marty and----he fires, an orange lick of flame spurting from the gun
Both men sit frozen
Visser's hand is the only thing that moved
Staring at Visser
After the gun blast we hear only the whir of the fan
Staring at Marty
' His eyes are now shut
Otherwise he hasn't moved
blood stain is growing on the front of his shirt
The two face each other across the desk
Visser's gun is still trained on Marty
After a moment Visser starts fanning himself again with his cowboy hat
The only movement in the frame is the slow back- and-forth of the yellow hat, rhythmically in and out of shadow as it catches and loses the light from the desk lamp
There is a long pause
Finally one of Marty's feet slips from the desk and hits the floor with a
Visser lays the gun on the desk
As he reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a handkerchief
He wipes his forehead, then picks up the gun and wipes it off
He leans down with the gun
As Visser places it deliberately on the floor near the desk
It is Abby's pearl-handled revolver
As Visser straightens up in the foreground
From our head-on angle shooting across the desk we can see the bright metallic glint of Visser's cigarette lighter underneath the dead fish
Visser's hands move over the near part of the desk, picking up the money and the 9 x 12 picture envelope
As Visser turns from the desk and walks across the room out of frame
We hear the back door opening
Who looks stupid now
The door slams shut
The only sound is the whir of the fan
pause
The camera tracks slowly forward, tilting down to keep Marty and the desktop centered in frame
As the camera moves the noise of the fan grows louder
When Marty's body and the desk are directly beneath us, the blades of the ceiling fan cut across the immediate foreground and effect a: : ' It is completely still
We are looking from the bar, across the dark empty floor, toward the pebbled windows at the front of the building that catch a hard blue light from the streetlamps outside
The jukebox in the middle distance glows in the darkness
pair of headlights catches the pebbled glass and grows brighter as we hear a car pull up to the bar and stop
We hear a car door open and shut, then the sound of feet on gravel
huge shadow appears on the pebbled glass as the figure crosses in front of the headlights
The man tries the door, finds it locked, and walks back in front of the headlights to cup his hands at a window
He walks back to the door, and a moment later it swings open--framing him in the doorway in silhouette
We follow him as he moves across the floor, behind the bar and up to the cash register
He switches on a small fluorescent light clamped to the top of the cash register
It is Ray
He punches a key and the register rings open
He lifts up the empty cash drawer and takes some papers from underneath it
' As he flips through the papers; bills, receipts, no money
As he finishes flipping through the papers
(muttering) Damn
He slips them back under the cash drawer and slams the register shut
Turning from the register he glances around the bar, the pauses, noticing something
' Light is spilling out from under the door to Marty's office
As he starts across the floor to Marty's office
Marty
He reaches the door and knocks sharply
No answer
He turns the knob
Marty
The door is locked
We hear the muffled whir of the ceiling fan inside
pause
Ray withdraws a ring of keys from his pocket and uses one on the door
The door swings open
Over his shoulder we see Marty, still at his desk, his back to us
On foot is still propped on the desk
What's the matter, you deaf
No answer
Ray stumbles toward Marty
He stumbles slightly and we hear the sharp blast of a gun and the sound of something metallic skating across the floor
Ray, startled, steadies himself against the desk, then studies Marty
' There is a dark pool of blood under Marty's chair
He looks back up at Marty, then walks behind his chair and throws a wall switch
The room is bathed in light
His eyes still on Marty, Ray crosses behind the desk
' The camera moves in a slow arc around the back of Marty's motionless head
Still moving
He looks away from Marty, scans the floor
He gets down on his hands and knees and peers under the safe
' There is a glinting silver circle in the darkness under the safe
It is the business end of the revolver that Ray half- stumbled over, half-kicked
Still on his hands and knees
He reaches in and we hear a rattle as he gropes under the safe
He withdraws the gun, looks at it
It is Abby's revolver
For a long moment he doesn't move
Then, slowly, he starts to get up
The desk, Marty behind it, Ray straightening behind him
Ray looks from the gun to Marty, slowly sets the gun down on the desk
pause
He begins to hoist Marty from the chair
There is noise from the bar, as of someone entering
Ray reacts
Separating the bar and back office
Ray hurries to it
(
) Marty
Footsteps approach the door
' He turns it gently
The bolt clicks shut
Meurice's footsteps draw nearer
(
) Marty, ya home
There is a rap at the door; Ray stands frozen
The doorknob rattles
Ray reaches out compulsively to grab it, but stops himself before actually touching it
Now Meurice's footsteps can be heard going casually back into the bar
We hold on Ray's rigidly set face
(
) What day is it today, Angie
(
) Tuesday
(
) Tuesday is ladies' night
(
) What
(
) Tuesday night is ladies' night
All your drinks are free
We hear a record drop on the jukebox and a Motown song blares
Ray crosses to Marty's chair and takes off his nylon windbreaker
He stoops down and tries to mop up the pool of blood with his windbreaker
This isn't going to work
He rises and walks over to the bathroom, the windbreaker dripping blood
' The song continues faintly in the background
The faucet is turned on and Ray's hand enters frame, holding a dirty white towel under the stream of water
- The song continues in the background
Ray's hand enters frame holding the balled-up towel
His windbreaker is wrapped inside
The camera follows as he pushes it across the trail of dripped blood to the pool of blood under Marty's chair
He still has not moved
Ray rises into frame and takes him under the armpits
He notices something on the desk in front of him
Ray's hand enters frame and picks it up
' Ray's hand enters frame and slips the gun into Marty's pocket
Marty is hoisted up
/ Ray appears in the doorway
The music from the bar, though fainter, can still be heard
There are three or four wooden steps going down from the back door to the small gravel parking lot in back
Ray backs down the stairs; Marty's feet -- down the stairs after him
The rear door of Ray's car is open
Ray heaves in Marty's torso
Marty's legs rest on the ground outside the car
Ray takes an ankle in each hand and pushes
As he shuts the door
He looks up across the parking lot
' The incinerator belching fire and smoke
We hear its distant roar over the bar song
We hear the car door slam
- We are looking down on Ray's car as the camera tracks behind it towards the incinerator
At the cut the roar of the incinerator is suddenly louder
It grows louder still as we approach it
Ray's car draws even with the incinerator without slowing or stopping
The wadded-up towel is chucked out of his window into the fire
We hold on the fire as Ray's car rolls on out of frame
' As he drives down a deserted country highway
We hear the rhythmic sound of the wheels clomping over asphalt
The radio is broadcasting a fundamentalist's sermon, periodically interrupted by static
Ray is sweating
--so there were three signs, the second of which is Famine, this famine which  have already pointed out is devastatin' Africa and the Indian subcontinent
And the third of these signs is earthquakes
Now  don't know why he threw that in but if you talk to a geologist, and 've talked to many, he'll tell you that earthquake activity-- Ray twists around and looks in the back seat
' Marty is lying inert
--has increased almost eighty percent in the past two years, and what's more, in two years' time we'll be experiencin' what's knows as the Jupiter Effect-- He looks back at the road
car roars by
--wherein all the planets of the known universe will be aligned up causin' an incredible buildup of destructive gravitational force
Now in Matthew Chapter Six, Verse Eighteen the Lord out and tells us that these are the signs by which we shall know that He is at our door
There are many good people disagree with me, but it's my belief that this Antichrist is alive today and livin' somewhere in Europe, in that ten- nation alliance  spoke of, bein' groomed for his task-- Ray switches off the radio
We hear the sound of faint, labored breathing
His jaw tightens
He whips his head toward the back seat
His head snaps forward again and he slams on the brakes
The car screeches to a halt
As Ray's door flies open
He is bolting from the car
The camera, at waist level, tracks toward him as he races out into the field that abuts the highway
Fifty yards in he finally stops, panting, framed from a low angle
His breath vaporizes in the crisp night air
We hear only his breath and the chirring of crickets
He is looking back toward the road
' Standing abandoned on the shoulder of the deserted highway
Its headlights cast a lonely beam up the road
No movement
His panting slows
He is in a cold sweat
After a long moment, he starts walking slowly, reluctantly, back toward the car
' Toward the car
Still no sign of movement
He slows as he draws up to the back of the car
He looks in the back window
' It is empty
The door on the highway side is ajar
No reaction
He walks around the back of the car onto the highway
He looks up the road
' Marty is crawling up the road on his hands and knees, leaving a trail of blood
The headlights of Ray's car give a fantastically long shadow
Still no reaction
He gets into the driver's seat and stares through the windshield as he gropes for the ignition key
' Marty, crawling
He throws the car into drive, looks at his target, thinks-- decides
He pulls the key out of the ignition and goes around to the trunk of the car
He opens it and pulls out a shovel
From in front
The headlights glare behind him
His breath vaporizes
In the background Ray is walking toward him, dragging the shovel, which scrapes along the asphalt
As Ray moves into the foreground and turns to face Marty only his lower legs and the shovel are in frame
The shovel rises out of frame
Both hands hold the shovel tensed over his shoulder
He stares down at Marty
long pause
We hear a distant rumble
' Inches away from Marty
Marty's hand slides forward and wraps around one of Ray's ankles
He shudders
He adjusts his grip on the shovel
The rumble grows louder
' He jerks his foot away, breaking Marty's grasp
Looks up from Marty
The rumble grows louder
' Headlight beams, although not yet the headlights themselves, are visible a long way down the road
Staring down the road
Finally he lowers the shovel, walks back to the car and throws it viciously into the trunk, walks back up into the foreground and stoops down
As Ray grabs him under the armpits and starts dragging him back to the car
Just before Ray heaves him into the back seat, Marty coughs weakly
fine spray of blood comes out with the cough
The engine rumble is quite loud now
As he slams the back door shut
He presses himself against the side of the car
Headlights glare over him; the truck roars by just behind him
' Sudden quiet at the cut
We are looking at Ray's car in profile, parked in the middle of a deserted field
From offscreen we hear the sound of a shovel biting into earth
We track laterally down the car, along the beam of its headlights, to finally frame Ray as he climbs out of the shallow grave he has just finished digging
He plants the shovel and walks back to the car
The grave in the middle background; the car's headlights beyond it
Ray is dragging Marty toward the grave
He dumps him in
As Marty thumps to the bottom, face up
As he bends over to pick up the shovel, dripping sweat
We hear the shovel biting into earth
Ray, in the foreground, pitches the first shovelful of earth onto Marty
Marty moves slightly
As he pauses, looking down into the grave
He stoops down and resumes shoveling, bobbing in and out of frame as he hurls dirt into the grave
As Ray shovels, Marty is moving under the loose dirt
faint, inarticulate noise comes from the grave
Almost imperceptibly, Marty's right arm starts to rise
Ray stands on the lip of the grave, hunched over his shovel, crisply illuminated by the headlights
In the shadowy foreground Marty's arm rises, extended toward Ray
He is clutching Abby's gun in his splint-fingered hand
As he straightens up and stands motionless, expressionless, watching Marty, making no attempt to get out of the way
The gun extended into the foreground
His index finger splinted, he slides his middle finger over the trigger of the gun
Watching
The gun trembling in the foreground
His knuckle whitens over the trigger
The trigger releases and we hear the dull click of an empty chamber
Staring blankly down at Marty
Of Marty's gun hand as Ray slowly sinks down on the lip of the grave, bracing himself with the shovel
His hand reaches for Marty's
Marty squeezes off two more empty chambers
Ray's hand slowly closes over the barrel of the gun
As he pulls, the gun slides from Marty's fingers
Biting into the earth
Furiously shoveling dirt into the grave
Marty barely visible under the dirt
Shoveling, panting
Half full
Working furiously
His breath comes in short gasps
It is filled
Ray is packing down the earth, slamming the shovel furiously against the bare patch of earth
Being slammed down against the earth
Again and again
The staccato beat of the shovel slamming against earth drops out at the cut
There is perfect quiet
The sun is just peeping over the horizon
In the foreground Ray is sitting in the open door of his car, smoking a cigarette
His gaze is fixed on a spot offscreen
house
Quite near by
The house and its perfect green rectangle of lawn are set incongruously in the middle of the open field
Staring, without emotion
He takes one last, fierce drag on the cigarette, then flicks it away
He takes the shovel, walks over to the grave and stares at it for several seconds, shovel clasped firmly in both hands
He walks back to the car
House, car and grave
Ray throws the shovel into the car, gets in, and turns the ignition
The engine coughs weakly and dies
He tries again
Same result
One more time
The engine coughs, sputters, and fires to life
The car runs over the grave and rattles on across the rutted field towards the highway in the distance
' As Ray drives down the straight empty highway in the flat early-morning light
Pale and unblinking
' In the distance we see a beat-up white station wagon approaching
It's headlights wink on, then off again
He squints at the approaching car
' The car is closer
It's headlights wink again
His jaw tightens
He stares intently at the car
Then, abruptly, he looks down at his dashboard
His headlights are on
Ray's hand enters frame and pushes in the knob
Watching the approaching station wagon
As it passes we catch a glimpse of its occupant
He grins and cocks a you-got-it finger at Ray before roaring out of frame
The station hasn't opened yet
Ray's car, empty, stands alone in the lot
Flat prairie stretches to the horizon
No movement in the frame
At the cut we hear the faint sound of a phone ringing through a receiver
After four or five rings the phone is picked up and we begin a slow crane down
(through phone; sleepily) Hello
(present; very hoarsely) Abby
you all right
Ray
What time is it
don't know
It's early
love you
beat
You all right
don't know
better get off now
The continuing crane down reveals Ray in a phone booth in the foreground
Okay, see ya
Thanks, Ray
Abby-- The phone disconnects
' Her sleeping head on a pillow
Offscreen we hear a door open and shut
moment later Ray's dirt-caked hand comes into frame and gently brushes a wisp of hair back for Abby's face
We hear Ray walk across the apartment and a moment later the sound of water running
Abby stirs
She looks offscreen
Standing in the doorway to the bathroom
He is wiping his hands on a towel
(sleepily) Ray
You're bad
Still half asleep, Abby smiles
What
said you're bad
There is a long pause
Finally: (smiling) You're bad too
Ray swings a chair out and sits down behind a table at the far end of the room
He leans back and props his legs up on the table
He is staring across the room at Abby
We're both bad
As we hear the click of a pull-string the camera is dropping: down past an orange safe light, down the length of the string, down to a metal darkroom tray where two short strips of negative are burning
Visser's hand and yellow sleeve cuff (now orange) enter frame, with an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph
The photograph is dropped into the tray
As it burns we see that it is the same picture of Abby's and Ray's "corpses" as Visser showed Marty, except that in this print the bullet holes and blood are less convincingly brushed in
Another print is dropped into the tray and ignites
In this one we see bullet holes but no blood
third print is dropped in and ignites
It is the original undoctored shot of Abby and Ray asleep in bed
Visser's hands enter frame holding the picture-envelope that he took away from Marty's office
Visser rips it in half and is about to drop it into the tray, but stops abruptly
There is posterboard, not a photograph, peeking out of the torn envelope
Visser's hands pull the two halves of the placard from the envelope and fit them together
The stenciled 8 x 10 placard says: "All Employees Must Wash Hands Before Resuming Work
" - Staring at the placard in disbelief
After a moment his hand rises into frame to deposit a cigarette in his mouth
His hand drops back down, groping in a pocket
His hand jumps back into frame, empty; he thumps at his breast pockets; he can't find his lighter
He wheels and exits frame
The light snaps off
door slams shut
' He has dozed off in his chair
Offscreen we hear a door slam, and his eyes open
Emerging from the bathroom
Her voice has a flat echo in the bare apartment
Why didn't you get into bed
(groggy) didn't think  could sleep
'm surprised you could
Are you all right
Yeah
She walks over and sits down on the bed
You called me this morning
Yeah
Abby looks at him, expecting more
Finally: just wanted to let you know that everything was all right took care of everything
Now all we have to do is keep our heads
What do you mean
Ray finally looks directly at her
know about it, Abby
went to the bar last night
Abby is looking at him in alarm
What happened
--Was Meurice there
Yeah
He laughs shortly
He didn't see me, though
Nobody saw me
The chair grates back as he stands up and looks vaguely around the room
Is it cold in here
Abby is looking at him nervously
Well
what happened
cleaned it all up, but that ain't important
He starts nervously pacing around the room, looking for something
What's important is what we do now;  mean we can't go around half- cocked
What we need is some time to think about this, figure it out
He moves a packing crate aside, still hunting around the apartment
Anyway, we got some time now
But we gotta be smart
Ray-- Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him
And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead
Ray's pacing is more agitated as he looks distractedly around the apartment
because if he's not dead he's gonna get up and try and kill you
He pauses, seemingly at a total loss
That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker
What the hell happened, Ray
Ray is walking to the window
Sunlight streams in around him
That ain't important
What's important is that we did it
That's the only thing that matters
We both did it for each other
He stoops down to look through a pile of clothes by the window
That's what's important
don't know what you're talking about
Ray's head snaps around
Staring at her he slowly rises to his feet and then remains still
mean what're you talking about, Ray
haven't done anything funny
What was that
Abby, startled, can't contain her agitation anymore
(rapidly) Ray,  mean you ain't even acting like yourself
First you call me at five in the
saying all kinds of nice things over the telephone and then you come charging in here scaring me half to death without even telling me what it is 'm supposed to be scared of
gotta tell you it's extremely rattling
We track toward him, isolating him against the window
He is perfectly still
For a long time he can't speak
(quietly) Don't lie to me, Abby-- Still worked up
How can  be lying if  don't even know-- The ring of the telephone cuts her off
She looks at the phone, pauses for a moment, then continues, struggling
mean if you and him had a fight or something,  don't care, as long as you
Her voice trails off
The telephone won't stop ringing
Abby and Ray are staring at each other, seemingly oblivious to it
Finally: Pick it up
Still ringing
Abby's hand enters frame and picks it up
What
Through the phone we hear only the rhythmic whir of a ceiling fan
Abby shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard
It is the same sound we heard earlier when she picked up the phone at Ray's house
As before, the line clicks dead
(looking at Ray) Welp, that was him
There is a long moment of silence
Then Ray's voice comes from across the room: Who
Marty
There is silence again
Ray shifts in front of the window
He laughs humorlessly
The laugh stops abruptly
What's going on with you two
(quietly) All right
He starts across the room
You can call him back, whoever it was
He is heading for the door
'll get out of your way
He pauses at the foyer and pulls Abby's gun out of his pocket
He sets it on a shelf by the door
Watching
We hear the door open
(
) You left your weapon behind
We hear the door slam shut
We hear the rhythmic whir of the fan
We tilt down from the ceiling to reveal that we are in the living room of Ray's bungalow
In the foreground Visser sits in a chair with the cradled telephone in his lap, facing the front door, which stands open in the background
The contents of Abby's tote bag lie strewn on the bureau next to Visser
Her purse is not there
After a moment Visser rouses himself and starts to sweep the articles back into the tote bag
' It is dark, lit only by the morning light leaking in around the drawn blinds
It is a small modern apartment such as one sees in large apartment complexes--shag carpeting, built-in bar
In the extreme foreground the small red "Power" light of a telephone answering machine glows in the darkness
The front door opens in the background, spilling bright sunlight
Meurice stoops down, picks up two newspapers, enters, and shuts the door
He walks toward the camera and his hand enters frame in extreme foreground to punch the rewind button on the machine
His hand leaves frame
few pieces of mail are flipped down onto the machine table, piece by piece, as the machine rewinds
He reaches down again and hits playback
After a beep: ' Hi Meurice, this is Helene, Helene Trend, and 'm calling 'cause  wanna know just what the hell that remark you made about Sylvia's supposed to mean
Mail continues to flip down onto the table, piece by piece
' She says you're full of shit and frankly  believe her
And hey, love you too
Sure
Anyway, you better call me soon because 'm going to South America tonight--you know, Uruguay
Dial tone
Beep
' (barking) Listen asshole, you know who this is
just got back from Corpus and there's a lot of money missing from the safe
The mail stops dropping; Marty has Meurice's attention
' 'm not saying you took it but the place was your responsibility and  told you to keep an eye on your asshole friend
Don't--uh, don't come to the bar tonight, 've got a meeting
But tomorrow  want to have a word with you, and with Ray--if you can find him
Dial tone
Beep
Meurice's hand drops into frame
' Meurice, where the hell have you been
-- His finger presses the stop button
: ' Pressing into a dark stain in the upholstery of the back seat of his car
When he raises it the fingertip is red--the seat still wet with blood
Looking down at the seat
He backs out of the car and walks up the driveway to his house
' As he comes through the screen door
It bangs shut behind him
As he crosses the living room we see, and he hears, Meurice's Trans Am pulling up and stopping at the foot of the lawn
Ray turns and looks out the window
Ray throws it open and hurriedly pulls out the first thing at hand--a sheet
We hear the door of the Trans Am open and slam shut
' Exiting the house as the screen door bangs and shudders behind him
He hurries down the walk
' Meurice is rounding the bottom of the lawn and starting up the drive toward the incriminating car
Its back door is standing ajar
hope you're planning on leaving town
Reacting to the line as he reaches the car
He bends over to throw the sheet over the seat just as Meurice walks up behind him
(his back to Meurice; arranging the sheet) Got a problem, Meurice
No, you do, cowboy
You been to the bar
Ray is still hunched in the open doorway
He freezes momentarily in arranging the sheet
Why
You shouldn't have taken the money
Ray doesn't reply or turn around
Meurice is getting more strident
Look at me man, 'm serious
You broke in the bar and ripped off the safe
Ray backs out of the car and turns around
Abby warned me you were gonna make trouble
Trouble with you is, you're too fucking obvious; the only ones with the combination are me and you
Ray looks evenly at Meurice
Behind him the sheet has been arranged over the seat
He puts an unlit cigarette in his mouth
and Abby
Maybe
But as far as 'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility
(tonelessly) What's that
Meurice reaches out and swipes the unlit cigarette out of Ray's mouth
Those things are nothing but coffin nails
He turns and stares down the street, exasperated
Look
Personally  don't give a shit
know Marty's a hard-on but you gotta do something
don't know; give the money back, say you're sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or something
Mow that his temper is gone, he realizes he has nothing much to say
He shakes his head and turns back down the drive, muttering as he lights himself Ray's cigarette
It's very humiliating, preaching about this shit
Standing in front of the back door of his car, watching Meurice walk away
His right hand rises into frame to deposit another unlit cigarette in his mouth
Offscreen, Meurice calls from the end of the drive: 'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, so you know it's no fucking joke
We hear his car door slam
After a moment Ray exits frame, heading for the house
The camera tracks slowly in to the back window of the car
Traces of blood are starting to seep up from the upholstery into the sheet
' We are looking across the tiled floor toward the front doorway
The room has the dim gray cast of daytime inside a shuttered house
We hold on the empty foyer as we hear an intermittent high whining sound
We hear the padding of feet on carpet, and then the clatter of nails on tile as Opal, Marty's German shepherd, trots into frame and circles the foyer, still whining
She jumps up and scratches desperately at the front door
slow, rhythmic pounding is very faint on the track
' Abby has just gotten out of her car and is walking up to the front of the darkened bar
The faint, rhythmic thumping continues over the cut, its source somewhere offscreen
As Abby takes a key out of her purse and lets herself into the bar, the thumping stops
' Abby switches on the lights, looks around, goes to the back- office door
Locked
As she fits her key into the lock: (quietly) Marty
The door swings open, fanning a shaft of light onto the darkened room
' We are looking from the inside at the bathroom door that won't close all the way
As the light fans into the office beyond and seeps in through the crack of the bathroom door, we see Visser's sleeve cuff and his hand pressing against the door, to hold it near-shut
Standing in the office doorway
We pull her into the room
She stops abruptly, looking past the camera, and wrinkles her nose
' Marty's fish, now half-decayed, still lie on the desk
Some of the desk drawers stand open, with some of their contents strewn across the surface of the desk
She takes a step forward
We hear the crunch of glass underfoot
She looks down at the floor
' Shards of broken glass lie on the floor
She looks up from the floor toward the back door
' The pane of the back-door window closest to the knob has been shattered from the outside, scattering broken glass into the office
She crosses slowly to the desk, staring at the rotted fish
She looks up from the desk
' On the standing safe behind the desk lies a white towel
Abby's hand enters frame ans picks up the towel
In slow motion a hammer that's been wrapped inside slips out of the towel, falls end-over-end, hits the floor with a dull thud
Stooping down to pick up the hammer
At eye level as she stoops down is the combination dial to the safe
The dial has been battered by the hammer
Abby looks from the hammer to the floor under the desk chair
' Blood stains
Staring down at the floor
She rises and looks at the desk
As she rises we hear glass under her feet
' The dead fish
Beyond them, on the floor around the desk, broken glass
Staring
' The dead fish
She seems to be falling slowly backwards
The camera falls with her, keeping her in close shot
Her head hits a pillow
We pull back slowly to reveal that she is lying on the bed in her apartment, staring across the room
She lies motionless on the bad, her eyes wide
' Across the darkened apartment we see the curtainless windows, and beyond them, across the lamplit street, the facade of the opposite building
Lying still
After a moment she gets out of bed, crosses to the front door of the apartment, locks it, then walks unsteadily back to the bed
: She opens her eyes, lies still for a moment, coughs
She gets out of bed and walks across the still dark apartment to the bathroom
She shuts the bathroom door
Abby looks at herself in the mirror above the sink, then turns on the tap water
From a neighboring apartment we hear a dull rhythmic thumping on the wall
She pauses, listens for a moment, then starts to splash water on her face
From somewhere offscreen we hear the sharp sound of glass shattering
It reverberates for a moment, then dies
Abby looks up at the bathroom door
We hear a scraping at the lock of her apartment door
Abby listens
Suddenly we hear the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges
Startled
She shuts off the water and stands motionless
Droplets of water are streaming down her face
We hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, crunching across broken glass
Ray
There is no answer
After a moment we hear bedsprings creak in the next room
Abby opens the bathroom door and walks out
shaft of light slices across the floor from the open bathroom door
Broken glass glints on the floor
In the semi- darkness we can see that someone is sitting on the bed
The person looks up
It is Marty
Abby recoils
Lover-boy oughta lock his door
Abby looks nervously at Marty
Droplets of water are still running down her face
She brushes one from her eye
love you
He smiles thinly
That's a stupid thing to say, right
Abby takes a step back
love you too
Still smiling, Marty shakes his head
No
You're just saying that because you're scared
He stands
We hear glass under his feet
He unbuttons the middle button of his coat and reaches inside
You left your weapon behind
He withdraws something from an inside pocket and tosses it to her
' As she catches the object
It is her compact
She looks from her hands up to Marty
He'll kill you too
Marty gags, leans forward, doubles over to vomit--blood
The blood washes over the floor at his feet
Bolts upright in bead with a muffled groan
Sweat pours down her face
She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye and looks around
' Moonlight glints through the windows across the hardwood floor
Through the windows we can see the facade of the opposite building
The apartment is dark and still, just as we left it before she fell asleep
She slumps back onto the bed
One hand gropes down out of frame and comes up holding an illuminated alarm clock
She looks at it, drops it back to the floor
She turns on her side and stares across the room toward the window
' The window
: - It is still not quite light
The few lights that shined in the windows of the opposite building before are now off; the facade of the building is a flat, undetailed gray
Still lying on her side on the bed, her eyes open, staring at the window
After a moment Abby enters frame
She picks her coat off a chair and puts it on
We hear a car door slam
'   - Abby has just gotten out of her car in the foreground and is crossing the lawn to the house
Down the road the street lights are still on
One light burns in the house, in the window of Ray's bedroom
Abby approaches it
Over Abby's shoulder, as she leans against the sill of the open window and looks inside
Ray sits on the bed in the empty room, smoking a cigarette, his profile to the window, gazing fixedly at the wall
Ray
Ray starts and looks toward the window, squinting
' Abby is coming through the screen door
The room is strikingly bare of everything except furniture
All personal effects have been removed
Abby looks around, bewildered, as Ray enters from the hallway
Where is everything
In the trunk
Abby, still standing in front of the door, looks at him uncomprehendingly
Ray walks over to a couple of cardboard boxes stacked in the corner
In the car
He ties a knot around the top carton with a piece of cord, then cuts the cord with a collapsible fishing knife
You leaving
Isn't that what you want
She slowly shakes her head
Wanna come with me
He leans back against the boxes, watching her
But first  gotta know what happened
What do you want to know
You broke into the bar
You wanted to get your money
You and Marty had a fight
Something happened
Ray shakes his head, smiling
Abby squints at him, looking for help
don't know, wasn't it you
Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found-- With your gun
He puts the knife in his pocket and walks over to the door
As he approaches her: Nobody broke in, Abby
'll tell you the truth
Ray faces Abby in front of the door
Truth is, 've felt sick the last couple of days
Can't eat
Can't sleep
When  try to
Abby
It's difficult to bring out
Ray's hand gropes for the cross- slat on the screen door
Finally: The truth is
he was alive when buried him
Abby stares
An object materializes in the sky beyond them
It is flipping end-over-end in slow motion, moving toward Abby and Ray and the screen door
Abby and Ray, each staring at the other, fail to notice until-- --it bounces off the screen
Abby starts; Ray doesn't
The spell is broken, Abby pushes hesitantly at the screen door
Ray's hand slides off the cross-slat; he makes no move to stop her
As Abby steps over the rolled-up newspaper that hit the screen door
Hurrying down the driveway to get to her car
low rumble is building on the soundtrack
Abby glances at Ray's car as she passes it
' More blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering the back seat
The bass rumble grows louder, punctuated by a rhythmic thumping
' ' As she pounds frantically on the door--the sound continuing over the cut
After a moment the door edges open
Meurice is standing in the doorway in a long bathrobe sleeper's blindfold is pushed up over his forehead
Abby
What's the matter
'm sorry, Meurice
gotta talk to you
Can  come in
He looks at her hard
Yeah
yeah, come in
He steps aside to let her pass
but  gotta tell ya
' As Abby enters
'm retired
Meurice switches on a table lamp; the curtains are drawn against the sun
Abby follows Meurice over to the bar
Jesus,  got a hangover
Want a drink
No, -- Well  do
He pours himself a drink
For you  answer the door
If you wanna stay here, that's fine
But 'm retired
Something happened with Marty and Ray-- (sharply) Abby
He glares at her
Let me ask you one question
He slams back the drink
Why do you think 'm retired
He grimaces
Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty
Until both of 'em calm down 'm not getting involved
No Meurice, it's worse than that
Something really happened,  think Marty's dead-- What
Did Ray tell you that
Sort of
Meurice sits her down on the sofa
That's total bullshit
Marty called me after he was jacked up
He tries to coax her into lying down
mean,  don't know where he is, but he ain't dead
Meurice-- You don't look too good
You sleep last night
Her head meets an end cushion
Meurice, you gotta help me
Meurice rises from the sofa, sighs
All right
Just sit tight
Try to get some sleep
He leans down to the table next to the sofa
'll find Marty, find out what's going on
Her head on the cushion
We hear engine rumble
Abby twists her head back, following Meurice
As we hear the table lamp being switched off we: : The engine rumble continues over the cut
There is no other traffic on the highway
light fog covers the road
green highway sign says: "San Antonio 73 mi
" We hear a car radio playing softly
Driving
He is gently lit by the light from the dashboard
He reaches forward to turn off the radio
The only sound now is the hum of the engine and the rhythmic clomping of tires on pavement
The look and sound of the scene are close to those of the first scene of the movie
Ray takes a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth, but leaves it unlit
' The headlights of an approaching car materialize in the fog
The car passes with a roar
Up ahead a traffic light is turning amber
The engine hum drops as he slows
We hear the low engine rumble and the squeaking brakes of another car
Ray is now stopped in front of the deserted intersection
He looks up in his rearview mirror
' Another car is stopped just behind him, the fog floating up past its headlights
The headlights halate in the fog; none of the rest of the car is visible
The unlit cigarette still in his mouth
He looks down from the rearview mirror to the intersection ahead of him
There is a long pause, during which we hear only the steady purr of Ray's car and the knocking rumble of the car behind him
Ray looks up at the traffic light
' The light is just turning from red to green
' He takes his foot off the brake, hesitates for a moment, the replaces it on the brake
He looks up in his rearview mirror
' The headlights of the other car remain motionless behind him
The car makes no move to pass
He slowly takes the cigarette from his mouth and drops it onto the seat next to him
His eyes shift from the rearview mirror to the traffic light
' Green fog floats past the green light
His face frozen
He turns slowly to look behind
' The other car is still motionless
We hear the muted rumble of its engine
His eyes shift back to the mirror
He gropes for his window handle and slowly rolls it down
He sticks out his left arm, eyes still on the rearview mirror, and waves for the other car to go around him
' The other car remains still for a moment
White fog floats up beyond the red fog created by Ray's brake lights
Finally the car pulls out slowly to the left to pass
Watching the car pass
' As the car pulls out into the light from the intersection and Ray's headlights, we see that it is a battered green Volkswagon
First the car itself, and then its red tail lights, disappear into the fog
Watching, for a long moment
Finally he takes his foot off the brake, turns the steering wheel hard left and hangs a -turn
' light is switched on in the expensively appointed room
Meurice enters, walking silently on the carpet, looking around the room
He throws the light off at the far end and leaves
' The door swings open
Meurice throws the switch near the door and the room is bathed in light
We are once again in the bedroom where we earlier saw Abby looking through her purses
We start to hear the faint buzzing of a fly
Meurice glances around, throws off the light, and shuts the door
Black
' Somewhere offscreen a light is switched on and we are looking in close shot at the dead fish
The sound of the fly is louder with the cut
Standing in the doorway from the bar, staring down at the fish
Ray glances around at the broken glass lying on the floor
His gaze shifts to the safe and the hammer in front of it
He walks over to the safe and stoops down
He works its battered dial and it swings open
He shuffles through the contents and brings out a small pile of photographs
' As he flips through the photographs
The first four are Ray and Abby in the motel room bed
The last is a mounted 8 x 10: Abby and Marty on a Gulf beach
Looking
Marty is still laughing
He scowls at the shots Visser took, then puts them back in the safe
When his hand comes out he is holding another photograph--this one folded twice
He unfolds it
' His and Abby's corpses
As he straightens slowly from the safe in the background
At desk level, we again see the glint of Visser's lighter under the dead fish
Ray crosses slowly around the desk into the foreground and lays the picture flat on the desktop
For a moment he stares down at it, then wheels abruptly and leaves frame
' Driving
He glances up in the rearview mirror
' As Meurice enters and throws an overhead light
The white room is bathed in bright, shadowless light
As Meurice steps into the kitchen his foot strikes something on the floor below frame, which clatters hollowly away
- The empty bowl skids into a wall, bounces back, and wobbles, spinning on its bottom rim
' - On a low skewed axis the camera is tracking in toward the impassive trophy head on Marty's billiard-room wall
The moose still has Ray's cigarette protruding from its mouth
As he walks toward the moose, head cocked to one side, frowning quizzically up
He hears something, and looks through the door to his left
' The long shadowy hall
We hear panting
Squinting
Opal
form starts to materialize in the shadows
Taking a step back
The dog bounding down the hallway
Its panting has become a low growl
He wrenches a cue stick from the rack and squares
Opal snarling, leaping
' The splintered top half of the pool cue is slammed down to rest on top of the coffee table
(
) Even the fucking dog's gone crazy
Sitting on the sofa, looking down out of frame
Behind her Meurice agitatedly paces back and forth, waving the splintered bottom half of the cue stick
His voice is unnaturally loud
Something pretty fucking weird is going on
Put your coat on and 'll drop you at home
But don't talk to either of 'em until  do
And don't worry
Believe me
These things always have a logical explanation
Usually
' The splintered top half of the cue stick on the coffee table
' Abby approaches her door in the foreground and lets herself in
' Looking toward the window
The room is dark
Through the window we see the facade of the building across the street
Abby enters frame in the foreground, in silhouette against the window, and throws an overhead light switch
The bright light reveals Ray standing by the window, looking out
(abruptly) Turn it off
Abby jumps, startled
Ray
From the roof of the building across the street we are looking down on the facade of Abby's building
Most of its windows are dark, but in a brightly lit fourth-floor window we can clearly see Abby and Ray
man is on the roof in the foreground, hitching a rifle to his shoulder
' Ray turns from the window which, with the switching on of the overhead light, has become a mirror of the interior of the apartment
Just turn it off
The light goes out in the apartment across the street; its window goes opaque
' Dark now
Ray still stands by the window, looking out
Abby still stands by the light switch
(answering a question) No curtains on the windows
Abby is clearly apprehensive--about Ray, not about anything outside
So
think someone's watching
Abby doesn't understand, and has had enough
As she throws the light back on: So what'll they see
Ray turns angrily from the window
Just leave it off
He can see in
Ray and Abby are once again clearly visible
Ray is starting across the room
' Abby takes a fearful step back as Ray strides toward the light switch, next to her
(abruptly) --If you do anything the neighbors'll hear
This brings Ray up short
He stares at Abby
It registers that it is him she's afraid of
You think
He shakes his head
Abby
meant it
when called
Abby takes another step back
Her voice comes out, after a pause, half-strangled: love you too
Ray winces
He slowly shakes his head with a pained half- smile
Because you're scared
We hear the dull report of a rifle and the deafening sound of shattering glass
The gun shot hits Ray in the back, knocking him to the floor
He lies still
She stares dumbly down at Ray
She looks slowly up to the window
It has a gaping black hole
The sound of shattering glass still reverberates in the apartment
Small shards of glass chink down from the window and shatter on the floor
Staring at the window, paralyzed--almost in a trance
Quiet except for the chinking of glass
We are looking through the telescopic sight of a high-powered rifle
The rifle sweeps up from Ray's body across the brightly lit room, and centers Abby, still staring at the window, in the cross hairs
' We are looking past Abby toward the shattered window at the far end of the room
brass lamp stands in the foreground, between Abby and the camera
Abby still stands paralyzed
Glass has stopped chinking from the window to the floor; there is a painful silence
Suddenly Abby dives to the floor just as  the rest of the window falls away and  the brass lamp somersaults toward us from the impact of the bullet
The window is now completely gone--just a black hole in the brightly lit wall
Scrambles into a corner at the window end of the room
The only sound is her heavy breathing
She looks over at Ray, then up at the bulb on the ceiling
' Breathing heavily, almost hysterical
She looks down at the floor
' Ray is sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood and broken glass
She reaches down and pulls off one of her shoes
She throws it at the ceiling bulb
We hear the bulb shatter and the room goes black
Abby rises and makes her way cautiously across the glass- littered floor toward Ray
She stoops over him
Its front door in background
Abby rises into frame and backs toward the doorway, staring down at the floor
One of her hands is covered with blood
Ray-- She winces and almost loses her balance as we hear a piece of glass crunching under her bare floor
She turns and moves to the front door, favoring one foot, and throws the door open
Abby lurches from her apartment and pounds on the neighboring door
No answer
She pounds on the door across the hall
' (frightened, in Spanish) Get away
'll call my son-in-law
(groping for the words, in Spanish) No no--you don't understand-- ' (in Spanish) He has a gun
Abby heads for the stairway at the far end of the hall
The heel of her shod foot is throwing her weight onto her bad foot; she kicks off the shoe
As she reaches the top of the stairs
She takes one step down, then brings herself up short
She looks over the railing down the stairwell
It is quiet
An innocent-sounding cough echoes somewhere in the building
We hear the sound of footsteps from somewhere below
Abby turns and hobbles back to her apartment
The bareness of the hallway sets off her abandoned shoe
' As she enters and slams the door behind her
She scrabbles at the lock, finally manages to get it shut, then turns and looks frantically around
' Ray is lying still in the darkness
We can hear footsteps approaching up the hallway
Abby enters frame and kneels down next to Ray
She fumbles around him briefly in the darkness
The doorknob rattles
Abby freezes, listening, trying to control her breath
After a moment we hear a scraping at the lock
Abby moves to the bathroom adjoining the main room and shuts the door behind her
It is very small
Abby presses her palms against the door and slowly eases her ear against the door to listen
The scraping in the apartment door lock continues
Sweat streams down Abby's face
She brushes a drop from her eye
We hear the snap of the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges
Her ear pressed to the door
From the next room we hear the sound of footsteps crunching across broken glass
Abby backs away from the door, stares at it, then turns and moves to the bathroom window
She looks out
' sheer drop to the narrow backyard of the building four stories below
Next to Abby's window is another window, separated from hers only by the breadth of the wall, that separates the two apartments
' Visser hunches, hands on knees, over Ray, who lies on the floor out of frame
(grimly) All right
He hunkers down closer to Ray
You got some of my personal property
He is rummaging through Ray's pockets but comes up empty- handed
One of you does
Visser looks down at Ray, glances around the room, looks back down at Ray
don't know what the hell you two thought you were gonna pull
His hand, gripping something, flashes down out of frame
We hear a dull crunch
Abby has drawn her head back from the bathroom window
She moves back to the door and braces herself against it
' Visser straightens up from Ray's body
He drops something to the floor, out of frame, that lands with a thud
He goes over to the light switch on the wall and flips it back and forth
No light
He goes over to the brass lamp, sets it upright, tries its switch
Again nothing
He disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open doorway
After a moment we hear a refrigerator hum as a cold blue light plays in the doorway
There is the rattle of a can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of its pull-tab being opened
After a couple of audible slurps we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close
Visser reappears in the doorway
He surveys the room, fixes on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob
The door swings open
He walks in
Visser looks around the cramped space
The shower curtain is drawn
He casually draws it back
The shower is empty
He goes to the window and leans out
' The sheer drop below; the other window to one side
He draws his head back in, presses his palms against the adjacent wall, and eases his ear to the wall to listen
Perfect quiet
After a moment he goes back to the window, braces himself against the sash, and sticks his arm out--groping for the window of the adjacent apartment
'  / ' Pressing against the glass as he leans against the upper half of the bathroom window
' It finds the adjacent window and starts to raise it
' Again we see him through the window
His jaw is set as he gropes offscreen
Suddenly his body jerks violently forward, his head smacking against the glass and cracking it
: ' Abby (out of frame) has grabbed it and now  she slams the window down on his wrist, catching it between the window sash and sill
Her other hand flashes across frame to  pin Visser's hand to the sill with Ray's knife
: We hear the shatter of glass as the shock causes his head to break through the window
His hand is nailed into the apartment next door
He is in pain
Abby back slowly from the window, staring at the hand
From the ground below we hear the faint and echoing sounds of the shards of glass shattering against pavement
' Visser's pinned hand is writhing
As we hear a muffled , a circle of light opens with a puff of plaster dust in the wall that separates the two apartments
line of light shoots across the dark apartment from the bright bathroom next door
Staring at the wall
We hear a second
' second hole has opened in the wall, letting through a second shaft of light
Four more sharp reports in rapid succession: With each gun blast a bright circle opens and a new shaft of light penetrates the dark apartment
Finally we hear the  of an empty chamber, and the clatter of the empty gun being dropped to the floor of the bathroom next door
Staring at the lines of light that crisscross the apartment
There is a long moment of silence, then a sudden
' Six circles of light
The circles go black momentarily as there is another
And another
Each time Visser pounds his fist against the wall, there is a muffled  and his swinging arm strobes the bullet holes
She turns and hobbles toward the door of apartment
The muffled thumping continues, as in her dream
As Abby emerges from the adjacent apartment
She stops and looks down the hall
' The stairway is at the far end of the hall
The door of her own darkened apartment stands slightly ajar
The bullet holes strobing
The pounding, more purposeful now, grows louder and more intense
Finally, with a crash, Visser's fist penetrates the wall in an explosion of light and dust
We pull Abby as she limps hesitantly down the hall
' Waving aimlessly through the ambient dust
He is blindly groping for the sill--and the knife that pins his other hand
His outstretched middle finger just grazes the handle of the knife
'  / Pulling Abby as she draws even with the door of her apartment
' Her pearl-handled revolver sits on the shelf just inside the door, where Ray left it
It catches the light from the hall
' The side of his middle finger rubs against the knife handle; the tip of his index finger barely touches it
Visser's fingers are trembling, indicating that his arm is stretched to its uttermost
surge against the wall gives his fingers another inch or so and they curl around the handle of the knife
' As she steps in from the hallway to pick up the gun
She looks around the apartment
' The window of the apartment, its glass now completely gone, lets in streetlight
Ray's corpse is a dark form in the middle of the floor
bright shaft of light slices across the room from offscreen
It glints on the shards of glass that litter the floor, just as in Abby's dream
As he slowly, quietly draws his hand in from the hole in the wall
He is holding the knife
He turns slowly to face the door, listening
' She steadies herself against the wall and turns to look toward the bathroom
' The bathroom door stands slightly ajar
The interior of the bathroom is a bright band in the shadowy recesses of the back of the apartment
Moving quietly toward the door
' Staring, almost transfixed, at the bathroom door
She raises the gun, trembling, and trains it on the band of light
' Visser's shadow falls across the crack in the doorway
She shifts the gun slightly and fires
' With the roar of the gun, a small circle of light opens in the door
As the door waffles under the impact, we hear Visser collapsing behind it
Leaning against the facing wall
She lowers the gun
She slides down the wall to finally rest seated on the floor
She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye
The cracked bathroom door spilling light
pause
After a moment, her voice comes out half-choked: ain't afraid of you, Marty
The bathroom door
Quiet for a long moment
Then, from inside the bathroom, we hear laughter
Staring at the door
We hear the laughter subside, to leave the sound of labored breathing
Finally: (
) Well ma'am
Visser lies on his back, his head underneath the bathroom sink
His good hand is pressed against his belly, which rises and falls with his heavy breathing
Blood seeps out between his fingers
He is smiling
If  see him, 'll sure give him the message
The underside of the sink, its convoluted chrome works beading moisture
Looking, with mild interest
condensed droplet trickles down the chrome
Directly overhead, it hangs for a moment from the lowest joint of the pipe
It fattens, wavers, wavers--and falls, spelling
[   1st
] "
In an early draft of the script, Ray, the befuddled bartender who for want of a more compelling character served as our story's hero, fled the scene of the tale's protracted central murder and checked into a motel outside of San Antonio:" , a lean man with a weathered face and large Adam's apple, stands behind the Formica check-in counter
, a heavyset man of thirty wearing a feed cap, sits in the lobby's one piece of furniture, a beat-up leatherette sofa
He sips from a can of soda
Ray, begrimed and haggard, enters out of the glare of the noonday sun
Hey there, stranger
What can  do you for
need a room
Calling out from the divan: He needs a room, Dusty
reckon  can hear him
(to Ray) Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the option
How much extra
(calling out) He wants the  option, Dusty
reckon  can hear him
option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax
(calling out) Tell him the channels, Dusty
Channels, we got two and six
Two don't come in so hot
Just a room then
(calling out) He don't want the option, Dusty
reckon  heard the man
(after shooting Kyle an irritated glance) Does he work here
(calling out) Sure don't
See, Wednesday's the special on Cola
don't know if  explained about the  option
If there's a in the room, you got to pay the option
(calling out) And how many room got , Dusty
Ever durned one
(gamely) Okay, 'll take the  option
Well see the thing about that is, we're booked
"Looking at this scene now, years later, it strikes us that revising it out of existence, as we did, constituted too much rewriting
Indeed, the more prosaic scene we replaced it with, involving Ray stopped at a traffic light, can be found in the finished script but not in the finished movie
It was shot but then deleted in order to more quickly get to the carnage, which was the picture's raison d'^etre
