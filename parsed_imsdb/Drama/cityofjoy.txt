City of Joy Written by & October 1990 Early Draft : -  (, , -1980) Heat that has mass
That rises off the parched earth in shimmering waves
After a moment, we see what appear to be figures coming out of the haze, one by one
family with their few belongings:  , 33, his wife, , 28, and their children, daughter, , 13, sons  and , 11 and 9; '  and They embark toward the night, the rising sun behind them
-   -  () Hasari's Father passes a gourd of precious water
Hasari serves the children first
Shambu gulps entirely too much, the others forcing him to stop by a unified force of will
Embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother, who sips, as does his sister
Aloka barely wets her lips, insisting on leaving the last drops for Hasari
And now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their son's family
There is an intense sadness at leaving the land and Hasari's Mother clings to him
'll send money soon
His Mother nods, as Hasari erupts in a small cough which, by habit, he suppresses
His Mother crushes Aloka to her
' Don't let the children out of your sight
Not for a moment
Now the children
She wants to keep them here even as the old man touches her, reminding her she must let them go
' Help your parents
Don't fight with each other
And, Manooj, stay away from the cinema, do you hear
Shambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to his grandma
() 2
: don't want to go
There are bad men with long knives who steal children
That does it: Hasari's   Mother dissolves in tears, but the old man nevertheless  unlooses her insistently from the children
Aloka and   the children get on the bus as the old man embraces his  son
' man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road
Yours begins here
/
- There's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or on top
The passengers are silent
woman breast feeds a baby
Several passengers fan themselves
Many sleep
The Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat
(to his neighbor) Our farm has died, so we are moving to Calcutta to become rich
Hasari and Aloka look  at each other: If only it were the pursuit of wealth and  not survival
The woman under- stands
And now the     forward and the Pals look back
Hasari coughs,   suppresses it
as silence falls
The elder Pals stand huddled   together in the dust and we see, nestled behind a boulder   at the roadside, a tiny, blue flower -- beautiful and   fragile, but like all things alive, determined to live
and we hear the sound of a a quiet   mantra in unison as we -- : -   - This flower floats gently in a bowl of water
The as we    to reveal a dozen Anglos, several Indians, and one Kenyan seated cross-legged before an aging Yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli- cants to find "their light, allow your white light to fill your spirit's eye
" Above, ceiling fans move the air

: As we  the group, we see that everyone has his/her eyes closed in earnest meditation
until we   an American,  , 29, who pops open first his right eye -- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye and opens his left eye -- looks left and right
and then, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for his white light, expels a stream of air through his pursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one indicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal
Get serious
Around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the source of this unmeditative sound
Max nods and smiles a wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for me, folks
-  - Max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise
We notice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his neck
His girl friend,  , overdressed somewhat in an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace she's been pursuing
swear to God, you never give anything enough time
What did you expect in five days, Max
Only what    they promise in the brochure:     Inner peace, serenity, and a nice    chant that gets rid of this rock    in my gut
, they do you in    a weekend
would really appreciate it if you wouldn't be terribly glib just now, Max
That's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica- tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in the valise
Am  to assume you'll be at the airport in Calcutta a week from tomorrow
() 4
: Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene Kahn
Maybe you better give me my ticket
Screw you, Max --  paid for it
How many times am  going to let you walk out on me and come back
think only you can answer that, Betsy Ilene Kahn
She slaps him
Do you really think that's an appropriate way to get rid of your Western rage, Bets
She swings at him again
He catches her hand hard in his fist
One slap is romantic
Two would call for retaliation
Lend me a hundred dollars
She yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs his knapsack and valise and goes out the door
Now, she's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt
She can't help herself; she cares
We    her a moment as we -- : () -   - Cool, lush hills

Max, in shorts and University of Miami -shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a bend in the approach road

We hear the - of a , giving his call numbers, then announcing he's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway
The Clerk  off and finds Max
() 5
: How you doin'
The Clerk gives Max a warm smile
Hello
've always wanted to walk into a little airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the following question
Ready
The Clerk nods; he's at Max's ervice
When's the next flight to anywhere
To Bombay
Tomorrow, at one o'clock in the afternoon
beat --- the Clerk with his smile, Max with his, one simply warm, the other giving off simmering heat
-   - Max sits on the ground, up against the building, playing a jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet pair of well-shod feet  the
Max looks up
The rubicund face of  , 50, and more British than Churchill
Behind him, his cherubic wife, and making her way toward the enclave of small planes, their daughter, , 26
say, are you looking for a way out of here
We have an extra seat
Where are you wanting to go
Max's eyes flick from Veejay to the back view of Manubai as she continues on and back to Veejay
'm wanting to go wherever you're wanting to take me

180 - - Max is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi
We see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejay would be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying the plane
The  of the  forces them to speak somewhat loudly
We were among the fortunate back in '48
We got out of East Bengal before partition destroyed so many
We make mattresses
The Rajah Double Spring
Veejay has an old flask out
We don't have a flight attendant on this flight
(passing the flask) Are you a musician, Mr
Loeb
Unattached trumpet player and recently-certified associate guru
As he takes a hit   on   the flask, Max's eye focuses on the little mirror on   the   dash
In it he can see Manubai's eyes
If we  were   to   judge by what he sees in them, she doesn't find him   the   least bit amusing
He smiles his smile at her
() -  ( ) huge bridge dominates the skyline
The train     trundles to a stop, its  clearing the way
People     hang on its sides, sit on the roof
and now flood the    platform, flowing into the station, clearing a view for us    of the Pals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of    this human anthill
() Hands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking for money
Daddy, 'm scared
() 7
: Scared
No -- why
This is very exciting
As soon as we get to our friend's house, everything will be fine
But, despite Hasari's charade of confidence, they (and we) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the desperate energy of the humanity around them
As they press on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform turns her eyes eerily on Manooj
as a deformed hand stretches  the
Aloka senses someone: beggar, face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy
This terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their mother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one hand and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of his other hand
It does not seem possible that he can protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching them
He moves them quickly to a wall
Wait right here
Don't move
He moves to a line of , shows a piece of paper to one, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a purchase of sweets from the Vendor
Please, can you direct me to my friend at this address
We are to stay with him
The Vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the Vendor next to him
Both look at Hasari
#1 There's no such address as this in Calcutta
But that's not possible
#1 Of course    it is possible
have lived here    all my life
You are new
Who     would know if a place exists or    does not
#2 Bombay, perhaps
Delhi
Look there
() 8
: Dear God, what now
Stunned, Hasari hands Vendor #1 a rupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, his face going through a magical transformation as he prepares to suggest to the family that all is well
-  ( ) few clean and cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into the gateway of the Grand Hotel, past a gateman
: - Feet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust
The Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the crowd
They've been walking a long  time
Shambu cries; Aloka tries to ease his fear
They  stop numbly at the edge of the park, put their bundles down against a long wall
Across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders
There is a deeply fearful look in Hasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling now
He needs to revive the family's confidence
He takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to Manooj
Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across the street
Hasari indicates a stall just across the main road
Manooj, go and get some fruit
Come straight back
Delighted with his task, Manooj sets off, his eyes on the marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of Kumar Kapur, starring in Hot Gun
Hasari calls out to him to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the street is a potential parental nightmare
hand ruffles Manooj's head and a   with dark eyes and a sweet smile comes at the boy's anxious parents
( ) Yes, hello, brother
Bihar, am correct
Yes, how did you know
() 9
: Hasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching his son's incredible journey across the street
Let me say only that the terrible malevolence that has visited your part of the country affects us all
Three years without rain
Nothing came out of the earth but debts
Terrible
And now, the    family on the street
It is not    acceptable
(smile widens) And if  can't help, my   name is not Mr
Gangooly
Which,   blessedly, it is
And now a smile as full as the sky above
- brick slides out of the wall
We're  the brick and see Gangooly's soft face as he reaches in and pulls out a key
The street is small and empty
Though the houses are nothing much, to the Pals, they look like palaces
Manooj and Shambu run about in delight
Gangooly motions for quiet
With a flourish, he  opens the door
- Gangooly enters, glances around, waves the Pals in
They're amazed
There's a cage occupied by two parrots
In one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess Lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a torn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part wash place, containing a tap with running water
Be free -- look around
On the faces of the family is one thought: Is it possible
Amrita goes right to the parrots
They'll need feeding
Give them seed
But don't spoil them
() 10
: He bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the washing area
And now, one of the miracles of life in the city
One and two
He turns on the tap and a stream of brown out
The Pals are hypnotized, the fists around their hearts begin to ease
Holy water from the Ganges
Flows out forever
Come -- touch it
Manooj and Shambu put their hands under the tap
Drink
It's as pure as the dew on Shiva's lips
They drink
Gangooly claps in delight
and beckons Hasari aside
Now, this place is yours for two weeks
My cousin, Moti, is away, traveling
Normally, the rent takes fifty rupees for a week, but for a brother, forty
No, don't thank me
Hasari pulls out his little screw of money
have only seventy-five, but as soon as  have work
Give me the fifty, pay the rest next week
You'll find work, trust you
Aren't  from Bihar, too
Yes
And the money is in his hand
He joins his hands together
You are pleased
Then Mr
Gangooly is pleased
It's how  am
() 11
: He turns on his heel and he's gone
For a moment, the Pals are still, swept from the brink of catastrophe to salvation
and now, as one, they release their sheer and utter joy
- Ravi and Veejay leading Max up the grand staircase, Manubai in the foyer, looking after them
- Ravi leads the way into a lovely guest bedroom
hope this is all right
The room hasn't been aired or the bed turned, but -- Oh, he doesn't care about that, do you, Max
Here, look here
Veejay opens a little cupboard, stocked with liquor
Help yourself
Be comfortable
Ravi, come on, go, go, let's leave the young man to himself
Obediently, Ravi goes
Veejay follows
Max goes to the window
The beautiful Manubai in the garden
He lies down on the bed
He's found Nirvana
- It's Hasari who watches now
There's  from Aloka and Amrita
Joyful  from the boys
Hasari is alone in the main room, on his knees, in front of the pile of their baggage and bundles
He turns his atten- tion from the laughter to a just-opened, old suitcase
He takes out a small tea box
Opens it delicately
() 12
: It's full of something brown
He  pushes his fingers in and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness that's almost religious, puts a pinch to his nose and breathes it in
The  and   from the bathing area is
Shambu is paddling near the tap
Aloka is bending over the drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark hair with a pot
Manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an old towel
Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the group with tenderness
and with gratitude for their good fortune
, red with anger, yanks the curtain aside, stares
The family freezes
Aloka's hair drips unnoticed on her sari
What are you doing here
Who are you
My name is Pal, Hasari
Mr
Gangooly rented this space to -- Mr
Who
Gangooly
You must be his cousin, Mr
Moti
don't know any Gangooly and my name is Binal and this is my home -- get out
The furious Binal, followed by the Pals, goes into the main part of the room
small crowd has been attracted by the noise
But this is true
We paid him a deposit of fifty -- man goes out because he has to work, and some beggar tries to move in while his back is turned
() 13
: This while Binal has begun to throw things out onto the street, though this cleansing of his home doesn't stop him from picking up a stick
The odd sympathizer meets with
So, should  suffer if they are so stupid to jump into the first mouth that wants to eat them
He turns with the stick on Hasari
You're lucky  don't kill you
Hasari looks at Manooj, who drops his eyes
They collect the remainder of their possessions and hurry out the door
- Full of neighbors
There's a suppressed violence in the air
man pushes Aloka
Sweat streaming down his face, Hasari confronts the man
pushes the men apart
Go to the river
Try to squeeze in there
-  -  () Calcutta broiling: Buses, vendors, carts, rickshaws, children beg at car windows
The Pals stand, uncertain, and for the first time a rickshaw fills Hasari's eye, carrying two passengers
But now he shoulders his burden and leads the family toward the river
We  until they grow small against the setting sun, gleaming red against the white domes of the Victoria Monument
'  -  - Moving through the dark, a figure, touching things, looking at photographs of the Chattergees
We hear a   mixed with the  a la Dean Martin of "Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime": "Goddamn it, boy, what's the matter with you
-- "Everybody loves somebody sometime" -- "Go for it, son
" -- "Sure, Dad, whatever you say, Dad
" -- "Everybody falls in love somehow" -- "You're the dad, Dad
" Now, a humidor
Max opens it, takes out a cigar, takes two
Takes five
Senses someone
Turns
14
Ravi in her bathrobe
'm starving
He gives her his best saint's smile
Well, you don't want to eat those awful cigars
Come with me, we'll wake up the cook, she'll fix you something proper
-  - the window, we see the bleary-eyed cook laying out food as Ravi chatters away at Max, he with a beatific grin on his face as he feeds himself
-   - The bridge etched against the dawn sky
The corpse of an indigent is collected and put on a cart
With his eyes open, watching the dead man being removed
After their humiliating flight, they found refuge here
Tiny figures huddled together with their baggage and bundles, near a tree, not far from the steps that dip down to the smooth water
Hasari's eyes, too, are on the dead man, that warning
He kneels beside Manooj, strokes him
The boy's eyes turns to the man's, wondering if the man can provide for them
Don't let it frighten you
You have to be brave
know we'll find work today
Fear and doubt fill Manooj's eyes
He nods
- Hasari at the gates, the family huddled together in the b
g
The man behind the gate shakes his head, points
15
line of a hundred men stretches from a door
Hasari is on the edge of panic, but when he turns to the family, he's wearing his confident smile
As before, he gathers the family into the protectorate of his arms and guides them onward
As he pushes off into the sea of humanity, we    ,  the   street upon street, disappearing Hasari
-   - Two plump men in shirt sleeves look coolly at Hasari
The elder shakes his head
The younger shows Hasari the door
Outside, an increasingly desperate Hasari finds Aloka before a small shrine, saying a prayer
- Aloka huddled with Manooj and Amrita
Hasari talking to the owner of a small market stall
Shambu is peering into a shop with male mannequins in the window
'  - In the moving mirror we see counters and shelves of men's clothing
The mirror stops at Max slipping into a kurta before an audience of Ravi, Manubai, and a salesman
It's not extravagant at all
You can't go around all week in your tribal garb
Max sees a boy's face pressed to the glass: he indicates the shirt, for the boy's approval
The boy smiles a wonderful smile
Now he looks civilized, doesn't he, Manubai
Almost
Max looks at her
She at him
16
'  - Man leans down, whispers to the smiling boy
You sure  look all right
The little boy nods
Max slips him several rupees
and he, Manubai, and Ravi fold themselves into her tiny car as -- Shambu runs to his dejected family
Look
man gave me these many moneys
What man
Why -- did you ask him for money
He just gave it to me
Where is he
Shambu looks, but the car's gone
Don't do that
We're not beggars
Shambu is devastated
Out of his own desperation, Hasari feels he's been a little rough on the boy
He holds him close
Go back to the river
Wait for me by the tree
Don't go anywhere
Do you understand
Aloka, the boys nod
We  them as Hasari heads off, quickly becoming a small figure disappearing into the sea
- Starting to sink
We    Hasari stepping to a grilled window as the man ahead moves out
17
- flaking gray wall, half-obscured with moldering files
The grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet supplications of those outside
An old  at a desk
voice calls out
The Clerk looks up, crosses to the grill
Hasari's tense face through the bars past, drowning out the words
except these: "
trade union
" The Clerk shakes his head sadly
On the verge of panic, Hasari hangs onto the window
Do you have family
Yes, yes of course
But 'm three days without work
'll take anything
The Clerk digs in his pocket, presses two rupees on Hasari
Here, now go away
No,  don't want you to give me -- The next man in line forcibly moves Hasari out of the way
In this city, a man with a family can't be proud
Take it
The Clerk waves him away, turns his attention to the next man
-  ( ) Manubai's face
Then Max's
Then hers
Then his
Looking at each other
Five days
Kiss
Ravi
said you have three days to get me into bed, and 'm betting you can't do it
() 18
: It's all right for you to use my mother as your tour guide and meal ticket, because she'll get something nice out of it
But what would  get
He stares at her a moment, then gets up, goes around the table
Well, gee,     don't know
Maybe could say    something so amusing that you'd    laugh so hard it would break that    hot poker you have up your ass
She stares at him
He bends to kiss her
She doesn't pull away
but after a moment he realizes she isn't responding
He continues the kiss, but he opens his eyes
to find her staring at him
He pulls back
They stare at each other another moment, then Max senses someone in the doorway
Staring at them, disappointment filling her eyes
The same sound of frustration and ennui he made in the ashram
- His arm around Max, Veejay guides the young man toward a waiting taxi
Believe me,  understand, but you know how women are
Do you have enough money
Max gives him a non-commital shrug
Veejay winks, stuffs the money into Max's pocket
-  -  ( ) Bare feet
and then sneakered feet step over the sleep- ing bovine, who turns a disinterested eye up
19
Max is guided by a grumpy hall  wearing an off- white shirt and bellbottoms through the walled and well planted courtyard of an inexpensive hotel
Max gives the cow a bemused eye
- The room is utterly utilitarian
The Porter turns on a ceiling fan, sending an army of cockroaches scurrying for calmer terrain
Max clearly doesn't care for cockroaches
It pleases you
No fruit basket
No mini bar
Max hands the Porter several rupees
Bar
Of course -- many, many
But make care, Sahib
Please, for me
If it is lady you like to know -- yes
-- you let me
Huh
Very sweet girl, good nature, very sweet
Or boy, very good
Max puts a finger on the Porter's head, turns him for the door
No like boy
Something then for smoke -- mmmh, very good for smoke
Max eases the Porter out
As the door is closing
Maybe you like two girls -- look a little Chinese, but very great pleasure
Max smiles his smile and disappears the Porter behind the closed door
The smile disappears and the  gets his attention; it has an annoying rhythm and sound
He flicks the switch, but the fan continues to snap around
() 20
: He stares at it
and startles us by suddenly flicking out a hand and grabbing the blade, stopping the fan
He lets go
The fan is still
He carries his knapsack to the tub; it has brown stains along the middle and the water has a brown tinge as it flows out of the tap
He sits on the edge of the tub, dumps his knapsack on the floor, picks up a half-dozen pamphlets from the ashram
Guides to inner peace
He wings the pamphlets at the trashcan
-   -  ( ) Hasari comes around the corner of a warehouse, a smile on his face, clutching some bananas and dried grain
His relief -- and ours -- is short-lived
The space where he left the family has been cleared and taken over by trucks
He's lost his family
group of Hindus are   celebrating a puja, the women singing canticles at   the top of their lungs; the men tossing a little boy   happily back and forth
as the panic-stricken Hasari   rushes up
My wife, my children
Hasari rushes on
Suddenly we -- : - His head turns and his eyes look this way, that way
until out of the near silence, we hear a distant, extraordinary word
() 21
: (
) Daaaaaaddddddyyyyy
The word catches Hasari's ear
He looks into the sea of people along the river bank under the bridge
(
) Daaaaaadddddddyyyy
As in a dream, Shambu rises up out of the sea of bodies and runs to his father
Daaaaadddddyyyy
Now, Aloka, Amrita, Manooj appear, rising up out of the sea, ending Hasari's nightmare
warrior returning from battle, Hasari engulfs the little boy
told you to remain where  left you
told you to stay there
The police came
We said we had to meet you, but they didn't care
They were mean
As before, Hasari tries to engulf the rest of his family in the protectorate of his arms
In the b
g
, Arun and his family
These friends have found space
They will share with us
Hasari looks at the tiny space
The roof is cardboard and cloth and half an old movie poster featuring the actor Kumar Kapur
Hasari looks at his tiny bit of food, debates a moment
then puts his hands together, addresses these generous people
would be proud if you would share our food with us
Everyone looks at the food; there is no disguising their hunger
22
- Distant transistor  as we  : The Pal children sleep despite the   and nightmare around them, the two boys huddled together, Amrita close to her mother
Hasari comes out of the dark
Aloka looks at him
He shakes his head
He slumps beside her
Aloka strokes Hasari, looking lovingly at him
remember the first time  saw you, on the day of our marriage
Wearing a bright yellow turban
You asked me my name and you said, 'You are a very beautiful girl and  am wondering whether you will find me appealing
' He strokes her tenderly in return
but now, overwhelmed with despair, she begins to weep
What
She doesn't want to say it, doesn't want to wake the children
It's all right -- what
miss the village
There could help
Hasari pulls Aloka close, strokes her
- The sky turns red
The Porter looks up, shakes his head: Poor young man, stuck with only a trumpet for company
' Max sits on the floor in a corner and plays as we hear the sound of a fierce  and a
-    - gigantic earthmover lurches into position
23
Swarming police
Awaken -- startled, disoriented
Aloka gentles the children as Hasari moves instinctively toward the threat
black ambassadorial car pulls up, out of which steps a
microphone and speaker has been set up
Another car unloads several politicos with party banners
minion hands the Babu the mike; he wants to get on with it before this turns into a political rally
Hasari is close to him, as is Arun
The municipality has directed us to carry out the destruction of this settlement
All of you must go -- now
For a moment there is a babble of fear and frustration
Then from Hasari's side, Arun confronts the Babu
For what reason
The Babue appears disconcerted
He's not accustomed to the poor asking questions
Because this settlement is impeding construction work
We're not moving
Why should we move
Who is the municipality
We are
This is our home
have my orders
If we're driven from here, where should we go
'll give you five minutes to gather your things
Then, the settlement comes down
() 24
: Why should you alone be burdened with such a task
Let me help
Arun begins to tear his shelter apart, and to heave the pieces at the Babu, who retreats
Others soon take up the call to vent their frustration, hurling things at the police and at the driver of the tractor
Quickly we've got a full-scale riot
The police wade into the crowd, pounding people with their sticks, Arun one of the first to get hit
He staggers into Hasari's arms
/ Unbelievable
Panic-stricken, Hasari and Aloka gather the children and their few belongings
as beside them a woman goes down from a stick to the head; Aloka stops instinctively to help the woman, but Hasari grabs her, trying to shelter her and the children as well as Arun's wife and children, clutching Arun to him as in the chaos they manage to escape
-    - On the billboard:  maharajah sleeping snugly on a thick mattress
From his dreamland he inquires solicitously: "Have you ever thought of a Rajah Double Spring as a present
" We   and  the Pals and Arun and his family, panting, terrified, beneath the sign
Daddy, are we going to die here
Hasari can see on everyone's face this question
No
Today, 'm just a mangy dog on the street, but soon,  swear, 'll look other men in the eye
(a beat) swear
Yet on his face we see the extraordinary pressure to make this promise reality
Hasari reaches the head of a line and receives a small handout
Turning away, he  studies the morsel of food
His head aches, his belly screams with hunger
but he takes only a single bite, then carefully wraps the rest in a cloth and knots it
() 25
: He feels a tug at his elbow
It's a 15-year-old  with thick, scholarly spectacles
() Why live like a beggar when you can live like a maharajah
Hasari stares at the boy
-   '  - needle injected, blood flowing into a bottle
Hasari seated on a stool, watching his blood leave his body, his face broken out in perspiration
thought you were only taking a little
We pay more, we take more
'm feeling a little dizzy
It'll pass
Rafik and a thin man chatting easily and exchanging ciga- rettes with another attendant
His vision
With his free hand, he begins to grapple for the Atten- dant to keep his balance, starts to fall
and the : - woozy Hasari gives Rafik his share; Rafik in turn gives the thin man his share
The thin man bows his farewell
() 26
: Blood is the oil well of the poor, brother
Now, give me another three and 'll give you these
He opens his hand with its dirty nails
In it lie a little group of pills, like highly-colored sweets
What are those
Vitamins
Take these and you can give again in a week
While Hasari considers, Rafik pours the pills into Hasari's hand, takes the three rupees
Hasari downs the pills
One week
Here
The same time
And he's gone, leaving Hasari, woozy but at least, for the moment, blessed to count his money
'  - Max lies on his messed bed, contorted, with his feet up over his head against the wall
book lies open beside him
half-eaten room service meal, many hours old, moulders on the bedside table
Max is babbling a mock sports case into his fist
They're in the shotgun
There's the snap from center, the clock is running -- five, four, three -- he has an open man at the Notre Dame twenty for the victory
and he freezes
He freezes
Mr
Choke chokes
The fans go -- at the door
Max shuts up, falls off the wall
He crosses to the door
Opens it
is 16, beautiful and exotic-looking behind her excessive makeup
- The porter pushes the girl gently into the room, smiling at Max, nodding
The door is closed

He may have been receptive to a "sweet, young girl," but not a kid in her teens
Got an
on you
(she doesn't get it) How old are you
Twenty, sahib
buy that
She approaches him seductively
can do anything you want, sahib
She fingers the   Hebrew letter at Max's throat, on its gold chain
For    a moment, Max is mesmerized by this child; but then,   as she begins more serious ministra- tions, he pulls   back
Hold it, time out
Time, there's time out on the field
Is problems, sahib
Is problems, yeah, just a couple
No, please, yes,  can -- There's something desperate in her that makes him put a finger to her lips and say
How 'bout some chow
(she doesn't get it) was just about to order some room service
Food
call, they come, we eat
She stares at him
'  -  (  ) Max smokes a Monte  Cristo and watches Poomina, like a frightened little  animal, devour the last of a Green Acres room service  meal and then wrap a small piece of fish in the paper  napkin
() 28
: She looks up at him, delivers a small burp
Covers her mouth in charming embarrassment
Now, you are ready for great pleasure, yes
Watching you eat was my great pleasure
Now you go home
As he escorts her toward the door, Poomina is distressed
Max realizes she can't leave empty-handed
He pulls out some notes
For you
She hasn't given up, though, and as he takes the money, she stands on tiptoe and kisses him
Torn, Max begins to respond
He stops  himself, his grip on her causing her discomfort
His  breath comes in little bursts
You're a very wet kisser
Work on it, get in touch in five years
He leads her toward the door
Like some lunatic comedy
she resists
He pushes
She locks her knees
He opens the door
Goddamn it, cut it out
Now, good night
He muscles her out the  door, closes it, wipes his lips
He stares at a parade  of cockroaches gliding along the wall as he listens to  her  quietly on the other side of the door
He   debates
and he loses
Opens the door
Poomina stands   there; the tears stop and a lip- twitching smile lights  her face
Five years already
Gee, time really flies when you have no moral conviction
She slides into his arms, pressing against him
With his shoulder, he closes the door, leaving us outside
-  -   - bare light bulb; a  vinyl  on a turn- table
() 29
: Poomina watches Max do a sleight-of-hand trick with a coin
He tosses it up, brings his hands past each other, then holds out his fists; she picks on
but the other holds the penny
Fooled, she laughs
He does it again; she points to one fist -- empty -- then other -- also empty
Max reaches behind her ear and
produces the coin
She loves it, her laughter escalating
But then she seesm to read something in the b
g
where we see four thugs, two of whom will become known to us as  , a capo to the local "mafia" chieftan, and , son of the local Godfather
Ashoka works on a pimple on his chin
The Goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with spit from one of his expensive new running shoes
Max eyes the thugs eyeing him
Short guys
Quit lookin' at us
This remark goes over big with the thugs
Max doesn't care
He knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle
The bartender brings them two shots of something in two unmatched glasses
Special drink for you, sahib
Only the most man can drink it
You make try
For me
For you,  would drink battery acid
Who that finish first
bet
She puts her glass to her lips and, in a childish, exaggerated way, mimes waiting for him to commence a drinking race with her
The two of them toss off what's in their glasses
The bangla in Max's glass is stronger than battery acid
He does an elaborate routine involv- ing the pain, the surprise, the sheer awfulness of the drink
But puts it down with mock machismo
beat
really don't think so -- oh no, nay, nay
never lose the truly irrelevant contest
We have fun some more
bet again
() 30
: She turns to the bartender, calls for two more
All the while, in the b
g
, The Goonda and his two thugs watch emotionlessly and Ashoka works on his acne
- Max sings "Take It to the Limit" with enormous inebriated sincerity as Poomina helps him out of the bar
There's a big black motorcycle parked outside
Max glances at it as they start down the alley
As he looks back to the road ahead, he finds The Goonda in front of him
Max isn't so drunk that he doesn't sense what this is about
He looks behind him
Indeed, the other two goons are there
Ashoka straddles the big cycle
Well well
Seek punishment and ye shall find
Knowing what's  coming, Max nevertheless unleashes a beautiful howl  and tries to trample The Goonda off- tackle
From   behind, he's hit with a length of stick
He goes down,  looks up through blasted eyes at Ashoka as two sticks now  land against his shoulder and his head
- The Pals sleep beneath the sign
Hasari awakens from restive sleep to the sound of a
He gets up
The others awaken
Don't go -- what are you doing
It sounds like someone needs help
Hasari bolts for the corner
As Hasari turns into the head of the alley, he can see three men beating someone, a fourth man standing off to the side, watching
What are you doing
(calling back) man's being beaten here
As Hasari runs down the alley, the and   and the three goons take flight
31
Hasari runs up, reaches out to Max, who's barely on his feet
As Hasari touches Max, Max turns and belts Hasari in the nose, nailing Hasari to the wall as Max collapses at Hasari's feet
Hasari grabs his nose with one hand and kneels beside the fallen Max
as a shadow moves and startles Hasari
He peers into the dark
and Poomina steps into the light
/ (  ) - '  - - The crucifix sways
Now Max's eyes    the cherubic face of  , peering  the without sympathy
Max on a cot in a tiny, spare room, a butterfly bandage under one eye
Joan, Irish, short, stout, hovers over him
Behind her, Hasari Pal
Good morning, junior, welcome to our country
Max manages to sit up
Wishes he hadn't
Oh,  like the way the room moves in circles
(checking out his accommodations) suppose  should inquire where am
You're in the City of Joy
Is that geographic or spiritual
Oh, now we require that each visitor decide that for himself
This gentleman and a young lady brought you here
Did  do that to your nose
(as Hasari nods) 'm sorry
() 32
: Hasari shrugs, smiles
and a gigantic rat drops in Max's lap
He leaps to his feet and against the wall
The rat scurries away
What was that -- a Shetland pony
would have to inspect it more closely, but  believe that was one of our economy-size rats
Max clambers for the door
Too late, Joan thinks to say
Watch your -- Max cracks his head on the door frame
Thanks -- got it
He ducks outside for some air
/ -   - ' Stunned
In the dawn light, he finds himself in a small square in a slum, an open sewer running before him
He's repulsed
Pardon the expression, but Jesus Christ
From the tea shop, , a stout old Hindu man dressed in Western clothes, raises a hand in greeting to Joan
On the door Max and Joan have come through: "City of Joy Self Help School & Clinic
" Across the way, a young man is dandling a baby on his knee, rubbing its back and sniffing at its neck
Small group of children around a blackboard with a teacher, , doing numbers
, the rickshaw puller, readies to go out to work
Trying to orient himself, Max turns
to find perhaps fifty people, largely women and children, staring at him
() 33
: He knows them by type:   patients
He looks at the sign on the door
You a doctor
Oh no, 'm a corporate executive
Doctor arrives at half seven, but only three days a week
This is obviously one of those three days
Indeed
What brings you to our country
came to find my white light
Ah, yes
take it you didn't find it
Kept opening the doors and windows of my spirit, but couldn't see a goddamn thing
What do you do in America
Max is slow to answer
Discreetly, Hasari hangs back, listens
Oh, how exciting
Must be something illegal
Are you a criminal of some sort
suppose that depends how you define the word: 'm a doctor
see
How long are you here
Perhaps  could recruit you for -- Forget it
You've got your non- practicing Catholics
'm a non- practicing doctor
() 34
: How very distressing
Why's that
Found out  just really don't like sick people
Well, 'm outta here
owe you one
can't imagine ever divining how to collect, but there are a few of us Indians, you know, who believe the tourist trade ought to be encouraged
Max turns to Hasari
Hasari is incredibly shy, can barely meet Max's eyes
Thank you very much
Let me
He goes for his money
No, please
Max finds his pockets empty
Then reaches for his wrist -- his watch is gone -- and then his throat -- his chai is gone, too
'm afraid they cleaned you out
Ram, here's your first rider
(to Max) Take this
She holds out several rupees toward him
All eyes on them
Go on, it's all right
You'll owe me two
-   - Max in the rickshaw, Hasari running alongside Ram, an exuberant smile slashed across his face
You see,  can keep up
() 35
: Keep up, of course
Anyone can run at this pace
But you think it's easy to run and to pull
can do it
could pull it
Come on, give him a shot
He's as fast as you and looks twice as strong
Will you still pay me when he runs you into a ditch
Absolutely
trust the man
Suddenly, Ram comes to a stop
All right, you, come, step in here
Hasari looks on Max with enormous gratitude
Ram puts the shafts down, has a short coughing fit, spits some phlegm, looks at Max
hope you're taking something for that
Ram waves him off as Hasari lifts the shafts to his hips
Now, fine, pull, go
Hasari tries to pull, but the center of gravity isn't easy to find
This is enormously difficult and Hasari's very clumsy at it
The street is crowded
The traffic is beginning to back up behind them
The driver and conductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults
See, mister
What did  tell you
Come on
What do you think this is -- some village street
You've got to move quickly
He turns to Max
You see, it takes a gift
() 36
: say he can do it
'll bet you the fare he can do it
(play by play) What do you think, rickshaw fans, can he do it
The crowd isn't in for fun
Hasari strains forward
The rickshaw moves with him
Ram moves alongside, shouting instructions and oaths
cop comes on the run, screaming at Hasai
which makes Ram importune more strongly and Max joke more vociferously
Even under this incredible pressue, Hasari gains confidence and begins to move quicker, earning shouts of approval from Max and Ram, who now has trouble keeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom, an avalanche of oaths following them
'  - At first all we see are feet on a marble floor
The Goonda's in his running shoes, then Ram and Hasari's bare feet
This is the partitioned splendor of an old house sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past
Everything is baroque, rotting and somehow impressive
Hasari has never been anywhere like this, and is caught between curiosity and fear of breathing
" " The three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun- light -- dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment of furniture
Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next to ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean
Sitting behind a desk is Ashoka, leaning over a mirror, squeezing a balky pimple
Near a large window, his 60-year-old father, , in a European jacket and dhoti, works with intense concen- tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a twist of fine wire
The three new arrivals stand silent and respectful before the desk
At last, without raising his head
Not a tongue between you then
() 37
: Yes, yes,  am wondering, sir, we are, is it possible you might have something for my friend
Ram indicates Hasari, as if there might be some question to whom he's referring
Ashoka attacks the pimple
Let me explain it for your ears, sir
My cousin from Bihar has just arrived in our city -- They've brought a small present -- of respect
The Goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk
Ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance at Hasari
So, you want to be a human horse
Oh yes
have personally witnessed his excellence -- yes
He doesn't talk
Can he neigh at least
(to Hasari) You -- do your ears function
Oh yes, Babu
Can
uhm
Neigh
Like a horse
Ashoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitates a neigh: "Ne-igh
Ne-igh
" Well, yes, Babu,  can do that
Would you like me to imitate a horse
Finished with the pimple, Ashoka wipes a finger on his shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes as
38
Behind him, The Godfather walks up to the desk, putting his glasses on
He barely glances at his son, but waves him out of the chair
Ashoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside
As he does, he turns a look of hatred on Hasari
Through no fault of his own, Hasari has made an enemy
Ghatak chews on a pan and casts a benevolent eye on Hasari
Lift your longhi
Hasari does
The Godfather looks at his legs and thighs
The wise men of our nation say that nirvana is the attainment of a state of supreme detachment
For me, nirvana is counting each evening, one by one, the rupees earned by my two thousand and forty-six rickshaws
Hasari doesn't know whether to respond
glance at Ram tells him not to
Ghatak gestures for Hasari to lower his longhi
You are with family
have a wife and three children, Babu
And they must eat, heh
The world is full of open mouths
He chews on this a moment, then opens a drawer
and holds a small, tinkling rickshaw bell toward Hasari
Hasari understands that, incredibly, he has a job
His breath is so shallow, he can barely utter his gratitude
He takes the bell
shall be eternally grateful to you
From now on,  shall be as the youngest of your brothers
Stay loyal
These days, it's a crop nobody plants
The Godfather turns his beatific and Godlike smile on Hasari Pal
() 39
-  ( ) Transitor
The Pals load the rickshaw that stands at the road with Ram in it
There are embraces with the bruised Arun and his family
-  ( ) We hear the   as the rickshaw, pulled by Hasari, carrying Ram and Aloka (holding Shambu) arrives (Amrita and Manooj trotting beside their father)
Surya, Selima, other neighbors greet them as they come
The Pals glance into the school at Joan, who's teaching an evening class
Reverentially, they follow Ram inside as Joan watches
'  - door opens
Moonlight
Faces peer through the door
Ram lights an oil lamp
In the glow, the family looks around their tiny space
Hardly able to suppress smiles
Someone has blessed us
job, a roof, a school
Soon 'll be able to send money home
(looking at Amrita) and put away a little bit for your dowry
In their excitement, the boys run
and up to the roof, under the stars
We them and: : -   - Max on his balcony playing his trumpet as we continue to 40
: (  ) - About twenty tattered street kids faces shining with en- joyment
They run and shout as they pursue something just out of frame
The cause of the excitement is Hasari running  us, feet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a huge sack
Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of the machine
Ram stands   in the center of the square
He shouts a command and   Hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a stop
It's    not easy and Sunil -- who's arriving -- has to jump out of   the way to the accompaniment of apologies from Hasari and   Ram and hoots of laughter from the children
Outside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy-five wait patiently, watching as Hasari takes off again
The wheels of the rickshaw hit a rut
Hasari loses control, the sack tips back and Hasari is lifted into the air, feet kicking as he tries to regain his balance
Aloka and Amrita, sitting near the bawling Ram, can't hold back their laughter
-   - The square is set with obstacles
As Ram shouts instruc- tion, we see Hasari negotiate them with much increased skill
He stops in front of a small group
It's his family, plus Joan and Surya
With an exhausted smile, he signs to Aloka and Amrita to get in
They do, and Hasari takes them triumphantly around the circuit
Hasari's triumphant ride continues and we: : - Hasari rubs the moonstone in his ring on the shafts, then touches his heart and his forehead
in uniform, approaches the rickshaw stand
We also see several other pullers, Rassoul, Chomotkar, Ramatullah
Rickshaw wallah
() 41
: Let Hasari go
The line of rickshaw pullers  turns to Hasari
The other pullers wish him well as he  comes forward
His heart pounds; ever so politely, he  helps the School Girl into his carriage
She gives him   the address of the St
Pius School
'm sorry,  don't know where that is
You're my very first passenger
Really
Well,  hope  bring you luck
She gives him a sweet smile
That way, and then to the right
His moment has arrived
He looks at Ram
and thrusts his hips forward, setting off into the insanity of the traffic, eyes flicking left and right
at him and a taxi tries to run him down, calling and laugh- ing as Hasari jumps in terror
(calling) Feed the police
Other pullers laugh,  call after Hasari
and as he approaches the first  corner, he manages to pull out a rupee and deposit it  into the hand of the impassive traffic policeman and  then turn right
- The School Girl hands him a slip of paper
This is my home address
Pick me up promptly at seven each morning
Yes, thank you, you can depend on me
The girl runs into the school  yard, met immediately by friends
Hasari looks around   at the clean, bustling school, at all the children in  their crisp uniforms and a look of great yearning comes  over his face
42
- Max is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants
Beef
You know -- cow
Minced, little salt, pepper, slap it flat like this, throw it on the grill, flip it
Now, though, he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter
He leans out
Ashoka, astride his motorcycle,  the  as a boy runs out of a store with an armload of cassettes
Put it on the grill, 'll be right back
He pulls the boy's ear,  the  to go
and senses someone close
He turns to find an American hovering at his shoulder
You know,  have to say you really don't look Jewish believe that's mine
He reaches for the necklace with the Hebrew letter
Ashoka recognizes Max
Looks around for help
There is none
Don't touch me
No one touches me
Really
Max grabs Ashoka
who breaks free, and  the down a side street
Max gives chase, his aching ribs slowing him a bit
43
Ashoka, glancing back, begins to open up some distance
Yet, Max hangs tough, weaving like a broken field runner through the mass of bodies and vehicles
Now, suddenly, he loses Ashoka
He has to make a choice about this corner or that one
He chooses
-   -  ( ) steps into his path
He sees Ashoka up ahead
He's hopelessly out of breath
Oh
great
good
good timing him
He can't talk and breathe
He points desperately
The Cop glances where Max points, but he makes no move to give chase
May  see your passport
Passport
'm in the middle of a high speed chase
That guy -- Passport please
crowd has begun to form
In the distance, we see a group of girls carrying cricket equipment   us
It's in my hotel room
Passport, please, now
Ready my lips:  do not have my passport with me at this
(he gets it) Ah,  see, said the blind man
The Cop obviously is doing this at Ashoka's behest
Max starts around the Cop
The Cop, however, sticks his club in Max's face; there's fire in Max's eyes
but a hand takes the Cop's stick before Max can make a big mistake
44
- The girls with the cricket equipment (and Margareta, the teacher)
The hand belongs to Joan Bethel
Well, all right, junior, so you'll owe me three
- scribe finishes writing a note home for Hasari
The scribe hands it to Hasari
- "We are well
Manooj does not go in the cinema
am earning my living as a rickshaw wallah
It is my honor to send you this
" With great pride, Hasari pays the scribe, seals the money order with the message in an envelope, licks the flap, and puts the envelope into the mail slot
(  ) -   -  () Surya plays his zither
Max and Joan sit at a table
Max pops little boiled candies into his mouth from a dish on the table
Oh, it was just a whim in the beginning really -- to try to convince them not to be so bloody passive, that they could pull themselves up on their own get a little money from a Swiss organization
Now it's become a bit more than  can manage
It's got to be like trying to drill a hole in water, though
We just need a few more hands on this little life raft we've set afloat here
() 45
: They stare at each other
Shambu has become one of Surya's tea boys and refills their tea
You know what 've come to think in my middle age, Max
Nope, no, earthly idea
You're pretty much outta my league, thought-wise
There are really only three actions open to a person
Only three -- okay
And what are they
To run, to spectate, to commit
Max peers at her a moment, then around the square
Has it occurred to you that this obsession with charity is really a flaw in your character
Charity
It's not charity, dear child, it's love
You're very badly twisted around, aren't you
One of us sure as hell is
The clinic's part-time doctor,  , comes out of the clinic after a very long day
'm off for home, Sister Joan pleasure to meet you, Dr
Loeb
The same
See you day after tomorrow
Good night, God bless, Doctor
(a beat) Generous young man
() 46
: As he watches Sunil head away, Max senses something com- ing at him from the side
soccer ball almost hits him; he jumps up, handles the ball athletically
He begins to play with Manooj and several other children
Shambu leaves his post in the tea shop to join them
Are you the American doctor
Are you coming here to help us
No, 'm the visiting American soccer star, El Max
Do you go to the cinema in America, El Max
When  was your age -- two movies, plus cartoons every Saturday
Aloka and Amrita are cooking on an open fire bucket
Max almost knocks the fire over
Aloka looks at him, apolo- getic, shy
as Manooj knocks Shambu down at Max's feet
Max scoops the little boy up
There you go, little guy
Ut -- what's this
Reaching behind Shambu's ear, Max produces a boiled sweet
Aloka watches this with a smile; their eyes touch again
as Manooj lets out a cry at the sight of their father
Ram and Hasari return home
Hasari can hardly walk
Shambu runs to his father, explaining excitedly
Daddy, there is the doctor from America
He saw two movies every Saturday
What's in your fist
Open, Daddy
Shambu pries his father's fist open:   seeds
() 47
: Seeds
Why
So we can watch something grow
'   - Children leaning down as smoke wafts up
We  the smoke   Max's cigar
Aloka and Amrita laying the food out
Shambu rubbing his father's aching legs as Hasari and Manooj plant the seeds in Hasari's little tea caddy full of earth from home
Max is watching this "family" huddled around the father
Another few months, 'll be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop
All around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice, aromatic spices, piles of vegetables
and at night, 'll lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines
This beautiful picture burrows into Hasari's mind
For a moment, he goes there -- home, to the village
If my wife will let me come within a hundred miles of the place where she herself resides
Ram laughs, Hasari smiles
Amrita,  saw a beautiful wedding sari today
Amrita is terribly embarrassed
It was six hundred rupees only
He laughs at the impossibility of the price
That's only 40 dollars, isn't it
If you have it
() 48
: 'll send it to you from America when  get home tomorrow
That's very generous but no, thank you
Repayment for punching you in the nose
You have repaid me by sharing our supper
Joan indicates that Max should let it go
Hasari ever so carefully waters the tea box
Doctor Big Brother,  myself would be willing to accept a gift
Could you give me five rupees in a note -- ten, perhaps
My ankle is badly swelled; the higher the number the more the swelling sinks
Max has to laugh
don't have a cent on me
'll owe you
How much
Now everyone's attentions is taken by a  from Shambu, who expels his breath, his terrified eyes directing our attention to
It's an amazing sight
Two lepers: , bearded with a sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way along on a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace, ahead of , a huge, mute leper
They stop some feet away
Lepers aren't often welcome
Out from behind Said steps Poomina
Joan Di, my sister
() 49
: She sees Max, gasps, throws herself behind Said
Joan looks at Max -- he starts to speak, she points a finger that silences him
It was Poomina who brought you to us
She has herself and her sister to support
It's all right, Poomina
Anouar, what is it
She moves to them
They're all three badly out of breath
It's Meeta
It's her time
But something is wrong
The midwives don't know what to do
Dr
Sunil, could he help, perhaps
Dr
Sunil isn't here
Meeta will die
Joan turns to Max, who hasn't heard the exchange
Max,  wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency
pregnancy gone awry
It's a leper
Could you have a look
Max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers
don't have any experience with leprosy
Good Christ, son, because she's a leper doesn't mean she's not built like a woman
can run and get Dr
Sunil
It's too far
() 50
: Suddenly, impulsively
could help
've had three babies
You can't do that
They're outcasts, they're unclean
There are murmurs of assent from the others
Oh nonsense
It's not contagious
beat -- everyone fixed on Max
You're a doctor, how can you not help
- The moon reflects off the dark puddles of muddy water that line the side of the railway tracks
Anouar propels his board with astonishing agility along the path, Said and Poomina running with him
Max, Joan, carrying a first aid bag, Aloka and Hasari following, slipping and sliding on the rough ground with its puddles and sewage
-   - The little procession arrives outside the three rough huts, made of bamboo, plastic sheeting, cloth, wood and cardboard
few shadows materialize
Lepers -- staring silently
Anouar points into a hut
Joan and Aloka precede Max inside
Max forgets to bend and bumps his head
- The only light is the feeble waver from a candle
The blind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground
Her ragged sari is pulled up to her middle
Her face runs with sweat, her hair is plastered to her face
girl with black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood
Meeta sends up a , uninterrupted
wedge of blood-soaked cloth is between her legs
() 51
: middle-age leper is leaning over her -- a midwife, encouraging Meeta with a string of commands in their own language
Max kneels, Aloka at his side
His breathing becomes shallow
but then he pulls off  the blood-soaked bandages
Between Meeta's legs   he can just make out the bottom of a foot
The child   is breached
Maybe already dead
Will she die
Max goes into reflex actions
Joan has opened the first aid kit
There's a flashlight among the medicine, alcohol, compresses, scissors, etc
He hands the flash- light to Aloka as
(to Joan) Pull me two c
c
's of Coramine
He nods at Aloka; she illuminates the scene
Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming' down the lane
Why it's -- is it possible -- way over here, in India -- yes, it's Mr
Choke
He comes to a stop
Everyone stares at him
Meeta moans
For a moment, he stays frozen
Aloka reaches out instinctively, wipes the sweat from his eyes
This gesture seems to free him; he looks at her, looks at the room and its expectant, trusting faces
'm going to have to turn it -- the baby
Tell her she has to relax these muscles as much as she can
He doesn't finish the sentence
Aloka speaks softly to Meeta as Max takes Meeta's arm, makes a tourniquet
Joan hands him the syringe and he injects
Hands the syringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning the baby
Aloka takes Meeta's hand and it's a moment before we realize Aloka, with her fine hand, is holding Meeta's fingerless palm
52
small group waits, trying to determine from the sounds what's happening inside
Anouar pours tea from a pot on the small fire, offers the cup to Hasari
Hasari stares at the cup, doesn't want to be impolite, but more than that, doesn't want to touch the cup
He shakes his head, smiles
Anouar drinks off the tea
Sweat pours down Max's face into his eyes
He shakes it out
Aloka leans forward and, with her new sari, wipes the sweat away again
Max nods thanks
Tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now
He demonstrates
Aloka does the same to Meeta
Meeta tries to cooperate
And suddenly Max has the baby turned
All right
Now, tell her to push
Aloka translates
Meeta pushes
The midwife, the little girl, Aloka lean forward
Again
Yes
Again
It's coming
No one is sitting now
Everyone hangs close to the door
Only Hasari remains apart, seated on a tree stump in the middle of the quad
He coughs; suppresses it
've got the head
Come on, little baby, come on, little baby
Be alive, be alive, be alive
Aloka wipes the sweat away again
He looks at her, his voice squeezed out through his teeth
We've got it, we've got it
Yeah
() 53
: He seems as released as Meeta
Then he gives a last gentle tug and a  squeezes out of the little piece of life in his hands
Max is fairly overwhelmed by the life in his hands
Poomina steps close, a smile on her lovely face, and touches the baby in Max's hands
- Max, Joan, Aloka and Hasari walk in silence down Nizamudhin Lane
There is only the mingled  sound of , , and a   nearby playing a popular song
Outside the clinic, they  stop
She takes his hand
For a non-practicing doctor, that was pretty practiced
Never been so scared in my life
It's a warm, open moment between them
But now there's the ongoing desperation of her needs
Max, please, won't you change your mind
We desperately need another doctor
Full-time
Think about it -- just give us a couple of months
Can't do it
Maybe you've got it in you to be a saint
just don't
Then what do you want
What are you going to be when you grow up
Good night, Aloka, Hasari
Joan goes inside, leaving Max, Aloka, and a very uncom- fortable Hasari alone a moment
Thank you for allowing me to go with you
You could make a helluva nurse
little smile comes over her face; no one's ever paid her that kind of compliment
She goes into Ram's hut, leaving Max and Hasari now
() 54
: think perhaps you are a good man
Hasari brings his hands together and goes inside
/
'   ' () - Max hears Joan praying inside
(
) Jesus, my brother, you who  am trying to believe are the light and salvation of the puking world Aloka sits huddled with her husband while their children sleep; they listen
(
) Please see that we are living in madness and darkness here
listens
(
) and we need help
Om, Jesus, om and amen
Suddenly, he hurtles into motion
He runs down the alley, his stride stretching out, swallowing up the distance between here and the world beyond the City of Joy in great gulps
-  - busy, urban airport as opposed to the small country airport in which we saw Max earlier
we hear
(
) Yes, yes, yes, that's right, yes
turned in your ticket
55
- It's a small place; it's sweltering, and it's packed with hundreds of families shoulder to shoulder
Though Betsy's trying to be discreet, it's not a very private place, as we see by the number of people watching Max and Betsy
bought it,  got a refund
But  want to go home with you
You want to go home with me
Yes
Then prove it
Good -- how -- name it
Buy yourself a ticket
would love to do    that, Betsy Ilene, boy would     love to do just that, but 'm    financially embarrassed at the    -- Use your credit cards
What credit cards
You know maxed them before we left
Just lend me -- No
You won't pay me back; you never have
Oh, Max
They're calling our flight want to go home with you, Betsy Ilene Kahn
Because  have a vision
It's
He's trying to woo and charm her
He mimes a kind of house shape
() 56
: see you and me, Betsy Ilene Kahn, nibbling toward each other through a quarter pounder with cheese, chugalugging a frosty light beer -- great taste
Less filling
Bowling
want to go bowling, Besty Ilene Kahn
He fires a strike through the watching crowd
want
Oh, my Lord Amighty, want so many American things -- Oh, stop it
You have no earthly idea what you want, Max
And stop calling me Betsy Ilene Kahn
Isn't that your name
You call me Betsy Ilene Kahn like you just met me yesterday
What should  call you
My girl, my significant other -- Don't get cute
You get cute and swear to God --- you told me once look like my mother
You do -- so what
See -- you don't understand
How could  possibly not understand a conversation as easy as this one, Betsy Ilene
hate you
Na ya don't
() 57
: stood by you for three years
know
supported you through your internship
You did
Why
It was never working
What have  been thinking all these years -- that you'd change
You're the most self-pitying, self-destructive, self
She can't find anything fierce enough, so she abates, tries to get it together to make a dignified exit
But you've taught me something, Max
You never finish anything
Well,  quit
've found my light and 'm free of you
She heads for the gate, people parting to give her a wide berth
- Will you at least call my mother and ask her to empty my savings account and wire -- Do it yourself, Max
Call her collect
You should have called her weeks ago anyway just because she's your mother
(to herself) White light, white light
She hands her ticket and boarding pass over and she's through the gate
Max turns to find the audience fixed on him
() 58
: Guerilla theater, folks
'All the world's a stage
'  Don't know if that word reached you here yet
If you'd care to show your appreciation by a small donation
Many smiles
and several instant offers of rupees beat, then
Aw, what the hell
Swallowing his incredible embarrassment, Max takes the money
-  ( ) The line is long
At this moment, Joan is checking a child's throat with a tongue-depressor
Aloka is walking beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for disposal
Hasari and Ram are getting ready to leave
Anouar appears at Joan's waist
Good morning, Joan Di
Dr
Loeb said many of us could be helped; that all it would take is money for medication
Anouar hands Joan some newspaper in which something is wrapped
Joan opens the paper
Inside is a good deal of money
Please buy the medication for us
If we cannot come here to receive it, perhaps Dr
Loeb would come to us
'll be happy to buy the medication, but Dr
Loeb is not part of this endeavor, Anouar; there is only his cherished memory
Then perhaps  am having visions
Anouar's focus is up the lane
Joan follows his focus to: 59
Max approaches
buzz    about Max's heroics; hands coming together
Max raises a    hand in benediction, makes the sign of the cross
Max    claps Hasari on the shoulder; Hasari brings his hands   together and gives Max a genuinely pleased smile
Children circle and touch him, Manooj and Shambu among   them
Good morning
Good morning
Heckuva morning
Getting ready to practice medicine without a license, Sister Joan
You don't see me soliciting conversions, do you
Well, well, well,  do so love to be surprised
Okay, for starters, pick me out someone with something easy  can heal, make me look good
(to Aloka) Aloka, you're my assistant, let's go
Aloka smiles, she nods, she accepts
Max, knock it off, give us a bit of hush
(as he does) What happened
changed my mind
And 'm a bloody bathing beauty
Okay, so  got left
Smart girl
So how long am stuck with you
Two weeks -- or until Mom sends me a ticket
() 60
: Not worth the aggravation of your prattle every day
Six months -- and not a day less
No way
Six weeks -- and that's my best offer
Two months -- and that's my final offer
(a beat) Done
Jesus and Mary
The Lone Ranger rides again
And now smiles creep onto all their faces as Max goes inside, followed by Joan
and then Aloka -- after she looks at Hasari, gets his nod of encouragement
Too late, Joan says
Watch your -- Thud
Thanks -- got it
The children titter
The teacher, Margareta, admonishes them to pay attention and be polite
as we -- : '  - '  -  ( ) The wheels spinning furiously and then stopping abruptly
Hasari, dripping with sweat, panting
The School Girl comes running toward him
After her, in the b
g
, her Hasari, where have you been
've been waiting almost five minutes
() 61
: 'm sorry, forgive me
It won't happen again
We're not going to school today
You're taking my mother and me to the Bara Bazar
'm getting married
Oh,  am so pleased for you
Panting helplessly, Hasari smiles
as he helps the School Girl's Mother into the rickshaw
Good morning, Hasari
Good morning, missus
Briskly, he takes up the shafts and sets off
Turn right at that corner, Hasari
It's farther that way, missus
No, not really
Turn there, please
Obediently, Hasari turns (as Ramatullah, heading the other way, passes; they wave) and Hasari pulls us
- He helps them out of the rickshaw in front of an expensive-looking bridal shop
You must remember this shop, Hasari, when it's your daughter's time
This is the nicest in the city
The Mother gives the School Girl a withering look and hustles her into the shop
Hasari can just barely hear
() 62
: (
) Don't say things like that
He's never going to be able to buy anything here
He watches from outside, a look of determination coming over his face
Suddenly a pair of fingers takes hold of his ear, twisting his face painfully
Ashoka, with The Goonda and two henchmen, in the b
g
Not working
How will my father eat this evening
was just
You have a daughter
Yes, Babu
(
) Rickshaw wallah
Called to work, Hasari starts for his rickshaw, but Ashoka hangs on to his ear for another uncomfortable moment
as he slips a rupee into Hasari's shirt pocket
Keep working
Give this to Sister Joan and your friend the doctor when you go home
Now he hands Hasari a sealed envelope and turns his ear loose
Hasari springs toward his passenger
- Max with his stethoscope to Meeta's baby
Meeta in a brightly-colored sari and a lot of bracelets and Aloka looks on
Poomina clings to the wall
() 63
: He's just malnourished
Is she giving him the milk we gave her or selling it
Aloka asks Meeta in Hindi
Meeta clearly swears she's giving the baby the milk
Aloka pushes her
Not all
Most
Tell her to give all the milk to the baby
Aloka does so as Max bounces the baby, coos to it play- fully
The baby pees all over him
Aloka translates quickly
Meeta starts apologizing
Poomina can't help laughing
Max reminds Meeta that that's once for each of the two weeks of the baby's life
Aloka soothes Meeta as she hustles her, Poomina, and the baby out, then quickly begins to wipe Max's face with a clean rag
This isn't something she's accustomed to doing, but she's doing it before she has time to think
Max finds himself conscious of her closeness to him
and then she becomes suddenly self-conscious and she backs off, ducks her head
He peeks up under
Psst
She looks at him
It's okay
He smiles
So does she
-  ( ) Sunil stands outside the clinic, rolling his sleeves down
Anouar waits at a polite distance
Exhausted but exhilarated, Max and Aloka emerge with an elderly woman patient, Max singing Chuck Berry to the woman's embar- rassed delight: "They're really rockin' in Boston, in Philadelphia,
" Sunil looks at his American colleague, smiles a small smile
Good night, 'll see you day after tomorrow
Good night, Sunil
() 64
: "
Deep in the heart of Texas, around the Frisco Bay
" Manooj and Shambu come charging at Max with the soccer ball, hoping to engage him as a playmate
Hasari returns home with his rickshaw
Selima waves at Max, indicates she's cooking dinner
Joan wanders out of the school as the kids are released and go charging through the square
Joan has the Pal kids in hand
Very special supper for you tonight, Doctor Big Brother
Will you stay
Wish  could, Selima,  because 'm sure hungry
Sixteen   hours of pestilence and misery  always make me famished
have   to go with my man Anouar tonight
've got lepers to heal
No, no, you know how patient we are
Eat, eat
(to Aloka) You're not tired, are you
Not if you're not
Between Hasari and Aloka, there's just a flicker of tension; evidently, this has become Max's (and her) normal day
But he's also worried about the note from Ashoka
Joan joins them with the Pal children
Well,  think we've got three very good potential scholars here
Behind the children's backs, she points at Manooj and indicates the kid's really got a head
Given him some time here, he'll be good enough for a proper school
It's more than a father could hope
() 65
: Fifteen years from now: Miami, Florida, Dr
Manooj Pal, in association with Dr
Maxwell Loeb
For a moment, Hasari is swept up in this little reverie, then remembers reality
(giving her the note) From the godfather's son
For you and the doctor
Amidst instant concern, Joan opens the envelope
Looks at Max
We hear the sound of
' " " -   - The  is of days gone by, playing on an old
Sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke
The godfather,
, Looking infirm, wipes a tear from his eye
Acha
Now we see   Max and Joan seated on cushions before the godfather,   tea in hand
Max catches a glimpse in an anteroom of   several thugs with several young girls, one of whom is   Poomina
She catches a glimpse of Max as she disappears   past a door
moment later, her head peeks around the   door frame
She brings her hands together
(
) You
Poomina quickly disappears
Max's attention is pulled back to the godfather
understand that you're interested in expanding your clinic and free school, and that you intend to start treating lepers in the City of Joy
We'd like to better serve the entire community, Mr
Ghatak
() 66
: Of course
That's very good
Admirable
And we'd be pleased to rent you suitable space
But you must understand that certain payments will go up
understand the rent would have to go up if we rent larger quarters from you, Mr
Ghatak, but why should we have to pay more protection
More people, more potential trouble
Strangers
If  don't charge you, what will  tell others
But we can't afford it
Surely if you can expand, you can pay more
Joan throws up her hands -- how do you reason with this man
Am  stupid, but isn't this protection money money we're paying you to protect us from you
We live in chaotic times, Miss Bethel, Doctor
control the City of Joy and maintain it as a model of harmony
It's a miracle, but a very fragile miracle
And how are we threatening your miracle
admire your courage in choosing to work in such a violent place, Miss Bethel
() () 67
: (') Your neighbors in the City of Joy, they're not educated, they're given to violence, to meanness, can promise you they won't like having lepers among them, but because they know you're under my protection
He dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next to his right toe
and tries to get to his feet
The Goonda hurries forward to help him
Doctor, do you like our music
Well,  can't say 've developed a craving for it yet
It's difficult to appreciate what we don't understand, isn't it
Let me put it another way: The world is a terrible place
Only the ruthless prevail
My son will make the arrangements with you
One of the thugs helps the godfather outside, where, in the b
g
, we see him listening to his music and pottering in his garden
As Max and Joan turn, Max finds himself face to face with Ashoka, who wears Max's necklace and chai
There's a long pause as the two of them take the other's measure
(to Ashoka) like your taste in neckwear
Joan puts a cautioning hand on Max's arm
Ashoka seems just the slight bit uneasy dealing with Max and so keeps trying to direct himself to Joan
He smokes a long Indian cigarette
The entire package we're proposing will cost you three thousand rupees a month
Joan is taken aback by the sum
If we pay you that, we won't have any money for supplies
() 68
: 'm told you're very resourceful
think  see a solution
May
What if we were to work out a profit-sharing arrangement
We give you a share of our net profit
How do you expect to make a profit off of lepers and the poor, Doctor
Beats the hell outta me, asshole
But you've obviously found a way
The question would seem to be whether Ashoka will have Max killed here or outside the house
His eyes on Max, Ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his hand
and smiles at Max
'  - Joan is furious
Have you gone right off your rocker
These people don't have a sense of humor
Are you trying to get yourself killed
don't think so
but with me, any duplicity is possible
He tickles her; she knocks his hands away; he tickles her again
Stop it, you
you
you nudnick
He doesn't stop, and as she storms off down the street, he stays right on her, tickling away
- It's dark and claustrophobic
The air vibrates with the and  of
About twenty kids sit in a line, back to back, manipulating aseries of lethal and unprotected lathes and polishers
No one can hear his neighbor
69
Hasari, with Shambu in the rickshaw, arrives to take the children home
As he looks inside, he notices
' Not far from Amrita sits a handsome boy (Subash)
He catches Amrita's eyes
Amrita is sweetly embarrassed to find her father staring at her
But he can't help but smile
At the same time he's re- minded moment to moment of his various obligations
- The three kids in the rickshaw
An ambassador car swerves in front of Hasari, forcing him to jam to a stop, jolting the kids
The Goonda sits in the back seat with Ashoka, who carves his fingernails with a switchblade knife
He crooks a finger at Hasari
Hasari leans close and Ashoka takes him by the ear
Who gave you your rickshaw
The Godfather
Who provides the food you eat
The Godfather
Remember:   Loyalty
He gives Hasari's ear a last tug
and the car continues on, leaving Hasari
He looks at his children, ashamed to have been cowed
Manooj fixes his father with a hard look
'  -  -  - Leaning over, listening, taking in the aroma of
70
' Max's cigar
He sits slightly apart from Joan, Sunil, Aloka, Ram, Hasari, Selima, Margareta, Surya, , and Shanta, Aristotle John, , Anouar, and Said
Hasari is stretched out, Aloka rubbing his screaming legs
Throughout the following, their eyes meet and deflect
The Godfather is at least civilized
The son is vicious
Remember the last elections -- the Molotov coctails, the blows with iron bars
They'll throw us out
We won't be able to find anyone else to rent to us
We'll just have to agree to pay what he wants
Saladdin's right
Neither nature nor the people with the power have any conscience
We have to pay
sigh escapes Surya
He shakes his head
Eyes flick at him
What do you say, Doctor Big Brother
think we must try to break the Godfather's hold on us
This is startling and is met with a babble of cautious agreement and dispute
Please, hear me out
But  think we have to be very cautious
How the hell do you proceed with caution against these people
You can't
You have to risk everything
() () 71
: (') You try to negotiate with these people, you make compromises with them, they'll eat you alive
Stand up against them now and they'll fold
guarantee it
Underneath, they're cowards, they got no guts
We show them we're strong and the'll just move on to easier pickings
We
You have an airplane ticket
Still, he's clearly piqued a lot of support
You know, Max, this is not American gangster television
Yes, if you're wrong, you don't have to be here
'm not wrong
You bow your heads, you plead with your Gods to do what you won't do yourselves
You put up with this nightmare as if there were no choice
'm telling you, if you don't stand up to that little pimple face now, he'll own you for the rest of your lives
Everyone stares at him
Many of them want to buy his commitment
There's another large sigh from Surya
Aloka and Hasari's eyes bang off of each other, she silently urging him to speak
He's deeply conflicted and deeply frightened
Even though  am invisible to some of you and  don't have a complete set of legs to stand on,  stand with the Doctor Big Brother
Maybe nature doesn't have a conscience or those with the power, but don't we
Said, the giant mute, mades an unintelligible sound in his throat, but clearly he's agreeing with Anouar
() 72
: agree with Anouar and Max Daddah
think it's worth the chance
Silence
until Aloka and Hasari's meet again and, out of his terrible fear and conflict, he says very shyly
Is it permitted to speak
There are quick nods around the room
With great difficulty, Hasari says his piece
want my children to be educated and cared for; this is our home, we have never had such friends
But many of us owe a great debt to the Godfather
He is strong and could kill us
But we must choose
trust my Big Brother
say we must stand up
There's still dissension, but somewhat more support
Said makes a fierce, unintelligible supportive sound
Surya sighs again
Eyes flick at the old man
Sister Joan, what do you think, really
Well,  think Max has hit on the heart of what we're trying to build here: a self-help society
Each of us has to decide for himself
As for me,  suppose  think, really, that if the bastards are going to suck us dry, 'd like to get in a couple of good left- handers before  turn the other cheek
But who will rent to us
Surya clucks his tongue and shakes his head; everyone assumes he is preparing a heated refutation of the resisters
His sighs, though, have been a building commitment
() 73
: have a property  will    rent you for two hundred rupees a    month, and not a rupee less
As     for protection
you are on    your own
Many of the faces are uncertain -- Hasari's notable among them

- ) Two cows are shooed out of the ramshackle building as bustling activity on the new clinic begins
Cleaning the place
Debris being torn out, hurled into a pile in the street
) Said, with the strength of three men, holds up a heavy beam while Hasari tries to secure it
Max, hot, smelly, and hating the place, stands in the middle of the room, wishing he were elsewhere
The beams starts to slip
Max leaps to Hasari's side
) We see    that Max and Hasari are thrown together again in some    carpentering task in uneasy camaraderie finger    pokes Max on the back
He turns to find Poomina    holding out two cups of tea
) The whole    group shares a meal, prepared under   the direction    of Selima, though the lepers remain   separate from the    normals
Anouar leads the lepers in    singing a song
Joan and Margareta pick it up, as do   several other of    the normals
) Equipment from the old school/clinic being moved from the square down here
) Max and Aloka do one of those dances where two people with arms loaded try to go around each other
Finally he says he'll stand still and she should go around him
They both laugh
Hasari watches

: ) Hasari and Max    move the last cot upstairs and into place beside a    window that will come into play at the end (It looks    down on the street)
Hasari nods to Max, indicating he    should look
) Everyone gathered as Shanta and Ashish put a banner above the door: "You are invited to the festival of this world and your life is blessed
" The assemblage applauds and embraces
) Hasari smiles at Max, brings his hands together, but doesn't embrace the doctor
- Everyone lingers, adults and children
Max plays his trumpet, accompanying Surya on his zither
Manooj hovers over Max
Doctor Big Brother, aren't you going to smoke your evening cigar
Max points at his trumpet, continues playing
Please
Max indicates his pocket
Manooj takes out a cigar and a clip
Clips the cigar, holds it out to Max, who indi- cates Manooj should light it, and keeps playing
Manooj looks at Hasari, who nods
Shambu holds a match to it
Everyone watches as if this were a major event
Manooj takes a puff, chokes, offers the cigar to Mehboub, who takes it, puffs, passes it
Everyone relaxes, enjoys the peacefulness of the smoking and the aroma wafting upward
Ram taps at Max's elbow
It has come to me tonight to write a letter to my wife
Ram produces a mangled one piece letter -- envelope
Please
() 75
: He thrusts the paper at Max
Max takes a pen from his pocket
Okay -- shott
Yes -- what is the word -- that word -- when land is watered
with canals
"Irrigation"
Yes, yes, that word,  want that word in the letter
Max looks at him, nods, waits
Ram stares at Max; waits
Well
Well
What would you like to say to your wife
don't know, Max Daddah
If knew what to say to my wife, 'd never have left home
Everybody laughs, though Ram's remark hits Max on a deeper level
Manooj slides in beside him
Why do you have to go home, Doctor Babu
Because he doesn't live here, Manooj
This is not his home
look between Max and Aloka; Hasari's eyes flicking at both of them
as Aloka's eyes come to Hasari
The cigar reaches Ram
As Max starts to write, Ram takes a large puff and blows a huge ring out of his mouth
We it
76
whole row of faces on rooftops enjoying the cigar
This as we: : -    - the  we see Max come briskly out of the hotel carrying his doctor's bag
He's met by the sight of Hasari between the shafts of his rickshaw and Anouar and Meeta perched on the seat
On no
Lepers
Lepers in my neighborhood
Sshh
Doctor Big Brother, please, we are pretending not to be lepers
Oh, oh,  didn't get the concept -- of course, not lepers
think you're going to fool a lot of people
have only one question: Why are you here
We've come to take you to the dispensary in grand style on this special day, haven't we, Hasari
Yes
Na, 'll just trot alongside Hasari
No, please, get in
Max climbs into the rickshaw beside the two lepers and Hasari pulls away
Meeta's very excited by this ride through Calcutta
You see, she's never been sightseeing before
Meeta, of course, is blind
Max, Hasari, Anouar laugh
You're incorrigible, Anouar
() 77
: Yes, yes,  know, thank you very much
As the rickshaw disappears into the sea of people and vehicles, we hear Anouar and Max
- Margareta, Manooj, Shambu, Shoba, several other kids and, at the end of the line, Poomina, all carrying water on their heads toward the City of Joy
Suddenly, someone whispers to Poomina
One of Ashoka's thugs
She glances after Margareta and the other kids who are turning a corner and steps into: Where Ashoka waits
You taking that to the clinic
(as she nods) You like it there
(as she nods) And they love your smile, don't they
She's fearful now and doesn't respond
He grabs her, the water pitcher crashes to the ground, he puts his knife into her mouth and lays her face open on both side with his knife
- Aloka comes  us leading a group of lepers
And stops
Her hand goes to her mouth
-  - Two hundred normal people lined up outside the gaily be- decked dispensary -- many mothers with small children in their arms
Shanta sees Aloka, gestures to indicate the incredible turn-out
The normals at the end of the line turn to look at the approaching
It is too beautiful to believe
() 78
: As if indeed she were right, their path is suddenly cut off by the Goonda and a commando of thugs, armed with sticks and iron bars, backed up by a group carrying banners with slogans proclaiming in Hindi, Urdu, English: "We Don't Want Lepers Here
" There's a sudden uneasy silence
Behind the thugs a short distance is the policeman who harassed Max earlier and another cop
Joan hurries forward
Good morning, Sister to the poor
Yes, Mr
Bhose
Those people aren't coming into this neighborhood
They are going to be treated at the dispensary
You have no right to stop them
Hasari arrives with Max, Anouar, and Meeta
Go ahead, Aloka, take them inside
The Goonda puts his hand on Aloka
The policeman in the b
g
keep their distance
Take your hands off her, you waster
Joan is seized by a sudden fury and grabs the Goonda
He grabs her much harder
Said growls and pushes forward
Several thugs turn, step in to neutralize him
Joan elbows the Goonda and tires to westle free of him
As a reflex he raises his hand
And as he does, it's seized
Max (with Hasari in the b
g
, confused, conficted)
Max slings the Goonda against the side of a truck
That was a mistake, Doctor
() 79
: The mistake's yours, putz
(to Aloka) Get these people inside
Aloka starts forward, leading the lepers
She's stopped by a sudden blow from the Goonda's stick across her shoulders, knocking her to the ground, bleeding from the neck
Hasari bolts for his wife, gets caught up in the melee
Max swings   around on the Goonda and for the first time we realize how   strong he is, and that he knows how to box
The Goonda   goes down and violence erupts
Anouar is chopping at   the legs of one of the thugs working on Said
The massive   Said tears free and starts to beat the crap out of the   two thugs holding him
The noise brings everyone out of the square, those lined up at the clinic, the children from the school
Sunil comes flying out of the clinic
stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and those normally in the crowded alley ensues
Shanta runs inside for help
Shopkeepers barricade their shop windows
One of the thugs pours gasoline over Anouar and  lights a match
Hasari kneels beside Aloka when he sees   the match ignite the tiny leper
Without thinking,   Hasari hurls himself on top of Anouar, rolling him in  the dirt and against his own body to put out the flames
Joan shouts, demanding the violence stop
She's hit from behind; she decides talk isn't going to do it
She grabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight
An  in the doorway, scattering anyone who remains in the area of the dispensary doorway, badly wounding Mehboub
More people with sticks
Hasari goes down under    several bodies
Max reaches Aloka, helps her up, sends    her toward the clinic
He tears an attacker off of Hasari    and they fight back to back a moment
near them
and through the smoke Max sees
80
Ashoka astride his motorcycle, behind his dark glasses, with more thugs, these with Molotov cocktails and pick- axes, ready to raze the clinic and school and the surrounding neighborhood
Sunil drags Mehboub inside
People chant: "White Monkeys, go home
White Monkeys, go home
No lepers here
No lepers here
" The thugs cock their iron bars and bricks and Molotov cocktails
Max picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for Ashoka
Suddenly, there's a  followed by a of air so fierce, Max is thrown to the ground
bottle of  has  just behind him
He's enveloped in smoke
An assailant bears down on Joan with a cutlass
As the assailant is about to strike, Hasari seizes the attacker and hurls him backward
Ashish steps in and slashes the assailant with his own weapon, startling, even repelling Hasari
From all over   the lane, young fighters have come and joined the fray, not   bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying the release
Hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a boy, arriving   too late to stop the boy from plunging his knife into the   woman's belly
Hasari fights his way to the woman, but   she staggers into the mob
Max knocks down one of the thugs only to have  another hand grasp his shoulder
He turns, fist cocked to   find Poomina, her hands holding her face together
Slowly,   she takes hands away
The sides of her face have been   laid open
Max sweeps her up in his arms, heads for the  clinic
Oh, little girl, little girl
Joan is suddenly beside Ashoka
We'll pay
All right then, so by all means, protect us
Ashoka raises a hand,   The Goonda blows a whistle, and the fighting stops as   suddenly as it began
The com- batants are breathing   heavily
There is silence but for the groans and cries   of the wounded and grieving
In a world such as ours, everyone needs protection
For the fee we discussed, from this day forward, can assure you nothing like this will happen again
() 81
: beat
Saladdin is at Joan's shoulder
Ashoka points a finger at Hasari
You
warned you about the company you keep
He  his  and  away, leaving Hasari staring after him in his dust
- People peer in through every opening
Mehboub's chest is bandaged
Sunil squeezes through the packed courtyard and hallway, Ashish carrying a wounded woman behind him
Hasari steps into a doorway, us  him
- , , Max, blood crusted on her face, sutures Poomina's awful facial wound as Aloka prepares a compress
Will she
Her face, will it
If she's very careful and doesn't do anything to open the wound, the scarring will be minimal
(to Poomina) Do you understand
You can't
You have to stay here
(to Joan) You make her stay here
'll try
Don't goddamn try, Joan
Goddamn do it
Poomina peers through her pain at Max, his hands putting her back together
(a litany) hate this place,  hate this place,  hate this place
Max looks at the doorway and he locks eyes with Hasari
Max breaks the contact
Hasari stares at him as we hear the godfather's  on the
82
'  -    - hand tap, tap, taps against a ledger
Ashoka sits behind a little table, picking absently at his face
The Goonda is slouched near the table, smoking a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch
(It's dif- ficult for him to show Ashoka the respect his inherited position gives him
) The Goonda has a bruise under one eye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday
The air is filled with the    the
here, we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather in his "throne room," wrapped in a cashmere, listening to the radio
Ashoka looks up, stares impassively at someone
Well
What have you got to say
For the first time, we see who Ashoka's speaking to
told them that your father provides us with a great deal and that -- Ashoka slams his hand on the register
From this minute, you   are off the list
You will leave    your rickshaw here
where it will   be reserved for a man who deserves   our trust
He stands up
Hasari is near tears
Please, Babu, this is as if the ground has opened up
have to speak to Mr
Ghatak
Hasari starts for the house
The Goonda stops him and, quickly, has Hasari on his knees, his arm twisted pain- fully behind his back
Ashoka jumps at Hasari, grabs his ear
My father's ill
You are speaking to me
() 83
: have a family
The decision is made
have made it
Now get out before  have Mr
Bhose break your legs
He gives Hasari's ear a vicious twist and slams his head against the table
'  - The side gate opens and Hasari is shoved   out
Stumbling, he runs to the fence, peers through
Two    men are pulling his rickshaw into the courtyard
Hasari    watches as a steel shutter is pulled down, cutting his   livelihood from sight
- Numb, compromised, defeated
Perhaps the low point of his life
- '  - "  " - Flickering candlelight illuminates the "Raft of Medusa
" Max rails at Joan
just don't
don't want to
don't want to care
don't want to care this much
just don't want to be invested in you people
In people
became a goddamn doctor because my goddamn father wanted me to be a goddamn doctor because he was a goddamn doctor
He was the goddamn king of doctors
It's too goddamn hard
Out of breath, out of words, Joan reaches out and takes Max to her, brings him beside her on the cot
Beneath the "Raft of Medusa," she sits with an arm around Max, as if he were her son
Not everyone's cut out for this
You did the best you could
Better than many
It's all right
() 84
: didn't do the best  could did what  always do
shot my big mouth off and did a half-assed job
And what  want to do now is want to go back to America and make money and live a life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on me
(a beat) You know, the fact is from the minute we're born we're shipwrecked
Some see that as a lifetime of drowning, of fear, others only to endure, but to triumph
It's all in the individual spirit, isn't it
Got it: To run, to spectate, to commit
(raises his hand) Running spectator
Then, by all means, go home, Max, and go with my blessing and my eternal friendship
The candlelight flickers against them as they sit side by side
Neither speaks
'  -   - At the tea shop, a group relive the day's events
The children sleep
Aloka sits outside, worried about Hasari
Max comes out, meets Aloka's eyes and looks away
She's heard the conversation
Hasari, drunk, comes down the slope
Face to face with Max
They took away my rickshaw
Aloka's hand flies to her mouth
Hasari peers at Max with his drunken gaze
It's a terrible moment for Max, but
() 85
: So what do you want me to do about it -- get it back for you
Max takes away a step
Stops
'm sorry
'm going home
Because this isn't my fight got one person to look after -- me
Hasari stares at Max
On the roof, the children listen
At the tea shop, the late-night talkers listen
All right, 'm running out,   okay
Because 'm a coward, this   is me, this is what  do,  get in   over my head,  let people down,    run
But  trusted you
Well, that was your goddamn mistake
Max walks away, leaving Hasari desolate
Aloka comes to him
don't know how 'm going to pay the rent, how we're going to eat
We have what is saved for Amrita's dowry
The thought of using the dowry is yet another awful blow to Hasari's hopes
The children must leave the school; they'll have to work
And you will not have anything to do with the clinic or those people anymore
Ram joins them
What  earn is yours, too
() 86
: You can't support all of us
You have a family in your village, too
Hasari touches his friend and goes into: ' Alone in his pain, he spots his tea caddy in which he planted his seeds over a month ago
He bends over to tenderly touch the growing shoot and water the earth
He looks up and the three children are staring at him
What will their father do now to keep them alive
-   '  - The needle injected, Hasari's blood flowing into a bottle
Hasari seated on the stool, watching his blood leave his body, his face again broken out in perspiration
- Waiting
- His face immobile, his thoughts distant
The Attendant starts to pull the needle out
Hasari stops his hand
Take more
The Attendant shakes his head
Take more
The Attendant looks at Rafik, who shrugs, nods
and allows the blood to flow on out of Hasari's body
- Barely ambulatory, Hasari starts down the street, but has to stop, lean against a wall
Through his woozy haze, he thinks he sees an apparition
87
There, in the entrance to a building, is Gangooly
Seeing a potential victim, he swoops in
Not well, brother
Still stealing from refugees
Gangooly looks at Hasari, recognizes him, and gives him an amazing smile
Well, yes,  remember you, of course -- hello
am delighted to see you -- yes
And tell me immediately, please -- your little family, your beautiful children, everyone eats, yes
Come, have a cup of tea or a little something stronger, we must celebrate
Gangooly starts to move, to position himself for a get- away
Hasari blocks his egress, unsmiling
Ah, well, you're angry    at me, yes, wondered if that was    still on your mind --  am full    of regret about that, yes, even    a little tormented
What can      say
have the spirit of an eagle    trapped in the body of a crow
'm touched
My friend,  am lame and  am poor
Does that mean that  shouldn't survive
Huh
When a man is struggling in a rough sea, he clutches onto what he can or he drowns
You don't look so well
lost my rickshaw
Gangooly gives Hasari an appraising look for a moment, then
() 88
: Ach
have an offer
No, listen
Shiva be my witness, you must at least think about this
Please,  can help
Or my name is not Mr
Gangooly
Which, fortunately, it is
-   - Gangooly guiding Hasari onward
Remove the children from the school -- no, why
When you, the father, can make a small sacrifice
Nature has foreseen your plight
For she has given you two eyes, yes, and two kidneys
But
To live, you have need of one only
have a friend who sold his kidney -- this one -- and now -- believe me, this is the truth -- he lives in a brick home
which he owns
That smile
( &
) - - forbidding face appears at the grill, stares out
- Hasari and Gangooly enter
repulsive smell almost makes Hasari gag
Gangooly takes Hasari's arm and steers him through the gloom
Hasari discovers the origin of the smell
line of skeletons arranged along the walls
Tables stacked with bones: skulls, spines, rib cages, hands and feet
Each skeleton sports a label with a price in dollars
Crouched among the bones and packing crates are men work- ing
Some smoke, some have masks over their faces
They scrape and clean and decorticate
They skillfully assemble their grisly creations, emotionless but like artists
89
- '  - a dusty, glass, interior window, we see, almost in mime, the manager examining Hasari
' With a smile, the manager produces some papers
Hasari shakes his head, starts for the door
Gangooly stops him
Of course, take some time, think about it
People all over the world, anxiously waiting, willing to pay
15,000 rupees for a kidney
25,000 for an eye
Gangooly winks, peers at Hasari with a single eye, and smiles
/
-    - Heat haze on the road
As we , we  Max, Joan, Aloka, also with their thoughts
Joan gazes out the window of the taxi
Max looks at the back of Joan's head a moment, then looks at Aloka, who sits between them
She deflects his eyes forward
Hasari has forbid her to have anything more to do with us
He'd be very angry if he knew she was seeing you off
Max looks at Joan
Looks out the window
-   -   - First we see joyous people greeting arriving passengers; parents greet a young man returning from college abroad
The way clears and we    Max, Joan, and Aloka, a tiny island in this sea of people at the moment of their parting
Max empties all the money out of his pockets
This is for Poomina
When  get home
He thrusts the money on Joan and Max offers his hand; she goes through the hand to embrace Max
Then Max and Aloka look at each other
() 90
: You did good things
(chokes up, but manages) Thank you for coming to our country
And now Max heads out the door
-    - Sparsely populated
They sit in isolation at a table over a cup of tea
It's not like  he's royalty or anything, so  'm not persuaded we have to wait  for the plane to actually take  off
No
We should go
Yet, they   remain another moment
then get up
Joan puts her   arm around Aloka and they turn to go
The looks on their   faces suggest they've come face to face with something   startling
Max
Standing inside the departure doorway
What were those three choices again
Their faces
And his with just a wistful version of his old grin
and we -- : - Hasari returns
Goes into Ram's hut
'  - He finds his family
and Max
The two men stare at each other
() 91
: need Aloka at the clinic
(as Hasari stares) All right, they, the patients, need her
She's a good nurse
(as Hasari stares) Come on, man, this is between you and me
Why take the kids out of school, why punish your wife
Hasari holds his anger in; he moves to a mat and lies down, his back to Max
But Max doesn't go
have a little money,  can get it from the States
It's not a question of money
We'll survive on our own
That's it
Hasari lies with his back to Max
After some moments of silence, Aloka indicates Max should go
And he does
After another moment
Maybe he's right
The clinic is for everyone and if  am needed -- Hasari bolts up, a look of anger on his face we've never seen
No
'm your husband and you'll do as  say
Unless, of course, you've become an American wife and then you'll do as you please
Stay away from them
They are not part of us
They will only be good to you as long as you please them
The children, Aloka are frozen, she very close to tears
Hasari lies back down, again turns his back on them
() - The small colony alive; a line of patients outside a door
92
- Max unwraps a bandage from a leper's partial limb
Looks around for Aloka
She's not there
Said is acting as his nurse
Points at his instruments
Hand me the scissors, please
Helpfully Said hands him the tweezers
Scissors, scissors
He demonstrates
Said fumbles through the instruments, picking up the scissors by the ends
Not that end -- No, that's fine, thanks, 've got it
- Max comes out with his last patient
Anouar waits
Max Daddah, you are finished
(Max nods) Follow me
Anouar takes off down the lane and disappears quickly into a little building, Max following
- Max follows Anouar past bubbling cauldrons and heaps of animal skins
The place stinks fiercely
Anouar and Max exit into
Two young men (the two pullers Chomotkar and Ramatullah) and something covered with a tarp
You didn't steal this
The police, Sahib, they stole it
We stole it from them
() 93
: The pullers whip the tarp off
battered rickshaw, the springs poking out of the seat, the broken wheels lying in the body, the finish scarred and gouged, one shaft broken
How much
- Max comes into the square
Aloka and Selima are pre- paring meals
Manooj, Shambu, and three other boys playing
Ram is trying to jolly Hasari, who's deep in his own reverie
Max stands in front of Hasari
'd like to show you something
Just take a minute
beat as Hasari fixes Max with an empty stare and the family waits to see if Hasari will respond
Go ahead
Go on
- The sound of a  being
Light flashes
Max and Hasari appear in the doorway
Surprised by the light, a few rats scurry off
Some- where a dog
Slated, shafted light
He indicates a corner
Piled up in its ruin
'm good with my hands
You're good with yours
What do you say
Hasari looks at Max, part resentful, part touched
If  were to go on the street with this machine,  would end up in a gutter with my throat cut
() 94
: Well, it's yours if you want it
You know the license, the cops, all that can be fixed
You'll own this -- it'll have nothing to do with the Godfather
Doctor Daddah, 'm just a small man
Don't try to tempt me again with big thoughts
Hasari starts to leave
Max blocks his way
You didn't want me to quit
Well, came back
But can you be trusted
hope so
Hasari can see the hope and desire in Max's face
After a moment, Max steps aside
Hasari bends his head and makes off
Leaving Max and a small sigh of disappointment
-  -  -  () She takes her morning absolutions, bathing in the foun- tain
The process is extremely sensual, though there is not even a glimpse of her nakedness as she moves her clothing around, cleansing this area, then that
She glances up to see
Max, in an Indian shirt, heading for the square; rather naturally, he brings his hands together in the Indian salutation
He carries several bottles of distilled water, a large value pack of bar soap, and a carton of medical supplies
As he passes, his eyes hook on Aloka's
He lifts a hand in greeting
After a moment, she ducks her head
He turns and continues on coming face to face with Ram, an enormous smile on his face
With him, Hasari
He glances at his wife in the water
(to Hasari) Going to look for work
() 95
: When Hasari doesn't answer
Yes, he is
Ram has a small coughing fit
Are you taking your medicine
Yes, yes, but look at this
He points at the wheel  of his rickshaw; the rim is cracked
Scornfully,   Hasari walks on
Max and Ram glance after him
Max   digs out several rupees
Ram takes them and goes
Max looks after the two men as they disappear
When   he turns
he finds himself face to face with Aloka
Without a word, they start walking side by side toward the square
It's several seconds before she says
He's very proud
They walk on in silence -- two friends, separated by a gulf
-    - Men moving like ants into the bow of the ship
Hasari is locked out, turned away without work
- huge gouge in the black mud, sunlight streaming through steel girders across it
Hasari emerges from the ground, looking for someone
Stops him
The foreman shakes his head, no, before Hasari even has the chance to ask for work
-   - ' - Then we see he's standing outside Mitra & Co
, staring at it, wondering if it's time to sell part of himself
No
We see on his face a look that tells us he will not be beaten
96
-  - The street children's school now takes up two rooms
Children peer out of one room now as, to the accompani- ment of Surya's zither, twenty or so girls are doing some Indian classical dancing, under the eye of a young Indian teacher
Across the way, in the other room, some children are translating Bengali words into English
boy is writing on the board
It's Manooj
We see that Shambu is in the same class
, we watch Max take a wrapping off of Poomina's wound, Joan assisting him
Indeed, Ashoka extended Poomina's smile on either side of her mouth
The scars are healing as nicely as could be expected
Max did a fine job
You must have had a good doctor
Still no running, jumping, picking up anything heavy
And you stay here
You're going to help Sister Joan and you're going to school
Do you understand
beat, Poomina nods
But now a look of abject fear comes over her face
The Goonda stands in the doorway
Max begins singing "Sweet Little Sixteen
" The Goodna stares impassively at Max
Time to collect the rent, Sister
Of course
Come with me, please
Joan leaves, followed by The Goonda
Max works care- fully at the fine line of scabbing on Poomina's scar
but then something takes his attention
Manooj, with a small tin of food, looks this way and that
and then sneaks into the shed
- We hear a, , ,
The door is half open
The padlock is hanging on its chain
Max opens the door
97
Startled, frightened, Hasari presses himself against the wall, as does Manooj
Hasari is wearing a wet dhoti, caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of the old rickshaw
Close the door
Max is very surprised but, needless to say, pleased
He looks at the rickshaw, looks at Hasari
Close the door
The Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple
Max quickly closes the door
The half light is broken by thin beams of light that dance with dust
Hasari studies Max a moment, then moves to put the first wheel on
Instinctively, Manooj moves to his side, takes hold of the rickshaw so Hasari can slip the wheel on
Hasari nods and goes for the other wheel
Manooj moves around to the other side, hefts the carcass
Hasari slips on the second wheel
Hasari looks at Max
Max brings his hands together and starts to go
was saying to Manooj that if a man bows down too many times, there will come a day when he will no longer be able to stand upright
The two men look at each other
and then Hasari gets on with his work
promised Manooj and Shambu 'd take them to the movies
Is it all right
(a beat) If a man makes a promise
Max brins his hands together and starts for the door
Hasari picks up one of the worn seat boards
- We're   a moving bag of peanuts behind a row of boy's heads
On the screen in front of them, a "medi- eval era" sword battle between the great Kumar Kapur and a legion of bad guys
() 98
: We hear the sound of   as we   Manooj to three kids we've seen in the neighborhood (two boys Manooj's age and Shoba, who's Shambu's age) and then to Shambu, each kid dipping into the bag in his turn
Finally: Max's (and on the other side of him, Amrita and Poomina
) The bag arrives
empty
(whispering) Thanks, guys
Who wants to go for more peanuts
No one
We're talking about rapt attention
We hear Max smiles
-     - Max and the boys walking home after the movie, the boys dancing around each other, acting out the fight sequences, all of the sword-fighting against Max, who battles them all over the street, in and around cars, Poomina and Amrita looking on shyly, as El Max fights to save their honor
can't decide if  want to be Kumar Kapur or a doctor
Ha ha
You can be both
Manooj Pal, swashbuckling physician
You're so much fun, El Max wish my daddy were as much fun as you
Max stops the fight, takes Manooj by the shoulders
wish my father loved me like your father loves you
Your dad's a very special man
And now, en garde
As the battle continues, the bright beams of a truck come at them
Time out, men
Off the street till this truck passes
() 99
: The kids move toward the wall of the building they're passing, but the truck seems to turn toward them, seem- ing not to intend to pass, but to hit them
The look on Max's face lets us know he senses something terrible is in the offing here
He shouts for the kids to get out of the way, shoving the kids closest to him into a doorway
He turns to Shambu, who's behind him, calls to him
But in a panic, Shambu doesn't move into the shelter   of the building on his right
but tries to run across   the street
Max leaps for the little boy too late
as    the truck just misses Max and clips Shambu hard, sending   the little boy flying
- Manooj runs   ahead of everyone as he charges into Ram's hut, crying   for his father
Behind Manooj come the others, Max   carrying Shambu in his arms
Hasari and Aloka, Ram,   Joan, others in the square hurtle out of their huts
can't do anything here
He's got a compound fracture, he hemorrhaging
We've got to get to a hospital -- now
You'll never get a taxi at this hour
- '  -  ( ) He pounds along,  the wheels wobbling and squeaking, urging people out  of his way
Max runs alongside Hasari
Aloka sits on the  seat with Shambu, whose quiet moaning fills her ears
Blood drips down the rickshaw
-    - Several taxis waiting for clients outside a row of restaurants
Hasari and Aloka watch as Max argues with the drivers
They won't take a bleeding passenger
- The race to the hospital continues
100
- The arrive at the gates of the huge, Victorian hospital
People sleep outside the gates
-  -   - The wards are full, as are the corridors
Patients on beds and stretchers everywhere
Most have at least one member of their family to look over them
In a side room, Max is arguing with a porter who tells him he can't help him
Max slaps some rupees into the porter's hand, tells him to take him to the person in charge
Shambu is fading
Aloka smooths the sweat from his brow, trying to keep Shambu alive by force of will and love
Then Max is back, standing over her with another man
It may take a moment before we recognize the  from the Blood Bank
They'll admit him, but we have to pay for the blood
gave him all had
He wants more
Do you have anything
Sister Joan gave me this
Aloka holds out a fistful of rupees
The Attendant blows through his lips, indicating it's a paltry sum
Max grabs the money and shoves it at the Attendant
We haven't got any more
The Attendant doesn't move
until he sees Max is about to explode
If this child dies while you stand here, 'll kill you
The Attendant is smart enough not to push any further
Now,  need an -ray room and need an
nurse
Not possible
You can't give care, you're an American
You must be an Indian doctor
() 101
: Then take me to one
As Max takes flight with the Attendant, Aloka strokes Shambu and Hasari hovers
We    Shambu's inanimate face and  a moment
Max hurtles down the corridor with a young  in tow
Almost a kid, he's been up for days
But he's going to help
This way, please
Max scoops Shambu up and rushes down the corridor behind the Intern, leaving Hasari and Aloka looking after him
His arm comes around her shoulders
-  () Hasari and Aloka wait
People are starting to move about
You're my wife, Aloka, you and my children are all my wealth
But if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan have need of you, you may go to them
Max comes out of the hospital
The two Pals stare at him
We pinned his leg
Couple of months, he'll be better than ever
They want to keep him today
We're a good team
Gimme five
He smiles, holds out a palm for them to slap
They look at the palm, unsure what this means
Yet, each takes Max's hand
-  - The whole community is here, around the tree
() 102
: don't think it was an accident
think they were aiming for Max
So, what we have to ask ourselves is whether his presence is endangering all of us
Even from my low vantage point, know this: It's the son
He's mad
Max Daddah is our friend
If they're trying to harm him, then they're trying to harm all of us
We must stand by him as one
-     - dip into a little box of paints
The boys look on as the two men paint an intricate design on the shafts
Shambu sits in the rickshaw seat
He wears an ankle to hip cast
Manooj is spelling words and urging Shambu to follow suit
Aloka is putting out a tray of food
Ram, Ramatullah, and Chomotkar slip in, quickly close the door
The two pullers focus on the rickshaw, Ram on Max
Doctor Daddah, please, very important, only one moment
This is going to cost me every rupee  didn't make today
Ram thrusts an envelope into Max's hand
letter from your wife
Ram nods nervously
Max looks at the postmark as he slices it open with a finger
This is postmarked six weeks ago
So
() 103
: So, what have you been doing -- incubating it
was afraid
Ram waits, his hands twisting each other
'My dear husband
' Oh that's very hopeful so far
'Your words brought tears of joy to my arid eyes
' Oh, 'm in love
My words brought tears to her arid eyes
(then fearful) What does that mean -- arid
Manooj throws his hand up
know
Dry
Correct
Her eyes were dry, your letter irrigated them
Aaah
He snatches the letter, crushes it to his heart
Notices the finish work on the rickshaw
This is a puka nasgar
What a curse that you can't use it
'm going on the streets tomorrow
This gets everyone's attention
The pullers shake their heads, they're worried for him
Listen
don't want you to think 'm crazy, but  don't think that truck was an accident
() () 104
: ') think Ashoka was after me
You can bet he'll be after you too
'm going to speak to his father
Can  go with you
'll go with you
Can  go with you if  shut up
beat
and Hasari gives him a small nod
'  - Ghatak is literally carried out of the house by an orderly and placed into his car
There's a driver and there is the Goonda
They start down the street
We're  the car
Suddenly, the driver slams on the brakes and from: We see Hasari and Max blocking the street with the new rickshaw
The Goonda jumps out of the car, comes threateningly at Hasari
Babu, please,  beg you, hear my words
As the Goonda is about to land on Hasari we hear a feeble
Wait
The Goonda backs off
The Godfather waves Hasari and Max close
Hasari brings his gleaming rickshaw to the window of the car, Max at his shoulder
May  say first, Babu,  wish you long life and good health
Acha
They take me now to the scientists
They stick needles in me, take pictures of my insides, study them, and then tell me what know
() 105
: The Godfather stares at Hasari, flicks his eyes at Max
Waits
When you gave me work,  swore would be as your youngest brother
Your son thinks  have been disloyal
He took my rickshaw
With my friend,  have remade this one
beg you to let me go again onto the streets
have my family
The old man looks at the rickshaw, at the obvious care that went into its renovation, at this unlikely team of refurbishers
He reaches a shaking  hand out toward a shaft
Hasari brings it close
The   old man rubs the shaft
It is very beautiful
Thank you, Babu
If  may say, it has an allure
An allure, Babu -- thank you
The Godfather stares at Hasari, then at Max
The world is chaos
We struggle to build something permanent, then our bodies betray us, our sons betray us
(to Hasari now) Yes, you may take your rickshaw out
If you can face up to my son
The Goonda gets back into the car and the car pulls away and we are left with Hasari and Max as moment
( & ) - Hasari enters
'  - The manager stares at Hasari, as he consumes a pot of rice and vegetable curry
Gangooly hovers like a crow
Hasari stares at the contract before him
() 106
: If a man dies and he's not burned, what do you think becomes of his soul
The manager turns his palms up, continues chewing
Hasari stares through the window at the row of skeletons
must provide for my family
Oh, it's a noble fate
If indeed your wheel ceases to turn, you will help educate somewhere in this great world a fine doctor
Hasari bends to the contract and laboriously signs his name
'  - Hasari arrives to an outcry of anger
There are several dozen rickshaws
Among the passersby, we see umbrellas, as the people on the street try to combat the incredible heat
What's going on
The Godfather ill
The son is raising the rent
Ashoka is on his front steps with a loudspeaker before a growing crowd of pullers
He's backed up by the Goonda and a dozen of his thugs
The loudspeaker lifts Ashoka's voice above the anger
Do you know how much it costs to change the spoke in a wheel
Or how much baksheesh  have to pay the police
Impulsively, Hasari moves forward
Cries from pullers: "Who will be the victims of this madness
You
" "Hell no
" "You don't need the six rupees each old crate brings you per day to fill your belly
For us, it means death
" The street is so packed with rickshaw and pullers now that cars can't get through
chorus of  ; drivers scream
() 107
: We haven't been breaking our backs between the shafts of our rickshaws in order to weep for you
Hasari continues forward, his eyes on Ashoka
The only thing that matters is the bundle of rupees we take to the munshi each month to feed and to answer the daily needs of our children
steps up on a telagarhi with a loudspeaker
Listn to me
Listen now
Listen to me
(when the pullers quiet) Friends
ask you to vote for an unlimited strike
Inkalabad zindabad
Long live the revolution
Rickshaw Workers Union zindabad
strike
No income at all
The slogan is taken up by a small percentage of the assemblage
Fear and doubt on many faces
That's what  thought
All right, get to work
Customers are waiting
Something detonates in him and he jumps onto the tela- garhi and grabs the microphone from Ashoka
Police arrive in vans
Friends
The Godfather at least is a caring man
This one, though, the son -- signal from Ashoka and one of the thugs knocks Hasari down
() 108
: We helped this man
We gave  him a job, a place to live
This  is how he shows his gratitude
Get on the streets now
Or turn  in your machines
Hasari gets up and tries to speak
Friends -- don't
If we stand -- He gets hit again
number of the pullers come forward and a riot starts
The police move in, beat and arrest many of the demonstrators
Ramatullah and Chomotkar try to help Hasari, but they are descended on by cops who hurl them aside and beat Hasari senseless until the: : - Birds flying  below ceiling
The room has a barred cage running all  around its edge; the cage is filled to near overflowing
Hasari stands before the , his face covered with  blood, his body a mass of aches and welts
At the back  of the room, Max and Aloka; elsewhere, Ashoka, the  Goonda, and several of his thugs
The life of a rickshaw puller is not one a man would choose if he had a choice
Our feet blister and burn up from the boiling asphalt, our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor cars and buses, our backs curve permanently from the loads we carry hour after hour, day after day
But  am proud to be one of the human horses who carry my countryman from place to place and  am thankful for the opportunity to make a living
But will not keep silent anymore and will not be cheated and threatened anymore
Life is hard enough
No more
Ramatullah starts to applaud
Rassoul follows suit
The Judge bangs his gavel
() 109
: Silence
(when it's silent) This man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let or hindrance
And  will make a restraining order against Mr
Ghatak
Cheers from the pullers
The Judge bangs his gavel
haven't finished these proceedings
For his part in this disturbance,  fine the defendant 50 rupees
Fifty rupees, Your Honor
That's -- Pay at this time or spend seven days in jail
Seven days in jail will cost him far more than fifty rupees
As he reaches into his pocket for his screw of money, a hand suddenly protrudes into the cage through the bars
Hasari
And now another hand with several rupees reaches through
Hasari
Now a dozen voices call his name and a  dozen hands reach through the bars with rupees clutched  in their fists and press the money into Hasari's hands
The Judge, Max and Aloka, and certainly Ashoka watch this  in amazement
The Judge bangs his gavel
Max turns, shoots a little finger gun and winks at Ashoka
his face, we see pure hatred for these two men
110
- Amrita, Manooj, and Shambu
With them, Subash flirting with Amrita, incurring the wrath and admiration of her brothers, causing her to flush
sounds
They all look up
Rain starts to fall
People run outside of workshops and huts, crying, "The rains, the rains
" Suddenly, a  shakes the earth and rain begins to bombard them
The rain falls, the  , and people in the lane are dancing, praising the beginning of the monsoon season
Men tear off their shirts, women rush out fully clothed, singing
Swarms of naked children run about
The kids run toward the clinic/school
- Hasari is locking his rickshaw into the shed
Staff and several patients come out of the examining rooms -- Joan, Aloka, Sunil, Anouar, Poomina
Margareta and her students, a new teacher, Bandona, her students come out of the classrooms
They're all swept up in dancing, Joan's metal cross jumping about as if it were beating out time
From his balcony, Max emerges with his trumpet and plays the first bars of "Singin' In the Rain
" Everyone looks his way; he begins to hum and sing as he jumps over the balcony to the ground and takes off in a wild, impro- vished, but damn good version of Gene Kelly's dance in the rain, bringing Anouar on his cart in as his dancing partner
Everyone in the courtyard crowds around them, laughing and encouraging the dancer/singers on
The number builds to an extraordinary climax with Max sliding through mud to an exquisite finish at Joan's feet
There's thunderous applause
- Rain
Max, The Pals, Ram, Joan, Anouar, Meeta and the Baby, Poomina, Saladdin, Mehboub, Ashish, Shanta, Margareta, Bandona, and the other members of the commit- tee sharing a meal
Really -- a boyfriend, Amrita
No
Amrita whacks Manooj
() 111
: Yes, she does
His name is Subash Ghosh
His father owns the workshop
Is there someone you care about
The look in Amrita's eyes tells us indeed there is
Hasari smiles at Amrita and then at Aloka
Then  must speak to his father and  must complete your dowry
Amrita squeezes close to her mother
This is serious and joyous
You will make people sigh at how beautiful you are
And  shall drop tears of joy
At my wedding  became so frightened, my father gave me things to drink to calm me down
went out to piss and fell asleep under the village tree
When woke  thought it was the tree 'd married
still love that tree
The laugh
But Hasari's attention is on his daughter
He reaches a loving hand to her
- '  -   - rag has been wrapped around the faucet and water runs slowly and silently down into the nearly filled tub
The scene is illuminated dimly by a flashlight with fingers over the beam
He sleeps
Suddenly he's grabbed, his eyes spring open in fear
Hands yanks him out of bed, slam him up against the wall, then hurtle him across the room and into: Where the tub has been filled
His head is slammed down underwater and he's held there struggling
() 112
: His head is yanked up and through bleary eyes he sees a knife at his throat and the Hewbrew letter chai dangling from the knife - wielder's neck, illuminated by a flashlight
Go home, Doctor
Before he can respond, he's slammed down into the tub of water again and held there until it seems his lungs will explode
Then he's dumped backward, gasping for breath
-  - Max on the run through the rain, carrying his belongings
He pounds through the puddles, past a sleepy old watchman, and through the gate
- He bangs on Joan's door
She opens the door in her Indian pajamas
One look at him
What's happened
Ashoka ordered me to go home
Well, 've come home
beat
She steps aside, he steps in, and the door closes him safely inside
- The rickshaw station
The  rain pours down
People clambor for rickshaws
The  line moves forward as fast as the pullers can take on passengers
Hasari, Ram, Ramatullah, Chomotkar look at the stalled buses, the streetcars, the taxis, the private cars
What a joy it is to survey this disaster
We will all make a fortune
() 113
: The monsoon is the great Durga's gift to the human horse
Hasari glances at Ram, who isn't a part of the joking
What's the matter
'm wet and 'm cold
Your daughter is getting married
Time is passing
want to go home to my wife
Chomotkar touches Hasari, nods across the street
There, we see the Goonda and two thugs
Hasari
It's Hasari's turn
He can't stay to talk with Ram now
He has to go
#4 How much to the market
Eight rupees
#4 What
won't pay it
Who else needs a ride
am available at a price
Several others crowd and shove toward him
#4 No
Take me -- 'll pay, let's go
The price just went up
Ten rupees
In advance
The Marwari hesitates only as long as it takes him to dig in his soaking wet pants and to slap the bills into Hasari's hand and climb aboard
Hasari sets out with great difficulty -- and greater determination -- through the floodwaters, flicking his eyes at the Goonda as he goes
114
- Water  pours down
we see Hasari inside, putting money  down in front of the shop owner and then hustling back  into the rain and taking up his shafts
We  the owner  look after him with a touch of disdain as he comes into  the window and takes down the beautiful green and gold  sari
-  - Water pouring from above; the gutters overflow with refuse
We   to the clinic
Water pouring off the room into the courtyard
Hasari locks his rickshaw into the shed and turns out, attention to Max, Aloka, Joan, Poomina, Margareta, Mehboub, several others trying to patch leaking roof tiles and keep supplies high and dry
Hasari enters
Max looks at him, doesn't like the look of the obviously exhausted man
How can  help
-    ( ) - An Anglo couple jockeying for preference
Hasari selects them from a crowd
This is the beginning of )   He runs  us from different directions with riders -- pushing, pushing -- the water getting higher, our his feet, his tensed muscles; for a moment, we hear only his breathing, the sound of his feet on the pavement, the   the  of the rickshaw
)   He drags up with an entire, well-to-do family of six, packed into the rickshaw
)   He stumbles to a stop outside the emergency entrance to the hospital, carrying a mother and her sick child
() 115
: )   An upper-crust Brahmin dressed in crisp white, an umbrella protecting him against the harsh elements
)   Four uniformed school children huddled, laughing together under the rickshaw's canopy
- '  - The rain continues, as does the work in the clinic
Max is working on Anouar, Aloka assisting
Meeta and the baby (now 6 months old) in the b
g
think Aloka would have a gentler touch than you, Max Daddah
Maybe she should perform this surgery on her own
Aloka ducks her eyes, embarrassed
Last time you told me you were more than two women could manage
Yes, but given a choice between one and none,  will accept the one
Max lifts Anouar off the table and places him on his cart
Okay, you ought to be good for another few days
Send in the next patient
Anouar scoots out
Max and Aloka both turn to the instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of scissors to the floor
Simultaneously, they bend to pick it up and bang heads
The first   impulse of each is to touch the other's head
But almost   simultaneously, their hands freeze short of touching
Several months ago, Max might have tried to kiss her;   now, though, there is friendship and affection
here,   we see a pair of bare feet
We   Max and Aloka
116
Shoba, a deeply concerned look on his face
Slowly his hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken wing
He puts the parrot on the examining table
- Hasari seals a letter and a money order into an envelope, seals, and puts it into the slot
He is  clearly exhausted
Outside he can  see two Sikh merchants at his rickshaw, looking around in the rain for him
He hurries toward the door
Here
'm here
'  - Aloka and three women huddled beside a window, Amrita half hidden behind them
We   a staircase another window,  which we see a doorway
In the doorway, Subash turns to smile a shy smile at Amrita; he shrugs
him now, we see Hasari facing ' and three , surly men with hair matted with mustard oil
The Ghoshes are all seated on low chairs and stools
Hasari is standing
- Mr
Ghosh and the Uncles stare at Hasari, who stands politely and hopefully before them
(' ) You're a rickshaw puller, am correct
Yes, that's correct
He looks at his brothers, on either side
They look at him
And  a partner in the workshop where your daughter is employed
Were you aware of that
Yes, yes,  was, my daughter told me, thank you
() 117
: Yes, well then, perhaps you can tell me why  would permit my son to marry your daughter
Mr
Ghosh raises his palms
It's all over as far as he's concerned
#1 Just a moment, please
The brothers huddle, whisper just loudly enough for Hasari to hear
#1 Are you saying there's no way you'd consider this match
Mr
Ghosh shakes his head, shrugs his palms
#1 Perhaps some inducement
Would that be of any help
(considering this) What could he possibly offer
#1 Probably nothing
But perhaps, in fairness, we should find out
Mr
Ghosh shrugs
The huddle breaks
All five men stare at Hasari
- Hasari, mouth half open, flecked with spume, pulls a huge Marwari
He's pouring sweat, his eyes are blood- shot
He has never looked more like a horse
They arrive at a cross street
The Marwari gets down and pays Hasari
Hasari slumps against the rickshaw and, while he awaits his next rider, counts his crum- pled pile of notes and coins
- Max, Joan, Aristotle John, Margareta, Mehboub, perhaps a dozen others trying to raise the level of the low wall at the entrance with bricks
The wall caves in
Other people in the neighborhood rush to rebuild it
() 118
: (shouting to the others) My dear friends, it's just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here
Thinking he's about to make some cogent remark about this unified effort
What's that, Doctor Big Brother
The opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price
Joan begins to laugh; the others don't get it, query each other as to what's funny about that
hate to admit it, junior, but that was actually quite witty
She whacks him on the shoulder with a wet, muddy paw
Ut-nobody laugh; it's a natural disaster -- we have guests
Everyone turns to
Manubai and Ravi, their car parked at the entryway to the clinic
big puddle separates them
'd throw my cape down, but 'm all out of dry capes
He sloshes through the water to them, wiping his muddy hands on his pants
He offers a semi-clean hand to each in turn
It's very nice to see you
Both of you
We heard you were still here
Vijay wanted to send some things
() 119
: She indicates the car, which is packed with dry food and such
Shall we unload the car
Yes, yes, by all means
Max whistles, indicates the car
People come and start unloading it, Ravi showing the way, leaving Max and Manubai alone a moment, Aloka flicking her eyes at the two of them
'm surprised
really didn't think you'd stick it out
People grow older; sometimes they even grow up
He smiles a sweet smile at her
She smiles back at him
-   - Anouar on Said's shoulders
The big mute runs, followed by Hasari and a phalanx of rickshaw pullers: Chomotkar, Rassoul, Ramatullah-Joan, Aloka, Manooj, several others in the rickshaws, Max and Sunil, each with his doctor bag -- all of them running in silhouette along the embankment in the rain
Where can we take them
We can't take them back to the clinic
No one will put up with it
We can't let them drown, can we
Eh, Max Daddah
- The leper colony is submerged
The parents have put their children on the roofs and the relatively able- bodied lepers are piling charpoys one on top of another to protect the sick and the infirm
Meeta and her baby are on a roof
The mud bank is too slippery to get the rickshaws down and back up
It's too deep
() 120
: beat
-  ,   - - leper clings to a rope as several of the human horses pull him and others up the mud bank
Max, Hasari, Rassoul, and Chomotkar up to their necks in water; Hasari and Rassoul have a door on their shoulders; on top of the door, a sick leper woman
Max is lifting one child, then another onto the door
The two pullers make their way slowly toward the mud bank
Aloka, Joan, helping lepers into rickshaw
Anouar
Max Daddah
The hut starts to come apart under them
Max and Chomotkar quickly move to the house with another door
We're here
We're here
Chomotkar holds the door up as Meeta holds the baby out in the direction of Max's voice
Max catches the baby as the house slips down, then grabs Meeta, who clings to him
- Hasari pulling the lead rickshaw
Anouar on Max's shoulders, the two of them leading a terrible ensemble version of "Hound Dog
" An air of festivity among lepers and rescuers
They come to a bridge made of two planks over rushing water
() 121
: Several rickshaws go across but as Max and Anouar start over, suddenly the ground gives way beneath Max's feet
Anouar falls free; someone grabs him; but a blackish stream rushes into Max's mouth and in an instant he's swept beneath the gurgling filth
The density of the filth makes his effort to surface ineffective
It looks for all the world like he's going to drown
Max has disappeared
Instinctively, Hasari dives into the maelstrom
He, too, disappears
After some moments, Hasari surfaces, spitting the filth out of his mouth
He dives again, comes up somewhere else
Dives a third time
Is down
Is down
Is down
Then suddenly bursts out of the filth, dragging the unconscious form of Max Loeb into the air
More people have gathered
Cries of: It's the doctor
Save Doctor Big Brother
Aloka passes a baby to someone and helps Hasari push Max up onto the bank
But now Hasari doesn't know what to do and turns to his wife
Aloka quickly clears Max's mouth and begins to admin- ister mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
She blows, she breathes; she blows, she breathes
People crowd in
Aloka blows, she breathes
It seems, though, that by his stillness and by the looks on people's faces that Max is dead
Yet, more determined still, Aloka goes on; blows, breathes
And now Max gags,  his body erupts in spasm, and he explodes a stream  of black liquid out of his lungs
Aloka supports his  forehead as Max retches again and then comes still
beat
- We   members of our group -- lepers and normals -- passing bowls of rice in a simple communal meal, Singing a religious song quietly
On the floor in the b
g
, Anouar is writing something on a slightly damp stretch of cloth with a child's crayon
Said takes the cloth and tacks it to the wall
What Anouar has written is this, "All that is not given is lost
" Everyone in the room stares at the words
122
- '  - Max opens his eyes to find Joan, Hasari, Aloka, and the children keeping a vigil
Oh, Jesus, the guy went to sleep when he was supposed to be working
gotta get up -- He tries to get up
Joan pushes him back down
Sshh, sshh, sshh
No heroics, junior
Lay back
You're all right
All right
(a distant laugh) Yeah,  am, 'm all right
He is a little delirious
The boys come close, kneel at his side, instinctively reach out to him
Want you guys to know something
About me
Wanted to be the world's greatest heart surgeon, just one better than my dad
Just one
First time 'm the lead surgeon on a case, the main guy, choke
Froze
The chief made me step aside
My teacher
Had to take over for me
Went into radiology
Photography
Had to have somethin' easy
No pressure
Wasn't too nuts about myself
Quit
Hasari reaches out and touches Max, telling him with a touch that it's all right
He stares up through bleary eyes at all of them with utterly open love
Amrita holds out a small gift to him: It's a banana leaf, holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little decorative leaves
You people
You
(a beat) love you guys
'  -    - group gathered on a dry, sunny afternoon, peering into the hut
We  on the growing flower in the tea caddy in the window and then go  the window into: 123
'  - Hasari, Max (dressed quite India), the local Hara Giri, Mr
Ghosh and the four Ghosh uncles crammed into the tiny room
Members of our group jam the doorway, spectating
The air is close
can offer no more    than 've offered
No more
All right, 'll add two dhotis,    two vests, and a punjabi
But     that's all
Mr
Ghosh lights up a bidi, looks at his brothers, wrinkles his brows at Hasari
That's all
Did he say that's all
My daughter's qualities will make up for what is lacking
' Well, it won't do
am firm in requiring for my exceptional son the bicycle, 1000 repees
and one ounce of gold
That's robbery
The child of a rajah might be worth that, and 'm not even sure of that
Impossible
We linger on Shambu a moment
- '  - Sister Cecilia, in full habit, looks over a sheaf of test scores
Then she peers up at
Manooj, seated between Hasari and Max
Well, indeed     think Sister Joan is right --    we've got a prospect here
We'll     start you off with a few classes;    if that works out, we'll make a    proper student of you
() 124
: Hasari can't believe his ears
Manooj sits frozen
Max grins
-     - Amrita, Subash, and Shambu heading home from the work- shop
Shambu's cast is gone
Subash flirts with Amrita
They see Hasari, Max, and Manooj coming toward them
Manooj runs to them, shouting that he's going to the school; Amrita, Subash, Shambu congratulate him
Suddenly the rickshaw wheels jam
They turn to find two men, one of whom has slammed a stick into Hasari's spokes
Retribution, it would seem, has arrived
The kids stop, huddle instinctively together in fear
Our policeman disappears into a doorway as shutters close up and down this little street
There are thugs at both ends
No one else is visible on the street
The two men stare at Hasari a moment, smiling
Then one gets into the rickshaw, crosses his legs as if he might want transport
But now he whips out a narrow bladed knife, and still staring at Hasari, begins to slice up the newly covered seats of the rickshaw
Max looks around, trying to cool things
Hey, come on, don't do this
Well, what's the problem here
They turn, Ashoka
Behind him, the Goonda
You've become very brave of late, haven't you
Don't do this
Oh,  do what  please
You see, my father's dead, 'm in charge now
So you will get off my streets, you will leave my country, and that clinic and school will close
() 125
: Why
My father was weak
He let you and your European friend give these little people ideas
It's over
You can't do this
He takes no more than a step at Ashoka, a hand coming up, when he's hit hard from behind
Goes to his knees
Jesus Christ
His hand comes away from the back of his head with blood
He tries to rise and is hit again
(to the kids) Get back
Stay back
No, no, come forward
Come
Ashoka glides toward the petrified Amrita
The Goonda remains unmoving, watchful
Ashoka puts out his hand with its rings, and strokes Amrita's cheek
What a little woman already, hey
Please, don't touch her, Babu
What did you say
said, Please, don't touch her
Hasari glances over his shoulder, his eyes bouncing off the Goonda's impassive face
Now, the knife comes out of Ashoka's pocket, snaps open, glints in the light
She's going to give someone a lot of enjoyment
Yes
() 126
: There's a moment of unbearable tension as everyone, in- cluding the Goonda, realizes this man is out of control
(to the Goonda) He said 'please' didn't he
'Please, don't touch her
' The Goonda stares at Ashoka
And now Ashoka reaches out and we   on his hand as it moves ever so slowly through space to settle on Amrita's breast
And now Hasari explodes
He hits Ashoka
hard punch to the chest
Ashoka stumbles and falls to one knee
The Two Thugs make    a move to come to his rescue
but a curious thing stops    them: the Goonda's arm, outstretched across their path,    his eyes alerting them not to proceed
Max lurches to his    feet unsteadily
Bhose, help me
Hasari unloads a punch into Ashoka's face; Ashoka's nose pours blood; he starts to whimper
He clutches Hasari hard to him
Holds him
Hasari struggles, slams his palm into Ashoka's chin, sending Ashoka to the ground, sending the knife skidding across the ground
Hasari grabs the knife, straddles Ashoka, about to kill
But he can't do it
Life is hard enough
No more
Leave us alone
Hasari backs off, leans against a wall, stares down at Ashoka, his hands in tight against his body
Manooj and Shambu stare at their father in awe
Shambu sees something on the ground where the first blow was delivered to Ashoka's chest
Everyone has moved slightly to one side
He bends and closes his fist around something
The Goonda steps between Ashoka and Max and Hasari
You won't be bothered again
look from the Goonda and the Thugs vanish, leaving Ashoka cowering in a doorway on his knees
() 127
: Shutters start to open, people begin   to appear again in doorways and windows
Fearing for his life, Ashoka suddenly   bolts
Max is fixed on Hasari
He lets up a    scream of exulta- tion, his hand going out for a "five"   from Hasari
The kids charge toward Hasari
Then everyone freezes
Hasari lists to his right side and blood starts to pour from the knife wound in his abdomen under his pressing arm
'  -   - From here we can see Hasari on Max's cot under "The Raft of the Medusa" in the little room overlooking the street
Out here, the two doctors are alone
Why don't you go on home
'll stay with him
Sunil nods
Max grips Sunil's hand strongly
Sunil goes down the steps
Max moves to Hasari's bedside
He watches Hasari breathing
He looks up at "The Raft of the Medusa
" '  -  (  ) thin stream of dawn light coming through the half- closed shutters
- Through the open door, we can just see Joan, praying quietly
Close around her, Anouar, Meeta, Surya, Marga- reta, Poomina
Beneath "The Raft of the Medusa," Hasari Pal speaks to his family and Max, Aloka sitting close to the bed, the Children on the bed beside their father, and Max standing close
() 128
: man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road
And you have to remember that you can never give up
We pray that life will bless us, that we will be kings, with possessions and money that we can rule over all around us
But it's a mist; the only thing that makes it possible to endure life is our love, one for the other
beat, the family and Max tightly bound together
And now we hear the dim sounds of
was dreaming the sound of rickshaw bells, and now  hear them
Max opens the windows
Manooj helps his father sit up
- Outside, there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard and spilling out into the street
When the window opens, all the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is full of their music
Are they here for me
Unquestionably, they are
city so big
When we arrived, we didn't have a place to live, a friend
He smiles
The many hands with their ringing bells
The tiny figure of Shambu joins Max in the window
Max bends close
() 129
: (whispering) Is my father going to die
Max makes the same sound he made in the ashram at the beginning of the movie, though this sound of dismissal different
Get serious
'  - '  - Hasari mirrors Max's expression of dismissal
Get serious
've agreed to the bicycle, 've agreed to the 1000 rupees
can go no further have nothing more to give
Everyone crowded around the door
From within, we the negotiations continue
Max approaches from the clinic
Shambu slips down the steps from above as
How's it going
All that stands between them now is the ounce of gold
Max Daddah, Joan Di -- is she a good reader
What do you mean
She read this letter to me
( he shows Max) But  think she must have read it wrong
She said my wife writes that irrigation has come to our village
But that's great

: But it means  should go home to my wife
thought that's why we've been writing all these letters
Yes, of course,  love her from here, yes; but, what if  go home and find  don't love her from there
Shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the edge of the tea shop
The little boy indicates Max should bend close
Max leans down
Daddy needs gold, right
Max nods
And Shambu brings his fist up from under the table
' He opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off the ground during the fight: Max's necklace and Hebrew letter
Do you think this is pretend gold or real
Max stares at the little boy's hopeful face
'  - We see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy and then Hasari's fingers come
He carefully snips the flower free of its stalk
Amrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father bought her
Father and daughter are alone
He hands her the flower and adjusts her veil tenderly

: You never did belong to me
You were only lent to me by God until you marry and continue the wheel of life
Amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms come up around his neck, the flower against his curved back
Tears fill Hasari's eyes, but a smile graces his lips
-  - The procession to the courtyard begins when a strikes up, accompanied by singing and shouting
Tiny lights have been strung over the street
We see Max and Manubai
Margareta and a group of children
Joan with Poomina
Anour, Meeta, Said
Everyone who's become part of the family is present
-  () The procession arrives and enters
Smoke from the chu- las
Light from a half dozen lamps
Subash and his procession make their entrance
ritual veil is fixed to Subash's face
The Pujari waves for Hasari to come to his place
Hasari turns to Max
would be pleased if you would stand with me in the place of honor to the right of my daughter
Deeply touched, Max nods
and the two men step for- ward
as Subash is motioned forward by the Pujari
Subash sits beside Amrita
flame
The    shyness of bride and groom as the ceremony proceeds with   the winding of the red thread
Hasari looks on with   unspeakable pride, Max beside him
We see the faces of   all our family again: Aloka, Manooj and Shambu, Joan,   Poomina, Surya, Selima, Aristotle John, etc

Turning
As Amrita and Subash, joined by the thread, circle the flame
as we
Now we see the clinic and school and the surrounding area, the alleys full of people and activity
