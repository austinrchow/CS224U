Written by John Sayles 6/18/2006 We hear a strange, single,
1
-   -          1 We follow a small boy's  on a strange contraption- , 10 years old, has a ` ', a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is stretched taut
He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes , pitch-shifting  as he plucks the wire
His friend  stands moving his fingers over a  he has laid on the side of the porch floor
few scrawny run around in the yard behind them- Leave off with that, Scratch
Aint bothering you
Yes it is
That aint no kind of music
We see that the board has   drawn across it and that Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it- Least  make a sound
Yeah and it's a nasty one
Lonnie looks at the sky- You want to try again tonight
Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from the setting sun- Might as well
2
1ST   -                          2 plays
tuft of   bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll  - 2
We  and  to look over a   , the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze
steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him
We   to see other , men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing between their legs and behind them
The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction- 3
-   -                  3 We see the boys walking on a  through the - 4
,   -   -          4 We float over   cutting through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on the ties- 5
-                               5 The boys stroll past white buildings of an , black and white,  on the grounds- 6
,  -                      6 The river rolls past us in the  as the boys cross a We - -   1950 7
-                                7 We hear   as we   toward the , a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads
3
-colored light bulbs (a few broken)   and erratically around the   as we  toward and then  it on the way to the entrance, catching up with Lonnie and Scratch
The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and go up on their toes to peek in through a window- 8
-                                      8 An   of long fingers on piano keys- woman in her late 50's, early 60's,   , leans into a  from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and - know a gal name of Betty Sue Shook it so much She got the German flu No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same As she sings we  and , moving through the large, near- empty  - You women don't worry About your life She made Jack the Ripper Throw away his knife- Only a few die-hard  are scattered at the tables and bar stools
pretty young woman in her late teens, , is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening aimlessly
No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping that nobody will notice and tell them to leave
4
They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently watching the long fingers work the keys- we  to see `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his 50's
He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on the music
We  to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up the song- copper brought her in She didn't need no bail She shook it for the judge He threw the cop in jail No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same , a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the bar, and , who sits at a table near the bandstand smiling throughout,
The sound makes the room seem more empty
Ty stands, nods to  , a slight, worried-looking harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae- You take it for a while
As Ty crosses to the bar we hear   booming from outside- They makin all that racket again at Toussaint's
Yeah
And all them people over there buying drinks and throwing their money after them dice and whatnot
Lucky we got none a that here
Metalmouth launches into a
Ty pauses at the counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae- You can drink your liquor You can drink your cold can beer- She sounding good, huh
Sounds fine
Always has
5
You can drink your good whiskey You can drink your cold can beer- Not much of a crowd
Not a crowd at all
Just some stiffs who want to drink theirself to sleep without the music wakin em up
You ought to advertise
Got an attraction like Bertha Mae- You can lay up with your sweet gal But Poppa don't you leave me here Singin is one thing, Slick
Whether people want to look at you while you do it is another
(defensive) You saying something about- Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting- Got quite a number over to Toussaint's place tonight
Sounds like it
Lots of young folks
Come to listen to that box of his
China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey
He gives her a sad smile- Thanks, China Doll
We  as Ty crosses to the door- 6
(
) Don't see why we don't just turn our box on and let folks feed it nickels like they do
(
) The lady is singing
(
) But didn't nobody come to listen to her, Slick
Ty looks out the door at- - -the -lit     across the road, hanging out in front,  heard from within- Ty reacts
Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room- Like the man say, you can't argue with failure
, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar, calls out to them- You know why Slick here is like a preacher
Slick tenses, used to this- Cause he does all his best work on his knees
Stokely almost chokes with laughter- Never mind him, he just a drunk- hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house
Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm- 7
You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick
oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries
Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then- You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get
Gentlemen- They all turn to see , Ty's wife, coming out from the back of the club
She is dressed for church- (doffs his hat)    Miss Delilah- Let's behave ourselves
(sees) What are you boys doing in here
Out
Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out
Delilah turns her attention to China Doll- And what are you doing behind that bar
It's just for a minute
That's sixty seconds too long
Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place
China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind- You bring people their food
Don't you be messing with their liquor
Nobody's eating
8
That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil
Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the door- At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where  get my cold can beer At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where  get my cold can beer- Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of , a large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in- Evenin, Maceo
You lookin good tonight
Likewise, Miss Nadine
What can do for you
(flirting) You know what you can do for me, sweet man
Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time- What would you like to drink
Ty watches the  in front of the Ace of Spades
Delilah comes up to join him, indicates his drink- How many is that tonight
Don't dog me about that, baby
Not tonight
don't want China Doll behind that bar
9
She got to help out
Not there she doesn't
You know she's not sposed to get excited- Not much chance of that in here
(wistful) Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place
The young ones
You'll get some of them
They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone
(joking)   Maybe that's the wages of sin
(bitter) Aint no sin happenin here tonight, baby, and there sure as hell aint no wages
Your God wants to chastise some sinners He best move on over to Toussaint's, got a whole barroom crowded with em
He isn't `my God'
He's everybody's God
He looks at his wife- How that tent meeting went tonight
Viola Underwood found the Lord
thought she found Him last year when they come through
10
(smiles) Well, she must have lost Him again between then and now, cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues
The Spirit didn't move you, though
(thoughtful) Not yet
Might be too late for me
Delilah surveys the room- can't believe you're serving Alton Stokely
Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he drinks- (
) That poor man- (
) Toussaint cut his credit off
Either he gets it here- -or he drinks that paint-peeler Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp
He's gonna drink himself to death in here
Least he won't go blind first
Delilah shakes her head and heads out the door- Imonna go home and say a prayer for that man
11
(calling after)   Say one for me too, baby
Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now, as Metalmouth backs her up on the harmonica- Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Go back to Alabama But don't you leave your Momma here Only Slick applauds- That was outstandin, baby
You still got the voice
Bertha Mae, a little unsteady, holds onto Slick's arm as he helps her off the stage- You think so
Sent a chill down my spine to hear you
Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in- might be a little late Saturday, Tyrone
(mutters, embarrassed) Don't need to come in if you don't want to
She stops dead
Stares at him till he has to let it out- 've made other arrangements
Other arrangements- 12
Try something new in here
You can't do that
It's his place, darlin, he can do whatever he want
Bertha Mae nods to Ty, holding onto her dignity for all it's worth- You know where to find me if you need me
Bertha Mae pulls Slick out the door
China Doll watches after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink- (softly)    put the box on now, Ty
Yeah
Put the box on
Imonna crank it up some, see if we can draw a little life in here- Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop in
The jukebox sputters to life,    and for a moment, then the   and all the in the club goes
9
-                                      9 The Honeydripper  is the last to  and
Lonnie and Scratch watch from under the streetlight- There it go again
Lectricity don't like that jukebox
13
10
-                                    10 Damn
China Doll
is struck,  as China Doll lights a she's pulled from under the bar- Got to get the power company in here- No you don't
They turned my juice off last month- don't want them sniffin around that splice job Maceo done
Must be a short circuit in the juke here- He yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure the few patrons- Don't worry folks, bar's still open
It's nice like this
Kind of romantic
Imonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around
Don't be wigglin nothin round less 'm there to see it
Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a He freezes in his tracks as the hits a  standing in the doorway- It is   , large and in charge
Pugh strolls into the club as if he owns it
14
Evenin, folks
Evenin, Sheriff
Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club- Your lights gone out
Looks like it
Don't know but that be a vilation of somethin or other
Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground without pissing off the white man with the badge- We just about to close up here
Pugh sniffs the air- Your wife been cookin
Not tonight
Went to the revival tent
(grins)  stood by there a while
Them nigras was singin up a storm
Ty doesn't respond
Sheriff Pugh stops right next to Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks
Stokely won't meet his eyes- just come out here to look in on Toussaint- had that shooting two nights ago
Lot's of fighting in there
There is that
But me and Old Toussaint got us a greement
() 15
(cont'd) You get these field hands suckin down that whiskey, hop em all up with music, there's gonna be some razors drawn
He only call me if it's a fatality
Never been a killin in here
Them youngbloods know better- -than to mess with Tyrone Purvis
He turns his attention to Tyrone- You got quite the reputation round here, Tyrone
Say you put some poor black boy in the grave
It gets very quiet, the  of the   growing tense and insistent
China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching for a flicker of evidence
Ty stays deadpan- Just people talkin
The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge of menace in his voice when he speaks softly- You remember that this is my county, Tyrone
What goes on goes on cause  let it
Don't want to get too big for your britches out here
Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the sheriff turns and heads for the door- You folks have a pleasant evening, now
They all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale
nigger aint shit in this world
Maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from Stokely- 16
Speakin for yourself
You didn't have this club, Tyrone, what you think you be
We  on Ty's face
He has been thinking about this very thing- (
) Wouldn't be nothin
And if that aint true then grits aint groceries
long   echoes outside- 11
'  -                               11 Bertha Mae pauses as she climbs the   of her two- story wooden , the nicest in the neighborhood, listening to the   with a troubled look on her face
Slick waits for her with the door open- That is a terrible noise
Just the northbound from Talledega
Sounds like it always does
Like a soul bein carried away from this life
- Come on in, darlin
You catch your death out here
12
-                                 12 We hear the   again as the   and the strobes past us, picking up speed as it pulls out from the yard- When it clears we see a   standing across the tracks
He steps forward and catches a bit of light-- 17
, 20's, rumpled from hard travelling
He carries a   and something bulky in a - , an older man in a  ' stands under the moth-addled light on the tiny , watching Sonny- Lucky the high-sheriff aint here to see you crawl outta that boxcar
He come round here much
Only when he's bored
Sonny reaches Shack at the platform- You working that train
Kansas City to New Orleans
What you get off here for
growed up here
Still got people
How bout you
(shrugs) Got tired of sleepin in a boxcar
Listen, is there a place to- (points) Switchman's shed, right over there, has got a cot
Don't mind the rats none, less you got food on you- and  can see you and a good meal has been strangers for some time
Sonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic- You get into town tomorrow an need somethin, tell em Shack Thomas sent you
They know who you talkin about
18
Thanks
Hey, what's the name of this town
Shack points to the  hanging down from the lip of the platform roof- The sign reads- (
) Name like that, must be a good place for musicians
Shack laughs as he heads away- Only night  ever spent in jail was a town called Liberty
Sun comes up, you'll see where you landed
And you best be out of that shed by first light
13
-   -                      13 few wet, crumpled  and dirty  are spread out on the bartop- (
) It's just a weekday night- Still operating by  , Ty and Maceo look at the night's dismal take, as China Doll lays chairs on top of tables- owe the chicken man,  owe the ice man,  owe the liquor man- Least you don't owe the electric company
19
(indicates the dark room)    Yeah, that's a big relief
(worried)    You thinkin bout closing down
Ty frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a
He spreads it out on the counter top
It reads- New Orleans Singing Sensation `' What you think
Biggest act in New Orleans, got him a hit on the radio- He's playing here Saturday night
Figured 'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone to put this up
Ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster- Here
You mean like in this room here
You know the Tomcat Club in Texarkana
Big Jim Jamison's place- Just went out of business
Damn- And since Sam is giggin his way over to Tulsa, that means he got the date open- 20
But you aint never had a guitar pl- Ty gives Maceo a warning look, which China Doll notes- 'm having one now
What you gonna pay the man with
Ty glances at China Doll, uneasy- You just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow
Payday come Saturday, he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black
Ty looks around at the empty club- They gonna take me down, it won't be without a fight
Maceo holds the poster up to the lamplight, warming to the idea- Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper
Man, this joint is going to jump
14
/1ST   -             14 An   in coveralls leads a  along the side of the road
carrying two dozen  in its open bed approaches- One of the pickers, , turns to look back at the man and mule- Aint seen no mule in a long time
The other pickers, men and women, don't look interested or even fully awake yet- 21
knew this was Alabama, but that's the Stone Ages, man
One of the other men, , looks him over
Dex is little and combative and has a nasty-looking  on his face
Ham is big and morose, with a deep, grumpy voice- Where you from, boy
Memphis
Down on you vacation
few snickers- Got in a piece of trouble up there with the white folks, need to bide my time for a spell
, a local man with a nervous air, jumps in- You bide any time in these fields, bossman gonna fire your ass for takin up space
Aint no worry bout that
'm a cotton-pickin fool
You a fool, all right
More snickers and the truck stops at the side of a Somebody lets the tailgate down and they begin to climb off- And where you from, Brother Bear
Missippi
Then this a real step up for you
Folks round here has discovered fire and whatnot- 22
That trouble you in have anything to do with runnin your mouth
The pickers unroll the sacks they pick up from the pile that's been left and begin to spread out at the base of the unpicked rows- Had to do with somebody get on my nerves and  had to deal with him
Must of been somebody kind of puny
Dex turns to face the much larger Ham- As  recall he just about your size
The two men stare at each other for a long moment
Way too early to fight
Dex breaks eye contact and moves toward a row- What's this place we at
Nearest town is Harmony
This Mr
Silas Tugwell's place
He nods toward Dex's row- You better get pickin
Cotton aint goin nowhere
More you get first thing when the dew still on it, the more it weighs when it tip that scale
Dex's gaze falls upon a tall, strong-looking young woman starting down the row next to his- You live here too
She gives him a weary look- 23
(shakes his head)   You got my sympathies
15
-   -                       15 of the  that cut the town in two
Sonny stands on the tracks just as the  , pondering- which side of the tracks is for white people, which for the colored
He hears   to one side, steps cautiously toward it- 16
-   -               16 Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case, moving toward the sound of a   being played expertly- An irate-looking   glares at Sonny as she picks up the milk bottles from her stoop, steps inside and slams the door
Sonny moves ahead, uneasy- We  on his face as he stops to listen, the , seeming to come from here, then from there, then suddenly from right behind him- He turns- , blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet- open  ,  expertly on a beat-up old
Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment, watching the man's fingers- Possum gets a whiff of him
He keeps playing as he speaks- Somebody slept in the railroad yard
Sonny watches the blind man's fingers move on the strings- Yall can play that thing
Been doin it near forever
24
(looking around) Listen, which side of the tracks am - The wrong side for you
What you doing here then
White folks look right through me
How much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow
Sonny surveys the street- Where our people go for music around here
There's a couple places just a little bit out of town
At the crossroads
Long walk
You in a hurry
Possum finishes his song- How old is that box you playin, Pops
(smiles) Second one that ever was- an the devil's got the first
How bout yours
Possum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe
Sonny is surprised at the blind man's perception- Brand new
Made it myself
(whistles)     Made it hisself- 25
That's right
So these clubs- Old Toussaint, owns the Ace of Spades, don't feature live music
And Pinetop Purvis, owns the Honeydripper Lounge
He don't care bout no guitar
Won't have one under his roof
That don't make sense
Possum scratches his head- Yeah- when a musician put his hand to murder, nine times outa ten it's a drummer done it
But Pinetop a piano man- He killed somebody
That's the story
Might be true, and it might not
17
-  -                           17 Ty is tacking one of the Guitar Sam  on the front of the building
(
) But if you meet the man, you damn well don't be askin him about it
and a curse from the side of the roadhouse- (
) Damn
Ty looks up- What's the matter
(
) got a shock
26
Thought you used to work for the power company
, Maceo wrestles with the jury-rigged  that run out from the battered, rusting  - drove a supply truck
(
) Guitar Sam aint gonna play by no candlelight
(sniffs)     smell bacon
(
) You must of burnt your porky ass with that lectricity
(
) Breakfast ready
China Doll has stepped out from the club- Where's your mama
Already over to the Mayor's
She told me to come here and make sure you eat something fore you start runnin around
Maceo comes around from the side- That is a sweet woman you got
You got one waitin for you if you want her
Maceo makes a face- 27
You mean Nadine
18
-                                   18 They step into the club
Plates of bacon, eggs and biscuits sit on one of the tables- (teasing) Come in here every night makin them cow-eyes at you- Ty and Maceo sit- She seems like the kind could smother a man- She makes all her own clothes
(smiles) Darlin, that's not the kind of thing a man cares about from a woman
The  that went out last night suddenly  - Hey,  fixed it
You didn't do no such thing
It just decided to come back on
Decided
Just like it decided to switch off last night
You not even in the conversation
Miss Nadine makes some good money too, sewing for people
That woman scares me
Last ole boy that give her a tumble, Nappy Carpenter
() 28
(cont'd) She cook for him, fixed him up all kinds of nice new clothes, kept him in gin and poker chips- Don't see no problem with that
Well, come four, five months, a man starts to- sorry, China Doll, but this just the way it is- a man gots needs
Nadine look like she can take care of those, too- You eat chicken every morning, noon and night for five months, you get a taste for some different kind of meat, right
(looks to China Doll) Maybe  shouldn't be- Aint gonna tell me something haven't heard worse
Well, Nappy goes out and has him a- a porkchop or two, let's say- and he comes back from Toussaint's one night feeling no pain, smelling like- like porkchops- the way a man will- and he falls out on Nadine's couch and commences to snore
Wake up the next mornin, finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it- Man was dog drunk- Miss Nadine come in with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says "Baby,  got your breakfast
" "Not this morning, Nadine," he says, sittin up, "don't think  could eat a thing
" "Well then," she says, "we can't let this go to waste, can we
" and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the man's lap
29
(wincing)    Owwww
Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head
Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she would of killed that man
They are all quiet for a moment, contemplating- You got to admit it, though- woman is an artist with that Singer machine
(
) Scuse me
They turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway- Which one of you is Mr
Pinetop
Ty's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet- We aint hirin
can play anything- Ty indicates the Guitar Sam  hanging behind the bar- Already got me a professional
Sonny looks a little shaky- Guitar Sam really coming all the way out here
That so surprising
No, no-- uhm, Mr
Shack Thomas said that if  was to- You know Shack
30
We uh- we travelled together- Ty gives him a once-over- When's the last time you ate solid food, young man
Sonny has to think- (to China Doll) Take him back and fix him somethin, China Doll
Standin there all hungry-eyed, puts me off my breakfast
That's real kind of you- Sonny pulls his hat off as he follows China Doll, who is suddenly quiet and self-conscious, back to the kitchen- Must of come in on the northbound last night
Look like he got cooties, too
Straw in them boxcars is full of em
Never cared to travel that way
Ty grows somber, reminiscing- was out there ridin them rails between the wars
Seem like half the country headin west rolled past the other half comin back east
(musing) Every one of us scrapin for the next meal- (
) This is the place
They turn to see  , a hard-looking, sharply-dressed character, leading the prosperous looking
into the club as if they aren't there- 31
Yall can tear things down, put things up- got a lot of potential
Looks bigger in here than it does from the outside
help you gentlemen
Just showing the man gonna run this place what he's got
Ty stands- This is my place
frozen moment
Then Maceo stands as well, backing up his friend
Cool Breeze puts one foot up on the chair next to Ty, licks a finger and dabs at his shoeshine with it- You the piano player, right
Name's Tyrone- call me Pinetop Purvis
Pinetop Purvis who owes two hundred dollars to Lucky Hardaway up in Little Rock- He's gonna get his- Pinetop who missed last month's rent- After this weekend- After this weekend you gonna be the same raggedy-ass piano player can't pay his debts off and Mr
Simmons here gonna be the new proprietor
32
Lucky give me two weeks- Lucky got a better offer
He nods toward Mr
Simmons- He can't do that
Cool Breeze takes his foot down and gets up in Ty's face
He lets his jacket fall open so the butt of his
44  is visible- You don't think so
(trying to defuse) What if we got our payment for him Monday
Cool Breeze doesn't take his eyes off Ty's- Saturday night
We can do that- Not just a taste- the whole two hundred
And  throw in a twenny-five cent tip for his messenger boy
'll be here
In the meantime, we not open yet
Which means yall are trespassin
Cool Breeze grins, still locking eyeballs with Ty- You seen enough, Mr
Simmons
believe  have
33
Cool Breeze breaks eye contact, strolls out, followed by Simmons- Yeah, somebody could make something out of this place
Wouldn't take much work at all
Ty and Maceo wait till the men are gone before they speak- We cleared over two hundred that one weekend- Couple years back- And we didn't have no Louisiana guitar wizard playin neither
Yeah, they say he draws em like flies
That's what they say
An awkward pause
Both men are shaken
Ty sits back down to think- They say first thing he does is go to the man that owns the joint, sticks out his hand and wants that cash money put in it
already sent fifty to his manager
How much you payin him all out
Another hundred
We'd have to clear three hundred- figure we charge folks two dollars to get in, then drinks- 34
(shakes his head) What 'm sayin is, less he sees the green up front the man won't get off the train
honks outside- What's that now
Ty, mind working, looks desperate as Maceo exits to see who's honking- 19
-                                  19 battered  sits in front of the club
, a taciturn white man, and his black loader step out as Maceo approaches- (calls out) Bout time you fellas run by
We just about dry here
The loader lets down the tailgate to reveal He begins to pull them out and pile them on the ground- Your boss in
Maceo shouts back into the club- Tyrone
Whiskey wagon come by
Ty steps out of the club carrying one of the Guitar Sam posters- 'all a day late
Ty nods at the Ace of Spades club across the way- Old Man Toussaint gonna chew you out
Toussaint went over to another supplier upstate
We just got you, then we headin down to the army base, officers' club needs servicin
This fifty-six dollars- 35
(weak grin) My credit no good anymore
Zeke only has to look at the loader, who starts to put the cases back onto the truck- Whoah, whoah- what's your hurry
Nobody that's right in his head sell liquor on credit
Specially not to no darktown roadhouse
Well this is like a special case, see- we got the harvest coming in, soldiers at the base gonna be let out on leave- Saturday night
Aint enough hootch in this truck to satisfy what we gonna sell- You pay as you go
That's bidness
Zeke walks toward the cab of the truck, Ty following him, desperate, waving the poster- You can come by Monday, get paid and take back every damn drop aint sold
We got Guitar Sam lined up, you know what that means
Zeke steps in and slams the door, the loader doing the same on the other side of him- 'll pay you extra- penny a bottle on the beer and a nickel on the whiskey
The truck engine coughs- (desperate) What if  throw in five dollars up front, just for you fellas-
Zeke pulls away- 36
Come on, man, everybody give credit, that's the American way
But the truck is gone down the road
Maceo comes up beside Ty, watching forlornly- Maybe we could buy some busthead from Willie Pettigrew
With that sheriff sniffin around every night
Land my black ass in jail for good
Another  pulls around the bend from the opposite direction- Then what we gonna do
The new truck slows to a stop by them
The  pokes his head out- Got a liquor delivery for a Mr
Lucien Toussaint
That's- That would be me
Maceo bites his tongue
Ty plays it through- trust they got my check all right
Don't spose 'd be here if they didn't
Ty glances over to the Ace of Spades, then points behind the Honeydripper- Pull it around to the back- we'll help you unload
37
The driver nods and wheels the truck past them
Maceo's smile fades and he looks to Ty- Man, this better be some Saturday night

Sonny sits wolfing down eggs and toast as China Doll watches him from the stove- Arkansas

First 'm going to beauty school when Mama saves up the money and then  have a portable skill- Like playin music
My step-Daddy says that aint a skill- (
) -it's an affliction
Ty sticks his head in, Maceo behind him with a case of liquor in his arms- 39
Come on, China Doll
Got some bidness in town you gonna help me with
Ty gives Sonny a distrustful look- And you, young man, want to point yourself west down that highway
Bout three miles you see a mess of people working in the fields- it's harvest time
If you can stoop and pull, they got a job for you
He steps out the back door- And wash up them dishes before you go
21
'  -  -             21 Delilah is washing breakfast dishes,  a gospel song as she works- see four and twenty elders Down on their knees see four and twenty elders Down on their knees Well they all turn together Standing to greet the rising sun see four and twenty elders Down on their knees , the mayor's pretty, high-strung wife, enters and hovers uneasily- Your biscuits were wonderful this morning, Delilah
Thank you
Of course, they always are don't know how you do it
Just cook em
40
When  married Floyd  swear couldn't even boil water
Might be why he insisted  needed help around the house
He used to come to the dinner table with a sense of dread
Anybody can learn to cook
Just have to put your mind to it
Maybe you could show me some of your secrets some time
No secrets to it
Imonna fix some ham with yams and greens today, you want to learn how
Amanda thinks about it, smiling all the while, sighs- Maybe some other day
Delilah isn't surprised by the response- You just say the word, Miss Amanda, have you cookin in no time
Amanda nods, uncomfortable but not leaving
She can't exactly offer to help with the dishes- just don't know what 'd do without you
22
-   -                   22 Ty, Maceo and China Doll approach the general store enter from the front- What  need is for you to go get friendly with Luther, then  just happen in- We can't just ask Mr
Skinner
41
Mr
Skinner don't want nothin from colored folks but they buy his goods and shine his shoes
You go on ahead, now- Maceo and China Doll cut around toward the back of the store
We  on Ty as he unrolls the posters he carries, looks across the street for another likely place to hang one- (
) It was early Friday evenin Hounds began to bark Ty turns-   how did Possum get there, chair and all
Stackolee an Billy Lyons Was squabblin In the dark Ty frowns at the lyrics- Stackolee said To Billy Lyons "What you think bout that
First you takes all my money Then you spits in My Stetson hat
" hate that damn song
Possum keeps playing but stops singing- How you keepin, Tyrone
(wary) Just tryin to hold it together
Got your beautiful young daughter with you this mornin- Don't you be studyin her
42
Heard you gone put on a guitar man out your place
Where you hear that
(grins)   Oh- the breeze
Well this time the breeze know what it's blowin about
Better be careful, Tyrone
You know what them guitar players are like
Ty glares at Possum- Be careful yourself
Ty stalks away around toward the back of the store
Possum grins and sings again- Well he shot him Three times in the shoulder Three times in the side That was the last time he shot him Cause Poor Billy Up and died 23
-                         23 quartet of  and  lounge on piled up shipping crates as Shack Thomas stands addressing them- The time is ripe and the bill is past due
Roosevelt would of done it already, only he died and they don't listen to Miss Eleanor no more
But Mr
Truman startin to bend, specially now that we got a war heatin up
As Brother Randolph says- (
) Here it comes- 43
Shack looks to see Ty joining the others- -the gospel accordin to
Phillip Randolph
(pleased)    Tyrone
How you doing, man
Got my nose above the waterline
And here's my baby- how's your mama doing, China Doll
He gives China Doll a hug and kiss- She's doin fine, Uncle Shack
Just tellin the boys here how Brother Randolph pushin through this deal where our boys gonna be a full part of services- already got the Navy and the Air Force, and the Army is- carried a rifle in the Great War, Shack
Boys get in the middle of this Korea mess they aint gonna thank you for your efforts
We want our due in this country, we got to go whole hog- Black folks shooting yellow folks to keep the white folks happy
It's time to move on from that kind of thinkin
Ty starts in through the back entrance of the store- 44
You go ahead and move right on, Shack
Then come back and tell the rest of us how it is
He steps in
Shack turns to China Doll- That is a hard-headed man
24
-                               24 , the head clerk, arranges boxes on the back wall and shoots a nervous look up front- 'd have to ask Mr
Skinner
Of course you would
While you at it, remind him how one of the reasons colored folks come in here is to get the lowdown on what's happening in-- Luther brightens as China Doll steps in- China Doll
Luther is clearly smitten- You gonna let us put these posters up, aint you Luther
Oh--  don't think that be any problem at all
(beaming a smile) That's awful nice of you, Luther
You lookin special today
That's sweet of you to say
45
Maceo, go on with the man and he show you where you can put em up
Come on, darlin, we got more stops to make- China Doll spreads a parting bit of sunshine- Nice to see you, Luther
Luther smiles and waves as Maceo hooks his arm and pulls him back into the store- 25
/  -       25 Ty and China Doll hurry down the tracks and cross to the black side of town- You got that boy eatin out of your hand
Luther's the only one didn't pull my hair when he sit behind me at Sunday school
Well  hope you got a little that sugar left, cause we got to spread some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey- You gone ask her to come sing again
Imonna ask her for money
Word is she got a whole pile of it squirreled away
China Doll stops, breathing heavily, bends to put her hands on her knees- Daddy- Come on, girl, we in a rush here- 46
got to rest
Ty softens, walks back to stand beside her- 'm sorry, baby
You catch your breath
China Doll smiles weakly- So- why Miss Spivey gonna give you money, you don't let her sing at the club any more
Gonna make her a partner
Partner in what
In the Honeydripper
But all you ever say it's just a hole you pour good money into- That don't matter
Imonna make her a proprietor
`tress'
Like waiter and waitress
Proprietress
She got to like the sound of that
26
-   - ,            26 One of the    appears in the front window as Maceo tapes it up- trio on teenage girls stop to look at it as they pass (Possum is nowhere to be seen)- Maceo steps out to join them, eager to close the deal- 47
Lovely ladies out to make a purchase- That the same Guitar Sam is on the radio
The very one
What's he look like
Fine lookin man
Real lady killer from what  hear
Got that New Orleans style to him
You ought to have a picture up there
Oh, we'll be gettin some of those when he comes in on the train
The main thing is, the man is electrified- and you know what that means
27
'                                      27 Formerly a fairly grand house, Bertha Mae's hasn't been painted for awhile and the yard could use some work
Ty coaches China Doll as they climb the stairs- We make like we just come by to see how she's keepin, and then 'll kind of mention how  been thinking of bringing her on as a partner- Left the door open
China Doll pushes the front door all the way open
We can hear Bertha Mae's  singing on a scratchy old
China Doll peeks in to see- 48
28
'  -                           28 -Slick, sitting at the bottom of the  that lead to the second floor, looking lost and bewildered- She's gone
Oh
Ty frowns
He was all geared up for the siege- When she gonna be back
She's just gone
Woke up beside her and-- He can't go on, tears forming in his eyes
China Doll and Ty trade a look- 29
'  -                               29 We start on the  , needle down on the spinning song, then  to see Bertha Mae, laying  in her bed
Aw, damn
We  again as Ty and China Doll step in
Slick appears in the doorway behind them
He's been drinking- Fourteen years
China Doll, you go find your Mama
She know how to fix up the body
People make jokes and all, but been with that woman fourteen years
That's a good part of my life
And stop by Beauchamp's and tell em they got a customer
49
She gimme the only home  ever had
He looks at them, devastated- What 'm gonna do now
30
-                                      30 Sonny walking along
He has left his guitar and sack back at the club
He slows, seeing- - ' The '  is sitting at the side of the road, a playing on the radio- He decides to brave it, walks ahead with his eyes fixed straight ahead
We he gets even with the car we see Sheriff Pugh sitting in the driver's seat, watching him- In a hurry, boy
Sonny stops, looks to the Sheriff- Naw, sir
Take your hat off
Sonny takes his hat off
He meets the Sheriff's eyes, trying to strike a balance between defiant and submissive- Where you headed
Lookin for work
You're not from here
Naw, sir
50
Stranger wanderin around, no job- that would make you a vagrant
But 'm lookin- got a job for you
Get in the back
Sonny doesn't even think about running away
31
1ST   -  -                      31 Black   pick cotton, watched over by an armed - (
) can always use another hand
We  to see , a white planter who chews and spits tobacco, looking Sonny over as Sheriff Pugh stands by- Caught this young fella in flagrant violation of the statutes
Gawkery with intent to mope
What's he gonna run me
Three dollars a day plus you feed im lunch
Now the sentence- that depends on how long you gonna need the help
Sonny decides to speak up- don't get any trial
Sure you do, boy
And a speedy one, too
(points) Meet Judge Gatlin
Gatlin spits- Grab a sack
51
32
-  -                    32 Maceo nails a Guitar Sam  to a tree, looks over his handiwork
An   trudges into the crossroads, sweat-soaked and footsore- Maceo watches, pleased, as the black soldiers check the poster out as they pass- Saturday night, fellas
Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it
white  passes, giving Maceo a dark look
Maceo salutes- Afternoon, sir
Nice lookin bunch of soldiers
33
'  -   -              33 Delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich she's made herself
We hear   on a  somewhere in the house
She hasn't gotten two bites down before Amanda wanders in, crossing to the liquor cabinet- Oh dear,  believe it's about that time- She pulls out a   - Would you care to join me
No thank you
Amanda pours herself a glass of wine- Of course you won't join me, you don't partake
That was thoughtless of me
52
That's all right
So you don't take spirits and- what else
In your church
'm sort of between churches right now
been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but -  haven't been sanctified yet
Ah- There's been a minister in this week- The tent out by the fairgrounds
Delilah nods
Amanda takes a drink- The church  grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church
And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict
They took up serpents
've heard of that
tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified
They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family
They're good people too
When  married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives
As if 'd taken up with somebody in a cult
53
It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion
And your husband is a---
Unaffiliated
Unaffiliated
see
He has his-- social club- The Honeydripper
Such a colorful name
Yes
He must devote a great deal of his energy to it
It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then  go over and cook some when  get off here
That's very- supportive of you
Considering the sort of- environment- (defensive)  been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda
Amanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up- see- was a singer
met Tyrone in the Paradise, down in Shreveport, China Doll was only two- Delilah considers, struggling to express who Ty is- 54
was just kind of livin along, you know, drinking more than  ought-- then Tyrone
It was like a light come into my life
Delilah turns away, embarrassed to have revealed so much- People think things because he owns the Lounge, but they don't know him
Small minds are never in short supply
She crosses to look out a window- The people in this town--- She catches herself, smiles- suppose they expected that Floyd, being from a prominent family- as prominent as is possible here in Harmony- would have chosen somebody more-- She fades away again, empties her glass- My people were very devout, but they weren't- financially successful
No shame in that
In school, if you didn't have shoes- She frowns at the memory, sighs- Oh,  forgot-- Amanda is up and out of the room
Delilah frowns at the decanter, hurries to put it away
Amanda comes back in holding a  for a young girl- 55
was going through Emily's old things the other day, and  thought this would look just darling on your China Doll- Delilah examines the dress, which is clearly for a little girl- Oh-  don't think it would near fit her, Miss Amanda
(disappointed) How old is she now
Seventeen
(shocked) Oh my-  must have lost track somewhere along the line
Seventeen
She sits, still holding the dress, sneaks a look over to where the wine decanter was- It was a very nice thought
An awkward silence that Perry Como fills inadequately at the back door, then China Doll steps in, not seeing Amanda right away- Mama
They need you at- Delilah shifts her eyes to indicate- Oh, 'm sorry, Miss Amanda didn't know you was home
(smiles) China Doll
We were just recalling-    you used to play right here under this table
56
34
'  -                             34 Ty sits staring, mind working overtime, staring at the dead woman on the bed
He barely hears Slick talking to the undertaker behind him, busy filling out forms- There isn't any cash money  know of
She sold a good deal of the furniture, but there's still a nice- lookin sofa in the parlor
Only thing she cared for anymore was singin out to Pinetop's place- Ty looks at a large  on Bertha's Mae's cold gray hand
He touches it with a finger- You welcome to look around the house- if there's anything your Missus might like-- long as it's not something personal to me and Bertha Mae- Ty draws his finger away from the ring as if burnt- It's just- she got to go out in style, is what it is
The best you got, all the trimmins- lay it out for her
That's the way she lived it- that's the way she ought to leave it
Ty closes his eyes and buries his head in his hands- 35
1ST   -                             35 Blazing hot
Cotton chaff in the air as the prison bend to their   task, dragging long sacks behind them like snakes
Even    the  are sweating rivulets as they stand by with   their  in hand
Sonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work, wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time
, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him- 'all never done this job before
57
Can't say  have
You want to set your pins out wide, bend over from the hip- Sonny widens his stance- -and don't be bobbin up and down all the time
When you up, be up, but when you on the row, stay down
Sonny digs in and keeps low- But most important, you got to get you a rhythm
Everything in this life got a rhythm to it- even pullin cotton off the plant
Lay it out for me
Not my rhythm- your rhythm
That's between you and the day and the work you got before you
Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it
'm going so slow
You gettin paid by the pound or by the hour
'm not gettin paid at all
None of us are
Ned cackles- Then  suggest you work that into your rhythm too
calls out- 58
Let's see more pickin and less talkin over there
Gettin right on it, Boss
Ned picks his way behind Sonny
Sonny starts to rock slightly, looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain- 36
1ST                               36 The free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought them, eating lunch
Dex watches the prison laborers across the road as he  a battered   , sitting with a couple of the other men- Them boys fryin over there
That Judge Gatlin's gang- he work them people from can until can't, ever damn day, and when his fields is picked he bid em out to the neighbors
Harvest time comes round here, you sign up with somebody fast or you stay outa sight
Dex waves flies away from his face, spits- Ate a peck of dust today
Take some water
Only thing wash the dust out is whiskey
(smiles) Aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what swallowed in my life
Dex riffles the cards- What we playin for
59
Two bits a hand
That's kind of steep- Dex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players- Hell,  member playin this game one night- Memphis is Boss Crump's town, folks is gamblin before they can walk- ten dollars a hand caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on Beale Street
Got up from that table, my money was as long as train smoke- What happen to it
Dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the morning can hear- Spent it all on fine-lookin women
He calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground- Yo, Missippi- His name Hamilton
Hambone
You want in on this
He raises a matchstick in his fingers- Settle up on payday
That your deck of cards
What if it is
stay clear of it then
60
Dex stops dealing to stare at Ham, insulted- You sinuatin
Just sayin  don't want to play
There is a sudden  at Ham's feet and
he brings his stick down hard
He pulls up a , dead, by its hind legs- Looks like dinner
Rabbit is a rodent
Man eat a rabbit, might's well eat a rat
Dex snorts, disgusted, then finishes dealing
He lays the top card face up and slaps down the rest of the deck- (mutters) Simple country nigger, fraid to sit down an lose his little handful of change-- He awful big to mess with
Don't scare me none
'm a steppin razor, man, 'm trouble on two legs
We hear a  ,  - Your draw, Junebug
And don't be drippin sweat on my cards
(
) Excuse me, folks- They turn to see Maceo leaning out of the window of Ty's old Ford, a Guitar Slim  taped to the side of it- Yall heard about the show we puttin on at the Honeydripper Saturday night
61
37
-                                     37 very modest wooden house with a porch
on inside- 38
-  -                           38 Ty and China Doll sit as Delilah lays dinner on the table
She is dressed to go out- expect there'll be a nice turnout for Bertha Mae tomorrow
Folks who wouldn't have nothin to do with her when she was alive
Some of them, maybe
You still got to pay your respects
Slick gonna have to find him a new ride
That's a terrible thing to say- That's how the man gets over, is all, sugarin up to some woman got a job or a bankroll- It's no way to live
Just how it is out in the world, baby- man got to walk through the gates of Hell to get a piece of cheese
He stares moodily, unnoticing as she lays his plate in front of him- You're not so young any more, lose hold of what little you got- He just shakes his head- 62
If you lose the club 'm sure you'll find something else
In this town
Like what
Delilah proceeds cautiously- You know anytime you want  could get Miss Amanda to ask her husb- "Watch yo feet, Mr
Mayor,  done just mopped the flo
" Delilah tries to ignore this- You work so hard at the Lounge, and what it brings in- Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver
know
didn't say that
You didn't have to
Delilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood- It'll just have to work out, then
strained silence
Delilah crosses to the back door- Meetin gonna start without 'm there
Your soul not the one needs savin, baby
She gives Ty a lost look, steps out
The screen door slams
China Doll sees how worried Ty is- 63
It's all gonna be fine, Daddy
Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar Sam comin to Harmony
39
-  -                        39 sings at the front of the - tent, a of salvation-seekers filling the benches- Mother died- Yes she died and left me It was long- long time ago Oh but  searched Searched her record over found mother just had to go Oh she cried son, Son don't you worry Oh you know the Lord Always fix a way Delilah arrives at the rear of the tent, finds herself a spot on a bench- She left me standing Standing along the highway Oh wondering- which way  must go
watches his singers, clapping out time with his big hands- As  walked- All along the highway was seeking my Lord each day She left me standing Standing along the highway Just wondering- which way must go
`Amens' and other sounds greet the end of the song
Reverend Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around at the souls gathered- 64
The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray
He gets an `Amen
' from someone in the crowd- It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits
The congregation start to get into it, , rocking with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their   that advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night-- It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan
That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow
The Reverend picks up speed- We got to get on that other road
The one that leads to salvation
The one that leads to glory
The one that leads to the right hand of God
Praise His name
Praise the Lord
The thoroughfare 'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow
() 65
(cont'd) Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way
Several people in the audience are up and  now, getting into the Spirit
Reverend Cutlip shifts gear, filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning- But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey
There's many a loved one got to be left behind
Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness
We  on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all very personally- (
) You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation
You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between
40
-                                            40 We  past  full of black - (
) Tulsa aint so bad but for the smell- (
) Got them stockyards near the jail- (
) That's right- and the flies
Course,  had me in a cell in Georgia once, six other men, didn't have no window atall
(
) Must of got caught on one a them freights
66
Sonny is in a big   with the other conscripted He hangs on the bars as behind him men pitch pennies, while Ned and another veteran jailbird, , compare lodging experiences- Yeah, aint no free ride allowed through Georgia
And the food there- Paltry- Paltry aint the word for it
Breakfast was a joke, lunch was a rumor- -and dinner was a anecdote
(laughs) Spose you been locked in that box
Or one just like it
Sonny begins to  softly, almost to himself- Well you wake up in the morning Hear the bing-bong ring- Walk up to the table And see the same damn thing All Imonna tell you Knife, a fork and a pan If you say a thing about it You're in trouble with the Man The men join him on the chorus- Let the Midnight Special Shine its light on me Oh let the Midnight Special Shine its ever-lovin light on me- Sonny turns to face them- You a singer, young man
67
Singer, guitar player- Imonna be on the radio some day
People gonna know my name
(chuckles) Keep thinkin that way, young man
Judge Gatlin don't choose to work you into your grave, you just might do it
Sonny ponders this, looking back out through the bars, singing more moodily now as we   from the cell- If you ever go to Houston Don't you stagger don't you fight Cause the Sheriff will arrest you You're in the cooler for the night- 41
'  -  -                     41 We hear the slow   Bertha May as we see China Doll applying polish to Bertha Mae's fingernails- 42   /
'  -                           42 We   through the house, looking at and  of her singing in her glory days, finally  out onto the  where Slick sits glumly on the steps and the undertaker stands in his black suit, looking at his watch as  begin to pass into the house- 43

-                                     44 Ty and Maceo help carry the coffin down a dirt road, Slick walking at the head of the mourners following it- 68
45
-                                       45 as- Hands grip ropes as the coffin is lowered into the - Reverend Cutlip speaks a eulogy- Slick tries to keep it together- Scratch and Lonnie watch the ceremony from a tree branch- Ty looks at his watch, slips away from the funeral party
Delilah notices, frowns
Reverend Cutlip takes note as well- shovel digs into piled dirt- Dirt is tossed down upon us and the screen goes
46
-                               46 Ty waits for a train, still in his mourning suit
We on his face- tense, preoccupied with his schemes to save the club- Hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed
Ty whirls around-- somehow he didn't see Possum, sitting on a bench behind him, guitar in his lap
That's right
She lived it how she sang it
Ty tries to ignore him, looks down the rails- Waitin for somebody
Ty is silent
Aint nobody on that train gonna change your luck, Tyrone
Gonna have to save your own self
69
(annoyed)    What you know about anything
Oh, nothin much
Ty steps away
Possum speaks quietly- But  know you from way back
Possum starts , a dark, moody, slide-guitar blues
Ty looks toward Possum, not happy he's there, then looks away
The  gets , , Possum  and , stomping his foot- We  on Ty's face, tighter, tighter, then  : -  - 47                                                                47 We're in a    - smoke, heat, packed bodies- Possum's grows   more intense as we   on  - young, with slick   hair a moustache and tons of attitude
He sneers, flicks his   cigarette almost straight at us
We   on  , also swearing, stepping away from his piano- Guitar Man hands his guitar to one of the eager  standing close, hoping for a fight- stands to one side, looking scared and excited, covering her mouth with her hands- Young Tyrone steps in to meet him, the  around almost pushing them together- Guitar Man pulls out a
Young Tyrone grabs for it and they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance- breaks the spell
-  - 48                                                                48 Possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen- The  again as the
Ty takes a deep breath, hoping- 70
49
/2ND   -                      49 Mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw the coffin carried
Reverend Cutlip sidles up to Delilah- mournful end for a wayward sinner
She always seemed at peace with herself
The company she kept, the life she led- never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul
The Reverend is not too pleased with Delilah's forgiving attitude- We're all hoping to see you get over and accept the Lord tonight, Delilah
'm hoping so too
Cutlip nods toward the  as they pass the , picking cotton under guard- You been lingering at the threshold long enough, Sister
Time to step ahead
Delilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this challenge
She passes out of frame and we see China Doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought
She looks over into the cotton field- - , Sonny bends his back with the other laborers, picking and sweating- 71
China Doll pauses, frowns as she sees it is Sonny working, a strolling past him, shotgun in hand
Sonny sees her, lowers his head in shame- 50
-                                 50 The  has just pulled into the station
pair of step out-- But nobody else
Ty feels his heart sink
Shack Thomas comes up behind him, carrying an overnight bag- Tyrone- got somebody gettin off here
Supposed to be
He halts by Ty for a moment, watching
Nobody else is stepping out- What's the party's name
Sam- Guitar Sam-- don't know his birth name- (impressed) He's comin here
He calls to the porters further up the platform- Yo, Nat
Guitar Sam get on this train
Naw, man
He's in the hospital back in Little Rock
Hospital
72
You know music folks- whatever he was doin, he must have done too much of it
The porters
Shack, realizing this must be a setback for Ty, pats his shoulder before he steps onto the train- Well, brother- maybe he be in tomorrow
We  Ty away from the train as Nat calls `All aboard
' and the engine gathers power
Possum sits listening to the single   he plays, as if tuning his guitar- Somebody didn't show up
(grim) Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind
We  on Possum, cackling darkly, as Ty walks away
The train  - 51
-                                        51 torn and crumpled Guitar Sam  lays on the bar counter
move on the keyboard
Ty sits drinking, brooding,  and  softly at the piano
Maceo is at the bar- Well  had my fun if Don't get well no more Well  had my fun if Don't get well no more My head is spinnin And 'm goin down slow- Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night- 73
Don't make any difference now
Got so bad,  heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses
Does pretty well for hisself, what  hear- Ty pauses on the keyboard- Somebody we could find
(shrugs) Hell,  don't know
Just a story  heard
They both go back to brooding
Ty takes a drink
He stares at the keyboard- There must have been a first one
First what
Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house
Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton
House niggers
That's how they called em
They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano- Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa
74
The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and  figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it
And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever- Ty  something like a - -him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work
This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music
Down to the bones-- And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench- Watch out now- -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he- Ty hits a  , lets it decay- And he thinks- `Lord help me, could do some damage with this
' 75
silence
Maceo is moved by the scene- Would have liked to been there mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it
Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand, distraught
This is the end for Ty, no strategies left, nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat- Mace, Imonna lose my club
Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that- got no more cards to play- Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person- (angry)  aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed- He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it into the bar and flips open
Ty and Maceo stare at the contents- What the hell that sposed to be
Maceo pulls out a home-built   , a painted white rectangle with a complicated  jury-rigged over the strings and yards of   hanging off it- Some kind of guitar
guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from
That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs
China Doll rushes in, upset- 76
They gone and arrest him
Arrested who
Sonny
The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin
Who's Sonny
Sonny that was here yesterday morning
Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him
Maceo, make a noise on that- Maceo plucks a string
Not much of a sound- It's electric- plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall  get more music out of it than that mess gonna make
Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see
You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out- He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires, also home-modified- -your amplifier
Which is what this thing must be
Sonny said he fix radios in the Army
77
Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head
Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton
Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot
What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway
Daddy- Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs- sideman- Sit over there and be all clean and polite
Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies- Old time music- Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for
He was just lookin for work
They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin
Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up
But he doesn't belong there
Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands- You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but  don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal
78
hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass
Ty has a thought
He looks over at the guitar in Maceo's hands- (thinking out loud) Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing- (
) think  fixed it good this time, Ty
Ty smiles- So he come out and plugs his ax in- He come out lookin good, from what hear
All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back- Clothes, right- Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums- You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile
(smiles) And somebody took off with the gate
Stole the whole damn register off the counter- They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they
79
Naw- it was his place that got robbed
Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show- They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted- And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they
Maceo begins to see where Ty is leading- Aw, no, Ty, we can't- Ty claps his hands together, jumps up and heads for the door- China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone
(to Maceo) Come on, man, we got work to do
Where you going, Daddy
promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam
52
'                                      52 We start on a portrait of Governor Big Jim Folsom on the wall, then   to Sheriff Pugh, feet up on the desk, a table-top  pointed at him, looking up at Ty- Why you interested in this boy
Got a job for him
Must be doin pretty good for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hirin new people on
80
Passing well, yeah- But this boy- Name is Sonny- He's payin off his debt to society right now, and if  was to pull him out of the field it would cost the county- Judge Gatlin payin three a day for prison labor
You gonna pay me four for the duration of his sentence
Which might be-
-as long as  care to make it
Well,  was counting on more of a one-time deal- if  could just rent him out for the weekend- Fifty dollars
Ty looks stricken- It's not just the money
There's legalistic principles involved here
Public safety issues- pay you Sunday morning
You pay me now or you forget about it
don't have it now
81
You think you too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone
Think you can go it by yourself
He puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his eyes- You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor- It's not a favor if  got to pay- Oh, you gonna pay all right
You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner
Same deal as  got with Toussaint
How'd that be
Ty considers
He doesn't have any options- (deadpan)    You'll get the fifty
(smiles)    And that wife of yours- (wary)   Delilah- Them fried chicken sandwiches- if was to come by, now and then, check up on my interests- She be happy to fix you whatever you want
My wife's cookin would gag a maggot
Different people got different kinds of talents
Sheriff Pugh heaves himself to his feet- 82
Lurleen aint discovered what hers is yet
Let's go fetch that boy
53
2ND   -  -                         53 in a deputy's arms- - Faces dripping sweat, prison gang pickers stoop to their work- Ty stands by his beat-up old Ford at the side of the road, watching, remembering
few of the   look up, curious, as Sonny is led over- This the one
Ty nods, looks to Sonny- You got any ideas about turning rabbit on me, you best get rid of em now
You payin my way out
Till Monday
How come
They get   - You like draggin that cotton sack
No
Then don't ask questions
83
Ty pulls away, leaving the less fortunate stooped in the field- 54
-                                     54 plays on the  as Nadine masterfully works her and Maceo stands by uneasily
He holds up the denim jacket Sonny left at the club- This size, right, but it's got to shine
And when you need this
Tonight
(considers) That's a tall order
It's got to happen
(fishing) You know,  do my best work, my fastest work, when 'm happy
Yeah,  spose you do- Nadine looks up at him from the sewing machine- You gone make me happy, baby
Maceo nervously makes for the door- Uhm- you come by the club tonight, we havin a special show
Tell em at the door you my guest- Food aint the only thing a woman needs three times a day
(mutters) Wouldn't hurt you to skip a few meals
84
What's that, baby
Maceo turns at the open door- Boy's gonna need time to try that jacket on- see how it feels
Later, Nadine- He is gone- 55
-                                    55 Ty and China Doll stand looking at Sonny as he sits on a bar stool- You got to do somethin with this boy's head, darlin
They might not know what the real Sam look like, but it aint this
can try
China Doll looks through the beauty products she's piled up nearby- And what exactly 'm supposed to do
You gone stand up there with that contraption you got an play Guitar Sam numbers
Hell,  do that with my eyes closed
We could get the audience to close theirs we be better off
(
) Ty- Maceo pops his head in the front door- 85
tracked Mr
Trenier down- Let's hit it
Ty leaves to join Maceo- Bye, Daddy
China Doll is a little nervous to be left alone with Sonny
She puts her comb in her hand and walks around Sonny, examining his hair while he examines her face- You know what you're doing
fix Mama's hair all the time
But you aint been to that school yet
You go to school to learn your guitar
(laughs)   No
China Doll steps behind the bar- might pick up some new things at beauty school but mostly it's for my certificate, and that is `a ticket to adventure'- that's what it says in the brochure
People lookin for beauty all over the world
Sonny sees the   that come through the wall behind the bar
China Doll searches around- You want to watch out for them wires sticking down- don't look safe
86
(shrugs) Yeah- power's always going out, people getting shocks and whatnot- Somebody ought to fix it
She searches under the counter for something- ` career in beauty is like money in the bank
' Says that in the brochure too
Plus it isn't physically taxin
Yeah,  can't see no pretty thing like you behind a plow
had the rheumatic fever when was little, left me with a weak heart
Oh
Mine been actin funny too- since  laid eyes on you
She acknowledges his flirting with a little smile and comes up with a   full of clear - What's that
Just some ole moonshine they keep around
China Doll crosses back to Sonny- (concerned) What you gonna do with it
They always joke about how this stuff'll straighten your hair right out- She twists the lid off, sniffs the liquid, reacts to its strength- 87
Imonna just make yours relax a little
56
56 , an older musician with a permanently stoic expression, sits watching his pupil, a  , torture the with a
He glances up at Ty and Maceo, trying not to plug their ears as the boy continues to - Mr
Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with
Time doesn't seem to react to the flattery- Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden
Played with most all of em down there
And King Oliver- One band falls apart you find yourself another one
Never any shortage of bands, down New Awlins
didn't know you was givin lessons
Pays the rent
Almost
You interested in a playin job
Your place
(tentative) It's uhm- backin up a man on the electric guitar
88
(shrugs)     If you can pay,  can play
Got to dress sharp
No need to say this to Time Trenier
You could cut yourself on the creases on his pants- It aint like a all-night thing- you just start out and there's gonna be a accident- Ty shoots Maceo a look- Accident
Sudden loss of power
Lights out
(shrugs again)      It's your gig, man
Eight o'clock
This aint colored people time and it sure aint New Awlins time
mean eight o'clock on the money
If you got the green 'm on the scene
That's a deal then
You know any drummers
(nods)     'll bring you one
Nothin fancy, he just got to keep time- Time is my name
Ty and Maceo wince as the kid hits a particularly  - 89
57
, 2ND   -          57 The free pickers are lined up at the side of the road- white  sits behind a wooden table in front of the transport truck and pulls cash from a  , consulting a thick  in front of him as he pays the pickers off
Sheriff Pugh observes, his patrol car parked nearby
Ham has come to the head of the line, Junebug behind him- Twenny-four, twenny-five, twenny- six, twenny-seven, twenny-eight
Make your mark here- (softly)   Owe me thirty
Book says twenny-eight
Dollar fifty every hundred pound, and  picked- Two dollars deducted for stones
didn't put no stones in the sack
We mill the cotton, there's always stones
But there wasn't none in my sack- We take off two dollars a week, always have
Aint that right, Junebug
Junebug knows it's useless to complain- Yes suh
Been that way my whole life
90
Ham is furious but has nowhere to go with it- You gonna take your pay, son, or give it up to charity
Ham swipes his pay off the table, stalks away
Sheriff Pugh glares after him
We  Ham as he crosses to the rear of the truck
Dex sits on the tailgate, grinning at him- Wouldn't let nobody mess with my money like that
They took the same two dollars off yours
Yeah, and you could pave a highway with the rocks  threw in that mess
He catches the eye of Lucille, standing nearby- You country nigros let the crackers run you like dogs- Ham grabs Dex by the shirt front and yanks him close, hissing in fury- That sheriff wasn't here 'd snap your neck, boy
(
) Don't let me stop you
Ham turns to see Sheriff Pugh standing behind him, a wry smile on his face- But first you gonna sign that ledger like you sposed to
Don't want nobody cryin they didn't get their due
91
58
-                                       58 Ty is repairing the little  with hammer and nails- (
) Mr
Purvis
(doesn't look up) People call me Ty or they call me Pinetop
Mr
Pinetop to you
(
) just wanted to tell you- preciate the opportunity
Ty looks up to see Sonny with his hair pressed under a tight cap made from an old - Right
know ever one of Guitar Sam's songs- know the chords, know the words- That's fine
Sonny begins to stroll around the edge of the club, looking at  and  on the walls- China Doll said how you was famous once
Ty is pleased at his step-daughter's bragging, but doesn't show it- was known, but  was never what you call famous
How'd you get your start
Ty sighs, sits back from his work- 92
Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin
used to come out and play his left hand for him
How old you were
(shrugs) Thirteen, fourteen
This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp
They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories
(shakes his head) There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air
You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows
Sonny stops by a poster for the ` featuring Tyrone "Pinetop" Purvis'- This is you- Big band days, on the road
If a railroad train run through it, we played it
(reading) `Reginald Erskine'
Don't believe  ever heard of him- Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee
Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway
And you were the piano man
93
Piano man, arranger, you name it
That must of been somethin, see the country first class
don't know about first class, but we seen the country
How come you stopped
(shrugs) Got tired of carrying another man's water
Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas
He bangs the last nail in- Met Delilah and wanted something of my own
Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr
Pinetop
won't let you down tonight
Ty looks at Sonny, considers telling him what the plan is- No-    don't spose you will
Ty gets up and goes into the back
Sonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall behind the counter and snaking off in every direction
He grabs hold of one, thinking- 59
-                                   59 Delilah is in her kitchen,  a   to herself, apron on as she begins to make a pie
She pulls a down from the shelf, flips the lid off- about half full
She starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out- a small
She picks it up to put it aside, then frowns at the way it feels
She shakes flour off, unzips it- 94
Nothing inside
60
-                               60 Maceo loads bottles of beer into the , wincing as the sounds of a   blast in from the bar- (
) How could you do that
(
) Imonna put that back and double- (
) You don't go gamblin with my baby's money
(
) had to send off the advance pay or the man don't come and play- (
) don't care what you took it for, saved that money up for China Doll- Delilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room, pursued by Ty, trying to explain- -and you got no business puttin your fingers on it
China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job
There's got to be some line you won't cross, some thing you won't do- The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe 'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, - 95
Reverend Cutlip is right about you
Delilah slams the back door as she storms out
Ty turns and
kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar
Maceo opens a beer with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development- 61
-  -                           61 We hear the revival meeting   an upbeat number as Opal, dressed for Saturday night, checks herself out in a spotted, cracked  and works on her make-up- (
) You got to choose Got to choose tween the fire and the Light 62
-  -                            62 Luther struts around a corner in the black section of town, dressed up to party
Behind him we see a half-dozen other    , all decked out, moving toward the railroad tracks- (
) You   got to choose Got   to choose tween the fire and the   Light All   you sinners Got   to choose tween the fire and the   Light 63
-                            63 trio of   share a mirror, spiffing up their uniforms to go out on leave- (
) No earthly love Is gonna make it right
You got to choose- 96
64
-                         64 Dex, dressed to go out, pulls a  out from under the cot he sits on
He lifts the lid to reveal an old
38 - (
) Got   to choose tween the world and the   Lord You   got to choose Got   to choose tween the world and the   Lord 65
-                         65 We  toward the barracks-like housing for itinerant workers as  come out, cleaned up and ready to celebrate- (
) All you sinners Got to choose tween the world and the Lord Ham walks alone
We see him stuff his  of single dollar into one pocket, tuck a   into the other
He passes a telephone pole and we  on the Guitar Sam tacked up on it- (
) Train is leavin Better jump on board
66
-                                 66 Delilah arrives at the revival tent, the  already - You got to kneel Got to kneel for the Savior and pray You got to kneel Got to kneel for the Savior and pray 97

fill the yard in front, heading into the Honeydripper
Metalmouth collects   at the door,  passing hands- (

68
-                                  68 Maybe fifty people are in the club already, mostly  and , with more arriving all the time- Ty stands watching the crowd, tense, not at all confident that any of his scheme is going to work- group of twenty of the black  from the base step in- Maceo comes over and lays a hand on his shoulder- Natives gettin restless
How we doing
We gonna be full up
But the food- Delilah comin in
Ty's expression gives him the answer- What if  lost her
She won't let you down, Ty- This aint gonna work, is it
We just got to play it out and see- 98
(calling)    Guitar Sam
They look out at the growing crowd
Ty is grim- See if you can push another round of drinks while  stall em
Then you gonna bring him out
Dex is joined by several  in the club, calling out- Sam
We come to hear the guitar man play
Guitar Sam

He wants you to stand up

Many of the congregation are up on their feet, clapping and testifying- Is there anyone out here tonight gonna answer His call

Delilah is standing, tears running down her cheeks, filled with the emotion of the moment- The fire is heatin up, Brothers and Sisters, and Judgement Day is nigh
Aint no time to hesitate, you got to come on down and take Him into your heart
Delilah starts to walk down the aisle- That's right- come on down
They no turning back now- feel the Lord's hand at your back- got to leave all them sinners behind
Delilah stops in the middle of the aisle, trembling, unsure- (sees her) You got a voice in your heart, Sister- that's the Lord talking

You just got to move your feet and get there

-   -                         70 China Doll fusses with Sonny's hair after he hangs his guitar, dangling with electrical hookups, over his head- You look good
Ty steps back in with them, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief
He looks Sonny over- his hair slick and shiny, the outfit Nadine sewed up for him tight and sparkling- (impressed) Damn- 100
He looks good, doesn't he Daddy
Honey,  want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge
And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear

Okay
She starts away- China Doll- Yeah
You know there aint a thing in this world  wouldn't do for you
Even if  mess up sometimes, you know that, right
China Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but pleased to hear it
The  for Guitar Sam grow from the floor- know that, Daddy
You go on, now
China Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny- Well, you look like something might of come outa New Orleans- 101

Where the electricity comes in
It was all- (
) Ty
They turn to see Maceo stepping in, concerned- We got a situation out there- You don't think  know that
Got the law in the house
71
-                               71 Sheriff Pugh stands near the piano, putting a considerable damper on the mood in the room
Ty hurries out to him, with a panic-stricken smile on his face- Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon
(looking around) Got a nice crowd in here tonight, Tyrone
See them army uniforms- Yeah, well we got ourselves this special attraction, see, and- Chicken
Huh
102
Them ribs outside smell real good, but  got my heart set on some of your Delilah's fried chicken
Right- She made it last Saturday at the mayor's but ole Clayford Gentry was up from Eufala and he got the drumsticks
Sheriff Pugh is distracted for a moment as Opal and the girls from the store step in, dressed to the nines, drinking up the eyeball action from the pickers and soldiers- 'm partial to dark meat
See, the thing is- She is back there cookin, aint she
Our agreement was- The situation we got, Sheriff, what with this special guest come up from Louisiana- what it means is- uhm- Ty has nothing, the crowd is starting to  for Guitar Sam again
He wipes his forehead- Maybe if you were to come back in- Regular or spicy
Delilah is there, smiling at Pugh, pulling her coat off- They both take the same time to fix up,  just got to know which
Ty and Delilah exchange a long look- 103
Have to make mine regular
like the spicy fine but it always come back to nip me later
She shoots a look to Ty- It's important not to bite off more than you can chew
(to Pugh) Yall just make yourself at home
She kisses Ty on the cheek and heads for the kitchen- Good luck tonight, baby
Slap some maynaise on it
Ty smiles, his nerves all gone now- (pointing) Might want to wait over there, Sheriff
Don't want to scare off the customers- from the crowd
Sonny has wandered uncertainly out onto the stage
Oh Lord- Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar- Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped around the wires coming out of the wall
He nods to Ty- Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick   , then into the dented  sitting on a wooden chair beside him and pointed out at the crowd
Metalmouth Sims looks on uncomfortably
Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind the keyboard- So here's what you all been waitin for, people, the noted performer and recordin star- 104
- Time Trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case, hat on his head, exuding his no-sweat attitude
Beside him is , a kid who can't be more than 14, wearing a fedora- (
) -direct from New Orleans, Louisiana- -Guitar Sam
emits from the amp as Sonny makes the connection- Sheriff Pugh cover his ears- The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained faces- Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the settles to a
Sonny frowns at the amp- Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train
The audience is stone-faced
Could this really be the man
Young Henry steps up and sits behind the  , pulling sticks from inside his shirt- Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat- China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at the door- Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage, worried- Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the under control- Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear- What's this fool playin at
105
Maceo isn't going to wait to find out
He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm
He looks to the stage, panicked- -as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open- Sonny  and leans into his microphone- Gonna hold may baby as tight as can Tonight she'll know 'm a mighty man
Have you heard the news
There's good rockin tonight
Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to play along
Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins- Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out
Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off- Have you heard the news
There's good rockin tonight
Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward- Thank you, Jesus
Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other- Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry 'll do you no harm The crowd is already  and  in time with the song
Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time- Make sure to bring my rockin shoes Tonight 'm gonna rock away all of my blues
106
Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his lips and  right on the beat to take the sax break, walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand
Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to  a modified jitterbug, people spreading to give them room- Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner paying special attention to Opal's hip action- As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica
Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer- Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and  his soul out, grabbing the break from Time
The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand
Sonny shakes out the long  attached to his guitar- China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music
Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it  as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter
He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind
Lonnie and Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the - 72
-                                    72 Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaint's, beers in hand, staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny steps out  with a  behind him- What the hell is that
Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays, a  stopping short of running him over
107
He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a  from the other direction stopping to blast him with its
Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the  emptying out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the Honeydripper, still playing- We got to check that out
couple dozen patrons move away with him
We  on the doorway as    comes out to look, puzzled and angry- 73
-                                     73 Time and Metalmouth  into the same microphone as Sonny plays his way back up to the stage- Have you heard the news
There's good rockin tonight- Have you heard the news
There's good rockin tonight- We  as Maceo hustles back and forth, trying to keep up with orders for ribs, bring cold beers out from the icebox, etc
He suddenly stops in his tracks- Nadine stands before him, looking fatally sexy in a she no doubt made herself
Oh my soul
Don't tire yourself out, Poppa
You an me got bidness together
believe we do
He hurries past with his arms full of beer, pivoting to check her out from another angle- Dex sees across the room, frowns- Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar, leaning in close to be heard over the music- 108
heard the news- There's good rockin tonight
Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild- , ,
Alla you men grab hold of a woman
You can't find a woman, just grab hold of yourselves- we gonna play this one slow and tight
Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light Boogie
Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and Ty joins in at the piano- They   did   the boogie real   slow With   the   blue lights way   down low They   did   the boogie real   slow With   the   blue lights way   down low Ty joins him- They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low Ty takes the verse- went to a party With a bobby sox started swingin All she would do was rock As they join in the chorus, Ty sees- Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a proprietary air
Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar
Maceo sees as well, tightening up- Cool Breeze nods to Ty
slow, sexy   comes up and Ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar
When he gets there Maceo is already counting out a huge pile of - 109
Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty
And they's another fifty in here- Maceo thunks a heavy   full of change onto the countertop- Lucky Hardaway don't mind some change, does he
Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty instead- What if Mr
Hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change, he wants the club back one way or the other
Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working- How'd that be
Well- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner
Ty shifts and we   to see across the room to Sheriff Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from Delilah
Ty smiles and waves- Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms- That sheriff your partner
(sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly
Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter- You must want this club awful bad, brother
Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear- 110
You maybe know this already, but that aint no Guitar Sam
He steps away just as the song ends to , Ty taking a deep sigh of relief
Sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song- (
) You is a lie
shocked silence
The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage
He points a bony finger at Sonny- You is a lie, boy
known Sammy since he's drinkin mama's milk, hell,  known his Mama herself when she live up to Plaquemine- and you aint him
The audience looks to Sonny for his defense- Ty holds his breath
Maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar
Sonny just smiles- That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin bout, Pops
'm Delta Guitar Sam
Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs- As long as we straight on that
Get on outa there and let the man play
of  to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back to his microphone- Imonna play you one  come up with today while  was havin my hair cut- He starts into a bouncy  that Metalmouth joins in with, then starts to  as the crowd starts to dance and clap- 111
Oh China Doll Can't get you offa my mind
Oh China Doll can't get you offa my mind
If you be my baby Gonna leave all them others behind
The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant groupies- but we  to China Doll, transfixed, as she is drawn toward the stage- Oh China Doll Think about you day and night
Oh China Doll think about you day and night
Can't forget you baby Oh when you gonna treat me right
Time Trenier steps in for a growling  - Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room- - The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door
The last person he passes turns toward Ty- Possum
But then  cross in front and he is gone
Ty frowns, troubled
Under the sax now we hear a dissonant , the haunting notes Possum was playing at the train station
Ty searches the crowd- The   continues underneath as we  across the crowd dancing- There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty
112
We  on
Why is he here
- Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each other's face
We   tighter and tighter on the young men, body language telling us a fight is about to break out- Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to reach them and the  come again, the growing echoey and menacing- -  - 74                                                               74 The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the- - falls to the floor, , and the- -Guitar Man falls to his hands and knees, his stomach a bloody mess, crawling on all fours and  and Young Tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and the Girl - -  - () 75                                                               75 -which becomes Time    into the microphone- -and Dex reaches for his pistol- -and Ham reaches for his knife, but- -a huge, strong hand clamps down on Dex's wrist- -and another huge hand grabs Ham's wrist
Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron
113
lighter, bouncier    has replaced the sax now
Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised pickers- Yall in my house, here, gentlemen
Don't have no fightin, don't have no killin, don't have none of that dismal nonsense in my house
Understand
What's your name son
Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm- Dex- Dexter Moncrief
And you
Hamilton Drinkwater
Well, gentlemen, this is the night there won't be no pitiful song written bout you two killin each other
Don't nothin rhyme with `Moncrief' anyhow
Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard  in one hand and the   in the other- Got a problem here
These young men seem to brought something in for our collection
(to Dex)   Yours first
Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before laying it in the box
He turns his attention to Ham- Now yours
He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box- Yall still need to mess with each other, you go outside and do it
114
Ty lets go of their wrists- This world is full of people got no use for us, like to see us in the grave
We don't need to give em any help
The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into opposite corners- Sonny keeps playing- Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart
Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart
surrender darlin loved you from the very start
Ty rushes to the piano, joins in jamming with the other players- 76
-                                          76 Slick sits on a tomb, drinking wine,  spilling over Bertha Mae's fresh-dug
He listens to the  in the far distance- Sound like the music movin on again, darlin
The way it always do
He listens for another moment, sighs- Time to make room for whoever comin next
115
77
-                                   77 The   next to the Honeydripper sign
We hear the of a distant
The parking lot is empty but for Ty's old Ford- Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front
He pastes a that says
across the Guitar Sam poster- (
) That boy can play some
Ty turns
Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped
You leavin
Aint needed round here no more
Where you headed
(smiles)     Oh-- down the road
Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment
(
) Tyrone- Ty turns as Maceo steps out, equally tired and unshaven- Who you talkin to out here
Maceo looks down the road, but Possum is nowhere to be seen
Ty shrugs- Just myself
78
-                        78 Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again
Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the board- -and begins to
Fast, rhythmic boogie piano- 116
Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling wire
He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack, plugging himself in
He looks to Lonnie, who nods, and then- -he begins to  in time with Lonnie
We   and away from them, the  spilling out over the field- It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll
