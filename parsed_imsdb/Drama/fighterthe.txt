Still hear metal scraping against asphalt
then it stops
, a wheelbarrow filled with 250 pounds of black asphalt edges into frame, followed by the guy sweating, struggling as he pushes it,  "" , 31, short, compact, close-cropped reddish-blonde hair, little boy face, glancing over his shoulder, dumps the wheelbarrow on old cracked cement
picks up a scraping- spreading tool on a metal broom stick, and commences to spread out the new asphalt
Trying to complete a newly paved road to the right which ends in this intersection
The scraping tool spreading the new asphalt
Micky sweating, dirty from asphalt
Now skinny bare arms start shadowboxing around Micky working
Only the arms enter frame in combinations, shadow punches
(ignoring punches, keeps ) Will you help me finish this
He turns and kinda smiles as leans away with the rake, then slips and moves with the punches being thrown by "Dicky"
, 38, Micky's half-brother, skeleton-like arms, backwards baseball cap, shorts, work boots, enters frame, shadowboxing around Micky, smiles missing teeth
The two brothers play spar, joking, having fun
Micky throws a and Dicky play snaps his head back
Then Dicky does it to Micky
Then Micky throws an upper cut and Dicky pops his head up, broken toy robot
You knocked my block off
He resets his head, punches Micky
