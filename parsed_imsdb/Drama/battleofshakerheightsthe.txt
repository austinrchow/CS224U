Written by Erica Beeney : - Muffled by the wet green forest
The very earth seems to tremble
Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air
and , closer now, mix with the rumbling in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion
lays splayed out, careless in death
pair of  flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of
For a moment the forest takes a breath
Nothing but trembling leaves
Then - The  of a Jeep Coming closer in fits and starts,  through low gears
Willys  appears,  through the undergrowth
It's driven by Private First Class
Eighteen, if that
Not much meat on him
His insignias indicate he's in the 29th Infantry
His face might be attractive, under other conditions
He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard- issue field jacket
Where the hell are those Krauts
To give himself courage, he  Tommy Dorsey's "'ll Be Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering the Jeep through the bushes and rocks
He drives straight for a fallen ,  the engine and tries to go over it
The Jeep's   catch on the log
The   spin
Kelly gets out
Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his face
Assesses the situation
He grabs a
Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever the Jeep free
When -- The  of a nearby   startles him
The branch  against Kelly's weight
He slips and falls in the mud
Shit
Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest
Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods
Pauses against a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun
Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned
But not for long, as    appear around the corner of it
Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation
Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk
Kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move
They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be
Their Karabiners rest slung across their backs
Bingo
Kelly focuses himself
Then he shoulders his carbine
Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly
"And so they buried Hector, breaker of horses
" He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917  from his pistol belt and steps out into the   in plain sight of the guards
Surely he knows they can see him
He must want them to see him
But they don't
Too busy passing nudie wallet photos
Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it
Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself an easy target
Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get himself killed
Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans,  into the air and waves -- -- when from behind him comes a voice
(
) Eine maus findet den kase
Kelly whips around to face a third German, the
His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young face
Point blank range
Only - Kelly doesn't fire
He just lowers the pistol
The German smiles
Kill me Adolf
Mien Prisoner
The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come running
One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes him into the barn roughly
Kelly doesn't struggle
Hey, Siegfreid and Roy
What are you waiting for
Kill me
Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up
One of the Germans shines a flashlight in his face
Kelly squints
Come on you pussies
Let's get this over with
The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain pen
(German accent) You will write your mother
Tell her how you will die now
Kelly takes the pen and examines it
Genuine Third Reich issue, no less
Nice work
The Officer pokes the paper
You will write
How you die alone
My mother and  don't have that kind of relationship
(hisses) Write
Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't he - but sighs and begins writing
After a few lines, the Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an Infantryman
Enough
Now you will beg for your life
What don't you understand
(interrupts sheepishly in German accent) The protocol says we should - The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker
He seems to be getting a bit hysterical
am the fucking protocol
(to Kelly) Beg
He and Kelly glare at each other
The Officer  his Luger into the rafters
Beg - for - your - life
You got to be kidding me
The Officer grabs his throat
Silence
Now  have a little fun
Kelly laughs
The officer slaps him
Kelly jerks away
Now that's against the rules
(sneers) There are no rules in war
Suddenly another   appears behind the German in the shadows
Only Kelly can see him
The  motions to Kelly "keep talking" while he gets into a better position with his -1 rifle
(to Officer) You've never killed anyone before, have you
shower in the blood of my victims -- The  shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes
Quick as a flash, the 's Colt 1911  is at the German Officer's neck, his -1 in his other hand
No wonder you smell so bad
Don't shoot, please
The 's eyes widen
He looks at Kelly
Will you look at the manners on this guy
(to German) Remember to thank me when  kill you
No, really, not in the neck - But the  does anyway
The Officer , grabs at his neck, and falls
(to Kelly) You all right
Yeah
My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway
You want me to give you a minute
That's okay
They'll get me eventually
If you can't get killed in a war, when can you
That's right
Look on the bright side
The  holds out his hand
Bart
Bart Bowland
Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy
About his own age, but  takes up more space
Kelly
Kelly Ernswiler
Kelly
(mimics) Bart
mean - that's Irish, right
(from the floor, now with a decidedly American accent) Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but  have to interrupt
(to Bart) Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck
You gave me a powder burn
Listen you wienerschnitzel
You should talk
You slapped me
'm not your bitch
The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform
Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about
Well it didn't work, now did it
(shrugs) Sometimes  get so caught up in the moment
And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother
The Officer grins
Inspired, wasn't it
Dude, you made him write to his mother
Who are you, Dr
Phil
(also with American accent) Can we get up now
Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex
Might as well
There's only an hour left anyway
The German Officer crosses his arms
(to Kelly) Admit it
You were scared
(snorts) Right
Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over
His legs are still tied
The   gets up and walks off with the  and some other , done for the day
Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep
That Willys yours
Yup
Just got her
Three summers packing out at Shop Rite
Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt
Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood
Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas
The Jeep finally pulls free and  Bart with mud
My bad
Thanks though
Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away
See you
Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked
About a hundred feet away Kelly stops
Well, come on
Bart walks towards the Jeep
Kelly backs it up again
couldn't resist
Bart climbs in
Real funny, Ernswiler
You might still get your chance to die today
- The customers are all
Some Yanks, some Germans, a few Scottish and North African irregulars
"Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox
Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together
Bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures
Kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food
Character building
Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock
(shrugs) That's what you get for invading Wisconsin
-Day at Kenosha was nothing
At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria
That's crazy
They both eat for a minute
Where do you live, anyway
Shaker Heights
That explains the death wish
Me too
What street
Penn Place
(chewing) Hmm, don't know it
It's not technically in Shaker Heights - but  go to Shaker Heights High
Pause
Kelly looks at Bart
Langely Prep
Sorry to hear that
Well,  got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop
Of course
would have gone to Langely myself only my polo pony had the fits
Bart throws his napkin on his plate
No matter
(raises his voice to address the room) We're all soldiers here
That's right
/Here, here
/ Whooping, cheers, etc
- Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive
Bart's house is fancy
nice yard and a pool
Bart hops out
You should come over some time
Service our lawnmower
would, but then  might soil my croquet whites
You understand
How bourgeois
Cheerio then
Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself
- Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed of
It is smaller and weirder
The flowers and bushes are overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning at precarious angles
Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway
- Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois
The Jeep looks good as new
He pulls a canvas cover over it
Sleep tight Hot Lips
,  - Kelly walks in on his dad  making sandwiches
great big pile of cheese and &
Sergeant Keller
How was the war
Did we win
Kelly doesn't smile at this
He looks at the sandwiches and puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's downright angry
Let me guess
Happy Meals for the wavy gravy wellness center
Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf
He looks kind bit ill-used by life
The phrase "rode hard and put away wet" comes to mind
As usual, your cynicism is refreshing
He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile
Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator
His back tightens
He slams the door with his foot
As usual, your cheerful optimism makes me ill
Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly
The hostility is nothing new
(lightly) You should get that checked
Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door
(
) Sure thing, doc
Say hello to Leif Garrett for me
- Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in
family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases at long worktables
There's a , father , grandmother -,  and
Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it
All of them are portraits of animals
Some have on hats or clothes
Kelly's mom  shows grandmother - a few strokes with a paintbrush
Eve wears jeans
She's one of those young-looking mothers Kelly's friends would have crushes on
If he had any friends
(to Kelly) Son of Eve
You are very dirty
(awkward) rough charge
You know
(to Kelly) Don't touch anything
We have to get ready for the Starving Artist show
(to Xiou-Xiou) Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy - see
Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French court dress
Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder
Now you try
Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting
(to Kelly) She loves the gold
Always overuses it
And usually her touch is so light
- Gold is the color of the sun
Eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings in progress
You know why we never have anything to eat in this house
But Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting
She's not paying attention to Kelly
Mao, what did we say about the eyes
She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style, lots of pastels, very abstract
Mao looks at her quizzically
More - empathy
That's right
And didn't  tell you to put in more cacti
(shakes head) No, no more cacti
Too busy
Simplicity is best
His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement
Eve rolls her eyes
Oh boy
'm not having this battle with you again
Kelly breaks in
Because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in Cleveland
Eve moves down the line
Well, you can always chip in here
We're ordering pizza later
At this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased with the news
No
Some people have to work later
(casual) Will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow
Eve looks up at him for the first time
Takes in his filthy uniform
Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things
Nothing's changed
It's the only thing  ever ask you for -- Don't be dramatic
But it's important to me
Eve stops at Mother Ling's painting
You're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, guess
(to Mother Ling) No - not that way - the sky should be stormier
Angry clouds
Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling
She smiles and nods, understanding
Why do  bother
Kelly leaves
Eve's busy talking
More brown, less blue
- Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile
Now Keller, who needs that sandwich more - you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life
Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich
How about the son of a heroin addict trying to get ready for work
Kelly leaves with the sandwich
Abe sighs and picks up more bread
That went well
'  - On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to one of Led Zeppelin
Some maps
globe
Models of fighter planes and a set of old tin soldiers
Oh yeah, and his mom's  , the one that started it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes
He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece
- Ah, the graveyard shift
Musak Steely Dan
Kelly unpacks cat food
Thousands and thousands of little cans of it
It's hard to keep the rows straight on the shelves
, the night cashier, stands at her register
She's plain- looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures out who she is
Not another soul in the store
Sarah wanders over to Kelly's aisle as if pulled by a magnet
So how'd your battle go today still don't understand how you could reenact the Battle of the Bulge in seventy-two degree weather
(plays with hair) Didn't all those guys freeze to death
Kelly doesn't stop working
He's got a system
Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a couple of guys
That's gross
War is hell
Kelly grabs another handful of cans
Then why do you do it
Kelly pauses
He puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately
You're never more alive then when facing simulated death
Really
Maybe  should try it
Kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up
You are William
Stone of the 1st Airborne, pinned down in Noville
The Germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily
(starts throwing cans) You're holed up in a stone barn
Sustaining heavy casualties
Running low on ammo
The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies
Sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans
Your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies
At 1 p
m
you lose radio contact with headquarters
If you withdraw, the Germans will flank the entire Allied forces arrayed along Bastogne and break the front
What do you do
What do you do
Stop it
Kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied
Battle of Bulge, the Southern Shoulder, December '44
Sorry  asked
Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a peace offering
Hey
Want a snack
We got a whole shipment in of busted Oreo's
Sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it
'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there
Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical
The frozen food woman came in with her kids
They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night
One of the kids looked like cardboard
Do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food
No
Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food
He fishes for a cookie
Next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food
An   pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart
Is this store open
've been waiting up front
If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours
Sarah gets up
Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a cookie
Sorry about that
have a lot of coupons and  don't want to be here when they expire
(to Sarah) Charge her double for everything
Sarah smiles and hurries away
- Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue  slung over one shoulder
Besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal
No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker
As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices  -- short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend  embracing a few lockers down
They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths
Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing
What the fuck are you looking at, Jane
Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker
No really, what makes you think you can look at me
honestly didn't know it was you thought it was a free preview of the Spice Channel
That's pretty funny
You got dental insurance
Kelly closes his locker and walks away
Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily
Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers
Stop it
She walks away
What
What
-- The lights are off in history class
The teacher
shows slides on the Civil War
The more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials
Mr
Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot
He clicks the remote and a photo of his , crouched over and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on screen
Whoops
He hurries through to the next slide
It doesn't matter anyway
Everyone is almost asleep
Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more Mr
Norman talks
And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks of Union soldiers fought bravely on
They were willing to give their lives so that others might be free
Kelly shifts in his seat
Is there a problem Mr
Ernswiler
No
But Mr
Norman doesn't start talking again
He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly
Until the silence becomes uncomfortable
And Kelly gets mad
Come on
Isn't this analysis a tad simplistic
mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure - but to insist on still characterizing the Civil War as some moral struggle
The soldiers were drafted - the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way out
(losing it) Why don't you talk about the Draft Riots
Where are your slides for that
'  - Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy
Kelly sits across the desk from  , a well- groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor
What gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum
Kelly doesn't move
He's not into this
Or question your teacher
know
mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog
Not Socrates
Ms
Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of herself
He's a smart cookie
She's got to change her strategy
She leans back in her chair
Kelly, you're a very bright boy
But you're making some serious mistakes
don't need to
Everyone else makes them for me
Her chair  as she leans forward and looks at Kelly intently
This anger must be masking a lot of hurt
was wondering what the tissues were for
Holmstead tries again
She looks down at his file
see you're not going to college next year
What are your plans
Kelly shrugs
Holmstead searches his face for any clues
How do  get through to you
Advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic
She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school
Her face clears
Something's clicked
think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential
- School's been out for a while
The first rush had already left
Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking lot to his Jeep
Lance steps out from behind an  and intercepts him
You upset Bridget
Kelly hardly stops walking
Give me a break
You need to apologize
What are you going to do, make out with me
Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack
Why are you fucking with me
You little fucker
Want to play, fuckface
You just used fuck as a verb, noun, and adjective
Impressive
Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of him
Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got in his knapsack
Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back
Kelly still seems unconcerned
Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack
Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it, gleeful
Lance walks away towards his car
Kelly runs after him
Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his
They  for a minute, until Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car
Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance drives off
Finally, Kelly gives up
Lance turns out of the parking lot and  the horn
Kelly shakes his head
Rim job
- Kelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a replacement
From his post behind the counter, Bart sees him and comes over
Kelly
Hey
You work here
Just a couple days a month, to get a heads-up on the latest stuff
What are you doing
Looking for a backpack
Is that all
Don't bother
have a couple extras at home
could give you one if you want
(beat) Sure,  guess
, '  - Kelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for Bart to get the key from the desk to open the door in the corner
The door finally swings open
Bart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war memorabilia
Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened flags
Very impressive
My dad's real into hoarding
Kelly holds up a flask in a leather case
What's this
Grant's field flask
Wow
Your dad should meet my history teacher
He sent me to the principal's office today for questioning his - rated interpretation of the Civil War
Forget him
would, but now the principal's making me give a speech on the Civil War at an assembly
(laughing in sympathy and amusement) What is he, some kind of sadist
She thinks she's doing me a favor
Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up
Are you
Depends on who you ask
Everyone's got an opinion
(grabs box) Take this
That'll shut them up
Bart opens the long box
Nestled inside is a leg bone with a foot attached to it
Stonewall Jackson's
Yeah right
Can you imagine that
Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse
Unbelievable
What balls
Kelly nods
That is balls
He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing
saw a backpack in here somewhere
Bart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles
Bart and Kelly sit at the kitchen table drinking sodas, waiting for , the housekeeper, to finish making them dinner
thought he had a couple
'd feel weird taking one out of the tomb of Tutenkamen anyway
Trust me, you shouldn't
(burps) Where'd your old one go
lost it
How
pause
Kelly decides to tell him
Someone took it
You let someone take it
didn't let him
told off some idiot -- Sounds like your mouth gets you into trouble a lot
'm telling you, it's not me, it's the world
, Bart's older sister comes in
She's older
Definitely in college, if not out
And totally shockingly beautiful
Otherworldly
Tabby, this is Kelly
(to Kelly) Don't give him any money, whatever you do
Shut up
All these little old ladies are looking for him in Arizona
He took their retirement money and bought defective bazookas with it
Kelly laughs
And looks at Tabby more closely
Very funny
We're paying attention to you, are you happy now
Finally, my life is complete
Fait accompli
(to Tabby) Minnie's making sloppy joes
Want one
Sloppy joe
Sloppy no
She opens the fridge and gets a yogurt
have to go take a shower
Will you call me when Miner gets here
Tabby leaves
Kelly's distracted
Who's Miner
The fiance
Bart rolls his eyes, indicating what he thinks of good old Miner
Kelly nods, doesn't say anything
Listen, 'm going to the flea market on Saturday
have a line on a couple dealers
You could get a backpack there
Kelly glances at the door Tabby left from
Oh yeah
Flea market, land of bargains
Especially if you know who to talk to
Kelly looks at Bart with suspicion -- and respect
- Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of the school
Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro- Magnon
He wears a   , overseas airborne style, obviously Kelly's
Hey fuckface
Like my new hat just joined the Boy Scouts
The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee
If you stay in it long enough, maybe you'll get your fudgepacker badge
Ooh
The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and  him on - "You gonna take that
"/"He just called you a fag", etc
Lance frowns and grabs Kelly
You're a regular Howie Mandel
Still holding on to him with one arm, he  Kelly hard across the face with the other
Kelly's knees give a bit
Lance holds him up
Lance
Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly
Okay babe
(to Kelly) One day you and me will be alone
And won't that be nice
Kelly is hurt but covering
Too bad my mom won't let me date yet
Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes
Tries to re-wet the dry inside of his mouth with his tongue
He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs
Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door
Why do you mess with him
You're right
should give him a break
- Kelly watches  in the living room
His cheek has a nice bruise on it
Eve enters
Oh, Kelly, you're home
Good
need you to go to the art supply store for me
Kelly looks at the
Get Abe to do it
Eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her wallet
He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House
What a surprise
'll make it up to you
Where have  heard that before
Eve sighs
When are you going to give me a break
Kelly jabs at the remote
Let me think - maybe when  finally forget every single word of The Little Mermaid soundtrack 'd listen to in the car waiting for him to score
No, probably when  don't prepare myself before  go into the bathroom, expecting to find him passed out on the floor
Eve waits through this
Actually, you know what
know 'll be able to put it all behind me when go away to college
(slaps his forehead, pretend remembering) Only,  can't go because someone spent my college fund on Mexican Black Tar
So looks like 'll have to try to forget at Shop Rite, where 'll be working for the rest of my life
You're right
You have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up
But please just get me some paints first
Eve comes over to Kelly
He sighs and puts his hand out
What do you need
She gives him the money
We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue
Two tubes of blue
(looks at him) What happened to your face
She puts her hand up but he moves away from it
Forget it
- Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes
He looks up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes
He's suddenly nervous
He knocks over a few cans of thinner
Almost leaves
Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye
They're having a sale on glitter
It takes Tabby a second to recognize him
Oh, hello
What happened to you
(shrugs) Tennis injury
Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether to believe him
Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints
Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle
You paint
Well, you see
That's a difficult question
How so
don't really feel comfortable calling anything done since the Renaissance "painting
" We might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane, but our skills have suffered from it
In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this
This gives Kelly more confidence
He leans over the aisle to see what she's looking at
You're working with acrylic
Why
Oil's much - richer
Oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you
Of course not
Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them
It's just - isn't acrylic a bit - jejune
Jejune
You're jejune
How old are you anyway
Older than my years
Tabby walks to the counter with her brushes
And you paint
Kelly looks down and partially confesses
Well, you know, my mother's kind of an artist, so - That explains it
Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag
She walks out, Kelly with her, matches her pace, talking
That explains nothing
Doesn't anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore
Michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the Infanta
Infantas are Spanish
Michelangelo was Italian
Tabby gets into her car
Kelly leans into her window
Exactly
One world, one people
Just like Jesse Jackson envisioned
Tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car
Well - Kelly
Nice talking to you
She drives away
Kelly stands there watching
Then he winces
What the hell did you just say
- Kelly pulls up in his Jeep
He turns off the engine but doesn't get out
Just sits there
He doesn't want to go in
- Colored plastic flags droop in the sun
Bart sweeps his eye over everything
wearing a wife beater has some not half-bad stuff
Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass mason jar of what seems to be dirt
(to Kelly) That there's actual sand from Iwo Jima
Or your sister's sandbox
The guy shrugs
Well, it don't come with no certificate of authenticity
(considers) could write one up for you, suppose
Get it notarized
No, that's quite all right
Actually, 'm in the market for medals
Sure
got a couple purple hearts
Silver Star
Can't sell them to you though
They were gramp's
(wink) Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back
Are you sure
They have a lot of sentimental value Yeah
How much
lot
Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy, who looks inside
What's this
General Ulysses
Grant's field flask, my friend
Kelly is shocked
The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously
Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even
The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again
He goes to get the backpack
Kelly's impressed by this smooth exchange
- Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands
Kelly now holds the backpack
Buying and selling  service medals is illegal
Exactly
That's why the resale value is so high
Is that what they teach you at Langely
Don't be so naive
We all have our skeletons
Some of them just pay more than others
And 'm not even going to ask about the flask
Don't ask, don't tell
The army gets everything right, don't they
frowsy  in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of an extensive display of pins and buttons
You boys look like Goldwater fans
've never been accused of that before
Well jeez, you don't have to be insulted
Anything military
The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth lazily
Fish around in that cigar box
Bart paws through the box
Acts casual
What do you want for the box
Twenty dollars
Fifteen
Don't be so hasty
(fanning) got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins 'm looking to unload
Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market food and watch a slow-motion bingo game
Goldwater fan
think that's some kind of insult
Not at Dartmouth
Where are you going to go to school
'm not
Ah, you have that luxury
You don't
(shrugs) didn't have much say in the matter
Everything has been decided for me since birth
'm not whining about it
Play the hand you're dealt, right
Easy for you to say
You got a royal flush
Are you crazy
My life sucks
Everyone's always telling me what to do
You can't fight it
Go with the flow
They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the : -, , , -
What about Tabby
She got to go where she wanted
Sarah Lawrence
Six years
She's almost done with grad school
Yale
didn't think people actually went to Yale
(thinking) don't know
mean, she drives off in her car in September
For all we know, she could just pull her car over in Albany and sleep there until May
What do you mean
It was a joke
Joke
Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out
Oh
Is that what one of those sounds like
Somehow,  always imagined they would be funnier
Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt
Sarah Lawrence
Isn't that for lesbians
Bart shrugs
What happened to your face
Remember the backpack incident
Same guy
The one with mad cow-diseased hamburger meat for brains
That would be the one
Interested, Bart leans forward
What are you going to do about it
'm not going to lower myself to his level
Of course not
But there are alternatives
Alternatives
Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd Special Operations Wing
Kelly shakes his head
Well do you want to get this guy or what
Yes
All right
Let's get the fuck out of here, then
Bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan
Kelly watches it hit the rim and go in
(on the move) have some things to show you
,  - Bart and Kelly sit amidst a spread of books, papers, and electronic equipment
Once we've gathered the intelligence, the plan will reveal itself
We don't plan first
Bart opens a pad
No, it limits our scope - what's the objective
Humiliation
Rage
Despair
Easy enough
'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing have the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here somewhere
Bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages
Tabby enters with an armful of art supplies
Hey
have some stretcher bars out in the car
Can somebody help me bring them in
Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important
Bart doesn't look up
He grabs another book
Sure
mean, 'll help
Bart raises his eyebrow
Kelly shrugs off the look
'll find those reports
'  - Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table
Kelly dumps the bars and stands there looking around
At the wood floors and skylights
Couch covered with a sheet
Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious objects stuck to them lay against the walls
They all seem faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash
Kelly moves to the  on the easel
Very yellow and pink
Kind of looks like castles
Gold
The color of the sun
Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas
That's the Cleveland waterfront
As the viewer,  get to decide what it is, 'm afraid
And it doesn't look a thing like it
It's the light
was playing with diffusion
Well make sure you put it away when you're done with it
Very funny, wiseass
Kelly resumes his tour of the room
It must be nice to have a place like this to get away to
It is
What about Farmer
Farmer
Tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths
The boyfriend
(laughs) Miner
What about him
Is he an artist, too
No
Definitely not
Thank god
Kelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light
You said your mom was a painter
She was, well - is  guess
Tabby cuts the canvas
What do you mean
She used to be
But then my dad - wasn't working anymore so she turned it into a business
She has a family of Chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her
Like Andy Warhol's Factory
More like Andy Warhol's tool shed
It was nice before, though
My playpen used to be in her studio
Wow
So you really grew up with it
What does, did, your dad do
He's a -1 documentary without the music
"Tragedy struck
" Kelly nods
"And then, things took a turn for the worse
" Well, just wait
Those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback tour
already changed the channel
Tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him
Bart's head appears in the open door
Christ Kelly,  let you go out on a little supply line assist and you're gone for days
Come on
Have fun, boys
If only it were fun
War's deadly serious, ma'am
(to Bart) And  used to think you were the only crazy one
Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi Hannah
Bart leaves
Kelly stands by the door
This is his only chance
'm worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised
Are you
Yes
might have to come by and show you the proper safety procedures
Some time in the presence of an art prodigy would do you good
don't think  have room for a playpen in here
Ouch
Tabby smiles
Kelly leaves
- Bart and Kelly walk across the yard
So, you have a thing for my sister
What
No, no
Everybody does
They skirt around the pool
We just have a few things in common
Oh really, like what
can't tell you
It's my feminine side
You don't wear women's clothes when you're alone, do you
,   - Kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama bottoms and a -shirt
The 's on static
He sees a sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room
Then he stops, sighs, and backtracks
He turns off the
Then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch
Dad
The figure doesn't move
Kelly doesn't know what to do
(louder) Dad
Kelly looks around, worried
In this house an unresponsive dad isn't necessarily sleeping
Should he wake up his mom
He shakes the figure slightly
It rolls over, only it's not his dad
It's some scabby
Kelly yanks his hand away
Wha
moment
Sorry
,   - Abe sits on a lawn chair
Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his dad - a good distance away
They both look up at the sky
Keller
There's a meteor shower
Kelly frowns
funny thing just happened
little trip down memory lane
thought you were on our couch, dead
Abe laughs
Oh, you mean Emmett
They didn't have an empty bed for him at Care House
Kelly nods, considering this
Well that's one of your more brilliant ideas
(anger rising) Have you thought about the fact that it might be dangerous
That he might steal something, or go into cardiac arrest
Drink all our cooking wine
Which he seems to have done
He just needs a place to sleep for the night
You're right
Besides, having him here makes it feel like home
Abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair
've been straight for four years, almost five
third of your life
Kelly claps slowly
Big whoop
've been straight the whole time
Abe closes his eyes
hate to tell you this, but 'm not your problem anymore
Kelly gets up
No
That's the one thing  get to decide
Abe looks at Kelly
Let me know
can wait
They look at each other
Kelly shakes his head and goes inside
Abe looks up at the sky
(to himself) Keller, there's a meteor shower
'  - In a backyard tree house next door sit Kelly and Bart, Kelly looking through a pair of M3 field glasses
have the target in sight
Through the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of his house
think he's leaving
Let me see
Don't be a farb, give them up
Kelly hands the glasses over
Bart looks through them
Then he puts them down
The coast is clear
The boys looks at each other
Let me prepare to deploy
Bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit which he puts on
Kelly looks through the binoculars
Is this going to work
We've planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power
Save it for the press conference
The boys climb down out of the tree house
Bart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard hat on
Kelly carries a toolbox
Stay low
On my signal
He looks at Kelly
Then he holds up one finger and gestures "go
" They sneak hunched over towards the fence comes out of the house and stops when she sees them
Bart and Kelly look at each other
Bart takes the toolbox and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering his mouth
Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across the lawn
The girl starts to
Kelly swoops up and covers her mouth with his hand
He tucks her under his arm and runs towards the opposite side of the house
He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth
We're the good guys
If you scream, the bad guys are going to come and burn down your house
Okay
So stay here and be quiet
The girl nods
Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts to sneak away
My dad has a gun
Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door
' Bart turns up the driveway and  the doorbell
'  opens the door
Bart confers with her briefly and steps inside
The door closes behind him
Kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the come up behind him
Can  help you, young man
Kelly starts and turns
was just inspecting your lawn
Kelly grabs a few blades of grass
Have you thought about Astroturf
It takes a lot less water to keep green
mean, no water, technically
'm not interested
Oh
see
Okay then
Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only - Lance   in his
Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into the house
Oh, shit
Lance comes right back out
He forgot something in his car
Oh, shit
Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him and Lance
Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie
He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk
Smile worker bee
'll be your boss some day
Bart nods and tips his
Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until Lance's house is out of sight
Then he gets in step beside Bart
What an asshole
His mom gave me cookies, though
Did you get it done
Don't ask stupid questions
Let's go home and listen
, '  - The boys sit around an  receiver/recorder
It was a five-watt  bug, so we should be in range - Bart  the  switch and Lance's Mom's voice fills the room
The boys smile with delight
' (
) So then  told her, "Harriet, with potato salad like that it's no wonder Ray-Ray's cheating on you
" (
) You didn't
' You're right
But  was thinking it
Instead  just told her to add more vinegar next time, and - Kelly shakes his head as the women natter away
don't think we can use any of this
Be patient
It's voice activated, so we'll get everything
Trust me
It's going to be great
All right, then
Kelly gets up to leave while Bart fiddles with the knobs
We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen hundred hours
,  - Abe and Eve have dinner together
-- And if we don't sell them there, we'll set up on the corner of Stevens and Lane, by the gas station
That's a good location
Eve looks at her husband and sees he's not paying attention
He seems a little out of it
He's pushing his food around on his plate
Are you listening to me
Did you make this with more chili pepper than usual
The same as always
Kelly comes in, walks through the kitchen and up the stairs
Kelly
Want dinner
(
) ate
His parents eat for a minute in silence
Abe winces and puts down his fork
Eve smiles tenderly at him
One day, we're all going to be happy
Abe puts his hand over hers
That sounds nice
, '  - Bart moves around the room excitedly
It's really too perfect, actually
What
What
can't describe
Just hit play
It's all cued up
Kelly hits a button
The tape clicks
From the speakers comes: (recorded) told you, that makes me nervous
Me no likey
But baby, my birthday's coming up
Still
That's not a good enough reason
Come on
little action
little prime time action
But people might see us
That's the point
That's what makes it sexxxy
Dangerous
Kelly stops the tape
Dangerous
Exactly
Bart and Kelly share a look
Kelly grins
Let's draw up the plans
have a few notes jotted down
All we have to do is fill in the details and let Operation Deadmeat begin
- Bridget primps at her locker while Kelly watches nervously from his
When she starts to close the locker door, Kelly rushes towards her and  into her
Her books and papers spill to the floor
Oh Jesus, 'm so sorry - He starts picking them up
Oh, it's okay - She looks around
If Lance showed up it wouldn't be good for either of them
Kelly hands her the rest of her stuff
They part ways
Kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket
Principal Holmstead  down the hall in her heels and Kelly  into a doorway just in time
He turns and pretends to look at a posted announcement as she passes
, '  - Bart inspects Bridget's book report with a jeweler's loop
He swings over to a piece of stationary Kelly's working on
She dots her 's with hearts
And her 's are loopier
The  is very important
'm working on it
They both crouch over the paper
feel kind of bad for her
She's a nice girl
Sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided
Stop it
He pushes back from the table
How does that look
(inspecting) Pretty good
think we're ready to manufacture a document
Kelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper
(clears his throat) Begin
"Hey Daddy
It's your birthday and you've been a very bad boy
But so has the baby
Both baby and Daddy have to get punished, only this time '  - Lance, shirtless, reads aloud from the letter
(Cont
) - baby makes the rules
Await further instructions at school tomorrow -- - Bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat next to Kelly
(
cont'd) -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy least expects her
Love, Bridgie
" Yes
Do you have everything
Kelly just looks at him
Bart's already asked this question
We can't afford any errors
You don't need to tell me
It's my ass on the line
Kelly pulls up in front of Bart's school
Bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder
wish  could be there to see it
You'll get the de-brief
It's a day that will live in infamy
You couldn't do any better than that
don't hear you coming up with anything
Bart hops out and salutes Kelly, who give him the thumbs up in response and pulls away
- Lance can't keep his hands off Bridget
What's gotten into you
Nothing, you bad girl
Lance cackles
Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin before school again
The bell
See you soon, my naughty baby
Bridget looks a little scared
Lance slouches into a seat next to Kelly, who drops another into Lance's open backpack
Kelly watches as Lance grabs his book, sees the note, opens it, and leers
It's my birthday
'm going to get a present
Kelly looks down at his desk and smiles
Damn it, fuckface
What're you smiling about
You wish you were me
Lance raises his hand
Mr
Palmer
May  be excused
Lance leaves like a house afire
(to himself) Eine maus findet den kase
Lance sneaks down the hall towards the   and whispers into the door
Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt
He pulls open the door
Nothing
Lance turns on the light
No one there
But propped up on the shelf next to a vase with a rose in it is another note
Ooh, push my buttons
He snatches the note
His eyes widen as he reads
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You little minx
,  - Bart crouches in the stall, looking at his watch
When the second hand sweeps past the twelve, he opens his cell phone and punches in a number
(serious grownup voice) Yes,  need to get a message to Bridget Shumann
This is
, / - Lunchtime
Typical bedlam
mill around
At one end of the cafeteria/gym is a small stage, the kind pep rallies are held on
Lance edges his way through the crowd, making a beeline for the
, confused Bridget stands at the ' desk
But  just got this note last period
Well  don't have anything here for you - let me look again
Oh yes, the called
The secretary hands Bridget the message
She looks at it
Cool
They want me to be an honorary member
(pause) Is that like a sorority or something
Lance looks around eagerly
He peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely contain his excitement
Bridgie
Come on, daddy's sick
He needs his medicine
He spots a  in the shadows
It must be Bridget
He unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees
brought our friend along
He's happy to see you
He rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage toward her
Kelly looks at his watch
Bart looks at his watch in anticipation
Kelly flicks a switch and presses a button
The crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound of the
They squint from the
ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau revealed to them: frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a - tied to a chair
What the fuck are you all looking at
Bridget, standing in the doorway, covers her mouth in horror
1 Look, he's got a hard on
2 Eeeeew
Lance stumbles off stage to  and , but mostly hysterical
Kelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight
Then he returns to military precision
He turns all the switches back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints
, '  - Bart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch
He's overjoyed
You're kidding me
Yup
There it was
The whole school saw it
Wasn't too impressive either
They raise their glasses to each other
To Operation Mincemeat
To the 193rd
They both take swallows of scotch
Kelly retches
How does it feel to give better than you get
Kelly finishes his scotch
Good
Real good
You want some more
(croaking) Don't mind if  do
That's my boy
The drink again
Kelly's feet are up
For the first time, he looks comfortable
- Sarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine
Kelly pulls up on the - with field goggles on
You know what this is
He puts his foot down like a kickstand
Eighteen volts of pure freedom
Sounds dangerous
Oh, it is
Unless you know how to handle it
Kelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame
Then he looks up at Sarah
You ever seen the freshly waxed floor in the produce section glistening under full florescence
It's breathtaking
Sarah gets on behind him
Hold on tight
He puts his foot up and kicks it into gear
The Electro-shopper takes off - barely
Kelly takes the corner too sharp and clips the edge of an    of cereal boxes -- they fall to the floor
The Electro-shopper inches forward
Close call
Have you been drinking
'  - Kelly looks in at his parents, checking to make sure they're still asleep
When he leaves  opens his eyes and listens to the door downstairs
' Kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack
- Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack
Minnie opens the door
Kelly
Bart's not here, he - Oh, that's all right
Actually, 'm here to see Tabby
Just to do a little painting with her
She's out back in her studio
Thanks
' Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in her hand
Music's playing
Jeff Buckley
She looks over as the door opens, surprised
Kelly
Hey
warned you 'd come
You did
She goes back to painting
Kelly stands there for a minute, waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation
She doesn't
Until she looks up and sees him standing in the same place
Maybe  should go -- Well you're here now
Go ahead
Set your canvas up
Use one of the ones in the corner
Kelly looks through them and picks one
Brushes are in the jar
Paint's in the drawer
brought my own
He takes off his backpack and opens it
Well then
Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies
He can't help but look at her
The light hits her hair and she glows
She catches him looking
Does it mess up your concentration
Me being here
No
She turns back to her painting
Oh
That's good
Kelly sets up his canvas
Just don't talk
Why would
(pause) 'm kidding
Right
Irony
like that
Kelly feels the tubes of paint
Nervous
Squirts some color out
Looks over his shoulder at her
He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being there, in the studio, alone with her
Trying to figure out how to play it
(
) Hey
Hey babe
Miner opens the door
See Kelly
Smiles like the stockbroker he is and crosses to him
Miner Webber
Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake
Kelly takes it
Webber Miner
Miner looks confused
Kelly
This is Kelly - Kelly Ernswiler
Sorry
- Quite all right
(smiles as an afterthought) So, what do we have here, a little painting class
Kelly's a friend of Bart's
He paints
Oh
What's your real job
Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas
That would be stock boy at the Shop Rite
But, as President Don Kaminsky says, every employee is part owner
So you could say 'm a captain-of- industry in training
Kind of capitalist larva
That's quite an image
Only if you see the most magical part
Do you see
What
Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little
One day 'll be a beautiful butterfly
First 'll have to be a pupa though
figure  won't be going out much then
Pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world
Miner stares at Kelly
He can't tell what he might be making fun of, or if it might be him
Whatever it takes to get you through the day
Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though Miner doesn't see it
He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls her to him
have the afternoon off
Come away with me
'm not at a good stopping point
Oh, come on
They'll still be here
(to Kelly) know you'll still be here
Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes
really shouldn't
But everyone will be coming soon
And it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves
We will
promise
Tabby kisses Miner
He realizes there's no convincing her and sighs
Like tonight
We can practice honeymoon suite
Maybe
Probably
Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away
Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves
Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while
Kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles, like he's copying what he thinks a painter would do
Is he always like that
Like what
Overbearing
Tabby stops and puts down her brush
Just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa
Oh, he will - later
When he's alone
Whether he wants to or not
Kelly paints
Not that though
How he wanted you to stop
He wants to be with me
What's so bad about that
Just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you
Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting
He has a hard time making eye contact with Tabby
No one should ever ask you to stop
If you stop, you might not be able to start again
Or you might start again, only things will be different
Well, that's sweet - It's not sweet, actually
It's just the truth
Hey,  can take care of myself
She picks up her brush
When's the wedding
At the end of the month
But don't ask me about it
It makes me nervous
Kelly looks at her seriously
Why
Is something wrong
No
Awkward silence
What are you painting
Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode
Really, there are so many layers of - imagistic symbolism - that  really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well - it's a recurring dream image
mermaid riding a rocket ship
Tabby stops painting
How
What do you mean, "how
" Sidesaddle
She's riding it sidesaddle
She's got a fish tail, for chrissake haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not
Do you have any idea what you're talking about
Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's gesture
Does that matter
Well, some people actually say what they really think
What if they don't know what they really think
It doesn't matter
It's called being yourself
Sounds boring
Not boring
Scary and wonderful and exciting
Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette
His gestures slow down
He's taking this in
Then he shakes it off
Hey
'm trying to create here
Stop distracting me
'  - Kelly comes in to return the art supplies
Xiou-Xiou's alone working
She looks up and smiles at Kelly
Mom's got you working late
- No
Kelly walks over and sees what she's working on
beautiful spare Chinese landscape
Wow
You're really good
Why do you make those stupid animals for mom
- Each painting is a lesson
Here - She gets out a piece of paper for him
'm making a lot of art these days
guess that means a lot of lessons
- Each line has a whole drawing contained in it
Each drawing has a whole life contained in it
Oh, that's all
Kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl of her strokes
He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's restrained and confident movements
Eve leans against the doorframe
Hey you two
'll try not to act surprised
It might spoil the moment
Kelly puts down the paintbrush
can't do this
have to go
Keller,  think 'm missing some art supplies
Have you seen them around the house
Kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves
No,  haven't
don't know what to do with him
- You son is not yet cooked
Give him time
Eve looks over Xiou-Xiou's shoulder
When are you going to let me give you your own show
We could do it for real
- No problem
When you offer me an eighty-twenty split
,   - Kelly eats with the Bowlands - Bart's mom, , his dad , and Tabby and Bart
The Bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good Wasp family
(to Harrison) -- But  told you  want to take German -- German's a Cold War language
You can't get any kind of State Department position without more diverse linguistic training than that
You'll take Chinese
Bart frowns
Are we on the same page
(mutters) Same page
Everyone eats in silence
(to Tabby) So darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement
Tabby puts down her fork
can't deal with that stuff, ma don't care who sits next to whom should have eloped
After all, Mrs
Bowland, sometimes when you bite the bullet, it explodes in your mouth
Mathilda looks surprised
This could go either way
(tentatively) Why, 've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it
You wouldn't say, "Sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants," would you
But have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it
Yeah, but they never take a bite out of their pants
Everyone but Bart
Tabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of a conversation she didn't want to have
What an unusual conversation
Do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, Kelly
Basically
ask why all the furniture is missing and my Dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon
All but Bart  again
He talks about art
/ You do
Kelly looks down at his plate
My mother's kind of an artist, so - You come from a creative family, do you
Mathilda salts her food
wish my boys would talk to me about my passions
can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden
noticed your magnolias
Very fine specimens
They are fine, aren't they
Mathilda beams
(ironic) Is there nothing you can't discuss
If anyone notices the slight edge to Bart's voice, they ignore it
Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks
Minnie has a way with the white sauce
' Kelly and Bart play PlayStation  "Medal of Honor" in Bart's bedroom
Bart is sulking, almost imperceptibly
My dad has this friend who's a director
He's shooting a documentary for the History Channel
Cool
He needs some guys to do a reenactment of some European theater battles for him
Kelly stops playing and looks at Bart
We're going to be on the History Channel
Bart's eyes stay on the screen
haven't asked you yet
Oh, come on
Kelly jabs at his controller
Well, if you want to
Next weekend
But you have to take it seriously
Kelly gives Bart a derisive glance
What do you mean
Of course  will
The flickering  light illuminates Bart's pinched look
From what 've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations
This has got to be straight up
This annoys Kelly
'm not "fast and loose
"  play the emotional truth
make it real
Bart glances at him
Like back in the dining room
What does that have to do with it
Bart shakes his head
(mimics) " noticed your magnolias
Very fine specimens
" That was real
Kelly's video game character dies
He drops the controller
What is this about
(shrugs) You just seem to have your own agenda, that's all
Bart plays on
He's keeping a lid on everything while Kelly gets more and more agitated
My own agenda
What other reason is there to do anything
'm just saying
know the difference between fantasy and reality
Kelly looks at Bart in disbelief
Are you saying  don't
Bart won't meet his eyes
don't know
Bart pauses the game
Why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn-out
Kelly gets up and grabs his jacket
Why do you steal from yours
He leaves
Bart un-pauses the game and continues playing
- Kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his sleeve
Principal Holmstead's smiling face greets him when he straightens up
Kelly
told some of your teachers about your presentation
We're all really looking forward to it
Kelly frowns at the Principal's back as she  away
Sarah appears
They walk down the hall together
What presentation
don't want to talk about it
As a matter of fact, do me a favor and pretend you never heard anything about it
Okay
Um
What, Sarah
It's nothing
- Kelly starts to pull ahead
have an extra ticket to Aerosmith this weekend
Aw Sarah, that's really great, mean
It's just that - 'm busy
Oh
Yeah,  figured
Okay
'll see you in the dairy section, though
Right
She stands there looking lost
- Kelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep
Bart pulls up to the curb in his
What are you doing here
tracked you down
There's someone 'd like you to meet
'  - few   sit sunning in chairs in the industrial feeling living-room
Bart and Kelly sit across from  , an old black guy, playing dominos
(to Kelly) Are you one too
Yup
And what do you see in that
Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery - the big stuff
Things we don't have anymore
see
Charlie sorts his tiles and scowls
He leans in to Kelly's face, giving him the eye
And do you think it's brave getting trench foot and syphilis, eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can
Kelly is taken aback by this
Well, no - Charlie leans back and nods, thinking about Kelly's response
He no longer seems angry
Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, would it
No, sir
Charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin
Parts of it were kind of fun though
got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the Ardennes living off what  could kill
(pause) felt very close to the land
Bart gives Kelly a significant look
Kelly doesn't notice
He's looking closely at Charlie
- Kelly sits in the car
Bart pumps gas
They talk through the window
met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the Youth Group
You don't really believe that stuff about Berlin
And Hitler's compound
Does it matter
Of course it matters
Doesn't the truth matter
Bart grins
don't know
You tell me
Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car
want a drink
Let me borrow a couple bucks
told you not to play him for money
was trying to be nice
He's your friend
Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap
Exactly
You should know better
What do you want
Mountain Dew - Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees , set up in the adjacent abandoned lot
She's got the van parked there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around on display
-- Oh shit
But Eve has seen him
She shields her eyes with her hand and calls to him
Kelly
Kelly backtracks towards the car
That woman's calling you
Eve walks over to them
Kelly can't get out of it
(low) Bart
Meet my mom
Eve smiles brightly
What a nice surprise
It's so nice to finally meet you
Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just like he's been taught to
Likewise
So, doing a little business
little is right
But  work it as much as  can
Eve laughs
Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot
Eve looks at both of them
So, what have you boys been up to
Bart took me to meet his friend Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home
Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home
You don't know him
You boys should swing by Care House
There are some Vets there
We can't
Oh
Well - okay
Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van
should go
But you boys should come over to our house some time
(to Bart) know your family must get tired of him
Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents entertaining Bart
Not at all
But 'd love to, anyway
Eve looks at Kelly
Then she runs back over to the van
There you go
Now you know everything
What's your problem
She's pretty cute
Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car
Don't you want your soda
Forget it
, '  - Kelly watches Bart pick through parts of his uniform
After the encounter with mom, he's retreated into himself
So filming's on Saturday
Can you make it
Are you kidding
Good
It's gonna be really cool
He's got an explosives expert coming
Kelly doesn't say anything
What's up
Kelly runs his hand through his hair
He can't bring himself to say what's really on his mind
Remember that stupid speech
Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it
Bart frowns
He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff
'm supposed to give it next week
Bart polishes his combat boots
Maybe you should talk to my dad about it
You think he'd go for that
Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently
Of course
He loves you
He was talking the other day about helping you out
(ironic) Want to go to Dartmouth
Are you serious
He was
If you applied for Spring Semester, he could "pull some strings
" (shakes his head slowly) don't think that would work for me
Considering -- my background
Yeah, probably not
'm not properly socialized wouldn't fit in
Bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges
That's bullshit
No, it's not
Tell that to my family
They're like your fucking fan club
Bart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly
Even Tabby likes you
So much she ratted me out to you
Well, she's inviting you to the wedding
Oh
Bart watches Kelly's face
But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you
don't know what you're talking about
Weddings
love weddings always get drunk and make out with someone's cousin
Bart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head
Good, 'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little action
Fletcher, eh
He's twelve
Let me give some advice
He's very into sharks at the moment
- Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door
There he pauses, trying to decide what to do
Then he scowls
He goes around the corner
Towards Tabby's studio
' Tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door
Kelly enters
Why did you tell -- Tabby turns toward him
She's crying
What
Oh, 'm sorry
He knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there
Kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture
Tabby dabs at her face
Miner and  broke up
Beat
'm sorry
Yeah
Honestly
didn't think you two were right for each other
You did, huh
Kelly walks over to her painting
Like this painting
Stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore
But if someone else sees it for the first time, they can tell exactly what it is
don't need any more bullshit right now
Kelly stops, taken aback
He walks away from the painting
He could never understand you
'm not as complicated as you think
Kelly walks to the window and looks out
never said you were complicated
Tabby laughs/cries at this
Oh
He just wasn't the right one
Tabby nods
She's starting to calm down a little
There's more to it than that
Tabby looks at her shredded tissue
Kelly sits down on the couch next to her
'm really sorry
really am
Thanks
Kelly pats her knee awkwardly
Don't cry
Tabby turns her face to Kelly's
You like me, don't you
Of course
Tabby closes her eyes
No,  mean -- you like me
Kelly looks scared
He wants to retreat
But he calms himself down
Yeah
think you're amazing
Well, do something
Long pause
Then -- Kelly kisses her
She kisses back and they fall against the couch together
- (
) All right, all right
'm going
Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler
He looks up and freezes
Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio
He shuts the door carefully and walks around the pool
Kelly doesn't see Bart
Bart doesn't say anything
He just watches Kelly go
- Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from corners of the room
The canteen underhand
The Jeep cap as a free throw
This is the best day of his life
Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still crusted with mud
Damn it
Damn it
He flops on his bed
But he can't help it
Soon he's smiling again
He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of the room
Kelly comes down the stairs two at a time, singing
Eve and Abe watch surprised from the table
Abe looks pale
What
, '  - Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning
Mathilda knocks and opens the door
Minnie's starting dinner
Is Kelly coming over
Not tonight, ma
Mathilda pauses and looks at her son
Okay, then
- An   and  unload equipment from a van
The  looks off into the distance, trying to visualize
Kelly pulls up next to the van
He wears a spotlessly clean uniform
Are you with the 101st or the 82nd
Well, 82nd today
It's not my usual division
Technically, my patches indicate - Whatever
Make yourself comfortable
We'll be a while setting up
Some of the other boys are over by craft service
Oh
Kelly doesn't go anywhere
The snack table
It's over there
Someone will come get you when we're ready
Right
Is Bart Bowland here yet
Bart
Oh, Harrison's son
don't know
Ok
Thanks
Kelly and a half dozen other  stand or sit in the grass around the table
They talk and rest on their backpacks
makes the rounds
(to Kelly) And you are
Kelly Ernswiler, private first class
All right, Kelly
Let's take a look at you
She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair, slicking it back
That's it, handsome
Kelly grins
When she walks away he messes up his hair again
He scans the crowd
No Bart
The
walks over
Okay, everyone
We're going to start positioning
Then we'll go through a few rehearsals
(points at soldiers) You, you and you - go over there by that tree
You and you guys, behind the hill
(looks at clipboard) Okay, who's got the Jeep
That
She's mine
Great
We'd like to use it
Can you drive it beyond the hill over there
Kelly tries to act casual
Sure
don't think that would be a problem
He walks towards his Jeep and pauses
Have you seen Bart Bowland
Has he checked in
Don't know
We've got enough people
It doesn't matter
Kelly nods, wondering a bit
But it's soon forgotten
(to Jeep) Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to be famous
(yells) Okay people
Listen to my voice
From now on, you do whatever this voice says
Take your place
Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored
He sees a  in the shadows of the trees
He raises his rifle and points it at the figure
Password
Bart steps out of the barn
Hey
Where the hell have you been
No where
They put you over here with me
That's great
think we'll get some close- ups
They want me to drive old Lippy
Isn't that awesome
Bart doesn't say anything
What the hell's your problem
ought to fucking kill you
What
You had to do it
Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep it normal
What are you talking about
You just do whatever the fuck you want
And consequences don't matter, do they
Are you out of your mind
Bart looks at Kelly
Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army uniform
What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you
The blood rises to Kelly's face
But he still won't look at Bart
You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy
She's a Yale grad student
Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world
Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle
No
You'd rather have me be miserable like you are
Bart comes closer
Uncomfortably close
(biting sarcasm) Once again, you've displayed your uncanny ability to nail the truth of a character
Kelly finally raises his head
And looks Bart right in the eyes
Stop talking out your dad's mouth and use your own for once
Bart lunges at Kelly
The camera's set up
The groups are in position
The
stands by the cameraman
Standby for rehearsal
Cue the explosion
In the field
Soldiers leap out of trenches
Cue the Jeep
Nothing happens
Cue the Jeep
Cue the fucking Jeep
The
shakes his head
The
comes around the corner followed by the cameraman
Bart and Kelly roll around on the ground
What the
Christ is going on over here
Bart and Kelly continue to fight
(to cameraman) Hey, roll this
Get this
Are you getting this
The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films
Kelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives away
(to cameraman) Follow him
Are you getting it
Bart sits on the ground, out of breath
We can use this
We'll cut it together
The
directs the camera at Bart
Get close on him
Bart pushes the camera away
, '  - Kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling
There's a cut across his eyebrow
Eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed
don't want to talk about it
Well, you're going to have to
Your father's at the hospital
Which one of his loser friends ended up there
Eve plays with her keys
Then she stops
They think he has stomach cancer
Kelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream
Then he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom
Oh this is just perfect
Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head
She's tired but still trying to deal
Why would you say something like that
Because it seems to fit
"Seems to fit
" Do you understand what  just said
Kelly gets up
Puts his feet on the floor
His shoulders are slumped
Why, do you want to say it again
Kelly - have to go to work
He gets up and holds the door open for her
Eve looks at him, heart heavy
She leaves
Kelly sits on the bed
Then he looks at the rabbit painting
He grabs it off the wall and  it backwards against the floor so he doesn't have to look at it
The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's rifle and
He  it
- Kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels
He  open the box and they roll everywhere
Sarah watches from checkout
She comes over to help him pick them up
forgot to tell you this box was booby-trapped
Kelly doesn't say anything
The concert was lame
The opening act singer ripped his leather pants during a stupid dance routine and stormed off stage
(pause, looks at his cut) Are you okay
No
Lance
No
Kelly gathers an armful of paper towels
Listen, 'm busy
Sure
understand
doubt it
Sarah puts a couple of rolls on the shelf
Um,  don't have a perfect life, if that's what you're asking
Kelly stops what he's doing
No, Sarah, actually, 'm not asking
never ask you anything but you just talk anyway
Have you ever noticed that
Sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands
Fuck you
She leaves
Kelly shakes his head
'  - Kelly, still in his work clothes, comes in without knocking
Hey,  hoped you were up - He stops when he sees Tabby and Miner sleeping together on the couch
Tabby opens her eyes
Kelly
Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel
just came to get this
Kelly leaves
Tabby follows Kelly across the yard
Hey
Kelly stops and turns around
guess the wedding's back on
We talked
Tabby smiles sadly
'm really sorry
Don't be
They stand there in the yard
Tabby wraps her arms around herself
My dad's got cancer
Tabby looks at Kelly, pained
Oh, Kelly
She takes a step towards him
He backs up
guess we all get what we deserve
Kelly looks at Tabby for a second, then turns and walks away
- Kelly drives along an open stretch of road
He throws the painting out of the Jeep
He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast
The Jeep , teeters on two wheels, and goes over the embankment
Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator
The front end is completely smashed
Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel
Stupid bitch
Then he calm himself, gets out, and starts walking
- Kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it
Kelly comes in late
Kelly
There you are
was just telling the class about our special treat today
Mr
Ernswiler is going to be giving the three first-period history classes a little talk about the Civil War
Kelly closes his eyes
He had forgotten - or tried to forget
Let's all make our way in an orderly fashion down to the auditorium, shall we
The class bolts for the door
Orderly,  said orderly
Mr
Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly
Well, what are we waiting for
'm so looking forward to hearing your views
Kelly sits in a chair on the stage next to Mr
Norman
scattering of  sit out in the auditorium
Principal Holmstead stands at the podium
For those of you who haven't had the chance to get to know Kelly, you should know he has a very interesting hobby
He takes part in reenactments of World War  battles right here in Ohio
did that too
When  was seven
Scattered
Kelly frowns
He has an unusual first-hand knowledge of history
We recently discovered that this extends beyond World War to the Civil War, which he is going to discuss with you today
Kelly
Kelly rises to scant applause
He stands at the podium, looking out at the crowd
He looks down and thinks
He looks back up
The silence stretches
Kids start giggling
Finally he leans into the microphone
'm sorry
He walks off stage
(to Mr
Norman) Well, go after him
- On his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder and madder
Just as he's about to get it undone -- Lance appears
What, they re-assign you to the bicycle brigade
Kelly frowns at the lock
'm busy
Too bad, cause 'm not
Remember that little show  put on for the school
don't know what you're talking about
Oh, come on
Pants down
Doll
Hard on
Kelly looks up at Lance
Oh that
heard about it
And did you hear me and Bridget aren't going out anymore because of it
haven't been following the story
Yeah well, let's get this over with
It is over
Lance pushes Kelly away from his bike
Kelly falls back on his hands
He squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike
Lance  him back with his foot and looks at him
Just let me go home
Did you call me a homo
Lance  him again
Kelly breathes hard
This isn't a good time for me
Let's re-schedule
No time like the present
Lance picks Kelly up and  him hard on the face
First you should probably get me to write home to my mother
Lance  Kelly and he reels
Then Kelly lunges for him and they fall to the ground
Kelly swings wildly but Lance pins him down and gives him a few good ones
Then Mr
Norman comes out
Stop it
Mr
Norman rushes over to them
Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his bike and rides away
Mr
Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance shakes him off
Get off me
- Kelly rides by his house and keeps going
- Kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but can't bring himself to go in
He pedals on
- Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory
He watches the rusty barges glitter on the water
The wind ruffles his sweaty hair
- Kelly's at the front door
Bart's not here
Sorry
She closes the door
Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway
He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of the guys says
,  - Kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape down his arm
Eve appears in the doorway
Oh Kelly
What happened
Kelly looks up at her
He's still got the cut eyebrow, which has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose
Nothing
Jesus
Let me see that
Eve comes over and tilts Kelly's head back to look at the cut
This is the first time she's touched him
She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink along with Band-Aids and goes to work
Ow
Kelly lets her dab at his face
He closes his eyes
'm going over to see dad
Kelly opens his eyes and pulls away
Oh
Eve puts a butterfly bandage across Kelly's eyebrow
And you need to come
Kelly pulls his head away
don't want to
At this point that's not an option
Now's not a good time, ma
Eve looks at Kelly sadly
It's never a good time
You can't make me
Eve shakes her head
(voice rising) It's not about you anymore -- Don't you get it
It was never about me
Eve rises to her feet
He's just sent her over the edge
(yelling) What is wrong with you
When are you going to stop blaming us, blaming him
'm sick of you being angry want to be angry
They just took out half of your father's stomach - Enough
(screaming and crying) You will not tell me what's enough
You don't know about anything
All you do is fight fake battles, in the woods, on the playground
But this, right here, us - this is the real one, the only one worth anything
She stops and breaks down
The man  love is dying
That's between you and him
Eve looks at her son
Her face looks older
If  made a mistake, if you felt left out, 'm sorry
But  can only deal with one thing at a time
Eve leaves
Kelly sits on the toilet, lost
'  - The sun shines in through Kelly's window
He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while
He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately
He puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the tie's too short
He pulls the suit out of his closet
The jacket doesn't fit
The sleeves don't even go down to his wrists
And he can hardly button the pants
He rips off the jacket
He pulls everything out of his closet
Nothing there
He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands
He looks at his  , hanging on the back of the closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it
He shakes his head
No, he couldn't do that
Then he sighs
- It's decorated for a wedding
Flower garlands trail up the banisters
trickle in
Harrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel, talks to an
Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters next to me if you can help it
(to guest) Oh, hello
So nice to see you
Thank you for coming
Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher
(to Bart) Where's the priest
He should be here any minute
Calm down
Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street
Kelly's walking towards him
Bart walks down the street to meet him
What the fuck are you doing
Kelly looks down
He can't meet Bart's eyes
was invited
uninvited you
It's not your wedding
Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head
Why are you wearing that
Kelly doesn't answer
(softening) can't let you come in
Why
Because you know why
Just go home
Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods
Town Car pulls up
Tabby gets out in her wedding dress
Has there even been a more glorious woman
Will there ever be again
Her    leads her around to the side of the church
Kelly watches every step
She looks beautiful
Tell her - give her my congratulations
Kelly walks off
Bart watches him go
, '  - Kelly sits on the edge of the bed, head in hands
He sees the torn rabbit painting
After a minute, he picks it up and looks at it
' Xiou-Xiou sits painting
Kelly enters with the rabbit
- Oh
Son of Eve
You startled me
Grandma Ling
Can you fix this
She examines it and takes out a wet sponge
She wipes it across the back of the canvas
- Your mom made it for you
can fix it
She works silently for a minute
Kelly watches her
She cuts a small piece of canvas to repair the hole
Did you come here to work on your own stuff
Don't waste your time on this
- never waste time
She turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch it up
- See
Everything can be mended
You're trying to tell me something, aren't you
- Oh no
could not tell you anything
, '  - Eve sleeps in a chair next to Abe, in bed sleeping
He looks pale but otherwise fine
Kelly stands in the doorway, still in his uniform
Abe comes to and sees him standing there
Hey
Kelly
Hey dad
How you feeling
Not bad
They gave me some stitches downstairs
(points to eyebrow) Three
Did you get punched
couple times, actually
know the feeling
Come on in and watch some television
Don't worry, this one's bolted to the wall
As you can see, my reputation precedes me
Kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair
Any battles this weekend
few
Busy, busy
Abe and Kelly look up at the television in the corner
Answer me this: how come no one ever reenacts the Vietnam War
It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't it
guess it would
Both continue to look up at the television
Plus that, you'd have to have protesters and stuff
Folks dressed up like your mom and me
People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards
guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing, now wouldn't it
could make it work
Abe looks at Kelly
bet you could
Kelly nods
Eve wakes up
Kelly, is that you
You were expecting some one else
Kelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine
He looks good
Eve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness
He looks just like you
Kelly nods slowly, taking this in
And it is finally too much
He breaks down and cries
For the fear and the misplaced rage, the fights and the stubbornness
But finally, relief
They walk back down the hall together
Eve reaches out and puts her hand on Kelly's neck
- Kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees the car packed up in front
Bart comes out with a box of stuff
Hey
Hey
You going away already
Yeah
The have this intensive summer orientation thing
Is that good
Bart puts the box in the car
Well, it's optional, but dad thinks it would be "a good way to meet people
" He's probably right
He usually is
They stand there
Well, go Big Green
Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand
Bart smiles
Kelly's been doing his research
Thanks
Kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike
Have fun
And get laid, will ya
Bart laughs a little and shakes his head
Kelly is gone
Harrison comes out
Is that everything
Everything you'd let me bring
Harrison checks the ties on the roof
Give me a break
- Kelly stocks shelves
There's a   working the register
Kelly sees  come in
He follows her to the bakery
Hey
Hey
Sarah picks some bagels
How come you don't work here anymore
The Electro-shopper's getting rusty
've got a summer internship at an ad agency
Fancy
It's all right,  guess
No, it's great
Kelly moves around to her other side, closer
Hey - Sarah moves away
Once bitten twice shy and all that
When are you going to get a real job
don't know
Probably when  figure out something better to do
You can't be a stock boy your whole life
Sarah walks to the front of the store
Kelly walks with her
Yeah  can
mean,  probably won't, but  could
Sarah turns to him at the checkout aisle
Well, it was good seeing you
Um
What
Remember that presentation  told you never to ask me about again
'  - Kelly stands in the front of the room, pointing to a battle plan with large arrows drawn on it
Charlie, Mr
Norman, Principal Holmstead, Eve and Sarah sit among other
Lee arrayed his defenses over here
Only this time, Grant was ready for him
Kelly keeps talking
Many of the   sleep
1 (to old soldier 2) This is boring
2 Yeah
Let's see that slide of the wife again
Sarah, Kelly, and Eve play dominos with Charlie and Mr
Norman
(to Charlie) Remarkable, remarkable
And they never knew
The real kicker was moving those cutouts of tanks around
The thought we had a whole regiment over there, but it was just a couple of us and those Hollywood props
That's amazing
Art playing a part in war
You're damned right
We practically won the thing right there
(eyeing Sarah and Eve with approval) Now this is more like it
Anyone care to place a wager on the table
Kelly tries to gesture to Sarah "no
" If you think it would be more fun
can't imagine having more fun that am now
Mr
Norman smiles at the group
You're never been to a French whorehouse,  take it
have
Oh, my
'  - Eve waits while Kelly and Sarah walk out to Sarah's car
Kelly helps Sarah into it and closes the door for her
still don't understand how you did that
spent my summers with my grandma in the Catskills
She didn't give me any spending money
(shrugs) So  played the bones for ice cream
She pulls away
He watches her go
Hot damn
