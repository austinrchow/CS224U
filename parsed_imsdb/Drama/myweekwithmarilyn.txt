Then,   : Newsreel footage of arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited crowd of fans
As they progress down the gangplank and stop to sign autographs we  an excited commentary : "Returning to England are Britain's acting royalty Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier, better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh
Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none other than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe
When the world's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive, we can be sure that sparks will fly
Now, now Lady Olivier, don't worry - any romance is strictly for the camera

Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting sun
It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home, complete with turrets and even a moat
There is a feeling of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something profoundly English
We are a very long way from Hollywood

He has two  with him, a man and a woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the painting
and this is one of Carracci's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style, which is clearly rooted in the tradition of high renaissance and antiquity
pauses briefly and hurries towards them
Throughout the scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go
The whole thing should be played at breakneck pace

Colin
Come in
Have you met James and Anna
Two very brilliant pupils
He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a little eccentric
smiles hurriedly at the students, no time to waste
'm leaving for London now, Pa
Ah, yes
Well, bon chance, dear boy
He puts a friendly arm around 's shoulder and starts to walk him back to the door

She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress, eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a dozen things at once

She leaves the Library

One more of his murderous prunings and we'll lose the tea roses for ever
And she's off again, with  still following

Only now does  really turn her attention fully to him for the first time
Now go and have a lovely time, darling
We're always here when you're ready to talk your future

Her face lights up

Be an angel - find Cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight
Then bring the car round

She dashes away after the , turning back as an afterthought to blow a kiss at  as she goes
smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house
We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly his need to get away
He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of the drive and across the moat
In the last rays of the sun, the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for the road ahead

The streets hum with activity as   in hats and raincoats stream from the tube stations

This is his patch; he is very much at home here, negotiating the busy streets with ease

She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone
We hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice carrying irritably
() Yes

He says Sir Laurence sent him
She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's familiarity

perches restlessly on the sofa
Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started
The seconds pass in dull silence
He is beginning to think his campaign will fail
But then, in a heartbeat, everything changes
He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and strides in with his wife   on his arm

At the age of 49    is at the peak of his fame
He is handsome and charismatic, and  is scarcely less extraordinary
The Gone With The Wind star remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating
Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone who comes into contact with them
leaps to her feet and  hurries to greet them as  stands up uncertainly
is all amiable bluster and bonhomie
Do you know, Hughie, it is simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on the telephone
The darling girl spends the entire day asleep
But great beauty has its way
He laughs, but then notices 's less than enthusiastic response
Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices hovering by the sofa
(') Hello, boy
remind me
He smiles vaguely and glances at  for help
You remember Colin, darling
You met him at the Clarks' party
( ) Of course
What are you doing here
You said there might be a job on your film

Keep the pack

They say he's a communist
No Arthur, no Marilyn

'm taking him to see Vivien in South Sea Bubble on Thursday
now, tell me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites in
He puts an arm around 's shoulders and they disappear together into Perceval's office
lingers behind, smiling radiantly at  who looks dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand
He now sees they are called "Oliviers"
wrinkles her nose in amusement
They named them after Larry
The first actor since Du Maurier to have his own brand and they pay him an absolute fortune
(Pause) 'm afraid they're rather ghastly
She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in mock awe
(') Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa
suppose he's all right
's eyes sparkle
emerges from the office with a handful of script pages and  looks at him slyly, getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of Marilyn's charms as she strokes 's cheek
12
( ) Let's elope together and have the most glorious affair
(Arch) Oh, but then, who'd look after my poor Larry
Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation
winks at  and takes her husband's arm
(') Now, darling, you must do something for Colin
You absolutely promised
looks hunted
There is no way out
He glances back at  as he comes in
Let's try to find him something to do, Hughie

Find something suitable

' 20 knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a tray with tea and a plate of biscuits
The blinds are closed and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold- up screen in the corner of the room
Framed in the light of the projector are  and the film's lighting cameraman
They take no notice of Colin
He looks up at the screen
The two men are watching make-up, hair and wardrobe tests for the film
in character as Elsie Marina
12A
The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon
It is an intimate glimpse of her at work
Colin watches, fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still holding the tray - ( ) Larry says he particularly likes this dress
She looks radiant
Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit
How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe
laughs
He immediately regrets it
Both men turn to look at him
turns off the projector and gazes at him stonily
Marilyn Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow
He wants to see the house she'll be staying in
Find something suitable
nods eagerly, anxious to get out
He is already at the door when  barks at him again
And leave the bloody tea

He blushes furiously, puts it down and hurries out

21 has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol sports car
He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring around its circumference
He taps his pencil thoughtfully as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that Olivier gave him
He inhales deeply, thinking, then grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his foot

Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front door, looking down his nose at
- Out of the question
can't have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots
We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks
- My wife would never agree
That's a pity
'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then
- double takes
- Marilyn Monroe
() She's making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier
The Sleeping Prince
From the play by Terence Rattigan

Good morning, Mr
Jacobs
hope you had a pleasant flight
Where's the fucking car
: 26
26 sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports car reading his stack of newspapers
After a moment he grunts in disgust
Jeez, do you Brits actually read this stuff
He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot out into the lane
The pages billow out in a great cloud behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows and on neat front lawns
gapes in astonishment
Welcome to Hollywood

28 slaps down a copy of the Evening Standard on the desk
The front page carries a picture of Tibbs Farm with the caption: "Exclusive - Marilyn's Luxury Home In England"
He jabs a finger at it angrily
News travels fast
That house was perfect for Marilyn
We can't use it now
Yes we can
knew Cotes-Preedy wouldn't be able to keep this quiet
They stare to him in surprise
He looks at them boldly
When you asked me to find a house for Miss Monroe  took the precaution of finding two
The other one, Parkside, is much better and the owner is very discreet
But now we have two expensive houses when we only wanted one
thought someone else on the production might want it
Oh, did you
There is a dangerous moment when things could go either way

He waits in tense silence, staring at their puzzled expressions
But then  shrugs

No

One does get so terribly nervous
It's just like the first day at school, isn't it

She smiles kindly at  who smiles back tentatively from behind her dark glasses
He smiles with considerable charm as he makes his opening speech of welcome
Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity
(Pause, looks around) We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but  hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness
Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he gives Paula a pointed look
She glowers back, obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned but clumsy joke
Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a sentimental flourish
(') So
My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together

You were superb, Marilyn
You were divine

You were great

Oh
you have that word in England too
She looks at him in surprise
She looks sedated, not quite there
leaps protectively to her defence
Marilyn has to prepare properly
She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface
Acting isn't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose

When Marilyn gets it right you just don't want to look at anyone else
frowns
For all his greatness as an actor he will never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive Marilyn
And the injustice of it is like a stab through his heart
At the back  only has eyes for the screen
He watches 's image, enthralled
Until now he has taken Marilyn entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on screen he begins to see things differently

He's such a strange man

Then she should pretend to believe it
bristles at this insult to her husband's work
Pretend
We're talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap

We're in absolute agreement, Paula
Acting is all about sincerity
And if you can fake that, you're off to the races
only stares at him in disgust
Thoroughly alarmed, intervenes
55
Maybe we should try for another take
Marilyn needs time to give a great performance
You should give her as long as it takes
Chaplin took eight months to make a movie
Eight months of this
'd rather kill myself
Throughout all this  herself looks lost watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective gaze
Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to allow her to sit down)

You can do it
You can't fail
You will have more pain, you will suffer more but you will create
All you need is time

What kind of tree is Elsie
An elm tree birch tree

What's the matter now
He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation with a honeyed tone
(') Forgive me, Marilyn
This is my failure, not yours
Tell me how can help you

Elsie is all in the script can't find her
She's not there
But you have her precisely, you know her inside out
'm in awe of your gift
We all are
She's not real
Why not simply rely on your natural talents
Are you saying  don't need to act

He looks at her in genuine anguish
Marilyn, you are the most attractive woman in the world
'm simply suggesting you be yourself

unobtrusively fetches whisky and cigarettes for them both as  abruptly booms out to himself
", now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind/Farewell content/ Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars/That make ambition virtue , farewell/Farewell
" (Pause, exasperated) Paula's not an actress
She not a director, not a teacher
Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn
It would be worse if she wasn't around
You know what would make Marilyn Monroe a real actor
season in rep
They wouldn't stand for this kind of nonsense at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne
You have to be patient with her
Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger
gives him a look but says nothing
Instead he picks up his bag and opens it
It is stuffed with bottles of pills
He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it in his pocket
better go see her
She'll need something to help her calm down
holds the door for him as he goes out
(After a second) Pills to sleep, pills to wake up
Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy
No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater
59
looks at him tentatively
Maybe she's scared
We're all scared
It's part of being an actor
But you have the training to deal with it
turns from the mirror to survey him
wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if  were you
Though heaven knows it's tempting
He sighs wistfully
(') And  think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing
isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue

Don't forget who you work for

Are you sure they won't mind
Help yourself
They can spare it
(Pause) Marilyn's okay
She's taken some pills and gone to bed
He frowns darkly
60
(') They like to keep her doped up
It makes her easier to control
You mean Miller
(Shakes his head) The others
They're terrified their cash cow will slip away
He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle

It is nearly midnight

84 , a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet
The narrow strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall in darkness
inches forward uncertainly
He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust
The house is totally silent
Then, just as he is about to move, he hears something
Breathing, very close by
Faint but unmistakable
Shallow breaths, like sighs
is paralysed
beat, then - door is flung open along the hall and light floods into the corridor
is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall only a few feet away from Colin
She is wrapped in a pink bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank and sedated
By her side is an open spiral bound notebook, its pages closely crammed with handwriting
() Marilyn
Come back to bed
It's not what you think
61
She stares at
It is not even clear she knows he is there
gazes back at her, paralysed
's voice comes again, flat and tired
(') () It's just a few ideas
Writer's stuff
(Pause) Bring back my book and let's get some sleep
Finally  stirs and closes the notebook
Holding it to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door
As the light snaps off  breathes for the first time in what feels like minutes
: 85

Good morning, Miss Monroe

They speak in low, urgent tones
It's nearly lunch time
She isn't feeling the part
It's a light comedy
How much feeling can it possibly require
Give her a few minutes
She can't hide in her bloody dressing room all day
Oh, yes she can

looks at him angrily
He is close to the end of his tether
( ) Go and find out what the hell's going on

She looks out suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the room
It's Colin
waits a moment then  opens the door wider
(') (cont'd) Come in
Marilyn wants to see you
stares at her in surprise
: 88
'
88 comes in
The dressing room is in semi-darkness
settles down in the corner
lies on a sofa, wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow
Pill bottles are scattered across the dresser at her elbow
There is a long pause
She sighs softly
How old are you
24
(Pause) Nearly You remind us of the young king in the movie
Kind of honest and innocent
() 'm not innocent
She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into the light
What's your job on this picture
62A
'm the third assistant director
Just a gopher really
Go for this, go for that
You're Larry's assistant too
He shrugs awkwardly
(') What were you doing in my house last night
Did he send you
63
hesitates
It seems pointless to deny it
He was worried about you
Are you spying on me
No
Of course not
Why would anyone spy on you
She sighs, and looks away
(') Are you all right, Miss Monroe
He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off
But then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge
Colin
Whose side are you on
stares at her
She looks utterly beautiful and vulnerable in the shadowy light
There is only one answer anyone could give
Yours, Miss Monroe
She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face lighting up
Call me Marilyn
He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy
She looks so lost and vulnerable
Perhaps he means it
Perhaps he is on her side now
: 89
89 As  walks down through the studio he meets with  , on their way to wardrobe winks at him
Marilyn's got a new boyfriend
Larry will get jealous
You can say that again
He gives a camp laugh
tries to shrug it off with a lightness he doesn't feel
Nothing happened
63A
You were in there for ten minutes at least
Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle
64
Paula was with us the whole time
The mind boggles, dear
smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see  nearby
She has heard every word of the exchange
: 90
90 is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance routine
Released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky, mildly silly and charming all at the same time
The dance is deliberately a little amateurish
Elsie Marina isn't meant to be any sort of superstar
But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and captures all this perfectly
Within the scene the actor  , playing Nicky, watches from the doorway
Everyone watches silently from behind the camera
No one can look away, least of all
It feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn is radiant
Even  has a reluctant half-smile on his face as he watches
: 91
91 The stage is empty except for  and
They sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room

Both men ignore him
He is too unimportant to worry about
leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it
dreamed last night  could hear singing
And then  realised it wasn't a dream
There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window
At two in the morning
It's a circus
freak show
smiles but  looks dazed
(') 'm going back to New York for a few days
need to see my kids
need a break

That won't help Marilyn

Sleep
It's what she lives for
Sleep is her demon
He pauses for a second
(') 've disappointed her
looks at him
shakes his head
(') She thought  could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke
That  could make her a new person
He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully
(') She wants me to protect her but can't
can't even protect myself
(Pause) She read some notes  made
They were nothing
Just a few ideas
About her
He looks up and nods slowly
She took them the wrong way
He leaves a long, uneasy pause
But you do love her
Your new bride and all that
plays with his whisky

(Pause) She's devouring me
Forgotten in the shadows,  listens attentively to every word

Hello, Colin darling
You look like Horatio defending the bridge
Are you going to let me in

93 is doing what amounts to a royal tour
She greets everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of Department with the same flirtatious grace
walks at her elbow
The crew crowd around her
She is easy and relaxed, relishing every second of their attention
hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard
know what a dreadful slave driver he can be
She sees  and takes his hands
(') David, he would be lost without you
Just doing my job
Tough as he is, he melts visibly
She moves on to , the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock misery
'm getting old, Jack
need you to work your miracles on me
You're more beautiful every year, Vivien
She laughs and turns to , looking at him severely
Now, you are looking after Larry like  told you
'm doing my best
glances away to see  standing nearby, awkward and excluded
She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair
67
Compared to  she looks frumpish
glides towards her, hands extended
Darling Marilyn
She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands
(') Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb
'm wild with jealousy
Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage
But 'm too old to play her in the film
Larry was quite brutal about that
You see, the truth is all that matters to him
That's why we all admire him so very much
She glances at  with a fluttering laugh
He smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes
(') Now,  must let you work
only came to wish you good luck
Goodbye, everyone
The crew press around her
watches, feeling more than ever the odd one out
watches her from the edge of the crowd
She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure
He is totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out
stares at him
All her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older
It as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack
She gazes at him with bitter disappointment
(') Oh, Colin
Not you too
He wants to protest but  is already turning away

You shouldn't upset yourself
You are ten times the actress she will ever be
If you could see yourself
The way you watch her
There's never been anything between Marilyn and me
She laughs hysterically
Only because she didn't want you
You're imagining things
Do you think 'm a fool
You didn't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier
She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred seething in her expression
(') (cont'd) But she saw through you, didn't she darling
Take away the actor and what's left of the man
You can't even play the husband properly without a script
(slaps him hard across the face
) hope she makes your life hell
Vivien
She storms out
After a beat,  tentatively enters
looks at  in muted apology

(') She hasn't been well
There was a baby

lost it
looks down awkwardly
sighs
(') (After a pause) Do you have a cigarette, Colin
hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers" grimaces wryly
(') Not one of those awful things
finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to , who lights it with a shaking hand
He inhales deeply

did think would fall shatteringly in love with Marilyn
What a joke
He looks at , his feelings raw and exposed

You don't leave Marilyn alone

She thinks everyone's going to abandon her
The phone rings
picks with a sudden burst of optimism
Perhaps she's come back
(Into the phone) Yes
() Sir Laurence
It's Roger
Oh, Roger
What's up

He frowns and looks at  in bewilderment
Yes, he's here

Puzzled,  takes the phone as  stares at him
Roger
, where, to Colin's astonishment  comes on the line (Roger is not in shot)

What the heck
Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant
looks around helplessly
Yes, 'm sure  can do that

He shrugs awkwardly
looks at  in panic
He shouldn't be talking to her
He's just a kid
Supposing he says something

His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast to , who looks at  with a new interest, wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that can work to his advantage
He smiles calmly

Don't you, Colin
There is a warning as well as approval in his tone

Miss Monroe said for you to wait
She won't be long

He looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage
He finds the brandy and picks it up - () Help yourself to a drink

stands in the doorway, casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a pale cream shirt
looks guiltily at the brandy

checking you've got everything you need
She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away from him
He can't take his eyes from hers
He drops his gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts
He looks up again sharply but not before she notices
She takes the decanter from his hand
Here, let me

No

hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind
'll tell you what's wrong
It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress
And this film won't help either of you
He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far
She stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise
Horribly self- conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens and coughs
She laughs
Are you sure you can handle that
You don't look old enough to drink
'm 23, Miss Monroe
It's Marilyn

Do you know 've been married three times already
How did that happen
You were just looking for the right man

checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror and sighs abruptly

But  look dead in the rushes
Dead behind the eyes
He gazes at himself thoughtfully
(') Perhaps 'm angry with her because in my heart  know my own career is in a terrible rut wanted to renew myself through her but all  see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy
He leans back

(Pause) You don't see Marilyn again, you don't even talk to her
She is completely off-limits to you
Got it

109 hurries along the corridor, looking for , who he sees pushing a rack of clothes
He stops awkwardly
She gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled
waited for you on Friday
Oh, God
'm sorry
forgot
've just been so busy
() So  hear
() You know how crews gossip
There's nothing in it
Of course there isn't
Marilyn Monroe fancying you
Come on
is put out
Up to now he has never fully confronted the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like the idea being dismissed so lightly
Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt
Before she can respond  herself coming towards them in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by  and her - people
She offers him a dazzling smile
Hi, Colin
smiles, self-conscious
stops and frowns, looking at Lucy
(') Hey, are you guys dating
That's what  heard
She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks in hard
He shrugs casually
81
Of course not
You know how crews like to gossip
His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating what he has just said to Lucy
smiles
Too bad
You look cute together
She walks off with her retinue
There is a long pause
looks up to see  staring at him in dismay
There are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily
thought you were different
Lucy,  really like you
We've had such fun
And now it's time to set your sights a little higher
get it
(Pause) Who do you think you are, Cary Grant
She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe department
Part of him knows he should go after her, but in the end he just stays where he is
He can't help feeling an unworthy sense of relief

110 crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and collapses on it gratefully
The noise of the rowdy pub floats up through the floorboards
He covers his ears with his hands then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to block it out

111 The studio is quiet at the weekend
walks along, snatching a moment for a cigarette
As he reaches the doors to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside him
is at the wheel
Get in

The studio doors open and emerges
He glances darkly at  and
Any problem, Roger
82
Just dropped by to take Colin out to lunch
looks surprised

stubs out his cigarette and hurries to the passenger door
You're not taking him to Marilyn
That would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit
Oh, no, sir

What do you have in there
Just a picnic
We've been looking forward to it, haven't we, Colin
looks at him, bemused
He gets in quickly frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave
Okay, well, have a nice time boys
Inside the car  looks at
Is she okay
In the same moment  herself erupts from under the blanket in the back
Oh, Jesus - She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty
Roger and  decided to take you out for an adventure
Didn't we Roger
() Indeed we did
Oh, God
If Milton sees me with you
'll be sacked
He tries to scramble out but  hauls him back gleefully
83
No one can sack you, Colin
(Pause) Except me, of course
She pats the seat next to her
(') don't like being on my own in the back
Before  can respond he sees the curious  running back, having spotted  in the back
What the hell
He peers into the back window
screams and buries herself back under the blanket
scrambles to get over into the back seat while  stamps on the accelerator and the car roars off
(') () Colin
Get back here, you little bastard
You're fired
Do you hear me
Fired

Do you think he saw me
can't help laughing
He finally tumbles into the back seat with  as the car speeds away
She scoots up to make room for him

This is fun
She threads her arm through his
He gazes down at their hands meshed together

There is no one else around
The wind sighs and the grass is pleasantly warm underfoot
turns her face up to the sun
This is how  ought to feel every day

Impulsively  hugs him
(') Let's run away together
He turns ashen
(') () Just kidding
She looks around happily
smiles at her
We have today, anyway
One day to do whatever we like
We can go back to real life tomorrow
Only one day
Well, maybe the weekend
Or a week
He grins
She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his side
(') What shall we do
We could go to Windsor Castle, if you like

There are two uniformed  on duty
nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of their own
Detective Chief Superintendant Smith
'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day
They'd like to look around the castle
As the policemen see  their eyes widen
Christ, is that
He stares in disbelief
smiles
Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors, is it
(After a second) Does she know anyone here, sir
We need to write down a contact name in the book
looks stumped at this
He turns to Marilyn
You don't know Her Majesty, by any chance
We met at a movie premiere
She said my dress was pretty
'm not sure that quite

He's the Royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead

He says to go straight up the hill, sir
You'll be met at the door

115B and  are led into another corridor, this one with a beautiful gold-leaf ceiling decoration

116 The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from floor to ceiling with books and prints
Every surface is covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to antique learning and culture
(63), the Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a sly wit
He greets  with a friendly, distracted air
Colin, my boy
Come in, come in
Forgive the dust
He smiles at , showing no sign whatever of recognising her
(') You are pretty, my dear
'm sure you and Colin have so much in common
looks around in awe
Gee, 'd love to read all these books some time
87
Luckily one doesn't really have to
lot of them just have pictures in
He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it
(') These are by an artist called Holbein
smiles at a portrait of a young woman
She's beautiful
She was the daughter of one of the King's courtiers, nearly 400 years ago
hope  look that good when 'm 400
laughs
He takes down another folder of drawings
And these are all by Leonardo Da Vinci
've heard of him
Didn't he paint that lady with the funny smile
She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the dizzy blonde
In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully
The Mona Lisa
Do you have that one here too
Alas, that one got away
He closes the portfolio and takes 's arm briskly
(') Now, let's go to the Queen's apartments
She's not here at the moment, but she will be sorry to have missed you
looks at him, wide-eyed
Really
88
Oh, yes
Why, she was only saying to me the other day, "what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth"
He shares a sly smile with
He knows exactly who Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company
He leads her out, with  trailing in their wake

Everything imaginable is inside - beds, chairs, baths, basins, even small rugs and chandeliers, all perfectly to scale
kneels in front of it, gazing from room to room with childlike joy
It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in every room
She cries out with joy
Look, Colin
kneels at her side
(') sure never had a dolls' house like this when  was a kid
She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and two children
She points at them, her eyes shining
(') This is me, that's you, and these are our kids
She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm
(') Our daughter's so pretty
All little girls should be told how pretty they are
They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them
Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment
(') We look like such a happy family, don't we

She turns to him
They are only inches away from each other

You mustn't let me keep you

small crowd of , and   has gathered
There are cheers as they see her
looks nervously at  but she smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently
Shall  be "her"
She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out, shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn "look"
The delighted crowd bursts into cheers stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be leaving with him
One of the spectators turns to him
Are you somebody, mate

Roger's car pulls up outside Eton College

This isn't a school, it's a palace
smiles
Eton is 500 years old
It was founded by King Henry
89A
It's like walking through history
Take that room up there
They stop as  points up at a window
90
That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough
Where we were whipped
looks at him in shock
Whipped
Beaten
She looks appalled
'd never send my kids away
(pause) How long were you here
Five years
But  was sent to boarding school when  was eight
Why
That's what we do in my family
She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly
It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy
In one way, yes
But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark
She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder
So how are you going to do it
Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there
Sounds pretty good to me
She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness
We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level
But before either of them can say anything a  turns the corner in his Eton uniform

He looks up at , his mouth hanging open in shock
Then he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice
Marilyn
It's Marilyn Monroe

smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy on the cheek
Cheering  hang out of every window
blows kisses to them all

follows after them with difficulty
pauses, jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys
Work hard, boys
don't want anyone whipping you
gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily
You can whip me anytime, Marilyn
laughs in delight
There are cheers as escorts her away
: 122
122 leans back against the car, smoking calmly
: 123
123 After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the peace and quiet of the river
rushes along the sandy bank
The water glitters magically
Hurry up, slow poke
But we haven't got any
He stops in mid-sentence as he sees  unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly
91
He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off
He hurries to find a bush to get changed behind
As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and 's cry of shock as she hits the water
Oh my gosh
It's freezing
: 124
124 swims in the water, humming softly to herself
wades in, wincing at the cold
She laughs
This is great
What if a boat goes past
We could be arrested
Don't worry
Roger will fix it
Oh, darn it
She holds her head and he looks at her with concern
What's wrong
have something in my eye
He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under the water
She holds her head up to him
can't see anything
Get closer
She tips her head back
He looks deep into her eyes - and suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips
Before he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away
(') That's the first time 've kissed anyone younger than me
There's a lot of older guys in Hollywood
She swims happily, totally relaxed
is much more self- conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats
Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the shore
She glances back, catching Colin looking
He glances away, embarrassed
92
(') Don't be shy, Colin
It's nothing you haven't seen before
wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his erection with his cupped hands
giggles
(') Oh, Colin
And you an old Etonian
He grins
She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering as she tries to dry herself
goes to take her in his arms
Let me warm you up
She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering
He rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only barrier between their bodies
Slowly his embrace becomes more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her - Don't spoil it
She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet
(') want this to be the perfect date
He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently, her expression wistful
(') haven't had a real date since was 13 years old
She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo of a lost childhood
He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse
As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans forward to kiss him chastely on the lips
The kiss is as sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish
The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine behind them
When they finally break apart she rewards him with a radiant smile
(') That was nice
don't get kissed much
She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens
93
(') Okay, what do we do now
looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the real world but reluctant to face it
There is a discreet cough and  appears
Time to go home,  think, Miss Monroe
She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him as she puts on the rest of her clothes
averts his eyes respectfully and waits for
The two men look at each other for a second
(') Be careful not to get in too deep, son

'
125 and  sit in silence in the back of the car
Her exuberance has vanished and there is a distant look in her eye

He puts his hand on hers and she squeezes it, but then pulls away

Hi Milton
She smiles sweetly

He looks at her in shock then bitterly at

She waves briefly to Colin, nothing more than a flutter of her fingers

You spent the day with her
What frame of mind was she in
She was fine
( -) Well, find out what's going on
There's a good chap
Perhaps we can persuade her on this splendid day to do the work she's paying herself to do
He stalks off
sees  grinning at him
Don't start, Dicky
You won't get any sympathy from me, dear
Frankly  wouldn't care if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow
She's trying her best
She's Marilyn Monroe
This is her life
Pills, booze, sex, more pills
(Pause) God, it must be wonderful

(') Oh, dear
Little Colin's in love

128 is waiting for  at the door
Marilyn's not well
95
But she was wonderful yesterday
looks at him for a long moment, masking his hostility in barbed politeness
don't know what you did to her, kid, but she got nervous
had to give her some pills to calm her down
She doesn't need pills
She just needs someone to care for her
Someone like you
reddens
shakes his head patronisingly
told you, 'm not in love with her
You kissed her
She said that
Spare me the bullshit
know everything
stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth
(') You messed her up, kid
Confused her
He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded
(') 've got every penny  ever made tied up in Marilyn
She owes me
If it wasn't for me she'd still be on contracts that make slave wages look good
gave her back her freedom, and now Miller's turning her against me
That's what you get for trying to help Marilyn Monroe
He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking more in sorrow than anger
96
(') If you want to play with the grown-ups, Colin, start learning the rules

There's a sharp rap at the door
() Colin

opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep
Roger
What's the matter
() It's Marilyn
cold dread clutches at 's stomach
He stumbles out of bed and opens the door
stands in the doorway Is she dead
She's asking for you
She's sick

How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma
Just bloody get dressed

She hasn't made a sound for over an hour
We should break down the door
How many pills did she take
Oh, Jesus, who knows
wasn't counting
knocks gently
Marilyn
There is no reply

132 and  carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel and prop it up against the wall
That's her window

The window is open

'
133 tumbles in through the window with a clattering thump
Marilyn
shaft of moonlight reveals  lying naked across the bed, her body partly covered by the sheet
Half empty pill and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser; there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her mother Gladys
(') Marilyn
For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she groans and sits up, looking at him blearily
98
Oh hi, Colin
Are you okay
Everyone was worried about you
Phooey
She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily on the pillow
(') Get in
She is instantly back asleep
fumbles his way to the door
He searches for the key on the side table and quickly finds it
He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses, looking back at Marilyn
He puts the key back and bends down to whisper at the keyhole
It's me
She's fine but 'm going to keep an eye on her
'll sleep on the sofa
() Come on, Colin, open up
(After a second) can't find the key
(Pause) You can all go to bed now
() Colin, open this door
She needs me
goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping Marilyn, his expression suffused with a tenderness we have never seen in him before
He pulls up the sheet so that it covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest his head on the pillow

'
134 wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding him
Colin
What are you doing here
sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her expression panicky and disoriented
hurls himself off the bed
99
came in through the window
He realises this doesn't sound reassuring
(') Milton thought you were sick
She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed smile
The window
Is there a balcony, like in Romeo And Juliet
How romantic
(Pause) But 'm not sick
What makes them think that
She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her bedside table
Please don't take any more pills
She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand
He reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp
As he puts it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph
(') (cont'd) Who's that
My mom
Her expression softens as she looks at the picture
(') They took her to the Sanatorium when  was a kid
grew up in other people's homes, mostly
Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture, this time of Abraham Lincoln
frowns
Abraham Lincoln
don't know who my father is so it might as well be him
Why not
can pick any father  want
She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully
(') Do you have a home, Colin
real one
Yes,  do
100
And a mother and father who still live together
Yes
And do they love you
'm sure they do
He nods
She smiles sadly
You're lucky
Her eyes fill with tears
She looks up at him anxiously
(') Do you love me, Colin
He stares at her
She looks lovely but desperately vulnerable
Yes
She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her palm
gently takes her hand and takes two of them away
She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back gently on the pillow
(') But you and  come from different worlds
You're like some Greek Goddess to me
'm not Greek
She smiles, teasing him
He smiles back
She takes his hand, looking at him in appeal
(') don't want to be a Goddess just want to be loved like an ordinary girl
Mr
Miller loves you
She stares at him, her face going blank with misery
found his notebook
It said 'd let him down
101
Writers scribble all kinds of things
It doesn't mean anything
She looks at him, her eyes full of pain
He wanted me to find it
It said he should never have married me
That  was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred
He's left me, Colin
Why do the people  love always leave me
She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that responds with sudden passion
'll never leave you
She smiles and embraces him gratefully
She sighs
All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe
As soon as they realise 'm not her, they run
He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms
She sighs sleepily
(') Boy, there's a lot of men in this business
And they all think you've got to sleep with them
She looks across at him, their faces inches apart
(') You're not like that
That's why like you
stares back at her guiltily
She smiles
(') You should date that Wardrobe lady
She's pretty
don't want to
(Pause)  love you, Marilyn
She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again
They stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible
leans forward and kisses him gently
The embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily
He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily
He wants her more than he has wanted anything before
102
And then he stops
The fantasy he has been pursuing for weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it does for him it will only damage her further
He pulls away from her gently
Her eyes flicker open lazily
What's the matter
Don't you want to make love
Maybe we should just be friends
Okay
Friends
She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw
As she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back
She curls against him
(') This is nice
Like spoons
used to do this with Johnny
Who's Johnny
Johnny Hyde
My agent, back in the old days
He was thin, like you
Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep
With her body warm against him 's resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined
Marilyn
She mutters softly in reply
(') Do one thing for me
Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do
Show Larry you're a great actress
() Okay
He smiles and turns out the light

He gets up and sees her through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath, her back towards him
She is practicing the gentle waltz tune she is to sing in the film

squeezes her hand and gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave
Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone
As the door closes  curls herself up in the bed
'm so tired of feeling scared
Life is so shitty
hate it
It hurts too much
looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish
'm here now
'll look after you
She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful
Good old Colin
Looking after me, looking after Larry, looking after Vivien
Always putting everyone before yourself
There is an edge to this
He gazes at her, shaken, but she smiles and touches his face gently
He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms

It hurts
It hurts, Colin
She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and frightened

(') The baby
can't lose the baby
looks at her aghast
(') It's a surprise
For Arthur
Don't tell anyone
Promise me
He hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door

The doctor's coming

Marilyn, unlock the door

gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about anything except Marilyn
There is a shuffling sound and the door is unlocked
At the same moment  comes rushing in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye
Marilyn
Marilyn, my baby, what has Colin done to you
haven't done anything
She's just
got a stomach ache
He reddens with embarrassment

What will Arthur say if she dies
She's not dying, for Christ's sake
The  now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side
He nods briskly

Connell
Is the patient in there
Please save her
it's Marilyn Monroe
You can't let her die
calmly extracts himself from her grasp
Perhaps you'd all like to give us a little privacy
As  shepherds the others out  turns on him bitterly
Happy now, kid

He tears the prescription off the pad and looks up
Who's in charge here
, ,  and  all step forward as one
gives them a wry look and shrugs
(') 've given Mrs
Miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped
She needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that she'll be fine

leans forward and almost snatches the prescription from his hand
She'll be safe with me

She looks bitterly at Colin

Well, goodnight then
holds the door open as he gets in
Was she really pregnant

Miller
He looks at  with cool disapproval, then closes the door and drives off

145 creeps into the room and sits on the bed
is awake
She gazes at him, hazy but lucid
We have to say goodbye now, Colin
Arthur's on his way back
When this film is over 'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him
'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's
She smiles wistfully at the fantasy
(') We have to forget this ever happened
don't want to forget
He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately
(') Let me protect you from all this
She smiles sadly
110
What do you want to do
Marry me
Why not
You could come and live at my parents place
You'd love it
It's a castle, like in a fairy tale
We wouldn't even have to live together
You could have your own suite of rooms
He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young
She looks at him with a sad, sweet smile
He shakes his head stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal
(') You could quit
Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood
Let it all go
This is what 've worked for my whole life
couldn't just give it all up
Why not, when it drives you crazy
Her eyes widen in surprise
flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression
You think 'm crazy
didn't mean that
just meant you could be happy
am happy
got everything ever dreamed about
She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes
He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain that Olivier was right
There is no way back
She doesn't want to be rescued
He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes
Of course you're happy
(Pause) You're a star
The biggest star in the world
She smiles, reassured
He drags himself off the bed and goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back
(') You're right, Marilyn
We have to forget all this
() 111- 112
(') From now on 'm nobody
Just the third
You don't even know exist
We'll never look at each other again
She giggles with some of her old playfulness
Well, maybe just a wink
Once in a while
He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out
As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be replaced by a bleak, frightened expression
: 146
'
146 sits in front of his make-up mirror in his Grand Ducal uniform, smoothing down his hair with pomade knocks and comes in
They're ready for you on set, Sir Laurence
Marilyn
She's just arrived
Only an hour late
Not bad by her standards
He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform
(') Maybe we will finish this bloody film after all

147 The crew are ready
The actors are on set
stands by the camera
is half-hidden in the shadows
There is a flurry of activity and  emerges, with  on one side and  on the other
She looks exactly as Marilyn should
With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess
She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him
He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret
111- 112A
turns to the assembled crew
silence settles
She smiles around, blinking in the lights
She looks for comfort or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or sullen hostility
She smiles nervously
(') hope you will all forgive me
It wasn't altogether my fault
have been ill
She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to understand herself and their expectations of her
(') 'd like you to remember  tried
This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence
No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty
Perhaps they think it is just another performance
113
147A
147A , in character, lies back on a sofa, with  on top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after his night with her
looks kittenish and irresistible as she sings only a few inches from 's face
( ) "
found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, 'm yours no matter what others may say or do
Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart
" She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly
There is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch
is amongst them
It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy for him
He suddenly realises that   has crept up silently behind him to watch the scene
As he turns to her she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring softly so that only he can hear
First love is such sweet despair, Colin
She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into the darkness at the back of the set
148
148 Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the finish line
We see a montage of scenes being filmed - -  enters as Major Domo through the main door of the oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving equipment
-  and   crossing the drawing room to the Grand Duke's bedroom
-  crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door
The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence - Very quiet, studio
Going for a take
The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy clunks
Camera running
Speed
113A
looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing
( ) "My dear
" ( ) "'ve got a solemn word of warning for you
" ( ) "What's that, my beloved
" ( ) "You know what's going to happen
'm going to fall in love with you, because  always, always do
" on  as she smiles, her face radiating joy and vitality
And then, in the split second before  calls `cut', turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin
He grins
looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles indulgently
Cut
Okay boys and girls, that's a wrap
There is a smattering of applause from the crew leaves the stage
148A
148A walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone
149
149 The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a group of hardened war veterans
offers  a grudging nod - `well done'
now comes forward, calling out above the hubbub
If you'd all like to step this way, you'll find something  think you'll like
indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio, loaded with gaily wrapped parcels
He ushers the crew over
(') parting gift to each of you from Marilyn
Men on the left, ladies on the right
113B
At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd happens
One of the crew simply picks up his present without looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against the wall
There is a moment, then a  does the same with hers
Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps their present
The bin is soon overflowing
stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out
, utterly indifferent to the hostile undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully
It's been a lot of fun, kids
See you at the Academy Awards
He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the dustbin as he goes
watches all this in shocked silence
He looks at the label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin, with thanks, Marilyn"
114
150  150 150A
150A The wardrobe department is empty except for , who cradles her own gift from Marilyn
comes in, looking nervous
They look at each other awkwardly
Aren't you going to throw yours away
Of course not
It's from Marilyn Monroe
He smiles
She shrugs and turns to leave
115
(After a second) Lucy
She turns back to look at him
(') was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday
'm washing my hair
He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves
She goes but then stops to look back at him
(') Did she break your heart
(After a second) little
Good
It needed breaking
There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the experience
He nods, accepting the rebuke
(') (After a second) might be free on Wednesday
smiles
She goes out
He looks down at Marilyn's present in his hands
: 151
151 walks down the hall
He notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre
As he goes towards it he sees coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his job done
The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything they've been through together
offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way
152
152 sits on his own, watching an edited version of the "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62)
comes in
glances at him
"You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir
/Our revels now are ended
() 116
(') These our actors,/As  foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air
Prospero
() We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep
" sits down next to the great man
They watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them
The sequence shows  improvising in the champagne and caviar scene
She serves herself food and drink before collapsing, drunk
The endless retakes and fluffs gone, what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty
(') (After a second) She's quite wonderful
No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct
Astonishing
He seems almost lost in awe
gazes at him in surprise
You should tell her that
Oh,  will
But she won't believe me
That's probably what makes her great
It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy
He smiles wryly
(') tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me
(Pause) Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again
He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up
(') And now 'm going back to the theatre
John Osborne is writing a piece for me
thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff
117
() Miller made me see things differently
(Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best
And believe me, most of the time, really am the best
He goes to the door and pauses
(') You've done a good job, boy
(Pause) Welcome to the circus
He goes out
looks back up at the projection box
Run it again, please
The lights go down
's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy
It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene 90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent
on  for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then - 152A
152A The circus is leaving
The film is shutting down
Not knowing his next job  sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul
Head down, sipping a pint
He could be a regular here
behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and regulars at play
And then, as if a gust of wind invaded,  looks up and freezes
The  , sensing something, turns to look up as well
The regulars are frozen in mid-action
is missing it all
100% of his attention is given to his woe and his pint
Buy a girl a drink
doesn't turn
He recognizes the voice and smiles
Can  get another one of those please, Barry
for once is silent, pours a pint
The regulars try not to stare
didn't want to leave without saying goodbye
117A
hands  a package
(') The first time you saw this, all had on was the radio
Colin opens the package
It's her copy of the script
On the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: (') Don't forget me
As if  could
Everyone else on the picture wishes they could
Everyone else doesn't understand
She smiles, touched
Be a gentleman and walk me to my car
152B
&
152B The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car
opens the car door for
beckons him closer
She kisses him gently
He smiles and says lightly: What's that for
That's for being on my side; and remember, when you see me wink, that's for you
walks around the car and looks over at
(glancing at ) Looking a couple of inches taller than when  first saw you
nods at  (a silent salute suggesting job well done
) He gets into the car and we stay on  as he watches it pull away
comes to the doorway of the pub
Was that really Marilyn Monroe
117B
No - just a good friend of mine
walks back into the pub, leaving  alone, staring at the vanishing car
And then the sun swallows it as it drives into the English countryside
: 153
153 walks along chatting to friends
Dressed in a neat dark suit he looks older and more confident
There is little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office
We see the caption:
154
'
154 walks into a small office
Film cans are piled up all over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves
sits typing at her desk
goes to his own desk, glances at his diary, then looks up
Any messages
pushes a piece of paper at him
It's probably just someone having a joke
looks down at the message
There is a Los Angeles phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe
(After a moment) Did she say anything
118
She just asked you to call
(Pause) It is a joke, isn't it
stares down at the paper
Probably
(Pause) Book a call as soon as you can
Los Angeles, California
Brentwood 1890
: 155
'
155 It is late
stares at the number on the scrap of paper
The phone rings
He picks it up eagerly
Your call to Los Angeles
We hear the crackle of the international line
He waits anxiously as the ringing continues
: 155A
'
155A the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable Brentwood house
: 156
'
156 The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions and deep rugs
Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood hills
white phone rings on the table
It rings continuously, insistently
It carries on ringing
No one comes
on the jangling phone
Each time it rings we think Marilyn might appear, but she never does
It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room
As the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz
119
() " found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, 'm yours no matter what others may say or do
Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart
" The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly drifts away to nothing
157
'
157 sits with the phone to his ear
The sound of Marilyn singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise has been revisiting it in his memory
He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going to answer
In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle in resignation
His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans
He stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they have been here for a long time, ignored
He finds the one he is looking for - it says simply  on the can
He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a Movieola in the corner of the room
He turns it on and bends to look
The screen bursts into life with an image of  at her most vital and captivating
It is a copy of some rushes from The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since forgotten
We see  dancing happily, exaggerating off camera, looking playful and sexy
She is radiant and full of life
After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks happily
Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet and charming
There is something so completely natural about the gesture feels he has been swept back seven years in time and is standing in front of him again, in the flesh
It moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen this clip before
At any rate he hasn't thought about it for years
It is  as he will always remember her, relaxed, affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever his
She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without sound)
She says something to an unseen crew member, then looks back, smiling at the camera
120
Her face fills the screen
Beautiful, timeless - Happy
