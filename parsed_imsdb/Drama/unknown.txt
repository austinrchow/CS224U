Glances over again
Martin catching him
Can  help you
Hello
The guy points to his headphones, shrugs
Martin  at his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds
nothing
Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored  who nods towards the back
Martin moves past college kids on Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked
- Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street, glancing back
No one is following
He moves onto the street, waits at a light

There's a bruise around her eye, now healing
She moves to the register where a beefy  counts off a week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her
She thanks him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to steam milk for a coffee

Patient, but wishing he was on his way home as well
He looks over Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the "Horticus" book on the table
Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written "Identity Theft
" (not looking up) Have you contacted your Credit Card companies
No
You don't understand
As explained to the last guar -- who went home by the way -- it's not about Credit Cards
Someone has taken over my identity
Someone is pretending to be me

Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one
Did you contact the local authorities
Yes
They
They believe the other man
need a new passport, papers to prove -- Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy
Why do they believe the other man
Because
Because my wife
He's staying with my wife
They must be forcing her -- Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away
(') You don't think  know how it sounds
Let me ask you this, if my wife was having some hot and heavy affair with another man, why not just leave me
Why this
After all, we're in Europe, right
() 32
: Spiegler burns, nods
(') Look,  need a passport
(tapping the forms) need the documents that this embassy is supposed to provide
Do you know, the things people will do to get a  Passport
() Anyway, we're closing until Monday
If you come back then -- Monday
They've kidnappedmy wife
You need to find out who this other man is, you need to be in contact with my wife -- Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off
He picks up Martin's Rolex, glances at the initials
Looks at his copy of 'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover
As he does, a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up
You understand, we're not a detective agency, we
Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore
Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is scribbled: "28th

Intimate, to be in here
Photographs on a cluttered vanity: Old country, Bosnia
Men in suits and women in long dresses
Children, a boy and two girls
Gina
Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets it on the stove
She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of fatty meat
Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the window
leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the plate onto a sloping roof above
Excited  as stray cats come running from every direction
Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the bathroom, turns on the hot water

Gina puts the bowl in the sink, heads for the door
Just a moment, Biko

Martin, looking at her
He knows what she's feeling
She meets his eyes a moment, glances back
sees Smith, caught in the crowd, but pushing his way towards them
Come on
They push their way forward through the crush

Gina takes Martin's hands, pulls him along a street of neon club signs, lines of youth waiting to get in
Smith emerges from the station, tracks them

They come to a door crowded with youths, Middle-Eastern and Balkan
Gina pulls Martin to the front
Unfriendly eyes  down Martin, the huge  nods recognition to Gina
Smith stops, takes in the many clubs, the various Bouncers guarding their doors
Looks down at his boring suit, nods defeat
Turns and walks away
''  - The club is barely-lit, punctuated by beams of moving light, constant music
The bar a glowing oasis
Gina leads Martin through
They pass down through old  bomb shelter construction, through curtains, into
Even darker, only small glowing lights, candles, neon tubing casts shadows
Quiet almost, only the dull 'thud" of the bass reaches them
He puts a hand on her shoulder
she pushes it off
Gina

Flies at him, slapping clumsily
Like an enraged child
Martin grabbing her
holding her tight
Bodies pressed together
as her anger and fear and grief dissolve into sobbing
His family is in Africa
The money will just stop coming
they'll never know why
Martin calming her, stroking her head
Her hand finding his, gripping it tight, wanting the contact
Martin looking down at the face buried in his chest
Feeling versus memory
Gina
Liz
Torn
long beat
Her control returning
And her strength
She separates from him
(') You saved my life
No response
Eyes locked
(') You never know, what you will do, until the time comes, right
Martin looks down, unsure
She stays on his face
Looking for
Her eyes shift: young Serbian  speaks with a female
Both cool, young, tough
Gina makes eye contact, heads nod in recognition
(') Wait here
Martin watches her go, speak with them through low light and smoke
His gaze wander
into the strobing lights
'
--   -- all
It's snow, drifting down
settling on a small idyllic home
Picket fence
Lights glow inside
Suddenly
Liz sits on the edge of a bed, glass of red wine in her hands
Martin enters the frame, his clothing and hands covered in drywall dust
Are you ready
Liz rubs dust off his face, leans in to kiss him
65
- Martin's eyes flick open and the  and  of the club come flooding back in
'
-- Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater undershirt and jeans
She unzips the jeans, pulls them down long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra
hesitates
Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her
Beat
Beat
Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts, the arch of her back
She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed clothing towards him
heavy coat, some jeans
Put these on
She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses
(') Were you happy
He looks up, shirt in his hands
She doesn't waiver
(') Your marriage
Was it happy
Yes
think so
don't remember
how it felt exactly
She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes
So why would she do this to you
For the same reason  would
If  thought it was the only way to protect her
Gina nods, distant
Martin presses on, difficult
(') keep having a dream
Liz is in the bedroom of our home, although it's different somehow
Her hair's different
she's smiling, about to say something
Then it ends

: (') just can't remember
how felt
He stops
Just the low pulsing  from the other room The lights revolving over them
Gina watching him
Looking back at her
That connection again
He looks away
She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to him
He shakes his head no
She shrugs, sparks it
Inhales deeply, eyes close
She leans back
(') You'll need to get out of town
There's a man who's helping me
He can -- (seems to ignore him) In Bosnia
It was not like you probably imagine
It was nice
there were cherry blossoms
() One day,  was sixteen
My sister and my brother came to me and said hey let's play hide and seek, down by the creek
He had ten Marka for whoever won
It was amazing, the way he just said it
Beat
She raises the joint, hits it again
Her eyes open, but she's deep in the memory and it's intense
(') So  went down to this place knew, under the small bridge over the creek
And  hid and waited
Not really that long
Then went back home, to find my brother and collect my money
() He, and my father and my uncle were dead
And so was my mother
My sister was alive
for a little while
She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin
(') It was not enough, to kill us
They wanted us to remember, every day, for the rest of our lives
We're you

: (2) What
Raped
() No
No one touched me
But now
'm not going anywhere
'm not running anymore
She nestles in under his arm
Closes her eyes
He lets his hand gently stroke her hair
won't let anything happen to you
( ) Liar
Say it again
'll protect you
She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way to sleep
Cool
- Gina sleeps, at peace
Martin leans over the one object he has left, his copy of "Horticus
" He studies the number markings on the flap, working
- Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge
-- Cheering ; a sound like
massive indoor ,  racing on a reverberating wood track below a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship
at the counter of a busy bar
Jeans, -shirt, Bomber Jacket
Different look, to say the least
Across the bar, nurses a coffee
They exchange looks, briefly familiar grey-skinned figure settles next to him:
Thank you for coming
Martin glances around, edgy
Jurgen watches him, glances at Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her
() 68
: You know, the most dangerous man in the world is the man who feels that he is drowning
He will drag under anyone who tries to help him
Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar
picture and article about the murdered nurse
Martin's picture, fuzzy
(nods, bitter) didn't do it
Jurgen studies him, hard
Looks back at Gina
You said you had something
Martin feels in his pockets, takes out the copy of 'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers
These numbers, are a code
The first number refers to the page of a given book
The second to a specific line on that page
The third number to words on that line
If  didn't have the exact edition of the book, the code would be unbreakable
(nodding, impressed) And what do the numbers refer to
That's where it breaks down -- the words are the Latin names of two plant species
Calochortus Albus
and Umbellularia Californica
Fairy Lantern
and California Bay
Both common flowering plants
Not part of your work
Or Professor Bressler's
Martin shakes his head
Jurgen grunts
Pencils notes
(') Your thesis
The one you sent Bressler
What was the title
() 69
: (2) "The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination
" And it was after reading it that he invited you here
Correct
Correct
Yes
Look -- Did you ever know someone called Laurence Darnell
Martin looks at him quizzically
Shakes his head
(') He was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin
He died in an auto accident earlier this year
He was doing research very similar to yours
Jurgen studying him closely
Martin shakes his head
(') What is Professor Bressler's relationship with Prince Fahad
() Fahad's sponsoring the Forum, Bressler's the keynote speaker
So they're not close
In a way
they're opposites
Bressler wants to end world hunger
Open research
universal access to all his data on crop cultivation
But Fahad's just a businessman
They're both progressives
Fahad knows we'll need food long after oil
New agricultural patents are worth billions
() 70
: (3) But his progressiveness has cost him
his own people hate him
the attempts on his life
He's got balls, that's for sure
Another beat
Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card from the pages of the 'Horticus'
turns it over, Martin's remembered schedule scribbled on the back
There's a cocktail party, before Bressler's speech tonight
It's in our suite
Champagne and hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a few of his guests
Is Fahad going to be there
Yes
Bressler invited him
Martin trails off
Starting to get there
Martin Harris
with just a few guests, in a confined space with Prince Fahad
For some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you
Oh, Jesus
You can't -- Jurgen flips his notebook shut
Gets up
--  need a few more hours
You need to go somewhere you will not be seen
Then meet me outside the Cafe Adler on the Kochstrasse

a  up the street
We have to go
We have to do what Jurgen said, stay out of -- She starts to pull him away, but he's not moving
He's staring at the pre-paid cell phones on display
Jurgen may have nothing

,   - Liz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt, putting on makeup
The room's shower is on
as she applies mascara
The Camera searches her face, her small gestures, looking for clues
Shower stops
behind her, Martin  comes out of the bathroom, nude
He picks a robe up off the bed, pulls it on as he approaches her, places his hands on her shoulders
They stare at each other in the vanity mirror
Martin  picks up the phone
Dr
Harris speaking
(
) ( ) Yes, hello, Dr
Harris
This is Else Adlam from Dr
Bressler's office
Dr
Bressler was wondering if you might be able to meet with him today

Eleven o'clock, if that's all right
Weinhaus Huth on Tiergarten

Across from her, Martin, a cap pulled low over his features
He opens another phone, dials
Yes, hello, this is Dr
Harris

Bressler
,    - Jurgen hands over a library card
finds his request slip, slides two documents across the counter
One a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads
-- He finishes reading the printed monograph
Closes it
Looking down at the cover
"The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD
He slides the bound photocopy next to it
"The process of Drakea pollination" by Laurence Darnell, University of Wisconsin
long beat
The two titles side-by-side
Sudden thought
Jurgen takes something out of his pocket; the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'
The scribbled schedule notations on one side
turns it over: the bowling alley's Uncle Sam logo
Jurgen holds closer, studying it
His mind clicking
printed German text
number: 21
And right at the bottom, a small time-clock stamp
-- Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals, near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and its zoo
Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle style brasserie bordering the avenue
Why here
The zoo
She loves Polar Bears
never knew exactly why
Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant
Looks back at Martin who hasn't moved
She checks her watch
Okay, go
You're going to be late for your date
() 73
: Martin nods, heads into the park
Long, curving paths bordered by green
labyrinth
' Gina watches, sunglasses on, as a taxi pulls up and a wiry haired man steps out, pays the driver
Lap-top bag over his shoulder
Another taxi arrives, Liz and Martin  get out
This shouldn't take long
just need to see what Bressler wants
Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo
Take your time,  want to see the zoo anyway
Memory, or nostalgia, touch her cool face
(') love the Polar Bears
Martin  nods, watches her go
He checks his watch and heads inside
-- , doing her best to casually window-shop at a designer storefront
Stolen glance across the street
- The  offers to take Bressler's lap-top bag
Bressler politely declines him
The waiter nods, leaves
Bressler opens the computer bag, checks on the lap-top inside
Zips it back up
Positions the bag by his elbow
Smiles to Martin
thought we might have a table for three, in case you still had your alter ego with you
No, thank God
assume he's safely back in the hospital
() 74
: Well, it's a lesson
You never know what people will do
All my work used to be on-line, my e- mails on an open server
year ago, someone broke into my office and stole my computer
believe they were after my research
Luckily,  split my data up and double encrypt it until  put it all together and make it public
That's why this stays with me until tonight's over
Martin  nods, starts to look at his menu
(') Now what was so important that it could not wait until this evening
,  he's been played
single beat
When he looks up, he's cool
hope you can forgive me
It was something you said
() It's been tormenting me
Martin  has his phone out and is , blind
- sits on a bench near a pond, tossing bread crumbs to ducks
His phone chirps, he checks it and is

Takes out her cell phone

Passes beneath the elephant gate
Martin starts to move forward
then   as Smith arrives, hurrying, again checking his phone
He pushes to the front of the line, pays his way in, eyes searching
Martin moves out behind him, hat pulled low
/  - Watchful staff; soothing music
Gina at a rack of dresses, anxiously looks out of the window, staring at Martin  and Bressler in the restaurant, a silent heated exchange
- Bressler in high form, reacting -- No
God
You're focusing on the science, but this
(patting his laptop) this is history
You open the research before it's finished, the conglomerates gobble it up
In the entire history of human development, name me one time when business has ever acted except in its own self-interest

Bressler catches this, looks to Martin , questioning
'm sorry, it's my fault
Another appointment  forgot
It doesn't matter
(jumping back in) But see you, you say  am too cautious
It's an idiot thing to say
'm a realist
- Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in another direction
Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over
- Martin  standing
Bressler, collecting his bag and scarf
'm sorry if  offended you, Dr
Bressler
just -- Don't be stupid
You can't offend me
We are colleagues, this is good discussion
But please, Dr
Harris -- Power is an animal, all to itself
It adapts, mutates to whatever form will best preserve it
It's always closer than we know

Perhaps you're right

urgently searching

Bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi
He's alone
No sign of Martin
Pulls out her phone

The sound of a cell-phone
Liz glances back
Martin, pressed out of sight against a wall
He his phone, tucks it away
- Martin  striding through the park toward the zoo
Gina way behind, trying to catch up
Dials again, Martin's phone going straight to voicemail

The giant Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her

Her eyes, soft
smile
which fades as she senses a presence
Turns

Standing across from her in this protected space
strange numbness
Doesn't know where to start
Liz
Just that syllable
She stares back, features tense
What are you doing here
Liz
What's happening
You're crazy -- you have to leave me alone
Why --
:  have to know why, Liz
Are they making you do this
Are they threatening you
How did you find me -- () 78

The Polar Bears

You me

She searches his face

Her facade seems suddenly to crumble

You can't what
can't get out
Can't leave
They'll kill me

Frustrated, he's a little lost
His eyes play over the entrance to the lower area, other women, also with umbrellas
- Martin  waiting in the ticket line at the gates
Gina approaches, breathless
Sees Martin
Hangs back from the ticket line
Spots a large party of school kids
Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group
just another parent
Swept through the turnstiles
Behind her, Martin  steps up to the ticket window
(' What are they making you do
Is it about Fahad
can't answer that
Come with me, right now
We can -- No
They'll kill us both
Who are they
She shakes her head, tormented

Not now
Not until we're safe
Then 'll explain everything,  promise
All want is for us to get out alive
You have to believe me

Her eyes lock on his

My case

Meet me at the airport at three o'clock
We can run together

Mind racing
Eyes suddenly catching , walking right by
Moment's urgent eye contact

Martin 's here
He's on his way
What can he do
He knows he can't stay
Suddenly, Liz moves her face to his
Kisses him on the lips
Whispers

Martin steps back slowly
Their eyes hold
Then he turns, walks quickly away
Behind the glass of the penguin exhibit
She saw the kiss
Cuts up a small path rising up from the Polar Bear area
At the top he turns, hiding himself, looking back
'
-- Smith and Martin  converge from opposite directions on Liz, speak at her, close, heated
Smith pops open his phone
Martin   at Liz, almost pushing her back against the glass
She  back up at him

He turns away, moves to the top of the path where Gina waits for him
They walk in silence
She's pretty
Martin doesn't acknowledge
Each face a mix of emotions

crosses the street to his building, carrying the bowling bag
'  - The phone on his desk starts
No one to pick up
- Martin and Gina hurry across the street
Cellphone to Martin's ear
Listening to it
- Jurgen lumbers asthmatically up the stairs
Gets to the fourth floor
Sound of the   above
Trudges up the last flight
Phone   just as Jurgen reaches the top
He stops, wheezing
An  propped against the door
He picks it up
Thumbs it open
Takes out: --  -
from the security camera at airport Immigration couple at a desk
Liz and Martin
Unmistakably Martin
hears the phone   again inside his apartment
Fumbles in his pocket for the key

Puffing: Ja

: (
) ( ) Is that Ernst Jurgen
Yes, it is
(
) My name's Rodney Cole
You left a message on my phone
There were two from Martin as well
What kind of trouble is he in
, Trains rumble and whoosh
Booming
Hurried commuters pushing past
-- he's the academic colleague we've seen in Martin's memory flashes -- an avuncular man about ten years Martin's senior
Talks on a cell phone: Oh my God
that's unbelievable, the poor man
Well here's the good news -- 've just arrived in Berlin
yes, 've been teaching in Leipzig, at the Hochschule fur Technik
came up for the last day to hear Bressler's speech
() 'll come right over, it's not far
No, it's no problem
'  - ( :) appreciate it, Herr Cole
Puts the phone down
beat
Another look at the airport scans of Martin
Studying them a moment
Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table
Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel
Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the bottom of the bag
lifts away a false floor
Reaches inside
The contents hidden from us
a shadow of tension crosses his face
Then a slow, enigmatic smile
() 82
: --
the mournful  of its whistle
Jurgen turns off the gas
Spoons Nescafe into a mug
Opens a closet, reaches over a musty clutter of jars and boxes
finds a rusted sugar tin
Inside is a single ancient sachet of sweetener
beat, pensive
He tears it open, adds it to the Nescafe
He looks up
Listening for
anticipating
the lively  at his door
Jurgen opens the door
it's  , grinning
shaking rain from his coat
Herr Jurgen
Dr
Cole
Please, come on in
Jurgen ushers him in
Leads them into the living room
(') Drink
've a bottle labelled 'brandy', which is more than likely hair lacquer
or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind
() No, thank you
Maybe some coffee
'm making some for myself
'm good
Thanks
Cole looks around the tiny apartment
Sees the framed photos on the mantel
Looks closer
(') You were in the military
The Stasi
In East Germany
() 83
: Wow, wait till  tell my son
He loves all that Cold War stuff
Look at that car
What is that
'Zil'
Suspension of a donkey cart and smelt like a tannery
Vanished as quickly as the Wall
Cole studies the other pictures
Notices Martin's Rolex beside them
Jurgen pours the kettle into his mug
So
This business with Martin
hell of a thing
How did he find you
Quite by chance, as it happens
Sounds like he was damn lucky
So, what can  do to help
Come with us to the authorities
Help them confirm his identity
The authorities
Jesus, it's that bad
guy comes to you with a story like that
What made you take the case
Curiosity
Curiosity
Is that all
Professional curiosity
There's not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me
Cole's face tightens
his back still toward Jurgen
(') a few questions  still think over
One in particular
From when  worked for the Aufklarung: our foreign intelligence wing
Cole still hasn't moved
Discreetly slips open a button on his jacket
Jurgen cradles his coffee, steam rising
() 84
: (2) (') There was this rumor
Of a based assassination unit called Section 15
Freelance, deniable
They'd work for whoever would pay -- public sector, private sector
Second-to-none in their planning and efficiency
They never failed
What's more, they were invisible
They'd strike, and nobody would even know there had been foul play
It was only rumor, of course
Cole turning to face Jurgen
Smile gone
Glint of a gun inside his packet
Jurgen looking steadily back at him
Takes a deep gulp of coffee
You had fifteen minutes after called
Why didn't you run
Where would  run from Section 15, Mr
Cole
can hardly walk
The edge of a smile, another large gulp of the coffee
Jurgen sets down the cup
He wheezes
(') Before  could get Chesterfields, smoked sixty machorkas a day
Filthy Soviet things
Killed more Russians than Stalin
My doctors assure me 'll soon be joining their list of casualties
Cole looking back at him, impassive
want to know how he found you
want every number, every source you've contacted on his behalf
And then what
We shake hands and you go away
Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket
(') There's no need for that
Beat
Cole's eyes flicker
Jurgen's body tightening
the coffee
the empty sachet of sweetener
() 85
: (3) Cole looks at Jurgen
moment's glimmer of respect
He doesn't move
His gaze lingering
Understanding
(') You never think
you'll have the courage to use it
But we do
The best of us
Jurgen coughs again
Suddenly sways
Puts a hand out to steady himself
Knocking over the mug of coffee
as the cyanide sweeps through him
Trembling hands clasp the edge of table
Building force
Shaking
His piercing eyes never leaving Cole
through the pain: Tell me
if he remembers everything
What then
No answer
Jurgen's hands slip
He slumps forward, his head hammering down onto the table
final convulsion
Then he's still
long beat
Cole buttons his jacket
Slips on some gloves
Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead
Restoring some dignity to him
Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he picked up
Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket
He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment
The legs of the stove
ever so slightly askew
The phone
Cole ignores it, moves forward

Listens, frustrated
The phone  and
He flips it shut

She looks back out the window
Sleeting rain streaks the glass
Endless grey city-scape
He tracks a clock: 1:40
Looks back at Gina who senses his gaze, keeps hers straight out

Carefully pries it away
Reaches into the hole: The  of Martin and Liz, arriving
And Jurgen's

As he watches it burn, he leafs carefully through the notebook

Inaudible PAs
Carts loaded with luggage

She turns it toward Martin
Filled with personal effects
Sitting on top a  passport
long beat
Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it
() 87
: His photo
And his name
Doctor Martin Harris
-- Noisy and busy
Gina uneasy
watching Martin as he carefully examines each item in the case
Everything familiar, yet strange
His, but somehow not his
a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket
His published paper -- the same edition Jurgen found at the library
his leather wallet
Martin studies it
Identical to the one Martin  had
Opens it
-- New Hampshire Driver's license
Credit cards
Martin fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out
the    we saw in Bressler's lab of a younger Liz with a younger Martin  in Paris
Except this time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo
gazing at it
He runs his fingers over its dock-eared corners, every bump and crease
Looks up to find Gina watching him
long, awkward pause
She reaches over
Takes the photo from him
Studies it
Can you remember now
how you felt
Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them
Gina handing back the photo
He stares down at Liz again as Gina stands, start to collect her things
(') We shouldn't stay here, it's not safe for you
Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him in this moment
He looks up at her, torn, back down at the pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in front of him
He glances at the clock: 2:55
Gina tracks his gaze
gets it, takes a step back
(') Oh, God
'm an idiot
She's meeting you here
Martin meets her gaze, open book

'm sorry
Yes
She's my wife
She's in danger have to -- (nodding, auto-pilot) That's good
'm happy for you
have to go
No, wait

We can take care of you
can get you money, arrange -- ( ) Stop
Be quiet
You've got what you wanted
You don't need me anymore and in case "we've" forgotten,  take care of myself very well
She starts for the door
Martin getting up
Gina stops, turns

Sadness, anger
One kiss and suddenly
Everything that's happened
To Biko
To us
--  know, she's your wife
Like  said, 'm an idiot
() Goodbye, Martin
She turns away again
Martin, frozen, watches her go

Pouring rain
of traffic
No look back
She joins the line waiting for taxis
- Martin still sitting there
The photo of him and Liz in Paris
Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut

People

Eyes frantically searching for Gina
In the distance

She steals a last look back at the terminal

You ready
Gina's face suddenly lighting up
she can see Martin
Spins back to the

There's another passenger

Martin hesitates, turns

Beaming smile
Martin stares at him, bewildered
Jesus, Martin, how are you doing
Rodney
What are you doing here
You called me, remember
You left a message on my machine
Yeah
but how did you know --

: Cole suddenly right up close
Presses a rolled newspaper into Martin's side
Cold steel of a concealed Qun
Stay one step ahead of me
Any move, 'll shatter your spine
His voice flat with menace
Martin's mouth opening
What are --
-- Go
Martin glancing round
Cole jerks him back, guiding him toward the passenger pick-up zone

Bemused
Martin vanished again in the crowd
Then a sudden stab of alarm
'

Heart racing
Struggling to make sense of things
Cole studying him in quiet amazement
Shakes his head
Thinking out loud
My God
she's right
You're completely gone
You really think you are Martin Harris
What the hell Rod
You're my oldest friend
You know who am
It's me
it's not that other guy
He's not -- -- Martin Harris
You're right
He's not
He's the guy who took over for you after you went missing
Exasperated, Cole leans forward
Spelling it out
('
But you're not Martin Harris either
There is no Martin Harris
Martin staring at him
Blank
Confused
Scared

You invented him
He's your legend
fiction you created
You made him up as a cover to get Bressler to invite you to the conference
No
That's insane

How do you think she feels about all this
You two were a good team, then you go and get Norman fucking Rockwell on her

Martin's face
Spinning
Refusing to believe
The Van to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors
The distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling
- Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the van
then her gaze    , four stories up on a parking garage: The white van
She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a -turn
- Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt
Picks himself up, trying to orient
The structure abandoned, broke
No side rails, just pavement to the edge
Trash and graffiti everywhere
Desolate
Cole approaches, losing it now
Boiling with rage: All that studying
planning
Hell, you even had us take out that kid after we ripped off his thesis
year of prep and you try to screw it up
we do everything to bring you back in, but you go on trying to screw it up
Do you know how much time you've wasted
It's Thanksgiving for Christ's sake
should be eating turkey with my kids, not here cleaning up after some wacko who bumps his head and decides his cover story's for real
Martin's eyes
staring back at him
Crumbling
But
who am

Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek

: You
You were my best boy
suddenly Cole  a fist into Martin's stomach
Martin doubles over
Cole  the gun across his
Kicks him Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood
Cole glaring down at him
Disgusted
Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton balls, lighter
Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin
Draws it into the syringe, glancing back: (') Look at you now
Nobody
no- one
Just another dead junkie
Streak of  as the sound of tires screeching reaches them
Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the ramp, accelerating towards them
Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing
- Gina  as bullets pierce the front windscreen
The image of Smith, firing, grows large
--
,   - Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as the two vehicles slide towards the edge
Cole is  across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are crushed between buckling rows of seats as
The van  with the '
front wheels pushed off the garage edge
teeters, see-sawing
Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi
Runs toward Martin, lying on the ground
Pulls Martin away, arm around him
Wait
Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van, locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back
Martin puts a hand out
and takes his briefcase
(') Is it true
() 94
: Caught, the van
Sneers at Martin, starts to speak
Eyes go  as
off the edge, Smith's body going with it
disappears
moment of calm silence and then dull sick crash as the Van hits below
Stares down at the wreck
Mind spinning
Gina comes up, touches his shoulder
Martin
He turns,
She chases after him
- Pouring rain
Vehicles hiss over the bridge
Gina catches up to Martin
Her voice straining above the traffic: (') Martin
Stop
Martin, what's wrong

Rain mists the windows
Mostly empty

Gina takes his hand in hers, presses it to her lips
Holds it
Places it against the skin of her neck and collar bone
Stares at him
He looks up

His breath flows out of him

But of course
Lily and Laurel are the real reason any of us put up with Leo at all
Fahad bends down and the girls run to him, a familiar face
Fahad hoists one up, takes the other by the hand
Hard beat
Looking to Martin  who stares back, cool
Liz nods, accepting the casualties
She takes Bressler's coat, reaches for his computer bag
Let me take these
Bressler hesitates a moment, then lets go
Separation anxiety
Just leave it there, if you could
He gestures to a sideboard in open sight
Of course

As she does so
her fingers slip inside the laptop bag

Invitation
She meets the guard's gaze with cool superiority
Her eyes flick to Fahad across the room
Are you serious
Why don't you ask the Prince

She moves by him, into the room

He looks back, to the picture windows
Empty now

Images go by, almost too fast
What exactly are you hoping to find

Laughter
Martin  still scanning the room
Gives up, turns to meet Liz already there with their computer case and a sportsbag
She hands him the sportsbag, they wordlessly leave through the rear door

Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing
Confused
Alarmed
Hurt
Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand sliding something metallic into his pocket
(') Hello, Martin

One bullet
There's really only one person, one right way to kill Bressler now, isn't there
The crazy man whose been stalking him, the crazy man who pretended to be Martin Harris

Holy shit that was close

In Martin's face: horror, deadly conviction
Time

Shouting
Weapons being drawn
Also seeing the gun
hand going out, a scream building
Bringing the Vun up, pointed at Bressler's head, perfect kill shot
No choice
Finger on the trigger

Falling plaster and debris

Liz walks through, brisk, angry
Dress torn, a cut across her forehead
She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the sportsbag
Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a knife, starts to toss it as well
She
Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the stainless steel surface in front of her
Hello, Martin
to find Martin there
Bleeding, hurt, covered is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands
(') Be careful, that might go off
She turns to face him
Hair slicked, clothes drenched
Stunning despite everything (') Five years as a team
and you end it like this
Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated in her palm
Martin tracks it, steadies the gun
Don't
Keep your hands where can see them
Please
from the hotel structure
Plaster and cables fall, across the floor
Martin , tries to keep steady
Liz is steady, cool
Laughs a little
You know, working with you
it almost wasn't work
We were so good
You, were so good
At the job

She smiles a little, warming
(') Don't you want to know your real name

Don't you want to know y real name
Don't you still want

She leans forward, just a breath
Warmth radiating, Martin stepping back
Please, just stop, Liz
Her face, reading him
His fear, his uncertainty
She smiles, just a little
Liz throws the knife
Martin as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto the floor
His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, in agony as he rips it out, looking up at
soft distance in her face
small hole in her chest, just below her beautiful collar bone
Her eyes find him, focus, smile
You'll never know
You'll never know who you are
long beat
We're not sure when exactly the life goes out of her eyes
Finally, Martin pulls himself forward
Gently closes her eyelids
- Police keeping people back
everywhere, jets of water fighting back the flames

Turns her

Fear, betrayal, love
Him standing there, empty, bleeding

She takes a step towards him, he pulls her tight to him
Holds on
