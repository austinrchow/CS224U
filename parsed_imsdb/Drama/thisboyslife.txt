-                                           1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah sings "Rags to Riches" on the
Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway
The   to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill
Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace
Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car
2
-                          2 Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son
The woman is
Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it
(Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone
) She is bright and energetic and lively
Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor
And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes
Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair
Men turn on the street to stare at her
The boy is
pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid
Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him
Well,   mean it
'm serious --  do
You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that
(totally oblivious) Uh-huh
You wait 'til you ask me for something
Just wait
See if you get it
() 2
2   :                                              2 (as above) Toby, hush
Let me just
So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward
Finally the car crests the hill and starts down
Caroline sighs with relief
She turns to Toby with a smile
What'd you say
said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back
Oh, honey, Jesus
Don't start with that again
Why not
Because 'm the mother, and get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen
Seriously, we've got no money
can't buy you the moccasins
bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em
No talk about Roy, okay
And ditto the moccasins
We, can't, afford, them
Yeah, but you did promise
Sue me
Take me to court
Oh, Toby,  know you're disappointed, but
Jack
Call me Jack
() 3
2   :   (2)                                            2 You're going to drive me to an early grave: 'm never going to make Salt Lake City
Seriously
If a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name
(loud) and  wanna be called Jack
Fine
And you can call me
(she thinks) Jeanette
Jeanette Marie
Oh, you're so stupid sometimes, The  of an  interrupts him
Both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor- trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them
Caroline brakes and steers a hard right,  the safely onto the side of the road
The truck, its   steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its  still
Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car
3
-                                 3 Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders
Caroline glances, then turns away
She pulls Toby away, one arm around his shoulder
4
-                          4 Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of water
(not much heat) Goddamn thing
() 4
4   :                                          4 She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck
She bites her lip
Oh, that poor man
There is a pause
Then Toby speaks: hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen
Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried
Then she sees the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her
She grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove
5
-                                5 Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo" together
Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight
How's this thing work, anyway
(not confident) It makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow
And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium
Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days
But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City
Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh
Honey, this could be a big break for us
If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador -- no money worries
It'll be like heaven on a June day

-                                            6 We hear " " on the car  and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door
Toby stirs, then opens his eyes
Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City
Toby is instantly awake, excited
Caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out
/ Forty-seven miles to go
Both of them are laughing with excitement
Toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells -- 7
-                                     7 Well, hell
The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming
Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car
If  could have one wish right now -- only one wish -- you know what 'd like
'd like to burn this damn Nash Ambassador to a crisp
(as Toby laughs) 'm serious
hate it
hate the factory that produced it, and hate the man who invented it
It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating
(a beat) My God, he was boring
Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends
At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone
Not enjoying the talk about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and speaks directly to the car
'd like to burn you to the ground
(to Toby; big smile) Let's go get rich in Salt Lake City

() -                        8 Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building
He holds a portable , which    singing "Volare

-                                9 Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands across the counter from a  who is looking at her very strangely
You're pulling my leg, right
No,  came here to look for uranium
My God, lady
If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to Moab
We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there
We were too late
So you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium
Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude
Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense
10
-                                  10 Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car
She gets in, and says two words: Don't ask
11
-                                  11 Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening --- noise from the : wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel
7
12
-                12 Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine
That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points
know
Don't tell me what already know
This thing's a bottomless pit
don't know what to do
No matter how much money pour into it
Suddenly a  in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops
She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and sympathetic
'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble
'Course these days  don't have to worry about that
My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever wanna go,  just have to hoof it, you know
Caroline smiles, then her face changes
You don't have    a car
(as the    Woman shakes    her head) You want this    one
Shocked, the Woman says -- uh
You're gonna give our car away
(to the Woman) Seriously
It needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to God,  can't look at it one more minute
Well, sure
() 8
12   :                                              12 Get the bags out
Get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment
We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross
You don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door
Hell, no
(she looks) There's no dent there
Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish-pan
Oh, yes there is
Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her the keys
you really just giving me this car
It's done
It's yours
You got yourself a Nash Ambassador
(to Toby) Let's go
Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in the world -- and off they go, feeling good
13
-  (  )                   13 1957 is all around us: gas is 29
9 cents a gallon; bread is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops
In all, a gentler time
Caroline and Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going
find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, 'll brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up
feel it: the good times are coming
And at least we're rid of that damn Nash Ambassador
() 9
13   :                                                    13 Yeah, and like Dad used to say, 'We may be broke, but we're never poor
' And later, if we get a house with a big yard,  could get a collie, you know
One like Lad or Grey Dawn
And someday maybe a palomino
And 'm going to try harder in school, too
The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an odd way, brave as hell
14
'  -                             14 subdued Toby sits in front of the
like to give new boys the benefit of the doubt, but this is the second time in two weeks that you've been in front of me, and  don't like that
(picks up a telephone) Now  think you better just call your mother and tell her to come down here
She works
She's working
Silent, the man continues to hold out the telephone to Toby
Finally he takes it and dials
15
-                                        15 Caroline and Toby exit
Toby sullen; Caroline angry
It wasn't me broke their stupid windows
Liar
Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe them instead of me
If you care anything about me at all, you'll shut up
() 10
15    :                                              15 Yeah, well if you'd stayed married to Dad none of this would've ever happened
Look, don't you put that    on my back:  can't make your     father call you
can't make     your brother write you
They     dumped you
Yes
But it's not      my fault
16
'  -                      16 The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall
Caroline and Toby enter
She pulls down the Murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying: My head is killing me
Toby heads for his room
16A     -                                        16A Caroline wakes up with a start, then sees Toby sitting in a chair, watching her
What time is it
Seven
Almost
Why didn't you wake me
started dinner
The potatoes are frying, and 'm heating up the hot dogs
Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her
He moves to sit beside her
Hold your mother's hand
() 11
16A   :                                            16A 'm sorry
know you are, honey
Ah, well -- it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so  guess we're okay
The   and she answers it
When she hears the  on the other end she once again  touches her right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the bruise had been
She sags back against a   wall
Yes
(listens) Yes
(listens) Yes,  know
(listens) You're right
(listens) All right, yes
in an hour, then
Caroline hangs up
Who was that
She closes her eyes
Who was that
Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until she's on the floor still laughing
We've got a guest for dinner: it's Roy
He tracked us down
Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa
17
'  -              17 Caroline, Toby and  are eating at the tiny table
Roy is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way
Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him
Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester
22 rifle across his lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy
() 12
17   :                                               17 found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town
And  think  got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station
How you like it at Winstead's
How do you know where  work
been here almost a week
You followed me around
For a week
Watching
Roy doesn't answer
He just wiggles his eyebrows like Groucho Marx
And how did you ever find me
Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx
He turns to Toby
You like the rifle, Toby
'Jack,' mean
It's the best present  ever got
just love it
(to Caroline) 'm going to pretend 'm shooting
Don't point that thing at anybody or  won't teach you to shoot
It's not loaded
You heard me:    anybody or any thing
It's got no bullets, for God's sake
Don't make me speak to you again
() 13
17   :   (2)                                             17 'll point it at the sky, then
Caroline sighs
Toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over
Caroline starts to clear the table
Roy jumps up to help her
18
-                              18 Caroline and Roy are   kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere
Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls away, indicating the   light in the other room
Don't
Toby's still up
Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline
You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard
He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her
She fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light burns
Aw, he won't hear anything
Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss
Then it happens
spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves Caroline away from him
It's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her
Violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it
Caroline is immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic
Shit, baby, 'm sorry
didn't mean that
'm just so glad to see you
He slides toward Caroline, kisses her
This time she accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice
14
19
-                                    19 Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window
He can hear every  of ', who continues to apologize between kisses
The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp
The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam
He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath
The  in the other room grow a bit , almost to an argument, and then again
Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette
He looks very young
20
-                            20 Toby wanders toward the rooming house
He stops to watch fiftyish  who are working in a garden
One Woman looks up
#1 Hi
Hello
The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion
#1 My Lord, look at the eyes on him -- won't he be a heartbreaker in three, four years
#2 Bedroom eyes
Toby smiles
#1 You live in the neighborhood, sweetie
Over there
(a beat) won't be here long, though, 'cause my dad's coming to get me
#1 Oh, yes
Yeah
'm gonna live on his ranch in Phoenix
The "Lazy ," it's called
() 15
20   :                                              20 #2 That sounds like fun
It is
've got a palomino horse and a collie, and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves
He gave me this Winchester
22, and last year  shot a mountain lion with it
And Lad -- that's my dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of them
The two Women exchange a glance
It's obvious the boy is lying
21
'  -  ( )21 Toby enters
Four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind Caroline
What're you doing home so -- (as he sees suitcases) We going someplace
We sure are
Where
don't know
Got any suggestions
Phoenix
Good
was thinking of Phoenix or Seattle -- lots of opportunities in both those places
What about your fabulous boyfriends
What about the fabulous, boring Roy
Is he coming, too
() 16
21   :                                              21 Not if  can help it
looked out the window at work today, and he was parked across the street, watching
Roy's so uncool
So boring
You liked him well enough last night
(imitating Toby) 'Oh, Roy,  just love my rifle so much
It's the bestest present ever
' Oh, shut up
But he's smiling, completely unbothered
Suddenly Caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close the suitcases
Toby laughs, too
Now
We're going now
What about all the food
Leave it
Even the canned stuff
Leave it
They grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door
Both of them are laughing
22
-                                   22 Caroline and Toby stand at a ticket counter, disappointed
Well, ask him when the next one to Phoenix is
Tomorrow morning, eleven forty-five
() 17
22   :                                              22 Toby and Caroline groan, then Caroline brightens
What about Seattle
(consults a list) Leaves in nine minutes
They look at each other
23
23 Toby and Caroline hurry onboard a Greyhound bus with Seattle as its destination
've always had a good head for figures, and if  could get my
license,  believe we could make a real go of it in Seattle
'll advertise for roommates, and  bet we find us a real cute house to rent
If there's a big yard, can  get a collie
Sure
Oh, honey,  feel a wind at my back:  think this is going to work out good
(as they board bus) Yeah -- like heaven on a June day
The  of the bus close
The bus begins to move
Caroline and Toby's faces are at the window: Seattle or bust
: 24
(, ) -             24 The house is a nasty little thing with peeling paint
From inside we hear: () 18
24    :                                          24 (
) and if you cut school again 'll just wear you out -- do you hear me
'm tired of it
(
) Yeah, yeah
Toby exits the house
But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool
few months have passed
He now wears -shirts and jeans which ride way low on his hips
As he walks along, he combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward into a curl at the center of his forehead
He's 1957 hip -- or thinks he is
He strolls on, feeling cool
24A
/   -           24A From one of the houses   emerges, falling into step with Toby
He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact replica of him
Hey, Terry
Hey, Jack
What'd your mom say about skipping school today
Who listens
You go over to Wanda's house last night
(as Toby nods) You make out good
(as Toby nods again) How good
fucked her 'til her nose bled
Sure you did
Oh, Wolff, you're rich
25
-                                 25 opens the door to admit Toby and Terry Taylor
Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor
19
26
-                                   26 As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry Silver's two , who are sprawled sensually on a sofa
#1 Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis, and Elvis
Excuse me, but does your face hurt
'Cause it's killing me
With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room
27
-                                 27 The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a black-and-white
Superman is
When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps to his knees and licks the  screen repeatedly, also moaning
Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual transport
Oh, Lois
Oh, baby, come here -- got six hot inches just waiting for you
Man, look at her
Look at that body-y-y-y
(continues licking screen) Um-m-m-m
--
Oh, Annette, want you
want you so bad
Oh, babybabybabybabybaby
You make my dick hard
The three carry on for a few more seconds
Yum, yum, yum
() 20
27    :                                             27 Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance
Then, slowly, they shut up and lie back down
27A     -                                            27A And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent, all three boys stare fixedly at the screen
They are totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth of the show
Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast; all three are at least two years from their first shave; all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman
28
'  -                       28 Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, , a diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and , a heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies
Both of the women ooh and aah over Caroline's dress
That belt just makes it
It does pick up the green, doesn't it
And you say he's getting serious already
Yes,  think
He keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby
Well, that's it -- three dates and you got 'im good
don't know if  want him -- She stops as Toby enters the kitchen
() 21
28   :                                               28 Don't want who
(about Toby) Little pitchers
Well, it's the tough guy who can't be bothered to go to school
(to Toby) Oh, it's nothing -- we were talking about Dwight
told you about Dwight
He the one drives down from the boondocks
The mechanic
Dwight
What a stupid name
(he draws the name out) Dwiiiight
Duhhhhwight
Dwight-tah-h-h-h
Dwighttahhhhh
There is a     on the front door
Toby sticks his head around the door,    looking into the living room
man is outlined against    the sunset, only his black silhouette is visible
It is     our first glimpse of
Has the man heard him
Toby doesn't know for sure
Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen
He is older than her, an attractive-enough man
He     is well-built, has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth
Those are his good points
On the minus     side: his over- eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes
He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in the pocket
Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy
Then she introduces Dwight to Toby
Dwight is all smiles
Would you like coffee before we go
Or a Coke
You know,  believe  could stand a cup of java
() 22
28   :   (2)                                              28 As Caroline pours the coffee, Dwight turns to Toby
So you're Toby
No
You're not Toby
No
Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack
' It's so silly
ever since he read Jack London
Well, 'll call him anything he wants
(to Toby, confidential) always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don't call me late for supper
Kathy and Marian think it's pretty funny
They laugh
Caroline smiles
Toby just stares
So, Jack, you like school
No
He might like it if he ever went there and tried it

Dwight takes a swallow of the coffee
His eyes widen

Well, well, well, all  can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where -- oh
Marian puts a cigarette into her mouth
Dwight jumps up, pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono- grammed Zippo
He snaps open the top of the lighter against his leg, and holds the flame in front of Marian's face
She lights her cigarette
Then Dwight perform the Zippo drama in reverse
What a conversation stopper
Finally, Kathy speaks to Toby
hear you're invited up to Dwight's next week for Thanksgiving
Aw, you'll love it
Great air, great water
For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes
And there's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day
Your mom said you might like it, so  signed you up
Toby sits up, eager

She grabs her coat (which Dwight jumps up to hold for her) and they exit

Welcome to beautiful Concrete

Sometimes  could kill you as free as  could eat a bite

They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their yearly battle to spawn
Against the rapid current, they leap again and again
Long strips of flesh hang from their bodies
They always show you salmon fighting to get upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get there
Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look
The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight
It's pitiful
Awful
They'll spawn, and then they'll die
They're dying now
As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear: hope to hell it's not an omen
Caroline has to fight back a smile

Dwight's home sweet home
Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask me
Lots of churches, too
neighbor of mine says, "Looking for nice churches, come to Concrete
Looking for sin, go to hell

Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head into the house

The room is dark, on the small side, and shows the lack    of a woman's hand
Caroline looks a bit taken aback,    but tries to hide it by saying the word "nice" over and    over
The   them  room  room: Okay, so that was the living room; over here is the kitchen --  plan on getting all new fixtures in here -- and down that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath
He stops at an extra, no-particular-purpose, nondescript room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table
This is sort of a lounging area
(as nobody says anything) You know, just in case you want to
He searches, can't think of how to finish the sentence in any impressive way
He gives up, finishes weakly: lounge
Skipper snorts with laughter, but cuts it off when Dwight gives him a look
Toby, trying to be good, bites his lip to keep from laughing

-                                     35 The business area is small and rather forlorn

You like it here
They glance at each other
Fine
Yeah, it's fine
It's a little isolated, is all
Not that isolated
Well, maybe not that isolated
Pretty isolated, though
Aw, there's plenty to do in Concrete if you kids would take a little initiative
When  was growing up we didn't have
-- we used our imaginations
We read the classics
We played musical instruments
You show me a bored kid, 'll show you a lazy kid
didn't know you played an instrument, Dwight
What do you play
(one-half second's hesitation) Sax
Tenor sax
Skipper and Norma glance at each other, then look away
Caroline takes a cigarette from her purse
Again Dwight jumps to her service: we are once more treated to the mini-drama of Dwight unsheathing the Zippo from its velvet case, opening the top on his pants leg, etc
(back to Skipper and Norma) How's the school here

It's a few miles downriver
Forty miles
Come off it -- it's not that far
Yeah,  clocked it: thirty-nine miles
In spite of the fact that he's eager for this day to go well, Dwight's bottom teeth begin to show
Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard
Just shut your god- damn pie-hole
They all shut their pie-holes
The six walk in a tense, uncomfortable silence for five full beats
Then Pearl tries to help out: 'm in fifth grade
Nobody seems to care

It's a test of skill

But you said  could

Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm
Dwight, you did tell him

If  made the rules,  might make different ones, but  don't make the rules

The contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye fifty yards away
The scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard
contestant finishes
There is a pause
Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs
The score comes:     84
There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's turn
From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot
He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his   in , hardly pausing to breathe
pause, and then his score is raised: 73
Dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline
There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama, shake that thang
" Caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional-looking
She  her  , taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot
The pause, and her score is raised: 93
There is a moment of surprised silence, and then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of applause

As the next-to-last round finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are complimenting her shooting
Dwight's smile is even bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win
The last round starts
, evidently the one in first place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn
As he passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks confidently
That second-place trophy ain't bad, honey
(big smile) Then you won't feel too bad about carrying it home, will you
Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away
Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot
He is evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he and waits, the score is raised: 95
There is an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a virtually perfect round
Dwight's name is called
He takes his position, but clowns around,  first left-handed, then right- handed, then with both eyes closed
His score is raised: 24
There is scattered laughter, and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his attitude says
Caroline takes her stance
Rock-steady, she  her and waits
And then it comes: 98
She's won
The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a pedestal, and a huge ham
In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close enough to congratulate his mother

Again Toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the hideously close to the cliff's edge
Dwight is oblivious to the danger
Yeah,  hear you're good at doing me
Here
Do me with the lighter

Dwight holds out the velvet-covered Zippo, driving with one hand, and the car is all over the road
Dwight puts the lighter back into his pocket
The car slows a bit

Dwight is calmer now
Skipper, go get that washtub out back, and Pearl, bring the hose around and fill it up
Hotshot and me hit a beaver
We'll salt him down
Skipper and Pearl move out on the run
Dwight slits the beaver from throat to testicles, guts it, then pulls the skin off

Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother, but your fancy days are over: you're a Concrete boy now
'm gonna give you a big injection of Concrete
That's right -- inoculate you
Oh, my, yes
You're gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work
Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver into the water

You'll be in Miss Graham's class

She's okay
She's pretty
hate changing schools
Speaking of changing,  had a talk with Jack on the way up here, and he says he wants to be a better boy
And that's good, 'cause things weren't going well for him in Seattle: the police actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him
Uh-huh, the police

You can spend your evenings hulling 'em
And  enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty -- pays fifty-five bucks a month
What d'you say
Toby glances around the table, he is subdued

better

Okay, you guys get these dishes cleaned up

He cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried, "Give me"

Is it religious
No -- even though it talks about God,  wouldn't say it was religious
It's sad

Very good, Jack

From the front of    the room, a tall,   thin, effeminate boy,  ,    turns to look at   Toby and holds the gaze for three    full beats, then   turns around and faces the front

Kill
Or
Cure
Understand
And 'm up to the job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot, am ready, willing and able to take you on -- you and that jibagoo music you like to sing
'm just the guy to knock that music out of your head and put in some respect and obedience

Why
Just see what he says
Yeah, do it
By this time Arthur is next to them
Smiling a superior smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things he's ever seen
Then his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands
Oh, my, my -- look at all that yellow: Didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee
Oh, shut up
(rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic) Now that's what  like -- an insult with some originality
Did you just make that up
Just now
So clever
Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier
(though he's not nearly close enough to smell Toby's breath) Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot
Both of Toby's friends laugh
Well, at least 'm not a great big sissy
Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: "Here it comes

71   :   (2)                                             71 Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching him on the ear
Arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head
The fight is on
Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are   so many of them
Before Toby can react, Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts Toby   on his knees
While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick him in the stomach
The kick is deadened by the papers in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind: , ' ' Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings
Then Toby gets in a solid punch to Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels
Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo
Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut
Snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again
Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers
They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again
Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment
They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur
By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp
Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud
With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while at him and threatens to nip his leg
Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully
He looks relieved -- at least it's over
No, it's not
From behind him he hears three words
Take it back

Both boys reach the top and stand facing one   another
Take it back
Arthur's words are not angry anymore
Toby's worn out too
Okay
Say it
Okay
take it back
No, say 'You're not a sissy
' Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy
Their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think
You're not a sissy
Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers

How'd it start
called him a sissy
Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg
Well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander
That boy fights for the pink team
Did you make him cry
Well
he was just ready to called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy

Acting more like, 'Oh gee, 'm so scared, please don't hurt me

So  say, 'Excuse me, but what's the problem

You always did have an eye for Dwight, didn't you

Okay
Now you can always  kick somebody in the balls, but  like this one better: What you  do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm

Hit 'em in the throat, but do it before they're expecting it
Now you try
'm afraid 'll hurt you
You won't
But  might
Finally Toby gives a half-hearted "Hah
" and swings the side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat
Dwight catches the arm easily
Come onnn
You're not trying
Again Toby hesitates, again he says "Hah

The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka

He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again

Caroline approaches carrying groceries
She notices Toby's expression
What's wrong
Dwight traded my rifle for a dog
He says the dog's for me, but it's some stupid dog he wanted
For a moment Caroline doesn't respond
Then she nods her head
All right
Okay, Dwight
You stay here
Don't come inside
Toby nods
Caroline heads inside, loaded for bear

Well,  did it -- and the bride didn't even raise her voice: he says he'll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends the papers
Toby nods
Caroline looks up at the evening sky and then shrugs

Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes Toby grin
That's nice --  haven't seen a real smile out of you in a month
Oh, Mom, can't we leave here hate it so much
You don't like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day
Let's just leave and start over someplace else

And besides, it's not so bad here, if you just try to -- If you say 'look for the good stuff,' 'm gonna get Dwight's 30/30 and shoot myself

Well, look on the bright side
You got a dog
In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight, Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old self again, joking with him
He grins and, with the palm of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove
She returns the gesture
And the two of them sit on the steps, staring into the twilight

He catches it
Dwight stands in the doorway

'                                            99 Dwight and Toby are looking for something
They both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc
Dwight says, " know  put 'em up here somewhere
" Then Toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver
Forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy
And, hideously enough, the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver
Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on 'em
" Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts
Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold, too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a breadpan
spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic

While we see this, and   then a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear: (
) Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana Turner, was held for questioning today in the stabbing death of Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's companion
spokesman for Miss Turner said today that the stabbing was an accident, and that Miss Turner's daughter will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman called a 'tragic accident
' Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway, also listening to the
Toby    is not watching the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at Dwight

Alone among all the other players, Toby wears his street shoes
Heavy squarish brogans, they , and  as Toby runs up and down the court
The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished floor, and Toby falls repeatedly
At first the crowd is silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these strange shoes
Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall, and somebody laughs
The crowd in general takes it up, and soon there is   whenever Toby's shoes particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip him up or cause another boy to stumble
Soon one ' -   the gymnasium
The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless, like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation comedy
Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified
Toby slips and slides, falls and rises
All the while his expression is hard as stone: he will get through this or die
And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
" Finally he makes a basket
One from the audience  out "Okay, kid -- way to go
" and then two or three people
Instants later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket
The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and heartily for the boy in the funny shoes
But Toby's expression never changes

Said he'd seen my dog this very morning
Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet
What d'you think about that
don't know what you -- Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed
He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right, again and again
Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face
Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps the boy's face again and again
Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose
He slams his forearm across Dwight's throat
Dwight rears back, choking and gagging
Toby throws off the covers and tries to run
Still choking, Dwight grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face down against the mattress

Toby goes rigid with pain
Dwight stumbles up gasping for breath

As he heads toward the doors
Toby then turns to stare at Dwight's car
They lock eyes, then Dwight smirks and pulls away
Toby watches the car disappear, then spins around and walks into the school

We see that the last two years have marked her
She's changed
Her expression is fixed, almost as if she were wearing a mask
Even the words are cheerful, but some of the old optimism is gone
Oh, honey, good news -- Truman's going to campaign for him

Dwight seems unchanged by the two years

Surprised she sees Toby's expression
What is it
called Gregory at Princeton
(as Caroline reacts) He's sending me applications for prep schools
need you to take me to Seattle to take some entrance exams
Would a prep school take you with, uh, your school record
've got to get out of here, Mom
've got to
've got to get away
When are the tests
Saturday
You'll be there
He won't let you have the Buick

'  -                 126 Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand
Caroline hurriedly prepares dinner
She tosses a milk carton into a brimming waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters the room
Take that trash out for me, honey
Toby grabs the trash and exits
127
'  -           127 Toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the lid back on, and then hesitates
He lifts the lid again and peers into the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips of four white envelopes made of heavy, expensive paper
He pulls them up and, though covered with tomato seeds, are undamaged
128
-                                       128 Toby walks in, fans out the four envelopes, speaks to Caroline
My application forms must've come today, and he threw them away
Hey,  thought  was helping him -- thought 'd save him some trouble 'cause he's got no chance of getting into some fancy prep school
You've always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window, don't you, Dwight
What
You feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside
It turns you mean
It turns you ugly
And one day do you hear me, Dwight
One day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face

We see the words "Official Transcript Required" on one application
On another we see spaces for the ap- plicant to list "Community Services" and "Athletic Achievements" and "Foreign Travel" and "Languages

won't do it
But why
You work right in the office -- nobody'll ever know
'm surprised you'd want help from anybody who fights for the pink team
'm asking you to help me, man
got word yesterday that  did really well on those tests -- but that's not enough
've got to cheat and lie -- but  don't care: this is my one chance to get out of here
No
Why should you get to be the one
Why not me

-                                    131 Toby is working with a table saw
Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down beside him
He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him
Glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes
Toby closes his eyes
He's saved

No, 've grown progressively fond of Concrete
think 'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said
Arthur turns and    swishes away
Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw
Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood
Toby says a mild,   astonished "Hey," and sinks    to his knees

He still holds his hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy)
Caroline appears in the doorway
Come help me stuff envelopes

No,  need to take them with me
'll be in in a minute
Let me finish this article

Yeah --  think maybe you should just

'You got letters from those schools

Pearl stands expectantly
Toby notices her, then walks off holding the letters to his chest

Slowly Toby opens the fourth letter
Another refusal
Toby tosses it onto the ground with the others, leans his head back against the tree trunk, and closes his eyes

Maybe that last school will come through
Yeah, or maybe he'll get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on
(on Caroline's look) Well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other

Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his listening pleasure, and turns  the  on the record
(to Toby) Don't go off without eating
'll get a sandwich after work
Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand down on the arm of the record player, then  it back and forth on the record
It's a violent action, and it makes a

Toby has made a real attempt to look good
His hair is modified, and he wears a tie and a suit
Yeah,  enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but 've been feeling a little restless lately
It's hard to explain
Well, you're probably bored
Not being challenged
Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys who want to go to Hill
Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school
think  would be
My father and brother went to prep schools
Is that right
Where
Deerfield and Choate
Mr
Howard is impressed
see
Well, maybe you'd like it
Hill was difficult for me, though -- classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position
(laughs) And  hated those snowy Pennsylvania winters
But then in my last year, something changed
The guys in my class grew close, so close that  still think of them as a second family

" Psycho and Arch have    entered the drugstore
Toby's back is to the door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't    be seen
Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes
so she said, 'No,  don't want you to do that,' and  said 'Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it
'  mean,  ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then
Arch moves toward the    back of the store toward the area where Toby sits
Toby     inches down a bit farther into the booth
Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby and tries on a couple    of pairs
so anyway, she went off like a Roman candle --  mean that woman can scream
said, 'You liked that, didn't you, baby
'  said, 'You liked the old Arch Cook special, didn't you
' Arch decides to let the sunglasses go
He and Psycho move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy
Toby exhales
Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly sometimes too -- you'd have to be ready for that
can see you've had sort of a sheltered life
Toby nods his head

) Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy
Both Mr
Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing his coveralls, ten feet away
Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he knows everything
Thinks he's so smart, but fella, what you don't know would fill a book
(glances at Mr
Howard's new Chevrolet; offhand) General Motors makes shit cars
Dwight turns and enters the drugstore
(weakly) That's, uh, that's this guy
he's a mechanic
did some bad work on our car
It's not much of an explanation, but Mr
Howard seems to buy it
He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car, drives away
Toby stares after him

Toby (his Elvis hairdo further modified) again prices and stacks food
His face is serious, his manner industrious

'  -                 144 Toby walks in; his Elvis hair disappearing
Pearl, who is boiling hot dogs, turns: know something'll make you feel good: that man called -- you got the scholarship
Toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously
He's won
() 113
144   :                                              144 He said they're gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars
so you gotta come up with the other two hundred
Great, huh
(sympathetic) 'm making hot dogs -- 'll make one for you
Can you put mustard on some bread for us
Toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a new jar and starts to open it
Dwight enters
What're you doing home so earl
Oh
Toby he got that scholarship -- two thousand and three hundred dollars
Dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows, then turns to Toby
Hey, leopard
say, 'Hey, leopard
'  know you, leopard -- can see those spots you can't change
(laughs) Thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody
Not a chance
know a thing or two about a thing or two
Toby won't rise to the bait, and Dwight falls silent, he, looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the trash
Who threw that away
did
Why
Because it was empty

144   :   (2)                                           144 Dwight retrieves the bottle
There are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle
He holds it close to Toby's face
Empty
That look empty to you
It looks empty to me
It looks empty to me, too
Dwight pushes the jar against Toby's eye, leaving mustard stains on the boy's face
Look again, hotshot
Is it empty
Toby jerks his head away, not answering
Dwight slams down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar
Dad
(to Toby) Now
Now, Mr
Big-Time Prep- School fucker, is it empty
Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger: trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby pulls free and jumps up from the table
Dwight is too quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard jar again and again
And again
Each time he asks if the jar is empty
Finally, Toby gives up
(muffled) No, it wasn't empty
(lets him go) All right -- clean it out
His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is murderous
He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus- tard, trying to get up under the neck
He manages to get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which he transfers to the edge of a plate
Dwight watches

Was it empty
Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight
Yes
Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on
As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room
, the kitchen table  over, and their feet  and but Toby is a wild man
Even though he has only one good hand
He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall
Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at Toby
Most of it misses
Again they grapple
Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee
Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby hangs on like grim death
Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he can
Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously
Pearl in horror, Toby in pain
Pearl runs into her bedroom
Toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand
Dwight takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy
Toby's eyelids begin to flutter
He's losing consciousness
From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of him, stunning him momentarily
As he looks up, we   see Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again
(level) Get away from him or  will kill you
Toby manages to stand up, Caroline speaks to both of them
What is this

Great
Go
Give me my paper route money, and you'll never have to see my face again
(manages a smile) That money is gone with the wind
(as Toby stares) That's right
spent it as you made it
It's gone
Poof
Toby starts for Dwight again
Caroline grabs him, saying, "No
No
No," over and over, literally dragging Toby away from Dwight
Caroline looks at Dwight
It's not so much that you're disappointing -- it's that you're consistently disappointing
Oh, fancy, fancy talk -- fancy talk for a whore
know a thing or two about a thing or two got friends in this town that tell me things, and  found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in Washington,

No, you don't

Yes, you could
Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted

Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward the door

When is it ever Dwight's turn for some consideration

Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and she begins to regard him oddly
(weakly) Yeah, heaven on a June day
What'd he say about you having a job in
Oh, Helen found me something in a real estate office, but
So now you can go
Oh
Oh
am so damn glad to get out of this place
'll be in 'fourth form

And if you get a two-bedroom place in ,  can come for vacations and summers

Caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette
(notices she's upset) What
Oh, don't cry -- he's not worth it
As sad as she is, Caroline smiles
She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him
My you've grown, haven't you
Then clutches him to her fiercely
Smiling, the two walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to each other

When Toby speaks, his words are full of love: know that, Mom

We see Caroline's face at a window
As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another direction
His face is shining, incandescent with happiness
He breaks into a wide grin
