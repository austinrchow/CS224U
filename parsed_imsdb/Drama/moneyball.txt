Written by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin : There will always be people who are ahead of the curve, and people who are behind the curve
But knowledge moves the curve
- Bill James 1
-  1 Static shots:  deserted locker room
Empty showers
Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in a coal mine
watch a game on a
: October 15, 2001 We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the faint voice of an announcer - / nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who has just three at bats in the series, and none of them hits - as he settles back in 2
- 2 At the end of a tunnel, the 's empty dugout
The empty diamond
Just a couple of the floodlights are on
/ - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has it, the pitch, Saenz swings and - The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut off
In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that wrap around the playing field
but then see that, in fact, it's 59,999 empty seats
There's a lone figure seated in one of them
The sound snaps back on: / - a ground out to second, Thom, is not what the 's were looking for from Saenz - down by two in the ninth - The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of peanuts
He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the baseball he absently turns in a hand
He switches the radio back on - / Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout to bat for Menechino - 2
2
He turns it off again
Calmly eats a peanut
Waits
Switches the radio back on - / - the 's are down to their last strike and this Yankee crowd is on its feet - Rivera squints for the sign, he has it, delivers and - Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio
Waits just a few moments
Turns the radio back on - / It is bedlam in New York
The Yankees - down two games to none - have come back to win three, and the Division Series
The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on Billy
He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and climbs the steps to leave
But somehow we still faintly hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward an exit, the voice of one of the announcers - / This is an exceptional feat not only for New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though not the kind you can be proud of: Only once before has a team lost a Division Series after winning the first two games - 3
-  3 It's coming from a small television a night security guard is watching
But when he sees Billy approaching, he quickly shuts it off
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on
It's no big deal
No, it's okay,  don't need to watch it
The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently turns in his hands - How's Meg
She's good, thanks
- and the glass window of the bar behind him - 3
3
And the boys
They're good
Everybody's good
That's good
The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen
Night
Night, Billy
It was a great season

-   -   -  4 lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the Coliseum
We - / They had three times your payroll, Billy
Yeah
/ You're not watching them celebrate, right
Car's off
Billy sits in the dark on his phone
No
That would be, uh-- / Pointless
Self-destructive
Masochistic
Are you asking me to pick one
/ What you should be doing is thinking about what an amazing job you did and how great you are
'll be honest, right this minute 'm not thinking about either of those things
4

/ You take a team with that payroll to the playoffs
You take the Yankees to a fifth game
'm not even sure the better team won
They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row
Trust me, the better team won
presses a button on his portable radio and is hit with sound of sports talk radio-- / --while embarrassing the entire city and making a mockery of their fans
'm sick of this
/ Let's go away
That sounds good
'       - Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland 's premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen
/ Someplace they don't have a baseball team
How about Oakland
/ Okay, here are the rules for tonight
You can do anything you want but you can't give any quotes to the press, go on the internet or hurt my car, we have a deal
Yeah
/ They had three times your payroll, Billy
From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "-- Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--"
5

Yeah
/ How about Hawaii
'll make a reservation someplace
The place with the turtles
Billy gets out of the car
Great
'm on my way
Billy chucks the radio away
Gets back in the car, puts it in gear

Billy's got a cell phone to his ear
Is it Boston
You're talking to Boston
What are they offering
( ) What does it matter to you
What
/ mean -- what does it matter since whatever it is you can't afford it
You don't know that
/ don't
You need to hurry
don't know that -- since  don't know what they're offering

She said we had to hurry up

: Another corridor, as Billy and Tara head toward security
Billy on the phone with Boras, continuing where they left off -- What did they offer
/ They offered seven and a quarter
Just to be clear -- they offered seven and a quarter
/ Yes
As opposed to you said seven and a quarter and they're thinking about it
/ No, they offered seven and a quarter and 'm thinking about it
(nothing from Billy) And you're thinking -- what
'm thinking  don't want to lose Damon, but  don't pay my whole infield seven million dollars
We're losing Damon
/ For seven and a half, Billy, you can keep Johnny Damon and we can be done thinking
have to go, my plane is boarding
Wait, don't hang up
Don't hang up -- Billy drops the phone in a plastic container, steps through the metal detector like it's a stick-up, grabs the phone again
1 Is that phone still on
What's the difference
7

1 Faradie
Can his phone be on
2 Sir, you need to turn your phone off
It's already through
Billy grabs his phone from the other side
Seven point five
/ Seven point five
'll talk to Steve
/ Talk to Steve
Boras hangs up
Try to relax
(hitting speed dial on another number) small emergency is starting to develop
Try
Try to relax
You look fantastic today
/ Hello
Arn
Billy
We gotta talk about Giambi
Wait, we're losing Giambi, too
/ can't talk about that now
can't talk about anything now
We can talk now
We're talking now

/ We can't talk now
'm at a family thing
'll call you Monday
Who are you talking to -- the Yankees
/ 'm talking to everybody
But not today
'm not in today
'm hanging up
Don't hang up
( ) He hung up
You found Giambi
Billy dials another number -- thousand dollars says you don't get on the plane
/ Arn Tellem's office
Denise
Billy
( ) These guys are auctioning off my team one player at a time
/ () He's not in today, Billy
know,  just want to send him flowers
/ Flowers
Flowers
Where would  send them
/ To who
To Arn
9

/ You want to send him flowers
() You're not going to be anywhere near Hawaii
To where he is now, yes
/ Beth Israel Temple, Beverly Hills
The airport is as close as you got
( ) Thank you, Tara
/ Denise
'm Tara
know
need a day
-- One day
'll fly out tomorrow
It's gonna be more than one day
() We're losing Isringhausen too
Only if my luck stays exactly the same
It's like the bell rang but you're still getting hit in the head
(hands him tickets) Just in case
'm sorry
Have fun out there

-  -  -  7 The ceremony is in progress as Billy arrives, plucks a yarmulke from a basket, sets it on his head and finds a place in the back row for himself and his carry-on
He listens to the boy's monotone-reading of verses
He fidgets
Taps his foot
Checks his watch
Turns to the person down the row and whispers -- How much longer you think
What
Nah, it's okay
8
-  -  8 As attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent banquet hall, Billy has cornered Arn Tellem, picking up right where he left off three hours ago in Oakland on the -- Arn,  don't wanna lose him
-- don't wanna lose him
This is my nephew's Bar Mitzvah
He did well with his Torah portion thought
Thank you
11
11
What did they offer
He's not staying in Oakland, Billy
What did the Yankees offer him
It's New York; you've got to give a player a reason not to play there
What did they offer
17 million
No way
Yeah
don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars
know,  know
For how long
17 a year for seven years
Billy stares, completely nonplussed
hundred and twenty million dollars
Hundred and nineteen
() You gotta get Steve to let you spend some money
That's pretty good advice,  should do that
12
12
Steve doesn't get it
This isn't a charity raffle
Arn
get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it
'll talk to him
And you're losing Isringhausen, too
Ya think
've gotta get back
Hey mazel tov, Arn
Thank you
Good luck
Arn walks away
Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year old kid standing right next to him
Are you Billy Beane
Yes
That was a pretty serious choke
Are you from around here
Yeah
You a Dodger fan
Yeah
Billy hands the kid his scotch -- Here, drink a lot of this
-- and walks away

-   -  -  9 Billy tries, but is having trouble sitting still as he talks with Steve Schott - the 's owner - around 60 - a college player way back when
He's a successful home builder now
Models of developments lie around
We're losing Damon and Giambi
We can't survive losing Damon and Giambi
Isringhausen's gone, too, don't you think
can win without a closer
can't without power
So negotiate with them
have
They want more
So offer them a little more
have
They want more than a little more
Like what
What'll it cost - say - to keep Giambi
17
17 for how many (years) - One
For one year
Billy nods
Steve smiles
And Billy knows what it means
It means, That makes it easy - there's nothing more to discuss on the matter
have confidence you'll find a way to make it work without them
14
14
can't
Sure you can
- Billy
What are we
The Taj Mahal
We're a small-market team
Obviously, we can't afford Giambi at such a (price) - Fine
He's gone
But  might - for a bit more than last year - be able to keep Damon in (Oakland) - (Steve is shaking his ) need more money, Steve
Billy
can't compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll
We just won 102 games with a forty million dollar payroll
With Giambi and Damon
We wouldn't have without them
Silence
Then - You can't ask me to be okay with losing
That's too much to ask a professional athlete
-- It's too much, Steve
You're not a professional athlete
() You're a professional
() 15
15
(') We're a small market team
You're a small market
And 'm asking you to be okay with not spending money  don't have
And 'm asking you to take a breath and shake off the loss
And then 'm asking you to get back in a room with your people and figure out how you're going to replace these guys with the money  do have
() Got it
can go from milquetoast to ruthless in a blink and he just did
10
'  -  -  -  10 Billy's on his cell again as he crosses the Bay Bridge
Scott
Billy
/ What was that beep
It's just my phone, it's about to die, but this'll be quick - listen - 'm losing my favorite prospects, but  got you the seven point five
/ That's great
'll get right back to () - No
No, you won't
got it for you and we're done
Damon stays in Oakland
/ Billy -  have to talk to Johnny - obviously
It's my fiduciary (duty) - Whose number is that - seven point five
Mine
/ No, it's mine - It's yours
So make your call, but don't play me, Scott
We have a deal
won't be a stalking horse
The word stays in the - dictionary
16

11
'  -  -  -  11 The door pushes open and Billy comes in after his very long day
He sets his carry-on bag down
Takes out his dead cell phone and plugs it into a charger
Calls Tara on the land line
Sorry, hon
'm gonna need another day
(
) Take your time, do your thing
There are a lot of cute guys here
You've got my suitcase
(
) No, the airline sent it to Prague
() Why
(
) Well, we left out of Oakland, honey
and  think the baggage handlers knew it was yours
(beat, can this get any worse
) Okay
Billy's cell phone rings -- gotta take this
(
) Wish you weren't insane
Miss you
She hangs up
Billy hangs up and switches to his cell -- Yeah
(
) Billy
Scott
just got off the phone with Dan
No, you didn't
17
17
(
) Yeah,  was surprised he even called me
Because he had said -- No,  have Johnny for seven-point-five or he's not playing anywhere, because that's the deal -- (
) Boston just upped it to seven-seven-five
Billy's hand is already in motion to smash the phone, but in a herculean feat of self disciple, he manages to restrain himself before impact
(
) You there
We had a deal
(
) We have a deal
If it's eight million
Why am  the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott
Why do  get the feeling 'm always gonna be a quarter million short
(
) 'm just doing my job for my client
That's all 'm doing
No, you played me
And you're playing me now
Congratulations, asshole
You win
Billy hangs up on him
: 12-14  12-14 15
-   -   15 Billy and his scouting department - ten men older than him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting around a large underground cinder block "war room" whose most extravagant appointment is a Mr
Coffee
Two large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with magnetic strips with players' names on them
18
18
On the left board - every player in the 's organization
On the other, even larger board - every player that may be of interest to them from the other organizations
It's the most complex chess board you will ever see
But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in the 's team - the star players they are about to lose - their names set apart from the positions they're vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (), Jason Isringhausen ()
Alright, guys
we had a great year
We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York
Now the bad news
we've got three big holes to fill
() Let's start with who we like for Giambi
We'll go around the room
Who you like, Matty
like Geronimo
(approval from the ) Guy's an athlete
This guy is big, fast and talented
Six foot four
Top of my list
Clean cut, good face
Good jaw
He's the real deal
Five tools, good lookin'
Can he hit
He's a tools guy
Can he hit
He's got a great swing
Natural swing
19
19
So you're saying he can't hit
He can hit
The ball explodes off his bat
It's exciting
When he hits it sounds like he's droppin' a firecracker at his feet
Down in the pisser you can hear that sound
Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron
That's not what  asked
asked can he hit
He's a good hitter
If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good
He needs a little work
He'll be able to hit
He could be a great hitter
Right
we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit
Grady moves on -- Artie, who do we like
Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on -- like Perez
He swings like a man
He swings like a man who swings at too much
20
20
There's some work needs to be done admit it
He needs to be reworked a little
But he's noticeable
He's notable
No, he's noticeable
You notice him
He's got an ugly girlfriend
What's that mean
Ugly girlfriend means no confidence
Alright
That's true
agree with Art
like the way he walks into a room
Kid's so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does
Passes the eye candy test
He's got the looks, he's ready to play the part
He just needs some playing time
'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6
Billy, if you want to talk about another Giambi, this guy could be it
Enough
Billy raises a book above the table, drops it with a dull
Is that a suggestion, Billy
Guys, stop
You're talking like this is business as usual
It's not
We're trying to solve the problem
21
21
Not like this
You're not even looking at the problem
We not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face, but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before
Good
What's the problem
The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace
Uh-uh
What's the problem
The problem is the same as it always is; we've got to put a team together with what we've got
Uh-uh
What's the problem
We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120 rbi's, 47 doubles
Okay, stop
The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game
There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us
And now we've been gutted
We're organ donors to the rich
The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart
And now 'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio
Is there another first baseman like Giambi
() Is there
Everyone mumbles "no
" Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi
22
22
Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em through player development, teach `em how to play Oakland  baseball
This is no time to push the panic button
This is the way we've been doing it for 150 years
Let us do our job
If we try to play like the Yankees in here, we're not going to be able to play with them out there
That's fortune cookie wisdom
No, it's just regular wisdom
Who's Fabio
Okay, Billy
Clearly you have something on your mind
Bill James
You're not serious
We're not playing fantasy baseball, Billy
Those aren't new ideas, they disproved that years ago
Bill James was a night security guard at the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans Factory
He thinks differently than anyone in baseball
He's not in baseball
He's in pork and beans
23
23
Don't attack the man, attack the argument
(to the room) think he just won the argument
Chuckles
What if we've been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win
What if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste good
Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken, you see what 'm saying
don't have the first idea what you're saying
We gotta start over
We gotta rethink this thing
We gotta look where others aren't looking
With all due respect, we've been doing this for a long time
That doesn't mean you're doing it right
Do you watch nature docs
You know what happens to the runt of the litter
He dies
'm open to any solution, as long as it's not what the other guys are doing
() Now, 'm going to Cleveland to poach an outfielder named Brandon Garcia -- Hold on -- You're going to Cleveland for a double- guy
Billy, 've seen Garcia
He's got a bad body
It's not a pretty sight
Kid wears a large pair of underwear
24
24
That is a big boy
He's not just big, but kind of doughy fleshy kind of body
Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth
() He's no Babe Ruth
When he walks, Billy, his thighs stick together
There's enough friction there to start a bonfire
If you saw him, 'm telling you, you wouldn't want to go to Cleveland
Billy, can  make a suggestion
If you could get Ricardo Rincon
he'd be worth the trip to Cleveland
That would solve our left handed reliever problem
Unanimous approval from the scouts -- Really
() Yeah
should get Rincon
() Definitely
Okay
'll also come back with Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb
And who would like a Faberge egg
Guys, you aren't hearing me -- in what universe can we afford Rincon
() 'm asking you guys to look at this game differently than you've ever looked at it before
'm going to Cleveland
() 25
25
(') And when  come back,  want you to tell me something  don't already know want to question everything
We've got to rethink this game
As he exits -- And Grady
Nobody cares about a 102 win season
Billy storms out
What's a Faberge egg
A16
-  -  - 1980 A16 ball sails well over the heads of the  in the outfield who are shagging the batting practice flies
The  in the parking lot have seen Billy play before and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a ball
's at the plate, crushing pitches from a pitching machine
--he sends another one sailing over the heads of the cluster of scouts
, tanned and glistening with sweat, looks over to see   watching him from behind the backstop
They're looking at him like he's Elvis and  tries to nonchalant it but can't help a small smile to himself -- This is the guy
He's got a great path
love the extension in his swing and the backspin he creates
That's some amazing power right there, huh
26
26
Good approach, great balance
How's he compare to the others around the country
He's number one
Let's just hope he's still there when we pick
This guy'll go in the first round
: B16
-  - 1980 B16 The scouts put the players through their paces -- sprinting, fielding
: C16
-  - 1980 C16 and  are talking to , who's toweling off and is still a little aware of all the people who are standing nearby to watch the birth of a star
Billy
'm Sabatini, Area Scout, New York Mets
Can we get a couple minutes of your time, find out more about you
Of course
'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez
Very impressive performance today
In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets,  see the top 200 players in the United States
It's been a while since 've seen a five tools guy, the complete package
Your throwing ability, your fielding skills
Ed told me you had power but  had no idea it was of the light tower variety
hope you're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft
27
27
Well, sir, 'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something  want to do full time
have a scholarship to play football at Stanford
Well, Billy, we're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well
And we believe in college, but that's something you can do in the winter months
You need to know the sky's the limit with your ability
You could be a superstar before you've even graduated
But to get to that level, you need to work with our people
Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you
: 16
-    -  16 Unlike the 's, this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture, which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball photo that hangs in the lobby

Beane
Mark's ready to see you now

'  -  -  18 Billy's counterpart in Cleveland--Indians General Manager --35 and about three weeks into the job--sits behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like Billy
Joining them in the room are  , including So Billy, what are you looking for
50 million in additional payroll
Try Giambi
Ouch
28
28
120 million
should've been a hitter
Where's Steve in all this
Supportive
Excited about rebuilding the team
Bonds is available
Yeah, how do  afford the rest of the field
So what are you looking for
want to help out
guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is -- -- need a lefty reliever and  want Ricardo Rincon
Not going to happen
Not even a discussion
Come on Billy, even if you could afford him we're not about to let him go
Why's that
You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up
We dished him to Detroit
Keep up
Well there goes my other idea
29
29
What else you thinking Billy
You have any outfielders  should be looking at
To replace Damon
Yeah
That's a tough one Billy
Yeah
Who do you got
The guys you might be able to afford
Hollins, Garcia
Coste
Tell me about Garcia
To replace Damon
Is he healthy
He had a back thing, some minor surgery, but he's okay
Petey
He'll be good by Spring Training
He'll do
can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash
Mark Guthrie
As Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices Peter whispering to the guy next to him
Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't object
How much are you thinking
30
30
200
approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away
Sorry about that
So
Garcia is going to be a no
What else are you thinking about
Let's make it work, 'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker
Shapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word 'no'
Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark
Sorry Billy, who else you interested in
19
-  19 Peter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until he notices Billy hovering over him
Hey
Hi
Who are you
My name is Peter Brand
What do you do
'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro
So what do you do
(pointing at co- ) Hey, mind your own business
( ) What do you do
Mostly player evaluation right now
31
31
Why does Mark listen to you
Actually he rarely does
He just did
don't think he was really listening to me in there per se
Really
Yeah,  think he was listening to Bruce
Who are you
Peter Brand
don't give a rat's ass about your name
Nothing from Peter
What happened in there
'm not sure what you're asking me
What did you tell Butch
Huh
Oh Bruce
told him  like Garcia
() Why
() Probably for the same reasons you do
Meaning what
32
32
He's undervalued
You were smart to go after him
( ) What makes him undervalued
Peter is stuck
He can't bring himself to say anything
After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems to say, ` understand, it's okay'
Come on
Billy makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow
Which he does
They exit the offices into 20
-  20 Where you from Peter
Maryland
Where did you go to school
Yale
hate Yale
Why
Kid from Yale once blocked a trade  was trying to make
What'd you study
Economics
What are you doing in baseball
love baseball
'm just curious
Why were you so cagey in there
33
33
work for a different team
know, but 'm the first person in baseball who's ever talked to you this long
Right
Why is Garcia undervalued
Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy to explain
Really
Why's that Peter
We might not see the game the same way
Oh really
What do you mean by that
You've spent your life in baseball and don't have a very traditional view of the game
Hey Pete, just say it
'm not about to beat you up
Say what you've always wanted to say to a
Baseball thinking is medieval
It's stuck in the Dark Ages
have a more scientific view of the game
Keep going, Peter
There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what's really happening
And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams
They're still asking the wrong questions
People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players
Sorry to say that
Peter, don't apologize for what you believe
34
34
The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins
To buy wins, you buy runs
You're trying to replace Johnny Damon
The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year
When look at Johnny Damon,  see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from

/ His batting average is ignorable
What matters is his on base percentage- swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left field for a single
He leads off first-- / - which in 2001 was
324
That's 10 points lower than league average, and 17 points lower than Garcia's
On the next pitch,  takes off for second-- / True, he stole some bases
But attempted steals in general have to succeed 70% of the time before they even start to contribute to run totals
In 2001 he cost you runs
's tagged out at second
He's got a good glove
He's a decent leadoff hitter
He steals bases
But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him
You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities
You read Bill James, Pete
Yes
These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new
In fact, some of them have been around for two decades
35
35
If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them
That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games
Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel
The elevator door closes

-  21 Billy's in coach, staring at the night through the window, lost in thought
22
-   -  - 1980 22 Billy's mother and father escort Martinez and Mets Head Scout Roger Jongewaard into the kitchen
Billy
They're here
Billy
Good to see you again
Obviously you're a very special player
We'd like to compliment you on your high school career, and we're looking forward to you being a part of the Mets family
Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to Billy's parents than Billy himself -- There's good -- and there's premium
Your son is premium
He has it all -- power, speed, the arm
The Look -- and 'm never wrong about that
Which is why this is a premium number
He sets a contract on the table
Clipped to its top- sheet is a check
On its left-hand corner is the Mets insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000
They all see it
lot of money in 1980
Silence
Then -- Billy's been offered a scholarship to Stanford

36
know
And that's a great accomplishment
'm sure you're very proud of him
So he can accept that, go there, and then - Jongewaard is already shaking his head no
understand how important college is do
But what  can't do is burn a second first-round draft pick on someone who can't play for four years -- no matter how good he is
Four years is ample time for someone to get hurt
It happens all the time
So, no
'm sorry
It has to be one or the other
To postpone four years is four years he could be in big leagues
The sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits
Stanford or The Money
Young Billy regards the check, and then his parents
He really doesn't know what to do
We're going to give him a different kind of education
This won't be his life's career, it'll be his first career
He's going to be a young guy in the business world when his baseball career is done
He'll still have his whole life ahead of him
It's your decision, Billy
Whatever you decide is fine with us

After  left you ran me through your computer, right

This is the American League West
This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season
Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow
39
39
Let's make sure we're on the same page
Okay
We're going to re-think baseball
Yes
Look for an inefficiencies in statistics
Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented
Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs
Unspectacular runs are more valuable
Why
/ () Because they cost less
We believe there's a river that hasn't been fished
We know it for sure
And because players have been overlooked because they don't rise to the standards of traditional baseball thinking, we believe that in this river, there are fish
fish who-- ( lost it) Help me with-- Forget the fish

In this room is a championship team that we can afford
Yes
But let me ask you this
If our theory is right-- Math isn't a theory
If it's right-- It's right
It sounds right
It is right
If math isn't a theory-- It isn't
'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you don't let me finish a sentence

In fact, why isn't anybody doing it

Why isn't anybody else doing it
Because they don't think guys who look like you are what win baseball games
They know it for sure
() Alright, let's find our team
: 27
-  27 Peter schleps his computer stuff
Sets up, plugs in, fires up
Turns an unused room into a war room with dry erase boards and computers
He installs software in the video room computer, works on a computer in his room, prints two pages of data and reviews
: 28
'  -  28 Peter enters and hands the two pages to Billy
Billy reviews, stands, then slowly paces as he reads
Peter stands and watches
: 29
-  29 From somewhere in the outfield, we have a wide view of the darkened stadium and Billy's office, which, unlike the others, is illuminated
We can just discern Billy's silhouette as he continues to slowly pace and study
: 42
42
30
-  30 Billy and Peter walk down a long, subterranean corridor
Peter carries a laptop and a slim notebook
Nervous
No
Huh
Interesting
Peter doesn't know what to make of that
31
-  31 As they near the scouting room, Billy sees waiting for him outside it
Hey, Art
Can  talk to you a second before you get started
got a lot to do
know
Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would be to insult him
He gestures for Peter to go into the scouting room alone
He'd rather not, but does
The scouts, assuming perhaps he's there to make coffee, ignore him
He finds a place to sit in a corner
Who's the kid
That's Peter
can't manage this team under a one-year contract
Sure you can
43
43
No  can't
've got to put a team on the field, then 'll deal with your contract
How about you deal with the manager's contract and then put a team on the field
At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to first base, nobody's going to be there to stop it from rolling
have to tell you it's not easy doing what  do under the cloud of a one-year contract
know
been there
know you have
And a 1-year contract says the same thing to a manager as it does to a player: There's not a lot of faith there
Which is strange after a 102-win season
If you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others
It's on me now
It's on me, Art
() And the kid's the new assistant general manager
() What the fuck are you about to do
doesn't answer the question, just walks into the- 44
44
32
-  32 -and ignoring Peter - who has tried to inconspicuously plant himself in a corner - pulls up a chair to receive his scouts' report - which Grady, as always, will lead
Art wanders off
How did it go in Cleveland
It was cold
The news bothers no one
Let's get after our relief pitching problem
We got Chad Bradford
Right-hander
Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes
Submariner
That's the one
Technically an underhander
What's his velocity
Unimpressive
About 85
Does he have a good breaking ball
Doesn't have one
Why do you like this guy
Well, he gets people out
45
45
The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him
He's down there
He's down there real low, too
Let's move on
The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing
- Well, we,  think, have fared better
We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi
Knock me down
We trade power for speed
rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever big heart in the last year his contract
Tend to play hard
We usually get a pretty good year out of them
Make up for some of the offense we lost
(puts more names up) Or the other option
Just a thought
We go for a high-maintenance guy
guy that's a little difficult but talented
guy like Milton Bradley
Well, not like Milton
Milton himself
Which do you want to talk about first
None of them
Grady looks like a man who can't take much more
You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way
We got some trades here
We can't do it
What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate
46
46
The (what) - Giambi's on-base percentage was
477
Damon's was
324
And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was
291
Add that up and you get - He points to Peter
You want me to speak
When  point at you, yes
Ten-ninety-two
Divided by three - Three-sixty-four
That's what we're looking for
And that's what we'll find
Three players whose average  is - Three-sixty-four
That doesn't come out right
You gotta carry the one
Still don't look right
It's right
The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room
Billy
Yes
47
47
Who's that
That's Peter
And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter
don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here
Yes
What's with this on base percentage obsession
Is that Bill James bullshit
You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all  care
Billy takes a Marks--Lot, jots down three names on strips, and approaches the board
So here's who we want
One
He puts the first strip up
It reads:
Jason's little brother Jeremy
He never comes home from the games
Billy, if  may, he's had his problems on the field -- not to mention his problems off the field -- not to mention he's getting a little thick around the middle -- there's the stuff with the weed
He's at strip joints
This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake
His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year
48
48
He can't catch a ball in the outfield
've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight
Billy puts up another name:
David Justice
Ten years ago he was a big name
He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year
But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight
He's 36
His legs are gone
He's a defensive liability
question whether the bat speed is still there
Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him
That's good
He's a fossil
With all due respect, bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire
And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract
Billy points at  -- He gets on base
got 37 free agents who are better than those guys
Scott Hatteberg
49
49
Who
Exactly
Sounds like an Oakland already
Yes, he's got a little damage in his elbow
Some damage
He can't throw
We're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his
Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at first
Yes
He's a career
260 hitter and the good part of his career is over
say it's just starting
Well, Billy, you'll like the sound of this
hear Boston wants to cut him and no one wants to pick him up
That's good news for us
He's cheap
Let me understand this
At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage
He can't hit and he can't field, but what can he do
() Look at the piece of paper or 'm going to point at Peter
The  consult their spreadsheets and then answer --- 50
50
(-) He can get-- He can get on base
Alright, so he walks a lot
He gets on base a lot, Rocco
Do  care if it's a walk or a hit
You do not
These three players, by your own admission, are defective in one way or another
Yeah
You want to replace Jason Giambi with not one but three defective players
You got it
Billy, we've all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball-- (cutting him off) Grady, it's not a discussion
think we're all losing sight of the fact that you're the general manager
You only have to answer to ownership and God
didn't know God followed baseball
hope he does
51
51
Some of the scouts look over in Peter's direction, no doubt wondering if he's had something to do with their general manager's ideas
Billy,  just don't see it
That's okay, Wash
We won't be victimized by what we see anymore
understand what you're saying about their averages, but there's something you're forgetting
None of them plays first base
haven't forgotten that, Wash
One of them is going to have to learn
Learn
You're going to have to teach him
Teach

Your boy and  had a talk while you were in Tacoma
didn't like much of what heard
No
No
You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one
don't listen to anyone, you know that
This isn't a joke
'm not joking
64
64
This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer
You know that
You're a baseball man
There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer
That's what we're doing
That's exactly what we're doing
If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body
a computer wouldn't do that
They would have had him sitting up in the stands
computer doesn't romanticize the sport
Leave that for the fans
Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years
don't want to hurt you love affair with the game
Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right
You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth

And now we're gonna see if 'm-- --we're gonna see if you're right

They thought you were a ballplayer and you weren't
As you know, it happens
Don't take it out on-- 'm not--taking it out on-- 'm trying to help, okay, 'm saying-- No, you're not saying anything to me right now
() Grady, you don't have special powers
You don't have the ability to look at a guy and "just know" because you're a scout with special powers

stands there a moment
On his way out, passing Art's windowed office, he exchanges a look with the manager
Billy takes a short walk to where a few of his scouts are standing around an arcade console
To the youngest one - Eric
You never even played high school ball, right
The young scout shakes his head, embarrassed
Grady's gone
You're the new Head Scout
Billy turns away and is headed back to the video room
Pokes his head in
Don't try to explain things to scouts
They're not programmed to get it
It's just us
He leaves
Peter watches the door close, then glances back to the tape as Youkilis takes ball four and waddles down to first base

Scott Hatteberg, lacing up, watches him

Infielders field grounders hit by Art Howe from a fungo
Billy paces in the foul territory off the first base line
:   missing a fly ball, looking tired,  missing the scoop
Art hits another grounder which Hatteberg botches again
Art looks at Billy a good long beat, then hits to another infielder
Peter walks up to Billy, just as - poke off the bat sends Jeremy Giambi scrambling back like a postman trying to escape a mad dog
The ball lands behind him
Well, we didn't pay him for his defense
Art and Washington hit grounders to Carlos Pena and Scott Hatteberg
Hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it
That's the way, Hatte

He's still got it
Then Justice stops, winded

-  -  50 As the players shower and change into street clothes, Art, Billy and Washington discuss Hatteberg, who knows they're discussing him
It's the first day of week one
There's nothing to judge yet
can judge it and so can you
First base is the moon to him
It wasn't to Giambi
He's the worst first baseman in baseball
What do you think of him, Wash
The nicest way  can put it is, he lacks confidence
Work with him Wash
'll do that, Billy, but we've got Pena who can play first
And he's looking pretty good out there
want to make it work with Hatte, Wash

As Washington crosses the locker room to lie to Scott about how much progress he's making, he passes Magnante taking off his knee braces, and Chad Bradford sitting at his locker with a Bible in his lap
Not to mention we already have a first baseman
rookie first baseman
It's not the same
Number 11 on the Top 100 Prospects list
Lists aren't baseball
Catchers at first base aren't baseball
Who's idea was this
Peter's
Hatteberg will be fine, Art
He will be fine, you're right
Pinch hitting while Pena plays first base

What are you trying to say
It doesn't matter what moves  make if you don't play the team the way  need them played

Why wasn't Hatteberg at first
Because he can't play first

This is about your contract

Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead
You've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team, 'm sure you can understand that
You're cutting me

just bought a house here

Well
That's all you have to say
My kids just started at a new school, they made friends
That's--'d leave them in school, you don't want to take them out in the middle -- What the hell are you doing

You're talking about kids and schools and you should've been out of the room three minutes ago
Shouldn't  tell them that they'll always be a part of the 's family

These are professional baseball players
You just do it
"Peter,  need to let you go

You remember Peter
Peter
Guys, give me some idea of what's going on out there
88
88
Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and we're gonna need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form
It's phase one, we're evolving and we feel confident where we're heading
- We're not scared
3 out of 17 games
3
We're getting crucified in the press
What makes you think this is gonna turn around
Because  believe in what we're doing believe the numbers
believe the record doesn't accurately reflect the team and where we're going to be at the end of the season
Peter and  feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan, and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs
Billy, look, you've got guys who are nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired as an usher in a ballpark now playing on the team
Give me something  can go back to these guys with and feel like  have the confidence that you're gonna turn these things around
With all due respect you asked me to build a team with shoelaces and gum wrappers and we've done it
You haven't done it yet billy
And it will pay off
Stick with us
Suffer the blows
Listen, life with no money means we're gonna have to suffer a few embarrassments along the way, but we are okay in the end
Billy, there's a lot of money at stake here

Our goal and our expectation by the All Star break is to be within seven games of first place

And that would be this working exceptionally well
7 within 500
By July
And what's going to keep us from getting there
Nothing Steve
Nothing
We're 3 for 17 right now
You've got to be able to give me a little bit more to go back to my partners with
Listen, you hired me to do this job and that's where we're going to be

Well, let's go buy Barry Bonds, then
This is the team we've got and this is the team we'll win with

Billy, put yourself in my shoes
What do you imagine is going to happen if things don't turn around
It's very clear, Steve
If  put myself in your shoes, 'd spend another 20 million on the team
We don't have another 20 million 'm just kidding, Steve, 'm just kidding
We've got the team

You want Pena on the bench
That's right
So that you can play Hatteberg
Hatte - as opposed to the guy who's going to win Rookie of the Year
No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who gets on base less
Pena getting voted Rookie of the Year and the 's making the playoffs are two entirely different-- Pena's not just the best first baseman on the roster, he's the only first baseman on the roster and the most valuable member on this team
Not according to, what do you call `em, facts
-- Listen to me--gets on base more than Pena
25% more
-- His fielding doesn't matter
It does matter and Pena only has one error in 70 games
Not only is that number statistically insignificant but it's also subjective
It measures what someone did against what someone else thought they were supposed to do

Billy picks up the call
( ) Sometimes you have to shake it up
( ) David, Pena's going on the blocks, you're my first call
because he's making the rest of the team look bad
He's going to be rookie of the year
(not eager to help but
) Probably an all star
He's an all star Dave
(winks at Peter, ) It's more like he's creating self-esteem problems for the other guys
No, 'm looking for a reliever and some cash
Ok
five minutes Dave, 'm not waiting
( ) What's the problem
(trying to slow it ) Billy, Pena is an all star
If you dump him, and if Hatte doesn't work out, you know, this is the kind of decision that gets you fired
Why you worrying about my job
() You worried about my job or yours
() 'm worried about yours
Well you should be worrying about yours because if this thing we're doing don't work
neither of us have jobs
That's probably true
100
100
In which case 'm a 44 year old guy with a high-school diploma and a daughter who 'd like to be able to put through college one day
(lets it sink in) You're 25 years old with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship
() don't think we're asking the right question
think the question we're supposed to be asking now is, do you believe in what we're doing or not
() It's a problem that you think we need to explain ourselves
Don't
to anyone
'm going to see this through, for better or for worse
Just tell me, do you project we'll win more games with Pena or Hatteberg on first
It's close Billy but theoretically Hatteberg
What are we talking about then
The phone rings
Dave
() That works
Great
There's just one more thing  need
don't want the guys paying for soda-- want you to stock my soda machine for three years
Uh huh, uh huh, great
then that's a deal
Billy hangs up
He stares at Peter
That was thoughtful
Yeah
Okay
You gotta tell Pena to pack
You want me to tell Pena he's been traded
Be a man
101
101
What about Jeremy
Am  telling him, too
No
'll do that
B99
B99 Peter walks into the locker room
Sees Pena talking to a couple of other players
He approaches Pena
Hey, Carlos
Yeah
Can  get a moment with you
Sure
Okay, maybe we can talk over here
They walk awkwardly to the players' lounge
Have a seat
They sit
So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers
This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary
He's expecting your call
He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit
Pena sits and stares at him
It's excruciating for Peter, awkward, until -- Is that all
Yeah
Cool
Pena just takes it
Picks up the number and leaves
102
102
99
'  -  -  99 Billy knocks and lets himself in
Mind if  have a seat
Please
You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg
don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the line-up card is mine and that's all
The line-up card is definitely yours, 'm just saying you can't start Pena at first
am starting Pena at first
don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now
() You traded Pena
Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi
You are outside your fucking mind
Art stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi knocking on the open door
Jeremy, come on in
Billy jots a phone number on an 's Post-It and hands it to him
This is Ed Wade's number
You know him
Art looks sick
103
103
No
Phillies General Manager
Real nice guy
Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you
The what
The flight
To Philadelphia
Billy gets up and shakes his hand
It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy mean that
You're a great ballplayer and great guy
Jeremy, not sure he heard right, looks at the Post-It in his hand as Billy escorts him to the door
We're going to miss you
Jeremy leaves
Billy looks at Art from the door
Adkins is gone, too
You're killing this team
Art
can do this all day long
He leaves
Art notices Peter, who had been lurking by the door, eavesdropping
What are you looking at
'm not looking at anything
You went along with this
You agree with this bullshit
() hundred percent
104

A100
-  A100 Pena cleans out his locker
Several players stop by to say goodbye
Tejada -- Keep your head up, okay
It's part of the business
You're gonna be a great player, okay
Thank you, man
Don't let this bother you at all
Chad Bradford -- Nice to meet you, brother
Take care and
God bless you, man
Thank you
Scott Hatteberg -- You're the best first baseman here
It's not right, Carlos
Thank you, Hattie
Yeah
100
-  100 and  stride through as the team is getting dressed for batting practice
The place quiets down as  comes in
They've all heard the news and they've never experienced a move like this in their careers
( ) Scottie
Yes sir
Go out and field some grounders
105
105
looks around at the , who are looking at Billy
Everybody, listen up
You may not look like a winning ball team
In fact, you look nothing like a winning ball team
But you are one
So play like one tonight
You'll get further instructions tomorrow
: 101
-  () 101 hits a single up the middle as the runners on 2nd and 3rd round the bases to score
102
-   102 's blackberry buzzes
"Sngl up the mdl--2 rns scr" Okay
A103
-  A103 Billy talks to Chavez and Ellis
Peter stands nearby
No more bunts
No more bunts
bunt is an out
You're paid to avoid outs, not make them
bunt isn't an out
It's a sacrifice
bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters
You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what are you saying
() Until the third out, anything can happen
After the third out, it's over
You gotta protect your outs like they're your children
Every out's precious, don't give `em away
() () 106
106
(') Another thing -- you should see more pitches
We wanna get into their bullpen
Deep into their bullpen
We want to see 100 pitches by the end of the 5th inning
You wanna get your at-bats off their 10th and 11th pitcher
You want us to walk more
How much more
Pete
At least once every ten at bats
Or
Triple- Sacramento's only 80 miles away
And there's no flights
(as they look to ) Don't look at him
Here's the deal
'm not interested in what you think you know about baseball, or what you think  don't know about it
'm not interested in guts or heart or determination or anything else the fans or your mothers love about you
'm interested in you getting on base
If you do that, we win
If you don't, we lose
And  hate to lose
hate to lose more than  need to win
There's a difference
B103
-  B103 Billy and Peter give advice to Dye and Byrnes
Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack
Every card that's dealt, your odds completely change
For instance, every first pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points
75 points
75 points
Every first pitch ball, it goes up about the same amount
So you gotta lay off the first pitch
107
107
First pitch curveball or first pitch fastball
First pitch period
When you swing at the first pitch you're batting
140
We want to see more pitches
How many pitches
Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches by the 5th inning
So
5, 6 pitches per at bat
Yeah
mean, Hatteberg drained 38 pitches
And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at everything
You're all squirrely out there
Wait for your pitch, man
This is a war of attrition
There's no clock on this thing
Wait `em out
Let them make the mistakes
And when your enemy's making mistakes -- don't interrupt them
C103
-  C103 Peter advises Durham as he works out
Basically, these are all your at bats
This is you versus righties, you versus lefties
and then, of course, all your count knowledge, okay
In an 0-0 count you're batting
290
In an 0-1 you average
238
In a 0-2,
159
When you're 1-0, you're batting
324
Understand what 'm saying
Not really
know, it's a lot of math
When your first pitch is a strike, your batting average goes down about 70 points
() 108
108
(') When it's a ball, it goes up about 30
If you draw a ball on your first pitch, you're unstoppable
If you strike on the first pitch, you might as well be jumping off cliff
'm trying to get you to lay off the first pitch
But 'm a first pitch hitter
like to swing at fastballs
And that's the way you've been trained
But it's a habit we'd like to break you from
We're trying to design the game to your strengths
This has nothing to do with you being a great hitter -- you're a great hitter
We just want to get you on base
But if  get my pitch, 'm gonna swing at it, no matter what the count is
'm not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park
just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike
guess 'll have to watch some film and take a look at it
Absolutely
The video room is open to you any time, 'm always available
103
'   -  103 and  with a group of players around the card table, post-game
-- But seriously
Make him use up all his bullets
Yeah, make him work
So
Mr
Beane
Billy's fine
109
109
-- Nah, make it Mr
Beane
Mr
Beane -- 'm screwin' with you, Haddie
So we just don't steal
That's right
That's what  do
That's what you pay me to do
No,  pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second
don't get thrown out much
don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if  did, the odds would be the same
You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season
get 11 of 17
That's not bad
You just handed them an out
Protect your outs like they're your children
There's no clock on this game
Until the third out, anything can happen
Get on base and let the next guy move you up
Pass the torch, pass the torch
We're like a machine
run making machine
A104
-  -  A104 As  and  prepare food -- What's your biggest fear
110
110
baseball being hit in my general direction
That's funny
() No, seriously
Seriously
104
-  104 Hey, Dave
've been thinking
want you to -- You gonna teach me something
Excuse me
've never seen a  talk to players
You've never seen a  who was a player
Huh
Is there a problem
It's okay, man
know your routine
It's a patter, it's rap, it's for effect
That's okay
But it's for them, it's not for me
You're special
You're paying me 7 million bucks so guess  am a little
As a matter of fact 'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David
The Yankees are paying half your salary
That's what the New York Yankees think of you
() 111
111
(') They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them
If this is news to Justice, he doesn't show it
Where are you going with this, Billy
You're almost 37, Dave
Almost as old as me
Let's be honest with each other about what we each want
want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show
So let's do that
'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, 'm paying you to be the player you are now
You're smart, you know what's going on here need you to set an example for the younger guys
Take a leadership role
Justice just studies him
then nods
We're cool
We're cool
All right
Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him -- You know -- the Yankees are coming to town
If it were me -- 'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass
But 'm a competitor
Billy exits
Justice calls after him -- You know,  got a couple World Series rings
think 'm a pretty good competitor, too
( ) You want another one
: 112
112
105
-  105 takes ball four from a Yanks pitcher, tosses his bat to the side and trots down to first base
: 106
-  106 is on first and taking a big lead toward second
He wants to steal it bad
() Tejada taking a big lead off first, eyeing the steal-- 107
'  -  107 watches with two or three
Don't do it, Migs
108
-  108 And --a base hit sends Tejada to 3rd
109
'  -  109 's blackberry buzzes: Sngl to lft
Frst and thrd--nobody out
Thank you
110
-   110 The wheels of the team jet lift off-- 111
'  -  111 The  is on as  and  work, seeming more and more like mad scientists who are getting closer and closer to splitting the atom
() What is happening in Oakland
The 's have won seven in a row and 15 of their last 19
You got to hand it to Art Howe
He's managing this unorthodox team in an unorthodox way
They are not bunting
They are not stealing
They are just winning
And Art Howe is the reason
113
113
Did you hear that
heard 7 in a row
Billy clicks off the  and it's very quiet
Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the 's relief pitching
Can you show me righty-lefty matchups for the division and overall versus Mariners
Peter reaches over and with a few clicks produces new columns of numbers, upon which Billy darts his eyes as he scrolls through them
Finally - Okay
He gets up and heads out
A112
-  A112 walks through the clubhouse, shouting locker room shoutouts to  as he walks by
Voos
Billy
(pointing back down ) That smell is getting worse
'm on it, Billy
( ) What are we doing tonight
Splitting the plate in half
Both sides
(to Hudson, playing ) Huddy, you gotta mix it up tonight
Trust your slider
114
114
Yes sir
(to the others) You guys stop distracting him
( ) Chavvie -- you couldn't hit that shit with a boat paddle last night
You gotta see more pitches
Patience
You got it, Billy
As Billy crosses through the weight room -- ( ) Hey David -- Hey, man
Great at bats
Really
Quality
Thank you
112
'  -  112 knocks on Art's door -- something we haven't seen him do before
can see  through the window blinds and is a little surprised at the courtesy of a knock
Come in
does
He's going to try to do this nicely
How are ya
Good
You knocked
did, and  hope you take it as a show of respect
We'll see
115
115
You look good
We've won 7 in a row, what am  doing wrong now
Absolutely nothing
Good
But
Yeah
Magnante's having some head problems
Head problems
Yeah
Okay
He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in two weeks
Everytime he winds up he's thinking he's about to throw the last pitch of his life
So he grips it a little hard
appreciate this
Sure
But  know my bullpen
Yes you do
Yes you absolutely do
No question about it
Except not really
Yeah
116
116
If we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base, 'd rather not see Magnante out of the bullpen
'll make that decision when the time comes
That's what you should do
Baseball's a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes
Except you should make it now
-- Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta hold a late lead with runners on
He's 37, he's scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak
You think a lot of yourself, don't you
think the regular amount of myself
Magnante on the other hand, he doesn't think very much of himself at all, and when he tightens up we've got ourselves an adventure
So 'd like to see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight when we're in, let's say, just to make it easier for you, any situation
Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the umpires have decided we're going to finish the game by playing darts, whatever
Bradford's the first guy out of the pen
() Okay
regards  for a moment
could've coached you up, you know
don't think so
You think you went as far as you could have
117
117
() Yeah, that's what  meant
Play Bradford
steps out of Art's office into-- 113
-  -  113 The game plays on  as  bench presses
The 's are up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have a runner on first
Through the tunnel,  can hear the crack of the bat and a collective groan from the stands
holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply looks at the
and sees the silent images
114
-  () 114 walking to the mound, tapping his left hand
heading to the mound
115
-  115 We think 's going to trash the weights, but he simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and watches the silent images
116
-  () 116 mops his brow, squints for the sign, winds up and makes his pitch
It misses low for ball four and walks to first
117
-  117 Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the and we hear - ( ) Magnante has quickly let two on base for Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for the Indians in a game that Oakland appeared to have put away
And then -  sits calmly
waits for it
and-- -- nods his head at the inevitable
118
118
( ) That ball is deep
way back
three run homer for Lee Stevens to put Cleveland ahead in the ninth inning
can hear 40,000 people booing their lungs out
He takes a moment, then grabs his jacket
118
-  118 The  are booing as  makes his way to the mound to take  out
makes his way from the bullpen and takes the ball from
turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees a strange sight:  is standing at the dugout rail
The plate  notices and follows Art's line of sight
He sees  and walks over there ahead of Art
You can't be in there, Billy
doesn't move
He just watches  as he comes into the dugout
Billy
The  are watching to see what's going to happen
puts his hand on 's shoulder a second as he says- Just nod a little bit--not too much--like 'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision
Players and coaches only, Billy
(ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to ) Remember that in about four seconds-- sees one of the nearby  cameras pivot over to catch this conversation-- --yeah there it is
We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief
First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say
119
119
-- Second of all, genius, those boos
They're for you
Drink up
Come on, Billy
Get me this game back
As  passes  he pats his back before we-- : 119
'  -  119 The radio is on and the  is telling us-- ( ) after giving up the lead on a three run homer off Magnante, the 's came right back to win it in the bottom of the ninth with another three run homer by Miguel Tejada
And the 's have won eight in a row
AA120  AA120 A120

-  -   -  D120 Billy, standing at the door, surveys the room, his eyes moving from player to player as they're hanging up their street clothes
The team's equipment manager, pouring himself a cup of coffee, glances over - You want one, Billy
'm good, Voos
Thanks
120

Voos wanders off
Billy keeps looking at the players
: July 31 - E120
-   -  E120 Billy comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and, like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving, doesn't through the entire scene -- Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone
Are you thinking Rincon
Yeah, he's lost faith for the season think he's gonna dump him
Hardcore
They wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' , staring at the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the middle of the conference table
Shapiro on two
Mark
Billy
Let's be honest premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs
/ Are you referring to Rincon
He's a luxury you can't afford
/ And you can
There's half a million on his contract and at least one other suitor
By at least one, you mean one
Who is it
/ 'd rather not say
121
121
() San Francisco
'll call you back
He hangs up
Stares down Peter
What do you think we can get for Magnante
Nothing
(continues to stare ) What's left on Venafro's contract
Two-seventy-five
Suzanne -- get me Sabean
() If we can get San Francisco interested in Venafro, Shapiro's only got one buyer for Rincon
Us
Pete gets busy on his computer
On three
Sabes
Billy
You like Venafro
can let you have him for almost nothing
/ (smelling a rat) Why would you do that, Billy
Because 'm amazing
/ Uh-huh
All  want is a couple of bucks and a sweetener
Throw in, say
122
122
Billy snaps his fingers at Peter -- Anderson
Anderson
/ like Anderson
No, you don't
don't even like him don't know why 'm doing this -- but let's do it anyway
Venafro for Michaelson
Anderson
Anderson
See,  don't even know his name
/ 'll think (about) -- Think about it and call me back
He hangs up
Get Shapiro back on
Billy and Pete stare at each other in silence
Two
-- / You can't afford him, Billy
You sure about that
get the impression the market for Rincon is softening
could be wrong
Call whoever's interested and make sure they're still interested
And call me back
He hangs up
123
123
What about the Mets for Venafro
You just offered him to the Giants
Suzanne -- Steve Phillips
Get me Steve Phillips
Pete works his computer
Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow, they're never gonna do it
Totally agree
We just need them to cool on Rincon
Phillips on two
Steve-
Billy
hear you're looking for a left-handed reliever
What do you think of Venafro
can make it quick and easy for you
/ What's the angle
No angle
/ Who am  getting fleeced for
Hang on a second
He puts him on hold
Peter is already scrolling through the Mets' farm system, his eyes darting around the stats
Bennett maybe
How old
Twenty-six

Twenty-six and in Double-
Forget it
Duncan
No
Cerda
No

Furbush
() No
Eckerton
Eckerton
Eckerton, that's the guy
Billy punches the phone off hold
Eckerton
/ Eckerton
like Eckerton
You don't even know who Eckerton is
The phone on Pete's desk rings
Peter answers a second blinking line
Hello
/ Is Venafro hurt
Oh, hi
No, he's not hurt
He's fine
This is just a situation for us
It's Steve
/ Last couple of times out, he got hammered
() 'm on with Steve
() Not his fault
We misused him
125
125
Steve Schott
Tell him to hold
(to Steve Phillips) Look
Steve
Here's the deal
'm being straight with you
'm getting Rincon
It's a done deal
It's done
/ heard the Giants -- No, the Giants want Venafro
And  told them they can have him for Michaelson
-- -- but 'd rather deal with you
Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't
Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask
As they listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call -- Yes,  understand it's impolite to keep you holding
/ 'll think about it
Of course
Think
But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro
He hangs up
Looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner
He hung up
Silence
Then -- If you could have the power of flight or invisibility, which would you choose
What
126
126
Invisibility or flight
() Invisibility
That's what Casey said
Why
You'd have total access
Besides, everyone else would choose flight
Quiet
Why isn't anybody calling
The phone rings
Shapiro's on two
Billy picks up
Listens
Fist pump
Great
Lemme talk to my owner
Call you right back
() Get Steve
Phillips or Schott
Why would  call Phillips back
Schott
Tell him 'm on the other line
Right
Peter dials
Billy can't sit
Mr
Schott, it's Peter Brand
Sorry left you on hold
Billy asked me to call you back
He's on another line
Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon
127
127
Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon
Please
() Yes,  added the please
(listens; to Billy) No
Billy thinks intensely
Finally -- Tell him 'll pay it, but when  sell him next year for twice that,  keep the money
Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit
Peter listens to whatever Steve Schott is saying, then -- Okay
Thank you
( ) He says he'll pay for Rincon
High five
Great
Shit
What are we forgetting
( ) Get me Shapiro
-- as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial
Wait, never mind
(beat, then into ) Mark
Yeah, it's Billy
Here's the deal
don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight
Tell him to change his clothes
got you the money and accept your gratitude
It's done
He hangs up
Fist bump
We gotta let someone go
It's Mags
It's gotta be Mags
call not it
128
128
Billy dials an extension
Art
Billy
The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse
The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland 's last night
/ No
What do you mean, no
/ No, as in no
'm not doing it
You do it
You did it, so you do it
Art hangs up
Billy slams the speakerphone
It's not the phone's fault
Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone
We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over
He leaves
F120
'   - 20   F120 Billy comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting up to where Magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to his locker, and sits with him
-- Hey, Billy
know 've been struggling lately
But we're coming into the home stretch, and  promise 'm gonna turn it -- --  need you to stop getting dressed
Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did
Eventually - Traded
129
129
Billy shakes his head, no
'm sorry for the crap news
know it hurts
() Mike
can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse
Magnante nods
Alright
Thanks
Billy gets up to leave
As he exits, he sees Peter enter with Rincon, standing with his new uniform in his arms, looking like a prison inmate
Oops
Billy joins them
Hey, Ricardo
Hola, senor
Hola
Hey,  know this must seem a bit sudden, but the Oakland 's have been trying to get you for a long time
You're gonna love it here
The guys are fun
Muy divertido
pitch tonight
don't know if you're gonna pitch tonight
But you're on our team tonight
no wanna pitch tonight
Right
So
where you from
Veracruz, Mexico
130
130
Well, you're a lot closer to home
Why don't you hang out there for five menudos and we'll get you a uniform and everything
(to side room) Hey guys, clear the room, huh
Say hi to Ricardo Rincon
As the other players file out and say hello
: G120
-  G120 Billy, Tara and Casey at dinner
Tara and me were thinking -- Dad
Tara and  -- She is correct
Tara and  were thinking about going to Point Reyes to the beach
That'd be fun
Me go, too
And 'll work on my grammar
(beat, then) Dad
are you going to lose your job
What
Where did you hear that, honey
The internet
No, 'm not going to lose my job
Don't go on the internet or watch  or read the papers or talk to people
131
131
'm not talking to people, 'm just reading stuff
Don't worry
You don't believe me
Ask Tara
He's not (losing his job)
Your dad is a brilliant man
He's the best  in baseball
But say that you did -- just saying -- would you have to move away
No, honey
Absolutely not
And even if did, 'm not going anywhere
told you not to worry about me
People say a lot of crazy things and they don't always know what they're talking about
It's just gossip
Like gossipers at school
You can't always believe what you read
Sometimes you need to scratch underneath the surface and find who the authority is
And once you do find out who the authorities are, ignore them at all costs
You can always ask your dad
Everything's fine, honey
'm not going anywhere
The only way  would lose my job is if someone was to give me a better one
Don't worry about me, okay
Dad knows what he's doing

-  B121 Peter sits with Hatteberg, reviewing his hits on a monitor
This is a chart of what you should and shouldn't be swinging at
These circles represent different pitches
Red is hit, blue is out, yellow's missed or foul, green is chased, white taken
This is you versus Conway
What do you see
'm chasing a lot of high and outside
The red is where most hits happen
That's where you want to be swinging
You don't want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone
We'd rather take those strikes, `cause you're not going to hit `em out of the park
And you're good about that, patient
() 133
133
(') Right now you're averaging about 4 pitches per at-bat
4 per bat
Yeah, and that's great
One of the reasons why we love you
You're draining a pitcher's pitches
Now, guys like Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little over 5
That's top tier
Does this chart make sense to you
Yeah
'll get on base more if  lay off anything high
This is awesome
So you have a breakdown of this from every game
Every game
Your instincts are in the right place
This isn't something they teach you in little league
This is something fundamental we're looking for -- how to wear out a pitcher's arm
If you're about to face Conway and wondering what you should and shouldn't swing at, come in here and watch how you're tending
You can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen
Pretty great, right
Show me some of the stuff 'm chasing up high

Everybody thinks the first pitch is what's most important, but it's not
It's the first two out of three pitches that matter the most
() 134
134
(') The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is the difference between a scrub and an All Star
So you're saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch it'll put us in the driver's seat
Any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us
game is on  in the background
Billy makes various comments the the screen -- That's a problem right there
Terrance jogging to first
() Mr
Justice
That's what we pay you for
() Chad Bradford, you deceptive son of a bitch,  love you
() He's a pain in the ass, but that Giambi gets on base
Another train of thought -- Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats
My whole career  only had eighteen walks
Actually

Shut up
And now we have -- 122  --   -  122 Migs, let's make a deal
'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull

Hey,
Did your car get egged

Don't worry about it

Sorry, Billy

At first base 'm making a lot of errors
'm gonna cost us a hundred runs

5 actually
But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs
70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games

Can you live with that

'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually

(back to ) We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte, we've got a machine that makes whatever you want
We've got free soda

heard about that
( ) Can you have some coffee in there for us
() Thank you
He snaps the phone shut
A171
-  A171 Billy and John admire the view
sets down a tray of coffee and exits
It's her birthday and  need to get her a present but she's usually the one who does that for me so do you have any ideas
() scarf
You mean like wool
No  meant something that women wear with, you know, a decorative -- Sure
Excellent
() And where would  get something like that
John, no disrespect,  just lost in five for the second year in a row -- give her a bowling ball for all  care
Steve Schott told me he's offering you a new contract
Yes he is
So why'd you return my call
You're the Red Sox, and  think  can help you
() 158
158
(') think  can do something about the Curse of the Bambino
heard you hired Bill James
Why it took someone so long to hire that guy is beyond me
Because baseball hates him
Money buys a lot of things
One is the luxury to disregard what baseball thinks
That must be nice
(beat, then) was grateful to get your call
looks at  a moment
You were grateful
Yeah
For 41 million you built a playoff team
You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and Pena and you won two more games without them than you did with them
And we begin a slow push-in on
this is the first person in baseball other than his assistant who doesn't think he's crazy
You won the exact same number of games as the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1
4 million dollars per win and you paid two- hundred and sixty thousand
Yes,  want you to be my General Manager
() know you're taking it in the teeth
The first guy through a wall always gets hurt
But those are dying voices
Any that doesn't tear down their team and rebuild it using your model is gonna be a dinosaur
's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and slides it to  -- 159
159
What's this
My first offer
opens it, looks at it for less than a second, and looks back up at
171
-  171 Billy looks out at the Boston scenery
He steals a glance at the paper in his hand, John's offer, pensive
: 172  172 173
-   -  173 Billy comes into the locker room and gives it a look
174  (  G177) 174 175  175 176
-  176 Billy sits at a table
baseball  down in front of him
He looks up to see where it came from
is standing in the doorway
Heads up
Jesus
What the hell -- Sorry
What the hell was that
don't know
Sorry
() How was Boston
Impressive
You're giving me Youkilis, Billy
160
160
Why would  ever do that
Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and  want Youkilis
Oh, what is that, your  voice
You can't have him
And Cash
And a player to be named later
You already have my job
What else do you want from me
don't want your job
Why did you take it
You didn't leave me much choice
() Did Henry make you a good offer
It doesn't matter
Did he make you a good offer
It was fine
What was it
It doesn't matter
Pete just stares at him
Finally, Billy reaches into his pocket, takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it to Peter
Peter looks at it
He offered to make you the highest paid in pro sports
161
161
( ) Do  love the Red Sox
don't know
've never heard you say you did
So why am  doing this
You're not doing it for the money
'm not
You're doing it for what the money says
It says what it says to any player who gets big money: that they're worth it
The offer says that
The money itself is redundant
() made one personal decision based on money in my life and  swore to never do that again
So you're not going to Boston
haven't decided
It's all over the news that it's a done deal
Look at this place
What a dump
() so wanted to win here
think you've already won, Billy
No Pete, we lost
You haven't given yourself time to get over it, it's only been three days
162
162
'm not even over last year yet
don't get over it
() 've got something in the video room, come with me
really can't look at video right now
No, come with me
A177  (  K177) A177 B177
-  B177 It's not much more than a home movie but you'll get the idea
Who is it
The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of running to second
This was in a game six weeks ago
hits the remote and the tape starts
The quality is poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy
This guy's gonna start him off with a fastball low and in because he hasn't read the book on our guy and doesn't know that low and in is where he eats
Jeremy takes him to deep center -- We see   connect and the ball fly off the bat but the camera stays on  running to first slows down the picture with the remote -- and he knows that if he runs it's a stand-up double and he's running
() Go pal
163
163
And now he's gonna do something he never does
He's gonna round first base, he's gonna take the turn
Please tell me he's safe at second
No
Because right here -- slips and stumbles to the ground
-- is what he's always been afraid of
It's all he can do to get himself back to first
has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back to first base
What is that
That's the first base coach
Why's he laughing
'm gonna fire that guy, why the hell is he -- Everybody's laughing
's looking around the field now, looking at his own dugout
We can't see what he sees but he's confused
And now Jeremy finds out why
Watch his face because this is art
He's just found out the ball went 60 feet over the fence
He'd hit a home run but he didn't know it
And 's face explodes into a smile
He slaps hands with the first base coach and begins his trot around the bases
stares at this
He takes the remote and backs it up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again
How can anybody not be romantic about baseball
164
164
() It was a metaph-- know it was a metaphor
That was a hell of a baseball season, boss
The Island of Misfit Toys
Okay
And with that, Billy's mind begins to go elsewhere
No resolution, no decision, other than to get up and wander on

His  of perfect sky
K177
-  ( A177) K177 's driving along and listening to the continued of talk radio criticism
(
) keeps listening a moment, then reaches in the glove box and pulls out a  marked "Dad's Mix"
slips it in the  player
The sound of the radio immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon broken by 's -- (
) Hey, Dad
picked these songs out just for you
And then the first track on the  comes on ( )
And  smiles
He continues on down the freeway into dusk, as-- 177
