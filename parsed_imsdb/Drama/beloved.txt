Written by Richard LaGravenese Based on the Novel by Toni Morrison October 11, 1996 124   -
It is winter in Ohio
house sits isolated beside a barren field
The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant woods stops it
Around the back of the house stands a rundown , a cold house, a privy and a water pump
porch with a single door serves as the only entrance
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we; - , 1865 from inside the house - , and   on wooden floor boards

- (13 yrs
old) and  (14 yrs
old) run down the steps from the second floor
They are fully dressed, carrying a small bag of belongings
We gonna need food
Wait here
Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter runs into the kitchen
Alone, he edges towards the front door, when suddenly; on it's own
Scared, he steps away slowly
-
Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag
He spots sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces already eaten
He finds a knife and approaches the table
He is about to cut into the cake when he sees appear on the cake's surface
Howard stops cold - dropping the knife
-
Howard exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand; Come on
() Bul
The boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine year old
Where you goin
The brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her
They love their sister
But there are stronger forces here
on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle
We gotta go
Bulgar looks up to Denver
They exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing
He wants to take her
Bye, Denver
You take care
Bye
Bul
Bulgar is starting to cry
He rushes up the steps and hugs his sister
He kisses her hard then breaks away
Denver's outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air
No
Bul
Bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding Howard's hand once more
Denver sits alone at the top of the stairs
She sadly looks up and weeps, as if to the house itself: Now what you go and do that for
-
carries over the images of: The two boys running for their lives towards the train, holding hands all the way
Howard is the first to reach it
As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in
Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him
- '  reaching for 's
They connect
- The boys are on the train as it leaves town
On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle
until it reaches , made with flecked pink stone
Upon the headstone is only one word: 124
-
Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a Close-Up of a  looking out of a second floor bedroom window
It is , mother of the two boys and Denver
She hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away
and a deep pain that is too constant to notice
; : 124 -    -
, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of
It is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding
Suggs is bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith
Ya know what 'd love to see
loved to see me some lavender
You got any lavender
Or even pink - pink'll do
Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser
She stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches
She looks around the room
No
Sorry
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color
Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until; () Oh wait
Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at her
Suggs smiles
Oh, that's fine
Fine
Sethe lets out a small laugh
She walks toward the window, stretching her body
Her expression changes as she thinks of her boys
Baby Suggs reads her like a book
They'll be all right
'm surprised they lasted here this long
don't know
Maybe we should have moved
What'd be the point
Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief
We lucky our ghost is a baby
My husband spirit come back
Or yours
Don't talk to me
Ha
You lucky
You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts
Be thankful
had eight
Eight with six fathers
Every one of them gone from me
Four taken, four chased and all,  expect, worrying somebody's house into evil
My first born - alls  can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread
Her little hands
wouldn't know'em if they slapped me
Can you beat that
Eight children and that's all  remember
(returning to her work) You remember Halle
Oh,  remember bits and pieces of all of'em  guess
Halle, of course
had Halle a lifetime
Almost twenty years
My two girls, sold and gone before could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet
My third child, my son after Halle
let that straw boss have me for four months so's  could keep that boy
Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child
couldn't love that child
wouldn't
Not any of the rest either
God take what He would
and He did
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here
Those boys didn't even know him
You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children blessing
learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that
like Halle
now that's somebody
Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face
Although she loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her
Just got a few more things to do, then 'll start supper
Sethe exits
124
-
Denver is playing in the front yard by herself
Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing gentle breeze carries a  into the bucket
Sethe sees it floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up
of  as the image triggers a feeling - and the feeling a memory - from long ago
Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in the barren field of 124
but rather- ; -
stunning vista of the plantation   - sun beating down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as the eye can see
Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic landscape
Sethe looks frightened
Her breathing grows shallow
She hears something; '  - rolling over a road, growing louder, coming towards her ; - away from the sycamores towards the road to see; ; 124  -
driving a horse and wagon with two children in the back, coming up Bluestone Road
He wears no hat
Sethe breathes easily
She looks around her -the reality of 124's barren field has returned
The memory of Sweet Home's sycamores have vanished
Denver is playing near the road
As the wagon nears 124, Denver looks up and smiles
The Man whips the horse hard so as to ride past the house faster
The children stare at Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity
The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile
She watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her mother watching her
Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot
Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods
-
Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is going
She reaches    planted in a ring
The tall bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground, forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high, with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves
This is Denver's private place
She bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center
Once there, this lonely child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself together
She lays her face against the cool earth
124
-
Denver walks to her room in her night dress
She passes the opened door of her mother's bedroom and peeks in: '  -
Sethe kneeling by her bed, as if praying
Beside Sethe,     as well, with it's sleeve around Sethe's waist
Like two friendly grown-up women, comforting each other in prayer
Denver tip toes away
'  -
Sethe enters to check on Denver, whom she thinks is asleep
She leans over and kisses her forehead, only to discover she is awake; Mama
What is it baby
You think maybe when daddy comes, he could talk to the baby ghost
Maybe make her behave and then people won't be scared of here no more
don't know
Why won't she ever settle
She's mad like a baby gets mad
You forgetting how little it is
She wasn't even two years old when she died
Too little to understand
For a baby she throws a powerful spell
No more powerful than the way  loved her
Hearing her mother say this, moves Denver
What do you pray for Mama
Oh,  don't really pray anymore
just talk
About what
Oh, about time
How some things go
Pass on
Some things just stay
What things
Like, the place  was at before here - Sweet Home
Even if that whole farm and every tree and blade of grass on it died - it'll still be there
Waiting
And if you go and stand in the place where it was, what happened there once, will happen again
If it's still there, waiting, that mean nothing ever dies
Nothing ever does
That's why  had to get my children out
No matter what
That's why you can never go there
You never tell me all what happened
Just that they whipped you and you run off pregnant with me
You don't need to know nothing else
(nods) saw a white dress kneeling next to you when you was praying
White
Maybe it was my bedding dress
Describe it to me
Had a high neck
Whole mess of buttons coming down the back
Buttons
Well, that's not my bedding dress
never had a button on nothing
What else
bunch at the back
On the sit down part
bustle
don't know what it's called
You say it was holding on to me
How
Kneeling next to you while you were praying
mean, talking
It looked just like you
Well, 'll be
think it was a sign
think maybe baby's got plans
What plans
don't know, but that dress holding onto you got to mean something
Maybe
Maybe it does
Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child
They hear a sound in the house - floor boards creaking
She's crawling again
Sethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen

-
Paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house
Grateful he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps towards the porch
His clothes are ragged
His feet sore and blistering in his shoes
-
Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs at the pump
She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking towards the house
The sun blazes in her eyes
She can't make out who it is, or whether or not he's even real
As he reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view
Sethe walks towards the front of the house
When she is little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past
Paul
Paul
Is that you
(smiles) What's left
(He rises) How you been girl, besides barefoot
Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket
She smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes
You looking good
Devil's confusion
He lets me look good long as  feel bad
How long has it been
'Bout eighteen years,  figure
Eighteen years
And  swear  been walking every one of them
Mind if  join you
He begins taking off his shoes
You want to soak them
Let me get you some water
No, uh, uh
Can't baby feet
whole more tramping they got to do yet
You're not leaving right away, are you
You stay awhile
Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs, you
Where is she
Dead
Aw no
When
Eight years now
Almost nine
Was it hard
hope she didn't die hard
Soft as cream
Being alive was the hard part
Sorry you missed her though
Is that what you came by for
That's some of what  came for
The rest is you
Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says this
she looks away instinctively
Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: The truth be known,  go anywhere these days
Anywhere they let me sit down
Come on inside
Porch is fine
Cool out here
Sit with me
Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her
So Baby Suggs is gone
Somehow never thought death would find her
It finds everyone
We managed well enough without meeting it
suppose
Awkward pause
Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult question - but one that is foremost in her mind; wouldn't have to ask about him, would You'd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn't you
Paul knows instantly she is asking about Halle
You know  would
But  don't know any more about what happened to Halle now than  did then
Something about Paul's expression might suggest he's keeping something from her
He turns his gaze outward as he says; You must think he's still alive
No
think he's dead
It's just not being sure that keeps him alive
What did Baby Suggs think
Same
Ha, listen to her, all her children dead and she felt each one go the very day and hour it happened
When she say Halle went
1855
Same day my baby was born
You had that baby, did you
Damn, never thought you'd make it
Running off pregnant
Had to
Couldn't be no waiting
All by yourself too
Almost
white girl helped me
Then she helped herself, God bless her
Awkward silence
We got spare rooms
You could stay the night, if you had a mind to
You don't sound too steady in the offer
Oh it's
it's truly meant
just hope you'll pardon my house
Paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her home
My house
like the sound of that
Sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in
124   -
Sethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her, hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder
As he follows her in; ,   forms around him
It worries him
You got company
On and off
The light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way to the kitchen at the end of the hall
Frightened, Paul steps back out the door
Good God
What kind of evil you got in there
It's not evil
It's just
just sad
Come on
Just step through
Sethe reaches out her hand
Paul tentatively takes it and is lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the kitchen where it ends
As he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light
It is sad
sadness that touches him, welling up inside until tears are brimming in his eyes
He reaches the normal light of the kitchen and steps out of it
-
Paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone
thought you said she died soft as cream
(busying herself in kitchen) Oh that's not Baby Suggs
That's my daughter
The one  sent ahead with the boys before  run off
She didn't live
No
The boys too
No, they alive - they run off before Baby Suggs died
The one  was carrying when left Sweet Home is all  got left
Still affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the table, finding something to say
Well, probably best
If a Negro boy got legs he ought to use them
Sit down too long, somebody figure out a way to tie them up
(the image disturbs Sethe) You by yourself then
Me and Denver
my daughter
No man
(Sethe shakes head "no") And that's all right by you
It's all right by me
cook at a restaurant in town
Sew a little on the sly
She places a bottle and a glass on the table before him
The light jarred him
He snatches the bottle to drink and calm himself down
She jokes
You look more done in by a walk through my front hall than all those eighteen years of walking put together
Got that right
124 -
Denver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down in the kitchen
She stops
Her face lights up
Daddy
She runs down the white staircase
-
As Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear: () Won't you stay a little while
Can't nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day
Denver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that leads from the second floor
She looks at Paul wide eyed
They turn to her with gentle smiles; Baby, this here's Paul
Garner
Paul, this is my Denver
Paul's the last of the Sweet Home men
Denver's heart sinks
Good morning Miss Denver
It's a pleasure
Good morning, Mr
Garner, baby
Paul
Garner
Yes sir
Glad to get a look at you
Last time saw your mama, you were pushing out the front of her dress
She's a fine looking young lady, Sethe
Fine looking
Got her daddy's sweet face
You knew my father
Knew him
Knew him well
Of course he did
told you, he's from Sweet Home
Paul may stay with us a while
Won't that be nice, having an old friend stay a spell
But Denver reacts with surprise and dismay
Paul is not her friend
Paul, right now, is more of an intruder
If that's all right with you, that is
We have a ghost here, you know
We met
But sad, your mama said
Not evil
No sir, not evil
But not sad either
What then
Lonely
don't see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does
It's my sister
She was just a baby when she died in this house
Reminds me of that headless bride back behind Sweet Home
Remember that Sethe
Used to roam them woods regular
(annoyed, resentful) Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home
Says it was never sweet and it sure wasn't home
Girl, mind yourself
Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe
But it's where we were
All together
It's where  met your father
And it comes back on us whether we want it to or not
Then why don't you ever tell me about it
Sethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge
Denver, start up the stove
Paul must be hungry
Don't go to no trouble on my account
Bread's no trouble
The rest  brought back from where  work
Least  can do, cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner home
You got any objections to pike
If he don't object to me  don't object to him
He addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response
She crosses to the stove and works on lighting it
She's mad
Where's he going to sleep
Baby Sugg's room got no sheets or nothing
We'll figure it out
Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr
Garner
Then you two can talk about Sweet Home all night long
(explodes) What's the matter with you
never knew you to behave like this
Leave her be, Sethe
'm a stranger to her
That's just it
She got no cause to act up with a stranger
Denver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud
Sethe moves to her
Baby, what is it
Did something happen
Denver moves away
Sethe registers this rejection
can't no more
can't no more
Can't what
What can't you
can't live here
don't know where to go or what to do but  can't live here
Nobody speaks to us
Nobody comes by
Nobody even knows 'm alive
What she talking about 'nobody speaks to you'
It's the house
People don't
It's not
It's not the house
It's us
It's you
Denver
Leave off, Sethe
It's hard for a young girl living in a haunted place
That can't be easy
(growing irritated) It's easier than some other things
Come here, baby
Denver allows herself to be held
'm a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and 'm telling you it' ain't easy
Maybe you oughta move
No
Sethe
No
No moving
No leaving
It's all right the way it is
You going to tell me it's all right with this child half out of her mind
(holding Denver in her arms) got a tree on my back and a haunt in my house and nothing in between but the daughter 'm holding in my arms
No more running - from nothing
will never run from another thing on this earth, you hear
took one journey and  paid the ticket but let me tell you something, Paul
Garner; it cost too much
Do you hear me
It cost too much
Now sit down and eat with us or leave us be
Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul
He watches as Sethe ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to quiet her down
Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words
He fishes out a pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for smoking papers he knows he doesn't have
waiting for Sethe to return
When she does, she heads straight for the stove
She spits on her finger and touches it to check it's heat
She then begins to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to Paul throughout - as the scene continues; What tree, Sethe
Huh
What tree on your back
don't see nothing growing on your back
It's there all the same
Who told you that
White girl
That's what she called it never seen it and never will
But she said that's what it looked like chokecherry tree
Leaves, branches
That was 18 years ago
Could have cherries by now for all  know
don't follow
Sethe pauses
Something in her decides to tell Paul , although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control; had milk, see
was pregnant with Denver but  had milk for my baby girl that  sent ahead with the boys
hadn't stopped nursing her when  sent her and the boys ahead of me
Anybody could smell me long before they saw me
Nothing could do about it
All  knew is  had to get my milk to my little girl
Nobody was going to nurse her like me
Nobody was going to get it to her fast enough or take it away when she had enough
nobody knew she couldn't pass her air if you held her up on your shoulder, only if she was lying on your knee
Nobody knew that but me
Paul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going
We was talking about a tree, Sethe
Sethe works faster
It is the work, taking an action - any action - that allows her tell the story numbly, without the pain of reliving it
without the images attacking Schoolteacher's boys drag me into the barn and took my milk
yet, the images come anyway
:    attack as : -
- Sethe being raped, beaten, held down by ' in a barn with a loft
( ) Held me down in that barn and took it
: Sethe screams and is smacked across the face
( ) They were like boulders on me
Their hands over my mouth and on my shoulders and my legs
: One of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two others hold down her body and ravage her
( ) couldn't move
Alls  could see was the loft above their heads
: Her mouth covered, her head immobile - she stares up at the loft
The loft
-
Sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder on the biscuit dough
The flashes of
told Mrs
Garner on them
She had that lump on her neck and couldn't speak but her eyes rolled out tears,  remember
Them boys found out  told on 'em and Schoolteacher made one open up my back, and when it closed it made a tree
They used cowhide on you
And they took my milk
They beat you and you was pregnant
And they took my milk
Sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips into the stove
As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her
He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his cheek against her back
He rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress
Raising his fingers to the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has become
Aw Lord, girl
Grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth
The tenderness is almost unbearable
Suddenly, '
He pauses and looks down
He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but rather; , , the house from side to side
Sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress
On all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if trying to keep the house together
Paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout; Leave this place alone
Get the hell outta here
table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg
Managing to stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking everything, screaming at the house; ,
The quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not stop whipping the table around until everything it is absolutely still
He leans against the wall, panting
Sethe is crouched by the stove
mixed expression of relief and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient child has been sent away
But a child she loves nonetheless
Denver looks frightened
More alone than ever, now that her one companion is gone
All three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like one tired person
: -
Denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes
At the stove, she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits from the oven, 124
-
shirtless Paul
is by the water pump washing himself
-
Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf
She takes out a jar
She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the broken table
She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through the front door
-
Sethe prepares a bed for Paul
Baby Suggs quilt is on the bed
She hesitates whether or not to leave it there
Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his shirt hanging open down the front
Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward
Why don't you
take a rest
'll call you when we're ready
Sure you don't want me to help clean up
No
you'd just get in my way
Denver and me'll do it
They stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny
Paul starts smiling
Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place
Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the floor
Sethe watches him
Paul crosses to her
He moves in to kiss her
They approach each other's lips like two burn victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their touch
124
-
Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again
Miserably eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate
-
Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking
They are still fully clothed
The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly
Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or excitement - but sits like a chasm between them
As Sethe lays there,  : : -
brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny corn field
Sethe and a slightly older  - handsome, strong - run through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot
How's this
Here
out in the open
Look around - can you see anybody
Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks
She shakes her head no
Then nothing can see us neither
He takes off his shirt
Seethe giggles as she gets on the ground, keeping her ankles crossed
Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs
She giggles
Halle pauses before laying on top of her
You are a beautiful sight
Don't talk stupid
You're my wife now
can talk as stupid as  like about you
(she giggles) ain't never loved nothing like you before, Sethe
(Sethe is moved) And after  get mama out
then  get us out too
And you'll see, baby girl
(smiles) we're gonna have us a liiife
He sings the word "life", so that Sethe laughs
Then, Halle lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love
As camera pans up to a  above the field, we hear Sethe ask; (
) You sure nobody can see
We hear Halle grunt "uh-huh" as we arrive on the hill where a sits
-
Beneath the tree,  ,  and Paul's brothers Paul
and Paul
are pouring water over heads and watching; ; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in clear view to anyone on the hill
Damn
don't get why she picked him
Halle's got that way about him
That way a woman feels he's doing it all for her, not for himself at all
can't see nothing so special about Halle
What about what he's doing for his mama
Fool thing, if you ask me
By the time he buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to somebody that old and worn
Freedom mean something anytime it come
The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking
, in particular, watches with tender yearning
-
, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home
He offers cooked corn to the men
Raccoon must've got into my corn
Damaged a few so, no use throwing them out
The men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh
Sethe, get the butter there
Everyone looks at each other as they thank No
Garner and begin to smear butter on their corn and eat
visiting the Garner's cautions him; You spoil these nigger boys
Maybe you got boys on your farm
My nigger's are men
Not a boy among'em
Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway
Beg to differ Garner
Ain't no nigger men
Not if you scared
But if you a man yourself, you'll want your niggers to be men too
Wouldn't have no nigger men around my wife
Neither would
Neither would
Sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to Halle
Paul  and Paul  hesitate as they think of eating the corn which the lovers consummated
But Sixo digs right in
Paul  eats slowly, his eyes never leaving Sethe as she moves Around the kitchen, her eyes never leaving Halle
Paul's Attraction and love for her are apparent
; '  -
on , on his back, turned away from Sethe
What began as Sethe's memory, has blended into Paul's
Sethe rises off the bed, breaking the thick silence between them: 'll call you when there's something to eat
She exits, leaving Paul alone on the bed
124
-
We see the house now
No creaking or sounds of breaking furniture
Just the sound of Paul
singing
-
Paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving the baby ghost away
Denver is sweeping the floor - irritated by Paul's presence and voice
They both hear the front door open as Sethe arrives home from work
They look to each other to see which one will make a move for Sethe first
Paul knows enough to bide his time with Denver
He watches as she places the broom down and exits the kitchen
124
-
Paul and Sethe sit on the porch together
Sethe is sewing
Paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask: Sethe
(she stops and looks) was thinking of looking for work around here
What do you think
Ain't much
River mostly
And hogs
Hogs is fine
Paul moves to where Sethe is sitting
don't need much, Sethe
Eat, sleep, sing a little when it strikes me
don't ask for more to
to live somewhere
Sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds: All right
It's
it's fine with me
Your girl Denver
Seems she's of a different mind
Don't worry about her
She's a charmed child
Nothing ever touch her too bad
From the beginning
Everybody  knew dead or gone, but not her
(pause) You got to know something, though - this here ain't no better life
It's just not that other one
What  do here - all ever do - is keep Denver from that other
So if you stay, there's no more talk about Sweet Home or anything else won't let the past in my yard again
Getting me and Denver through this here life is all that matters
You understand
Dangerous to love anything that much, Sethe
Best thing is to love everything just a little bit
that way, when it breaks or runs off or gets taken, well maybe you'd have a little love left over for the next one
Don't be asking me to choose, Paul
There ain't no choice here
That's the whole point
'm not asking you to choose
Just want to know if there's some space for me
Want to know if it's more than "you can stay", "it's fine"
more like, " want you here Paul"
Beat
Sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him
Maybe we should leave things the way they are
Sethe rises to enter the house when Paul's words stop her: How are they
We get along
What about inside
don't go inside
Sethe, if 'm here with you, with Denver, you can go anywhere you want
Jump, if you want to, 'cause 'll catch you
Go as far inside as you need - 'll hold your ankles
Make sure you get back out
'm not saying this because  need a place to stay
told you, 'm a walking man, but been heading in this direction for seven years
When  got here and sat out there on the porch, waiting for you, well,  knew it wasn't the place  was heading toward
It was you
We can make a life girl
life
(scared) don't know
don't know
Leave it to me
See how it goes
No promises, if you don't want to make any
Just see how it goes, all right
Sethe's heart is twisted
She wants to cry
because she feels hope
and because she feels fear
All right
We'll see how it goes
You willing to leave it to me
Well
some of it
(smiles) Some
Well okay
some
Sethe manages a smile
'  -
Denver lies curled up in her bed
Alone
Sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly
Denver looks up, surprised to see her
What is it
What's wrong
Nothing
Nothing's wrong
Lay back down
Denver obeys, unsure
You think baby ghost's really gone
Don't know
miss her
Sethe lets out a small laugh
do
Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would never hurt me
She was my sister
When was little, after the boys left,  used to think that she and me both were waiting for daddy to come
And once he did, she wouldn't be mad no more
(Sethe listens sadly) They hear Paul singing out on the porch
Denver grimaces
Wish he'd shut-up
He's ruined everything
No, he hasn't
He won't
(hesitates) He
he wants to takes us to the carnival next Thursday
Denver's eyes light up with excitement then caution
You mean, go out where they'll be other people
Dress up a little bit
Wear our hats
What do you think
(downplaying her excitement) Maybe
Maybe
All right
all right
(difficult for her to say) Can  ask you something
(Denver nods, her back to Sethe) was wondrin'
What you think about us
maybe
maybe thinking we could start
if we got an idea to, thinking we could start
countin' on
(she stops) On what mama
Countin' on what
Sethe can barely bring herself to say
To hope
To imagine
Paul
But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers; Something
-
Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black townspeople gathered for the carnival
sign reads
Paul is in high spirits
Saying hello to anyone whose eye he catches
Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants
Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life
Denver is excited but worried
She doesn't want to like Paul but can't help the thrill she's feeling
And when one or two passersby shout out; - Hey Denver
Hi there Denver
Denver heart almost weeps with joy
Sethe walks cautiously
Overdressed for the occasion, it is her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years
She catches the eyes of some of the women she knows and
good Christian women who nod in their acknowledgement yet are holding back something
judgement
repulsion
Paul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad
of
the various carnival acts, all performed by a  ; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids
Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty
At one point,     shouts to the children; All Pickaninnies free
The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit
But Paul whispers; Two pennies and an insult well spent in my opinion to see the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves
Sethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that laugh, a sudden sensation of relief
Paul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade
Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks; Mind if  take a sip
Denver agrees
Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back to her
Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him
-
Our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with distance in between each
The sunlight casts strong shadows
Sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees; as they walk home
; -
-
of a ,   (more like a small river) with a   standing tall on the bank before it
There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves gracefully beneath the sun
; , Exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree
She seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck
Yet her skin is like new lineless and smooth
Glowing
Although racked with pain,
Smiling the way travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long and arduous journey
-
The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods
She passes by Denver's   secret place
Then continues forward, as if with a specific direction in mind
124   -
Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124
Denver is the first to see
Look
What is that
All three look to see; sitting on a stump not far from the steps of 124
As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and stares directly at Sethe
The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe, curious yet warm
The Young Woman, happy yet there is a hunger in her stare
-
The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup of water
The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup
You from around here
The Young Woman shakes her head
She reaches down and takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new
Sethe bends down to pick them up
The Young Woman never lets her eyes leave Sethe
Those shoes look brand new
What might your name be
The Young Woman speaks in a low, rough voice; Beloved
Sethe drops the shoes
Denver sits down
Paul smiles; Beloved
You use a last name, Beloved
Last
No
just Beloved
(she spells it) As she spells it we see sethe's reaction; she is deeply touched
Then Denver's - who looks both amazed and curiously excited
Sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches Beloved
That's a pretty name Beloved
Take off your hat and 'll make us something
We just got back from the carnival over near Cincinnati- But Beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair
Miss
Miss, you want to lay down
Her eyes open to slits
Paul is about to help her when Denver rises; 'll take her up
She can sleep in baby Suggs room - that all right Mama
Course
Denver eases Beloved onto her feet, which Sethe and Paul notice do not have a line or sore on them
(whispers to Sethe) Look at her feet
They're not walking feet
More like she rode from somewhere all the way here
Yet, Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her to the white staircase
Beloved starts coughing
Sounds like the croup
Is she feverish, Denver
No
She's cold
Then she is
Fever goes from hot to cold
Could have the cholera
(adamant) She's not sick
Denver helps her up the stairs
Sethe and Paul register Denver's defensive reaction
'  -
Denver eases Beloved into the bed
Beloved falls asleep the second she hits the pillow
Denver gently - cautiously - strokes Beloved's forehead and cheek
'  -
Denver stands vigil beside Beloved, wrapped beneath a quilt
'  -
Denver watches her sleep, wiping her hot forehead with cold cloths
' '  -
Denver washes out Beloved's underwear and stockings
She hears Beloved murmuring
She moves quickly to her side
Beloved
Beloved 'm here
what is it
Heavy
this place is heavy
Would you like to sit up
Beloved shakes her head no
She takes hold of Denver's arm and wraps it around her own body
Denver sits up against the pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denver's arms and falls back asleep
Denver holds her, lovingly
-
Denver has not left her bedside
She places another quilt upon her, tucking it in around the sides
As she does this, Beloved's eyes open for a brief moment, catching the sight of Denver over her
She smiles
Denver gratefully smiles back
Can  get you anything
Are you hungry
Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food - Denver's meal
Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and feeds her
Denver is thrilled
; -
Denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the sandwich to Beloved, who, no longer feeling sickly, accepts it with a bright smile
-
Denver explains how to pack mud in the cracks of the hen house as Beloved listens attentively, eating jelly out of a jar
-
Denver explains to Beloved how to warm the chicks with their skirts as the latter eats something sweet
They both giggle at the softness of the chicks
& '  -
Denver is showing Beloved how to make her bed
then you fold it over like this see
This here used to be where my brothers and me slept
was always at the top
How you get so smart
ain't so smart
Yes you are
Well,  used to go to Lady Jones
She'd teach us with songs how to spell and count
You don't go no more
No
had to stop going
You so smart
Tell me about your brothers
Well
they're names were Howard and
As Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if it were a rose to admire
Denver drinks in the attention, her heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange creature
and
and Bulgar
At night, we used to
crawl into bed together
'd lay down on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die- witch stories
He said they would protect us
And if  learned them, they would protect me if ever they were gone
-
Everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner
Beloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long after the syrup had been sucked off
It makes Denver laugh, as she licks her cane stick
It makes Sethe smile, to see them both happy
It makes Paul disgusted
-
Paul confronts Sethe as she sews
You gonna just feed her, from now on
Denver likes her
She's no real trouble
But don't she have a home
Some place to go
Didn't mention one
thought we'd wait until her breathing got better
She still sounds a little lumbar
She breathe like she can eat, she could blow this whole house down
And all those sweets
Sometimes the body needs that sugar for strength when it's trying to recover after an illness
But that's just it
She don't seem sick
Something funny about her
Funny
How
Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look sick
Good skin, bright hands and strong as a bull
She can hardly walk without holding onto something
That's what  mean
Can't walk but passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning and saw her lifting the rocker with one hand
You didn't
Don't tell me
Ask Denver
She was right there
At that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen
Denver
Come in here a minute
Denver enters the keeping room
Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one hand
That so
Denver looks at Paul with a hard gaze; didn't see no such thing
From Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying
and whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly destroyed
'  -
Sethe is getting ready for bed
Denver sticks her head in: Have you seen her
can't find her
Who
Beloved
Sethe shakes her head
Denver exits anxiously
The mentions of Beloved's name stir a  in Sethe: : -
Sethe talks to the   as he works in the hot sun
His   helps him
She need a marker
Somethin' to tell me where she is
But  ain't got no money
The Engraver eyes her body
What you got then
Sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in front of the young boy
The Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her hip, curling his hand around to her back
What you want it to say
was thinking what the preacher say at the funeral
Dearly Beloved
(touching her) For ten minutes  give you one word for free
His hand glides down to her buttocks
Sethe can't help but see the Young Boy watching the scene
of
'  -
As the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly feels someone else's presence
She looks up to find: Beloved standing by the door - watching her
Oh
didn't know you were there
Can  help
Help what, honey
Beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning up Sethe's night dress
Where you go in the morning
Work
work in a restaurant
What time you go
Little after the sun come up
like to make a loaf of bread before  go
How you feelin'
Beloved nods, absorbing the information
You remember your mother at all
(scratching back of her head) remember a woman who was mine and remember bein snatched away from her
Sethe, nods, understanding such things
She cautiously reaches out to stroke Beloved's face
Beloved responds like a puppy, pressing her cheek against Sethe's hand
Sethe is moved
-
Sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for work
She finds Beloved waiting for her, placing out her cooking things on the table
Beloved looks up and smiles
'm helpin make your bread
124  -
Beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe coming home from work
When she sees her, she runs through the house, out the door to meet her
Denver appears at the door, upset by Beloved's loss of attention in her
-
- , as she leans her tired head against the porch, sitting on the step
She closes her eyes and is about to drift off, when; '  gently touches her shoulder, settling there
Sethe looks up and smiles, patting her hand
Beloved stands above her as Denver takes a seat on the step
Beloved searches Sethe's eyes and asks; Where your diamonds
The question surprises Sethe
and startles Denver
Diamonds
What would  be doing with diamonds
On your ears
Wish  did
(beat) Hmm
come to think of it,  had some crystal once
present from Mrs
Garner - woman  worked for at Sweet Home
never saw you with no earrings
Gone
Long gone
Tell me
Tell me about your diamonds
Sethe hesitates
Beloved kneels at her feet
(to Beloved) Ma'am don't talk about Sweet Home
(ignoring her) Tell me
Tell me about your diamonds
Denver awaits her mother's reaction with great interest
Sethe looks at Beloved sweet, innocent expression and something in her resistance, eases: Well
this lady  worked for in Kentucky gave them to me when  got married
Denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mother's willingness to tell Beloved what she'd never tell her: What they called married back then remember going up to her in the kitchen to tell her
'd help her make ink for Mr
Garner in the kitchen
was fool enough to think  was going have some kind of ceremony
maybe even a new dress
(    ;) Sethe's continues telling Beloved, an attentive audience
Denver, more attuned to Beloved's interest than the story, is disturbed at her mother's telling of it
-
Camera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke to; suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner
Beloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or whatever she needs
She is "shining" - for Sethe, and for Sethe alone
Denver notices it as well
It is raining outside
Both Denver and Beloved are wet from the rain
Denver's hair is all tangled
Best unbraid that hair
Tomorrow
Today's always here
Tomorrow never
It hurts
Comb it everyday, it won't
Your woman never fixed up your hair
All three look to Beloved, puzzled by her question, which is clearly intended for Sethe
Paul's getting more annoyed
What
My woman
You mean my mother
Beloved nods
Paul and Denver exchange a curious look
If she did  don't remember
don't think  saw her but a few times
Tell me 'bout her
Paul and Denver look to Sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer
remember once, she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse
The only thing  do remember in fact
Paul is disturbed by Sethe's carefree storytelling - how it contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it will lead to no good
Once again, Denver is surprised to hear what she's never heard before
She looks to Paul and knows what he is thinking
Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it
But Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the eyes
She opened up her dress and right on her rib, right here, was a circle and a cross burnt right into the skin
(interrupts her) Sethe
What
Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so
Any more beans
Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues: anyway, she points to this mark and says to me "This is your ma'am
am the only one whose got this mark now
The rest all dead
If something happens to me and you can't tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark"
Scared me so
couldn't think of anything to say so said "Yes Ma'am
but how will you know us
Mark me too
Mark the mark on me too
" Did she
No
She slapped my face
didn't understand it then
Not until  had a mark of my own
Paul is disturbed
He can see Sethe getting upset
He is mad at Beloved for her damn questions
What happened to her
Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected
Something unwanted is coming into her consciousness
Paul notices it
She rises; Don't know
Everybody done
Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks: Well, as long as we're all asking questions, getting to know each other
(to Beloved) Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself
Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the dish inside
We hear the others
: (
) (defensively) She don't remember nothing
(
) You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking
(
) Can  have some more pudding
Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table
She is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the      ; -   ; : -
of people surround a tree
are preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in line, awaiting their turn
Among the crowd is   () holding the hand of an ()
Nan is pointing to a (' ), who is one of the people waiting in line to be hanged
Nan whispers to Sethe: That's your mama - right there
Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask of courage and rage and tears
She looks straight ahead - not at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter
'm telling you, small girl Sethe
Me and your Mama was taken by the men many times
She threw them other babies away
the others from the whites, without names, she threw them away
But you she gave the name of the black man
She had her arms around him, child
The others, she did not put her arms around
Never
Never
The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further down the line
of  as    : - Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen: (
) Ain't you got no brothers or sisters
(
) don't have nobody
She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second pudding
Denver tries to interfere
She has us now
You been here five weeks, we still don't know nothing bout you
Paul, Stop it
Denver bring those dishes
What was you looking for when you came here
This place
was looking for this place could be in
Somebody tell you about this place
At the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested
She told me
When  was at the bridge, she told me
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; Must be somebody from the old days
How'd you come
Who brought you
walked here
long, long, long, long way
Nobody bring me
You had new shoes
If you walked so long why don't your shoes show it
Paul
stop picking on her
want to know
Where'd you get them shoes and that dress you had on
take the shoes
(coughs)  take the dress
(coughs) The shoe strings don't fit
Suddenly, she begins to  on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair
Denver and Sethe rush towards her
Beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin
She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess, glaring at Paul
You all right
(whispers) want to go to sleep now
Come to my room
can watch out for you up there
Sethe gets Beloved to her feet
Denver takes her up the staircase to her room - glaring at Paul
When the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans up
What's the matter with you
don't understand what the hold is
It's clear why she holds onto you, but  just can't see why you holding on to her
What you care who's holding on to who
Feeding her is no trouble
And she's nice company for Denver
We was just starting to feel a little like a family ourselves
Is that what's got your teeth on edge
can't place it
It's a feeling in me
You wanna feel somethin
Feel how it is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody there not worrying you to death about what you got to do each day to deserve it
And if that don't get it, feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything God made liable to jump on you
Feel that
know every bit of that, Sethe
wasn't born yesterday and  never mistreated a woman in my life
Well, that makes one of you in this world
(surprised) One
Not two
No
Not two
What Halle ever do to you
Halle stood by you
He never left you
Ha, what'd he leave then if not me, huh
don't know but it wasn't you
That's a fact
Then he did worse - he left his children
You don't know that
'
He wasn't where he said he would be
had to pack my babies off ahead of me, on their own, so  could stay behind to look for him
Underground agent said by Sunday we had to leave
Sunday came and he wasn't there
He couldn't get out of the loft,  expect
Forgetting himself, Paul let that slip out
Loft
What loft
(hesitates) The one over your head
The one in the barn
Sethe stops dead cold
It's no use
The   : -
Violent, rapid images of Sethe being raped and beaten held down by '
Sethe, pinned down, stares up at the loft
Camera rises up
There, in the loft, hides
The expression on his face is that of a man broken in two
of
-
Sethe wraps her arms tightly around herself and asks; He saw
He told you he saw
You told me
The day  came here
You said they stole your milk
never knew what messed Halle up
That was it, guess
seen him the day after you left
Says where you been Halle
All he says to me was "the loft"
asked him what he meant not going with you but he never answers me
But  knew was something broke him
Not one of them years of Saturdays, Sundays and nighttime extra never touched him
But whatever he saw go on in the barn that day broke him like a twig
He saw them boys do that to me and let them keep on breathing
man ain't a Goddamn ax, Sethe
Chopping, hacking, busting every Goddamn minute of the day
Things get to him
Things he can't chop down cause they inside him
The last time  saw him, knew he was broken for good
What did he say
Nothing
What did you say
Didn't you say anything to him
couldn't
Couldn't
Why the hell not
on  who doesn't want to explain - or even remember - as we cut to: : -
He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men, by Three white Men
The bit jerks his head back, saliva spills uncontrollably out of his mouth
His hands are chained behind him
His feet chained together at the ankles
Another chain is connected to an iron belt and stretches to a wagon
He is being lead away with forty five other prisoners
() tried to kill Brandywine - man Schoolteacher sold me to
Don't know what possessed me
Me and about 45 other prisoners were being walked from Kentucky to Virginia
then on to Georgia
Two places  don't ever want to see again
He is lead past the milk shed, when he sees: , alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting by the butter churn
' He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands
The White Men laugh
Paul is aching to scream out to him but the iron bit holds down his tongue
As Paul is lead past Halle,   named  is in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee
Look at Mister there
(referring to the rooster) You go tell these niggers where to go there Mister
Crow'em right outta here
Mister crows and the white men laugh
Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Paul's face
He struggles to keep a view of Halle, until he is out of sight
-
Paul approaches Sethe, touching her gently
didn't mean to tell you that
didn't plan on hearing it
can't take it back but  can leave it alone
Sethe, instead of collapsing from the information, she seems hardened
Let's do that
let's leave it alone now
(more to herself) Let it alone
Just sit down and leave it be
Yeah that would be nice
Would be even nicer to lose it altogether - if had my choice
Halle did
Other people's brains stopped, went crazy
How sweet that would have been
Me and Halle squatting by that churn, smashing cold lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in the world
Sethe, don't do this
What a relief to just stop it all right there, huh
Close it shut
Squeeze that butter
But  had three children on their way to Ohio and nothing would have changed that
And you tell me he didn't leave me
Sethe exits
Paul is left alone on the porch until Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in pursuit
As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks; Guess she's feeling better, huh
Denver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues after Beloved
The two girls run towards the woods
-
Beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon
Denver is an attentive, grateful audience
Where'd you learn to dance
Nowhere
Look at me do this
She puts her fists on her hips and skips
Now you
Come on
Come on
She takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder
As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's attention
They spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled
Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks; Why you call yourself Beloved
In the dark my name is Beloved
What's it like where you were before
(a thoughtful expression) Dark
'm small in that place
'm like this here
Were you cold
Hot
Nothing to breathe there
No room to move
How did you get here
wait; then  got on the bridge
stay there in the dark, in the daytime, in the dark in the daytime
Long time
All this time you were on the bridge
No
After
When  got out
Why'd you come here
To see her face
Ma'am's
Sethe's
Yes
Sethe
And with that, Denver takes a breath of courage to ask the question she's been longing to ask: You my sister, ain't you
You really are
Beloved looks at her and smiles
They are so close she leans in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the lips
You won't leave us, will you
No
Never
This is where  am
knew it
knew
First time  saw you and you said your name
And when you touched me - real gentle
And familiar
Like 'd felt that touch before
Smiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly, Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved; Don't tell mama
You musn't tell her who you really are
don't know what she'd do
Please, you hear
Suddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as well; Don't tell me what to do
Don't never tell me what to do
But
but 'm on your side
want to protect you
(stands above Denver) She's the one
She's the one  need
You can go but she's the one  have to have
Beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the boxwood bush room as Denver's pleads; No
Beloved please
Don't go
didn't do nothing
We were dancing
Don't go
' & '  -
The room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising outside
Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start
She senses something
She rises and looks out the window to see; ; Beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as Denver awakens just in time to see her go
Sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through the woods with a specific destination in mind
Soon, she comes upon; -
Sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pew's of grass and weeds
Sethe remembers the place as it was
She hears the a gathering of people though the clearing remains empty
She crosses to the rock and sits
Camera moves up to reveal - : , vital and strong, standing on the rock, preaching: 'm not here to tell you all to clean up your lives and sin no more
'm not here to tell you we're the blessed meek and are glorybound
'm here to tell you that the only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine
And if you cannot see it, then you shall not have it
on  as she remembers Baby Suggs words, sitting alone in the clearing - the images of the past gone
-
Beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place
Camera moves beyond her to find; Denver, having followed Beloved, watches her from a distance
-
Sethe remembers Baby Suggs advice: (
) God lead you home
So now, lay'em down, child
Sword and shield
Don't study war no more
Lay all that mess down
Sword and shield
Lay'em down
sword and shield
Sethe weeps
She slides to the ground and holds her head to weep
She covers her head from God and cries memories she can no longer fight from coming; : ' ; -
only here, her back is exposed and she is being beaten by the Schoolteacher's boys
The    never stops with the whip for a second as he rants; ' '
They beat her mercilessly
-
Sethe, tear stained, bloody and very pregnant fights her way through a corn field as she makes her escape
Her dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and bleeding
Her feet already swollen and blistered
She is in agonizing pain
She moves like a figure in a nightmare
: , : -
Sethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions have started and the pain is unbearable
Her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body
Her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock
On her back, the tree is starting to form
She lays there waiting for death
Until a  : () Sethe can not answer as she hears   moving through the field
She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her
with arms like cane stalks and enough hair for five heads steps through into view
Look there
nigger
If that don't beat all
Sethe can not speak for fear
Man, you 'bout the scariest looking something  ever seen
What you doing back up here
Sethe manages to control her breath and push out the word; Running
Amy looks at Sethe's swollen, bloody flesh at the end of her legs
Them the feet you running on
My Jesus my
(semi-delerious) Am  in Ohio
Ohio
Fool girl - you in Kentucky
You 'bout a thousand miles from Ohio
(murmurs to herself) 'm still in Kentucky
You got anything on you, gal, pass for food
No, ma'am
like to die 'm so hungry
Thought there might be huckleberries
That's why come up here
You having a baby
expect this baby ma'am is gonna die in these wild onions
Amy doesn't know what to do with that information
So
Well,  got to eat something
Any stands and looks as if she's about to leave when Sethe, feeling the girl is safe, stops her with a question
Where you on your way to, miss
(eager to tell) Boston
Get me some velvet
It's a store called Wilson
seen pictures and they have the prettiest velvet
Boston - is that far
Farther than Ohio
Must be velvet closer by
Not like in Boston
Be so pretty on me
You ever touch velvet
Or even seen it
If  did,  didn't know it
What's it like
Sethe desperately wants her to stay - to not be alone
Amy kneels back down to her, curious now; What they call you
(lies) Lu
What you gonna do, just lay there and foal
can't get up
What
can't get up
Amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe
There's a house back yonder
Well, not a house with people in it - more like a lean-to near the river
How far
Make a difference, does it
You stay here, snake might get you
Well, he may come but  can't stand up, let alone walk
and God help me,  can't crawl
Sure you can Lu
come on
Amy helps Sethe turn over onto all fours
-
Amy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking moments to stop and let the pain go through her
Come on Lu
You got to move faster than that
You won't get to Ohio til you ninety years old, you keep moving that ways
- -
Amy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks for her to put up her feet
She talks non-stop as she works
Never know it to look at me but  used to be a good size
Nice arms, everything
That was before they put me in the root cellar
She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the rocks
Mama worked for these people here to pay for her passage but then she had me and died right after so  had to work for'em
was fishing off the Beaver once and a nigger floated right by me don't like drowned people, do you
Your feet remind me of him
All swole like
Amy props Sethe up from behind when she notices You all bloody back here
Gal you a mess
Undo your dress - let me see
Sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as Amy undoes her dress; Lord,  ain't never seen a poorer excuse for a- Amy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless
Then: Jesus
It's a tree Lu
chokecherry tree
had me some whippings but  don't remember nothing like this
Glad  ain't you
what God have in mind  wonder
You thank your Maker  come along
Spiderwebs all  can do for you
What's in here ain't enough
'll look outside
Maybe  ought to break them blossoms open and let the pus run
(rises) (smiles) That you ain't dead yet Lu's a miracle
Make you a bet
You make it through the night, you make it all the way
- -
To Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs the pain of which causes Sethe to cry
It's gonna hurt now
Anything dead coming back to life hurts
Stop wiggling, girl
(sings) " ; ; ' " (talks) Don't up and die on me in the night, you hear me Lu
don't want to see your ugly face hankering over me
If you do die, just go on off somewhere where  can't see you, hear
'll do what  can, miss
Amy continues singing
-
Sethe is trying to walk, holding on to Amy at first, then a tree
Cause of me, you up and walking
See, Jesus - Lu made it through
'm good at sick things, ain't
Yeah, you good
What's that all over your dress
Milk
Got to get my milk to my baby girl
You got another baby waiting for you
(stops and touches belly) think this one is dead
Amy doesn't know what to say, so she says: You hungry
Sethe keeps trying to walk; ain't nothing but in a hurry, miss
Got to meet someone
help bring me and my milk to my baby girl
You want shoes
Say what
figured how
: Amy cutting two pieces form Sethe shawl then filling them with leaves and tying them over her feet - : -
Sethe and Amy walk towards the river when then see: ,   with oars
Jesus looking at you, girl
Sethe can't believe her eyes
She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins
She doubles up in pain; What you doing that for
Ain't you got a brain in your head
Stop that right now
said stop it, Lu
You the dumbest thing on this here earth,
Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up
Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her waist
Amy takes her position to assist
Oh Jesus, 'm awful sorry 'bout the braggin
need you here now
Come on Jesus
don't be getting lost on me now
Sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through
Amy curses; Damn daddies never around 'cept for the fun part
Biggest joke God made on woman was giving men the planters 'stead of the soil
(gasping) Amy's strong hands pull Denver's head out and up, to meet Sethe's eyes
Sethe cannot believe this creature made it through
Amy rinses it with water then, wrapping it in her skirt, holds it up to Sethe
My Lord
She's never gonna know who am
You gonna tell her
Who brought her into this world
You better tell her, you hear
You say
Of Boston
That's pretty
Denver
Real pretty
-
Sethe awakens, mud-caked, on the banks of the river
Her baby girl crying beside her
Amy is gone
She rises, painfully, picks up her child and continues on her way
: -      ,    - - : -   -
thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river
Sethe is sitting beneath the oak - the rain soaking her as she breast feeds her baby
She cries out loud - but her sobs and tears are lost in the rain and thunder
-
Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest
She stops when she sees: gliding down river
She can't make out if they're white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it passes; Waiting behind the tree, we see that Sethe is sweating a fever
But Denver seems to be doing fine
She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way
She sees; -    and two boys - fishing
She approaches cautiously
One of the boys is the first to see her
Sethe's bloody and torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to the young boy
He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and motions for him to turn around
The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where she's been and why she's there
Headin cross
Yes sir
Anybody know you coming
Yes sir
My mother-in-law over in
Stamp Paid raises his hand to stop her
He looks around to see that no one else is in sight, then motions for her to sit on a rock
As she does, he gets a water jug and hands it to her - she drinks like a madman in the desert
The Boys watch in fascination
Stamp Paid turns to one of them and says: Take off that coat
Why
You heard me
The Boy slips out of his jacket, complaining
What am  gonna wear
You want it back
He unties the baby from Sethe and wraps it in the coat
then you go head and take it off this baby
And if you can do that, then go 'way somewhere and don't come back
-
On a flatbed, Stamp Paid crosses the river with Sethe, her baby and the two boys
-
Stamp Paid helps Sethe walk up a very steep bank while the Boy without a jacket, carries the baby who wears it
-  -
Stamp Paid leads Sethe and the others into the hutch
Wait here
Somebody be here directly
Don't move
They'll find you
Thank you
What's your name - so  can remember you right
Name's Stamp
Stamp Paid
Watch out for that baby, you hear
She nods as he and the boys exit
: -  : Sethe is asleep with the baby when  enters the hutch; Saw the sign a while ago but  couldn't get here no quicker
What sign
Stamp always leave the old sty open when there's a crossing
Knots a white rag on the post if it's a child too
(kneels) My name's Ella
Where you headed
Ella empties a sack with a wool blanket, cotton cloth, two baked sweet potatoes and a pair of men's shoes
My mother-in-law's
Name's Baby Suggs
She got my other three children  sent ahead
When was this one born
Yesterday
hope she makes it
Hard to say
(gives her men's shoes) Let's try to get these on your feet
124   -
Baby Suggs rises off the bench on the porch when she sees Sethe coming up the walk
She runs to her and embraces Sethe and the baby, tears in her eyes
Oh my Lord
My sweet Lord thank you
Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house, kissing her hard on the lips
Sethe can't believe she's in her arms
Where's Halle
Sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion
He wasn't there
flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism
Well, he be along presently, 'm sure
Where are the children
Not now
You too ugly looking to wake 'em up in the night
First we get you well
-
Baby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face, her body
hands, arms, legs
When she gets to her unrecognizable feet, she touches them
You feel this
Feel what
Nothing
Baby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethe's back
She looks and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping
Girl
-
Baby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethe's back - greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the inside of a newly stitched dress
-
Sethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds dressed waits for her children
Baby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in
Sethe welcomes them to her arms
They run to her, jumping on the bed
The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesn't care
The Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her mama
Already crawling - ain't that somethin
Come on, baby girl
right this way
Mama's waiting
Sethe picks her up and the tears flow
She can't stop kissing them - their necks, their heads, their hands
The Boys inspect her strange looking feet and ask; Pappie come
Soon
Baby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the children
All right boys - mama's home now, you be seeing her all the time
Go downstairs and get your supper
Go on
Sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk downstairs and be with them
The Boys leave as Sethe cradles the Little Girl
Sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her breast to the Little Girl
She winces with pain and smiles - she got her milk to her baby girl
Baby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived
Nothing worth saving here
Oh wait
Look and see if there's something knotted up in the petticoat
Wedding present
From Mrs
Garner
Baby Suggs finds
Be nice if there was a groom to go with it
What do you think happened to him
don't know
He wasn't where he said to meet him at
had to get out
had to
He'll make it
if  made it, Halle sure can
(skeptical) Well put these on - maybe they'll light his way
As Sethe takes the earrings, the Little Baby Girl reaches for them
Through her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine - like diamonds
Baby Suggs hands gently massage Sethe's neck as she says; Whatever happens now
God lead you home
So now lay'em down Sethe
Sword and shield
Don't study war no more
Lay all that mess down
Sword and shield
Sethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm, safe hands - letting go of the "diamonds", one of which lands in the hands of the Little Girl
who plays with them in fascination
: ; - Sethe is remembering these last images, she eases her own hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did
She realizes how much she misses her
and wonder who can touch her now and help her "lay it all down"
And then, quite suddenly; ; - ' Paul
There is Paul
Sethe realizes, as ' : -
-
-
-    '
Sethe rises from the ground, as if with a new realization
She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods, her pace increasing with each image
-
Sethe walks through the woods, passing Beloved unawares - who has fallen asleep by a tree
Beloved is awakened as Sethe walks by, and gets to her feet to follow
Further on, Sethe passes a sleeping Denver, who also awakens upon hearing the footsteps of her mother, followed by Beloved
Sethe walks on, unaware of them following her
124  -
Wide angle of Sethe walking well ahead of Beloved and Denver
Sethe is walking with great purpose and energy
124   -
Sethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen; Paul
Paul, you home
Paul sits in a tub under the white staircase
He smiles
Sethe is relieved
grateful to find him there, for her
Where else would  be on a Sunday off
Sethe smiles, almost in tears
Why don't you come on in here
Paul
What if the girls came in
don't hear nobody
have to cook
Paul
stands up in the tub and holds Sethe against his wet, naked body
What you gonna cook
(loving his body and his attention) thought 'd make some snap beans
Oh yeah
Fry up a little corn
Yeah
He kisses her - and that's exactly what she wanted
Oh Paul
'm right here baby
Thank you Lord
Camera slowly moves out of the kitchen as Sethe and Paul begin to make love, revealing; Beloved watching from the doorway, unknown to Sethe or Paul
She is disgusted, envious
and runs out
124   -
Beloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods
She passes Denver as if she weren't there
-
Beloved reaches the stream and steps in
She begins to violently hit the water around her, then begins hitting her own face and head, clawing at it as if to escape from the boundaries of flesh
Suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself
She bursts out of the water, gasping for air
Slowly, her rage subsides, replaced with a calm, ruthless understanding 124
-
Beloved is walking back toward the house
She stops
She looks back at the house to the kitchen window - knowing Paul and Sethe are in there
She approaches the kitchen window and looks in
- Sethe is drying off Paul's body and rebuttoning her dress
Camera moves slowly into a
of Beloved, this time her focus is on Paul
124   -
The inhabitants eat dinner in silence
Denver awaits a look from Beloved
As Beloved passes her a bowl of peas with a smile, Denver is satisfied
Beloved then turns to Paul, offering him the bowl
You have brothers or sisters
Caught off guard, Paul looks to Sethe - whose expression asks him to be nice
We don't talk about that
Beat
Sethe told us you been walking for eighteen years
Where you been all that time
Paul is about to get mad when he looks to Sethe again, reels it back in and answers curtly, but politely; Lots of places
don't remember them all
Don't remember much about anything
You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking
Hearing his own words echoed back to him, annoys him
Well not me
What's gone is gone
No good come from bringing it back
Pause
Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease
He can't help looking, covertly, at Beloved and finds Beloved staring right back at him
It makes him shiver
'  -
Sethe is asleep
Paul is restless - tossing and turning as we Intercut; Dream Images flashing across his mind
- '
-
-
crotch
() Paul awakens
-
Sethe enters to find Paul asleep in the rocker by the stove
She stirs him
Paul
Paul
(waking up) Mmmm
What
called you two or three times but gave up round midnight
thought maybe you went out somewhere
Damn
'm sorry honey
'll make some breakfast - you get yourself washed up
Sethe begins to make breakfast as Beloved enters the kitchen and sees Paul has slept in the rocker
She looks at him with a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on
Paul registers the look
-
Paul is asleep in the rocker
He is restless
: -
Paul is chained by the ankles to forty-five other men
He hands are shackled
In his mouth, an iron bit
The men are being led by   with rifles
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; One thousand feet long
Five feet deep
Five feet wide
Camera tilts down to reveal, within the trench; , with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves
-
Paul awakens
his face and body drenched in sweat
124    -
Paul
walks across the field with a thin blanket over his nightclothes - walking toward the storeroom
In the window of her bedroom, Sethe watches him - sensing he is moving further and further away from her
In the window of Denver's room, Beloved watches Paul as well - with a pleased expression
: ' ; -
; Hiiiiiii
-
Three white Men walk along the trench unlocking the cage doors one by one
One by one, the Black men emerge and stand in a line in the trench
When all are assembled,     signals them to climb out of the trench to the ground above
Waiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of chain
Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to the second and so on
As they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the line of men and while not a word is spoken, thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through their eyes to the man beside them: () 'm a make it
() New man
New man
() Steady now, steady
() Help me
this mornin's bad
: The White Guards walk passed them
one White Guard stops in front of the man beside Paul
He turns to him
Breakfast
Want some breakfast nigger
Yes sir
Hungry nigger
Yes sir
Here you go
The White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves a step closer to the Black Man's mouth
Paul
looks ahead, trembling
He vomits
The Guard steps away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder with a rifle
-
The Black Men work
sledge hammers in hand
As they work, miraculously,
"They sing about the women they knew, the children they had been
they sing of bosses and masters and misses
of mules and dogs and the shamelessness of life
They sing of sisters long gone
They sing love songs to Death
" -
torrential downpour
The men in the wooden cages watch the rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around them
Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet
Mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof
Some finds rest
other's minds are long gone
Camera finds Paul
But there is no sound coming from his mouth
Tears flow down his face, but when he touches them, he realizes; They are tears of mud
He looks up and the wooden planked roof is breaking under the power of the rain
He looks down and the water is up to his thighs
Suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is knocked down
He gets up, searches through the mud for the chain and notices it's slack
He pulls as well
One by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been locked
It is giving way within the muddy wall
; , ,        - before mud and water drown them
Paul climbs with the will of ten men, with every ounce of strength he has left
of
: -
Paul
is wide awake
The memories won't let him sleep
Winter has arrived and the night is cold
He lies underneath a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place, even further from the house
He adds newspapers under and around his body to stay warm
He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether
He hears the door to the cold room open
But he does not turn to look
What do you want in here
Beloved enters the cold room
want you to touch me on the inside part and call me my name
She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away
Paul stares at a silver lard can so as not to look
When good people take you in and treat you good, you ought to try to be good back
You don't
Sethe loves you
Much as her own daughter
You know that
(drops her skirt) She don't love me like  love her don't love nobody but her
Then what you come in here for
want you to touch me on the inside part
Ever since you come here - feel like got a new devil to face
You have to touch me
On the inside part
And you have to call me my name
Ain't no chains on me no more
don't have to do nothing
Now, go back in that house and go to bed
Paul continues to stare at the lard can - like Lot's wife, he's fearful what turning to look will do
Call me my name
Beloved moves closer, right up behind him, entwining her arms around his body, like chains
No
Ain't no chains on me
Call me
Ain't no chains on me
'll go if you say it
Tears well up in his eyes
Paul can feel her warmth
He surrenders
Beloved
Beloved presses her body against his
He turns and grabs her, kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred
-
Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the sounds of lovemaking
And cries
-
Sethe, Denver, Paul and Beloved eat dinner
in silence
-
Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished
Beloved gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even friendliness
Just a cold look, void of respect or even attraction
She exits the cold house, leaving Paul alone
He is on the verge of tears
'  -
Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him mad
He wants to touch her, to wake her, to ask for forgiveness and help
But he can not and buries his head in his hands
-
Paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and breathing inside to keep them warm
He is rehearsing: Look here Sethe
You ain't gonna like what  got to say but  got to say it
See, it's not the
a man can't
what  mean is, it ain't really me
see, it ain't weakness, the kind of weakness  can fight, that girl is doing it
know you think  never liked her nohow, still don't, but she is doing it to me anyway
Fixing me, Sethe, she's fixed me and  can't break it
Sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a scrap pan in the crook of her arm
To her surprise
she finds Paul waiting for her
Man, you make me feel like a young girl, you coming by to pick me up after work
Nobody ever did that before
Better watch out,  might start looking forward to it
She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment
Got to rinse this out
She enters the restaurant
Paul watches the dogs eat - watching them getting what they wanted
Sethe re-appears with a cloth over her head
You get off early or what
took off early
Anything the matter
In a way of speaking
Not cut back
No, no
They got plenty of work with them pigs
More they can handle
just
(Sethe waits) You ain't gonna like what 'm about to say, Sethe
Sethe steps forward to hear what Paul came to tell her
There is no apprehension or anger in her look
Instead, a calm resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he had to tell her without it being anyone's fault
As if she already knew he cane to say he was leaving her
She smiles
Well say it, Paul
whether  like it or not
Paul knows what she's expecting
And when he sees her diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her eyes
he can't tell her about Beloved
He is filled with respect and admiration for her in that moment
Something pops into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned; want you pregnant, Sethe
Would you do that for me
Sethe breaks up with laughter
Paul joins in
You came by here to ask me that
You are one crazy-headed man
You right;  don't like it
Don't you think 'm a little too old to start that all over again
She slips her fingers into his
Think about it
Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his cheek
He smiles broadly; She laughs, shaking her head
burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly
They begin walking
Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers, stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully
Paul throws his arm around Sethe and squeezes
She lets her head touch his chest
They stop and stay that way for a moment - not breathing
Sethe closes her eyes
Paul looks up to the trees lining the roadside like defending arms against attack
Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow
Sethe opens her eyes: Mercy
-
On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand
Snow falling all around them
been on my feet all day, Paul
Where  been
Sitting down
Stop
don't have the legs for this
They slow to a walk
Then give'em to me
Before she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his shoulders
You need some babies
somebody to play with in the snow
sure would like to give it a try
Need a willing partner though
'll say
Very, very willing
They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when they are jolted by the appearance of; Beloved
Waiting in her usual place for Sethe
Her hands wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe
Her eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence
Sethe gets herself down from Paul
Crazy girl
You out here with nothing on
She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around her shoulders
You got to learn more sense than that
She walks on ahead with Beloved
Paul, suddenly icy cold and filled with anger, walks behind
124   -
Denver waits on the porch
Sethe and Beloved walk by her
Evening, girl
Sethe and Beloved enter the house
As Paul approaches, he stops before Denver
Their eyes meet
Paul stares at her, as if to ask - "Who's ally are you
"
Denver, unnerved by his look, runs into the house
Paul waits on the porch until, a moment later, Sethe re-appears
Now  know you not sleeping out there tonight, are you Paul
(Paul doesn't reply) You come upstairs tonight
Where you belong
and stay there
As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief
-
Denver is cleaning the dishes
Beloved sits like an angry, upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth
She likes him here
(to Denver) Make him go away
She'd be mad if he leaves
Beloved didn't consider that
Her fingers move violently in her mouth as if something were bothering her
until, finally, she pulls out a back tooth
her lips slightly bloody
OOoo
didn't that hurt you
It's like my dreams
get two dreams, see
One,  exploding
The other  being swallowed
Sometimes it's hard to keep my head on my neck, or these legs connected to my hips
One day think  might wake up and 'll be in pieces
(Looks at tooth) Maybe it's starting
(cleans Beloved's mouth) Oh stop
It's just a tooth
Probably wisdom
Does it hurt
Yes
Then why don't you cry
What
If it hurts, why don't you cry
Beloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries
124 -
We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up
'  -
Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the ceiling
Paul is asleep
On her face are reservations
She rises, crossing to the window to look out
At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad
She walks by without Sethe noticing her
Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall
Then, as she moves back to the bed,
Camera moves ahead of her to: ; & '     -
Sethe, Halle and the baby girl (Beloved) sleep together by the wall
The boys sleep together under a window
Halle is trying to sleep but Sethe is awake
What you think about Schoolteacher
He white, ain't he
mean, is he different like Mr
Garner was
How was he different
Well, he and Mrs
Garner - they ain't like other whites  seen before
Mr
Garner always spoke soft, for one
Mrs
Garner too
Don't matter
Loud or soft, what they say is the same
Mr
Garner let you buy out your mother
Found that house for her to live in from those friends of his in Ohio
Yep
He did
Well
If he hadn't, she would have dropped in his cooking stove
Still, he did it
Let you work off her fee, lending yourself out on Sundays
He could of said no
He didn't tell you no
No, he didn't tell me no
She worked here ten years
If she worked another ten, ya think she would have made it
pay him for her last years and in return he got you, me and three more coming
He always treated you fair
Called you all men - said he never wanted niggers on his farm
That's just it
We was men because he said so
We was men because we was on his land
You think he be calling us men if we ever walked off his land
When we walk, don't matter what they call you
You'll be free
Sethe
baby girl, that ain't gonna happen
Not by walking, anyway
What you mean
Schoolteacher in there told me to quit lending myself out
That phrase "
while the boys is small"
causes Sethe to look at her sleeping boys
But
then
how you gonna buy yourself out
Or them
(points to the children) Or me
Halle raises himself up to face her, to give her the final blow
Ain't gonna be no buying us out, like did with mama
Or them
As far as Schoolteacher concerned, ain't no other life ahead for any of us but this one
Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is frightened
Halle
what we going to do
(whispers) Sixo, ya know he creeps out at night
he says the way they took my ma'am
he says freedom is that way
He and Paul
got a plan
They heard of this man, what they call an underground agent
if we do what he says, don't need no buy out
You mean
But what if we caught
What'd they do to us
To the children
Same thing they're doing now, honey - only quicker
-
Sethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and Bulgar run ahead of her
She turns in the opposite direction and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of the kitchen
She passes the open window of the classroom and hears; () Which one are you doing
() Sethe
Hearing her name, Sethe stops and peeks through the window
Schoolteacher is standing over the student, who has been writing in a notebook
Schoolteacher licks his finger and thumbs a couple of pages before saying; No, no
That's not the way
told you to put her human characteristics on the left; her animal ones on the right
And don't forget to line them up
Although Sethe doesn't entirely understand, something about the words disturb her
She looks to her children
'  -
Mrs
Garner is sick in bed with a goiter
Sethe enters with some soup
don't think  can swallow that
Too thick
'm sure it's too thick
Want me to loosen it up with a little water
No
Take it away
Bring me some cool water, that's all
Yes ma'am
Sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water
Yes, you can have quite a few
(drinks) Mmmm
Thank you Sethe
Now tell me, know Halle's no trouble but the others, the Pauls and Sixo - how's my brother-in- law handling them
All right
Yes Ma'am
Look like it
They do what he tells them
They don't need telling
Good
That's a mercy
know he's no Mr
Garner
But after he died,  had no else to turn to
would've had to sell one
It wasn't even enough selling Paul
And in my condition
needed help
People said  shouldn't be alone here with nothing but Negroes
And he is a learned man being a schoolteacher
As Sethe fills Mrs
Garner's basin with fresh water, she looks out the window and sees: outside with his students, we notice as Mrs
Garners description continues; know his ways might be a little more strict but as long as the men do as they're told 'm sure it'll be fine
All right, 'm through
Talking makes me tired
Yes ma'am
-
Sethe lies beaten and raped, her clothes torn, her body aching and sweaty
She struggles to get to her feet and exit the barn
'   -
Sethe opens the door to find her children asleep
She is about to wake them when; She notices Mrs
Garner's light is on in her bedroom window
Sethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do before she takes her children to the meeting place
'  -
Mrs
Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her bedroom door opens
Sethe enters - her appearance tells all
My God Sethe
what happened to you
-
Sethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the hand with the other
They move as fast as they can
-
They arrive at the meeting place where   crouching in the field is waiting
Hurry up
You're late
(hands her the children) Here
But ma'am
Just go with her
Do what  tell ya
Sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman
Put sugar water on that cloth for her to suck so she won't forget me til  come
Where you going
Halle wasn't there
gotta go back
You crazy
Take em out
Now
'll get there myself
got her milk
'll get there
Don't worry
She kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking her
along with the boys
Go
Go
Now
Sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman holding the baby girl
as Bulgar cries out
Mama
-
Sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters when suddenly; appears from out of nowhere
two restraining her, one holding a horsewhip
You nigger bastard
Sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be beaten
; '  -
Sethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and reliving her past nightmare
She sits up and realizes where she is
She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep
She lays down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space between - enfolding her arms around him
-
Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse
Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb from the cold - Paul
is in high spirits
as he works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers
- 1 Hey - you like this work so much maybe you best get in the chute with the others
You ain't got much more sense than they do
The men laugh
Paul smiles and brushes it off
Ain't just a job reason to sing
Other things a man's got to look forward to that a job just a way to spend your day til the good times arrive
- 2 Good times
Ain't no such day
Now, now
it's all a state a mind, right Paul
If you can think it, it can happen
More than that
When a man can make plans then a man can make good times happen
- 1 Oh the man's got plans
You saving up for a gold mine, boy
(more laughter) Better then gold, my friend
Me and my woman's planning on starting a family
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern
New life
Born free, hear
Now if that don't define a good tine,  don't know what does
- 2 Nothing born free ever again
What you talkin
Nobody owns us no more
Nobody gonna own my children neither
- 2 Children inherit what come before'em
Just cause you can't see no chains, don't mean they not there
We're not free men
We're somewhere between freedom and chains
And as long as the world is white, that's where we're stayin
The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they continue working
Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what he should do
-
The men are on break
Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed by Sethe
Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him
May
Free country
No matter what anybody says
like the way you think, boy
Good
Good to think that way
Friend of mine, Baby Suggs was her name
sort of became a preacher in these parts
that was her way of thinking too
When she was at her best, that is
You knew Baby Suggs
Oh yes
You're not one of her Sweet Home men, now are you
Yes sir
Me and my brothers and her son
Oh,  see now
Sethe told me she died soft as cream
Well
maybe on the outside
Why is that
Stamp Paid looks at him with sympathetic, sudden understanding
You don't know, son, do you
See  had to figure that out first
Know what
Stamp Paid pulls out     from a bag he carries with him all the time
He hands it to Paul who looks to see: beneath a ;
Who is it
That there's a picture of Sethe
Sethe
(studies it) Nah, that ain't her mouth
can see where you might think it around the eyes but that there ain't her mouth
Besides, why would some black woman's picture be in the paper
You don't read son, do you
(Paul shakes head ) You want me to read to you
Paul senses something terribly wrong
and doesn't know whether to say yes or no
124

Sethe is sweeping the porch
Paul appears on the road
When he sees Sethe on the porch in the distance, he stops
Sethe sees him and smiles - but something about his slow approach to the house sends off an alarm within her
Paul makes his way to the porch
He stops before her
Already fed the girls
You eat
(he shakes ) Want something
Paul doesn't answer
Instead, he steps up to her as he removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her
Sethe's heart stops beating for a moment - not having seen this image for many years
But she's survived worse than the telling so she faces him
Best you come inside
She rises and enters the house
Paul follows
-
Paul sits at the table
Sethe begins her story seated before him
don't have to tell you about Sweet Home
What it was
But maybe you don't know what it was like for me to get away from there
She looks for a response but expects none
did it
got us all out
Without Halle too
Up til then it was the only thing ever did on my own
Decided
And it came off right like it was supposed to
She rises and begins to move about the room, circling Paul as she tries to find a way to explain it all; We was here
Each and every one of my babies and me too
birthed them and got 'em out and it wasn't no accident did that
had help, of course, lots of that, but still it was me doing it; me saying, "Go on" and "Now
"
Me having to look out
Me using my own head
But it was more than that
It was a kind of 'thinking-about-myself'  never knew nothing about before
It felt good
Good and right
was big, Paul, and deep and wide and when  stretched out my arms all my children could get in between
was that wide
Look like  loved them more after  got them here
Or maybe couldn't love'em proper in Sweet Home 'cause they wasn't mine to love
But when got here, when  jumped off that wagon - there wasn't nobody in the world couldn't love if  wanted to
: as  : () had 28 days
28 good days of free life
'   124 -
Sethe, out of habit, is awake before the sun has risen
She is fully dressed
() of getting up like  always did, getting dressed before the sun came out, and then realizing  had to decide myself what to do with the day
She sits on the bed, watching the sun rise
'  -
Sethe watches her children sleeping, safely
() Days of watching my children sleep away the morning
And taking care of my baby like it was the most important thing had to do
Denver is asleep in a bassinet
Sethe reaches in and picks her up
She sits by a window and breast feeds her as she hums (This is the same melody we heard Sethe humming in the beginning of the film)
Sethe's melody carries itself over the following images; 124  ;   -
Sethe is carrying a bucket of water to the house
She sees: Bulgar and Howard running and playing
Howard tackles his brother and starts tickling him
The two boys laugh hard
Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face; () 'd hear my boys laughing a laugh  ain't never heard
And for a second 'd get scared - scared someone might hear them and get mad
Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket: () Then  remembered
and if they laughed that hard til it hurt, that would be the only hurt they had all day
Sethe sobs, uncontrollably
124
-
Ella teaches Sethe a new stitch as she chatters on
() We had us days of company
-
Another woman teaches Sethe the alphabet, as Sethe cradles Denver and the Little Girl (Beloved) crawls around her feet
-
Baby Suggs and Sethe cook with a kitchen full of men and women who have come for a visit
() of ease and real talk
Talks about the Fugitive Bill, Dred Scott or book learning
Talks as quiet or as stormy as we wanted
Two men get into an argument to the amusement of the women
-
As folks gather to hear Baby Suggs preach, she introduces a smiling, shy Sethe to each one
() And when everyone would gather to hear Baby Suggs,  saw something  ain't never seen before in my whole life
Alone for a moment, Sethe looks around at the crowd of faces; Sethe's Melody stops as Baby Suggs stands on her rock and calls to the crowd: Let the children come
,
Camera follows the joyous exodus to reveal: the entire black community of the days when Sethe first arrived
The children run to their respective families; (with joy) Let your mother's hear you laugh
The children, loving the game, laugh hard
The adults get a kick out of it
Sethe watches her boys and hides her laughter
Let the grown men come
,
The men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them with a clapping rhythm
arises from the women to accompany to dance
Now
you women
want you to cry
For the living
For the dead
Just cry
Camera follows those women who are not singing as one by one, they remember and weep
Sethe watches
and weeps
Something in me knew Halle was never gonna knock on our door
He was never gonna see what  saw that day
saw what men look like
and  saw mothers, for the first time
124

Stamp Paid walks up to the porch carrying a his body dirty, scratched and bleeding
() think it was Stamp Paid who started it
He walked six miles to the riverbank, slid into a ravine, reached through blood drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes, wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the State just to bring us those berries
He places the baskets on the porch in front of Baby Suggs, Sethe who is holding Denver
and the Little Girl (Beloved)
(laughs) What a sight you are, Stamp
Worth it though
Just one bite of these berries and you feel down right anointed
He puts one into Denver's mouth
She's too little for that, Stamp
Her bowels be soup
It'll sickify her stomach
Now go wash up round back
crazy fool
Stamp exits
It was real nice of him
He's a good one, no doubt of that
can get three, maybe four pies out of this
Seems a shame just for us though
'm gonna invite Ella and John over
How 'bout if  make a couple of chickens to back it up
() And that's how it began
-
Sethe and Baby Suggs and Ella and several other women cook
() Three pies became twelve
two hens became five turkeys
/124
-
Various images of people gathered enjoying food and drink
laughing and singing
() and Ella and John turned into almost ninety others
- Women serving up the food
- Older men sitting and talking as they eat
- Younger men playing with the children
Chasing them with sheets on their backs, scaring them into laughter
-  Man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing
While Sethe enjoys her free life and, most of all, her children - the boys running around her
Denver in her arms
Her Little Girl (Beloved) by her side
Baby Sugg's visits with various guests, serving up the food
() Everybody ate so well and laughed so much
; Images of whispers exchanged between some of the women: () it made them angry
Women head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval towards Baby Suggs as she continues cooking and feeding
() The pies, the turkeys
the bread pudding and shortbread
the one whole block of ice brought all the way from Cincinnati - it made 'em mad
Loaves and fishes were Jesus's powers
they did not belong to an ex-slave who never had a white boy beat her, who had her freedom bought, who rented a house from white folks that hated slavery worse than they hated slaves
It made'em furious - her thoughtless generosity and un-called for pride
She had over stepped
offended them by giving too much
and they left their disapproval there so's you could smell in the air the whole next day

Baby Suggs works the field, not far from Stamp Paid
() Later on  wondered why no one warned us
why no one saw them coming and ran to 124 to tell us
She chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants
She stops - sensing something is wrong
She looks up at a clear blue sky
She hears the birds and the stream way down beyond the woods
She looks around and sees Bulgar, Howard and the Little Girl (Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house
She sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver in a bushel basket beside her
The clok, clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over to Stamp Paid, helping out with the axe
She returns to her work
but something is deeply wrong
And then she hears it; and     coming from the distance
(The same sound Sethe heard in her first memory of the sycamores earlier on) She rises up and looks; ; -
Far in the distance,
and      - : 124  -
Sethe continues working until she notices peripherally that Baby Suggs is standing stock still, staring at something
Sethe rises and looks in the same direction; : -
The Four Horsemen are closer
: 125  -
Sethe's face freezes in terror as
Stamp Paid, in between chops, looks up and sees the two women
then turns his face to see the men
'     - and   : () There's a Look whitefolks get
a Look every Negro learns to recognize along with his ma'am's tit
That righteous Look that's like a flag going up the pole
the righteousness that announces the whip, the fist, the burning, the lie
long before it happens in the open
Over the above speech, we see in Sethe's expression a death of soul - an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of joy and life
And with it, an insane rage
Sethe grabs Denver out of the basket, then scrambles after the crawling Little Girl (Beloved), scooping her under her free arm
Howard
Bulgar
The tone of her voice cause the boys to freeze
She runs towards them, grabbing one by the hand and ordering the other to run in front of them
She moves and speaks with efficient clarity
The shed
Get in the shed
Run
Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid watch helplessly - 124  - The Four Horsemen - Schoolteacher, his Nephew, a Slave Catcher and a Sheriff - arrive at the house and dismount, tying their horses to the front gate (which is no longer there)
The Nephew scampers to the front of the house and peers in the window - he listens
Hearing nothing he motions for them to go round the side of the house
Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid standing exactly where we left them
Except; They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange noises, thuds and the     are heard
Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road
The Slave Catcher motions with his rifle for them to stop - and they do
The men move towards the shed, meeting up with the Nephew as he runs past Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid
; Camera moves closer towards the shed, the sounds coning from within more audible now
- The Nephew opens the door
The Four Men enter
Howard and Bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust, unconscious - a bloody shovel lays near them
Sethe is holding a blood-soaked Little Girl (Beloved) to her chest with one hand
and Denver by the heels of the other
She is swinging Denver toward the wall planks, misses then tries again
When out of nowhere, Stamp Paid rushes by the horrified white men and     '  before she can swing her a second time
Stillness
Schoolteacher looks at the carnage
a bloody saw lies at Sethe's feet, the weapon she used on her own child's throat
The Nephew is paralyzed
horrified
What she go and do that for
What she go and do that for
Baby Suggs walks in
Whatever amount of God's grace she could imagine and will into being, vanishes with one look into that shed
You all better go on
(to Schoolteacher) Nothing here to claim,  guess
Look like your business is over
Mine's started
Schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in the shed before exiting, followed by the catcher and the nephew
The Sheriff speaks to Sethe
'll have to take you in
No trouble now
You've done enough to last you
Sethe doesn't move
You come quiet, here, and  won't have to tie you up
Meanwhile, Baby Suggs notices who breathes and who does not and moves straight to the boys
Stamp Paid extends his arm to Sethe
Sethe
You take my arm and gimme yours
Sethe turns to him, the first time she's looked into anyone's eyes and sees Denver in his arms
sound escapes from her throat as though she'd made a mistake
'm going out here and send for a wagon
He exits
Baby Suggs rubs the boys' hands, tries to raise their eyelids, spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as they slowly regain a dazed consciousness
She whispers; beg you pardon
beg your pardon
124
- Sethe, clutching the dead baby to her chest, is led out of the shed by Stamp Paid, Outside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop murmuring the second they see her
Among them are Ella and Lady Jones
They are shocked and pained
Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence
Baby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the porch into the house
When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms, she stops
lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart
Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff
Baby Suggs takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid
She tells the Sheriff
Excuse me
but the child needs nursin
needs the mother's milk
Then she's best come too
Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and reaches for her without letting the baby go
Baby Suggs resists; One at a time
And you gotta clean yourself up
But Sethe only wants her living child
The two women struggle as Stamp Paid does what he can
Finally, Sethe wins and takes Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her with a bloody breast
Baby Suggs breaks inside
Breaks right in two, although from outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock
makes his way through the crowd with a pair of shoes and hands them to her
Mama says Wednesday
She says you got to have them fixed by Wednesday
Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding
You hear, Baby
She says Wednesday
(taking the shoes) beg your pardon
Lord,  beg your pardon
sure do
: (  ) : 124   -
Paul
sits at the kitchen table
The story told
Sethe looks out the window
and waits
Your love is too thick, Sethe
Love is or it isn't
Thin love ain't love at all
did stop him
took and put my babies where they'd be safe
Didn't work though, did it
It worked
How
Your boys gone, you don't know where
One girl dead, the other can't go farther than the yard
How did it work
They ain't at Sweet Home
Schoolteacher ain't got'em
Maybe there's worse
It ain't my job to know what's worse
It's my job to know what is and keep them away from what  know is terrible
did that
What you did was wrong, Sethe
should have gone back there
Taken my babies back there
There could have been a way
Some other way
What way
You got two feet, Sethe
Not four
That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it
Sethe has no response
The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast
Paul rises, playing with his hat
not knowing how to leave
But desperately needing to
He moves to the exit and stops
You can set aside supper for me
Might be late getting back
Unable to look at her, he turns to exit
When Sethe speaks in a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen; After all  told you, Paul
and after telling me how many feet  have, you think saying goodbye is gonna break me into pieces
Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through him
You're a sweet man
Unable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves
Sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers
So long, Paul

Sethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with dry rags
Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates; What do these do
Sethe and Beloved look up
Sethe smiles; My Lord
where'd you dig up those
There for skating on the ice
We have another pair and half of another, think
Can we try them
Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious lightness: Go ice skating
Ha
(beat) Why not
You sure mama
Strikes me that after your man leaves, it might just be the wrong time to be scrubbing floors
might just be the perfect time to go ice skating
Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of Sethe's attitude
Sethe speaks to Denver; Go get the shawls
and find me an old shoe for that half a pair
The girls get excited
Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the pail
-
bright, cold winter day
Beloved wears a pair of old skates
Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate and one shoe
The two girls giggle and fall as they try to skate on the ice
helping each other up
Their skirts whirling
their laughter mingled with screams of delight
Sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs
Come on, ma'am
try
Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly falls on her rear
The girls scream with laughter
Sethe tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as well
The girls try to help her and fall over each other in the trying
Denver rises and tries an independent glide
The tip of her skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly
All three laugh so hard, they start coughing
Beloved goes to Denver's aid
Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air
Beloved helps Denver, and falls as well
The two girls see Sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times
Until, Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop and look
The two glide back to Sethe
Her laughter has stopped, but her tears have not
They gently, comfortingly, touch her shoulder
-
It is a snowy night outside the windows
Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire in the stove
She has made sweet milk that she hands to the girls before taking her place in between them, on the floor, facing the fire; Denver, on her right, rests her head on her lap
Beloved sits on her left
She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire
The illumination highlights her beauty and her profile; the chin, mouth, forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow the fire threw on the wall
Sethe can't help but stare as another thought occurs to her; (
) All  remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread
Her little hands
wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me"
() "Here
Look here
See this mark
If you can't tell me by my face, look here
" Beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she leans back to rest on a propped-up pillow
In the flickering of the firelight, Sethe can see: Sethe knows before she's aware of it consciously
And just as it hits her,
Sethe recognizes it as her own melody
made that song up
made it up and sang it to my children
Denver lifts her head from her mother's lap to look at Sethe, knowing what is happening
Nobody knows that song but me and my children
Beloved turns to Sethe; know it
click
Sethe looks at her daughter, returned
"There is no gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous
For what is truly miraculous is so, because the magic lies in the fact that you knew it was there for you all along
" : ; -
It's snowy white outside
The girls are still asleep in front of the stove
But Denver awakens upon hearing her mother load the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast
Sethe hears her wake up and turns, as she beats eggs in a bowl; Back stiff
OOh, yeah
Don't know if it's the floor or the skating
Could be that fall you took
That was fun
Beloved snores lightly beside her; Should  wake her
No, let her rest
She likes to see you off in the morning
'll make sure she does
But first 'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside
Won't you be late for work
Don't matter
First time 'll be late in nine years
No great trouble
Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time
don't matter
(looks at the girls) The world is in this room, baby
This is all there is and all there needs to be
Denver smiles - but it is a cautious smile
Something about her mother's statement both elates and disturbs her
-
conflicted and contrite Stamp Paid walks through the snow down Bluestone road towards 124
As he does, he remembers his last conversation with Baby Suggs; : -
fall day
Leaves ankle high
Stamp Paid is walking when he sees baby Suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes
He crosses over to her as he gets her attention; You missed the Clearing meeting three Saturdays running
Baby Suggs turns to her old friend - but there is no sign of welcome or recognition
There is a noticeable change in her demeanor
She continues walking
He follows; Folks came
Folks come
Folks go
Here, let me carry that
He reaches for the carpetbag but Baby Suggs pulls it away
got a delivery around here
Name of Tucker
(points) Yonder
Twin chestnuts in the yard
They walk a bit, until; Well
Well what
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what
If  call them, and they come what on earth am  going to say to them
Say the Word
Two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp Paid's voice, which was too loud
So he whispers; The Word
What you was put here to speak
That's the last thing they took from me
But you got to do it
You got to
Can't nobody Call like you
You have to be there
What  have to do is get in my bed and lay down
want to fix on something harmless in this world
What world are you talking about
Ain't nothing harmless down here
Blue
That doesn't hurt nobody
Yellow neither
You getting into bed to think about yellow
likes yellow
Then what
When you get through with blue and yellow, then what
Can't say
It's something can't be planned
You blaming God
That what you're doing
No, Stamp
ain't
You saying whitefolks won
That what you saying
Those white things have taken all  had or dreamed
'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks
They just don't know when to stop
You saying nothing counts
'm saying they came into my yard
You saying God give up
Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood
'm saying they came into my yard
You punishing Him, ain't you
Not like He punished me
You can't do that, Baby
It ain't right
Was a time  knew what was
You still know
What  know is what  see: a nigger woman hauling shoes
Aw, Baby
He stops her, before the Twin Chestnuts of the Tucker house
We have to be steady
"These things too will pass"
What you looking for miracle
No
'm looking for what  was put here to look for: the back door
They exchange a look of silence and finality
She turns and walks to the back door of the house and knocks
moment later a White Woman appears, takes the carpetbag and keeps Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime
Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns
124
-
Now, Stamp Paid feels the need to find out what's going on inside 124 since he caused Paul to leave
He approaches the porch, then the front door
He raises his hands to knock - but he can't bring himself to do it
He turns to walk away then stops
He turns back and with a force of will,   upon the door
No answer
He Still no answer
He steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there
He turns to leave when he sees; in the window
Denver and Beloved
Denver bolts away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house
Stamp Paid is unnerved by her look
'  -
Sethe enters late, putting on her apron as  yells; What the hell you thinking, girl
Strolling in here this late
Don't talk to me, Mr
Sawyer
Don't say nothing to me this morning
What
What
You talking back to me
'm telling you don't say nothing to me
Sethe begins organizing her counter to make pies
You better get them pies made
Sethe ignores him as she begins
Sawyer is at a loss
Not too sweet
You make it too sweet they don't eat it
Make it the way  always do
Yeah
Too sweet
(he exits) '  -
Ella opens the front door for Stamp Paid
He looks disturbed
Where you been keeping yourself
told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside
Oh  been out
Stamp takes off his hat and follows Ella, who is doing laundry in the kitchen
Out where
Was over to Baby Suggs
What you want there
Somebody invite you in
That's Baby's kin
don't need no invite to look after her people
Ella shrugs and continues folding wet laundry on a line behind the stove
Stamp sits
Somebody new there
woman
Thought you might know who she is
Ain't no new Negroes in this town  don't know about
What she look like
You sure that wasn't Denver
know Denver
You sure
know what  see
Might see anything at all at 124
True
Better ask Paul
Can't locate him
He's sleeping in the church
The church
Yeah
Asked Rev
Pike if he could stay in the cellar
It's cold as charity in there
What he do that for
Any number'll take him in
Can't nobody read minds long distance
All he have to do is ask somebody
Why
Why he have to ask
Can't nobody offer
What's going on
Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog
Unrile yourself, Stamp
It's only a few days he been there
Shouldn't be no days
You know all about it and don't give him a hand
That don't sound like you, Ella
Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years
Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed
working man who can pay his own way
He ask,  give him anything
Why's that necessary all of a sudden
don't know him that well
You know he's colored
What else there to know
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning don't feel like it
It's her, ain't it
Her who
Sethe
He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to- Hold on
Don't jump if you can't see bottom
Girl, give it up
We been friends too long to act like this
Beat
Ella knows he's right
She surrenders the truth
Well, who can tell what went on in there
never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy
ain't sure  know that
Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here
And how'd she make it and her husband didn't
And where is he
And how she have that baby in the woods by herself
Said a whitewoman help her
Shoot
You believe that
Well,  know what kind of white that was
Aw, no, Ella
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me  don't want no part of
You was friends
Till she showed herself
Ella
ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children
What's any of that got to do with Paul What run him off
Tell me that
run him off
(surprised) You
told him
Showed him the newspaper
About Sethe
Read it to him
He left that very day
You didn't tell me that
thought he already knew
He didn't know nothing
And nobody
Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at
He knew Baby Suggs
Sure he knew her
Her boy Halle, too
And he left when he found out what Sethe did
(Stamp sits) What you say casts a different light on it,  guess
thought- Stamp knows what she thought
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul
You came asking about a new girl
That's so
Well, Paul
must know who she is
Or what she is
You mind loaded with spirits
Everywhere you look you see one
You know as well as  do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground
Stamp can not deny this
-
Sethe is walking home to her daughters
There is a serene, introverted expression on her face
as if she were detached from the world around her, safe inside
We hear her thoughts: () Beloved, she my daughter
She mine
She come back to me of her own free will and don't have to explain a thing
She had to be safe and  put her where  knew she would be
But my love was tough and she back now
She come back to me in the flesh
won't never let her go
'll explain to her, even though  don't have to
Why  did it
How if  hadn't killed her she would have died and that is something  couldn't let happen to her
When  explain she'll understand, cause she understands everything already
And she ain't even mad
When  put that headstone up  wanted to lay in there with you, put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm and  would have if Bulgar and Howard and Denver didn't need me, because my mind was homeless then couldn't lay down with you then
No matter how much  wanted to
couldn't lay down nowhere in peace, back then
Now can
can sleep like the drowned, have mercy
She come back to me, my daughter, '      '
() my Beloved and she        Beloved is my is mine
sister
() and she is mine
; 124   -
Denver is cleaning the kitchen, waiting for her mother
We hear her thoughts: () swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk
She played with me and always came to be with me whenever needed her
Me and her waited for our daddy
love her
do
She never hurt me
love my mother but  know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, 'm scared of her because of it
All the time, 'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again
Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard
So  never leave this house and  watch over the yard so it can't happen again
have to keep it away from my sister
'll protect Beloved
'Cause She's mine
'     '
()                () Beloved
She's mine        am Beloved () and she is mine
124
-
Beloved, waiting for Sethe to come home, sees her approaching
We hear her thoughts: () am not separate from her
There is no place where  stop
Her face is my own and  want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at it too
a hot thing
In the beginning could see her
could not help her because the clouds were in the way
But could see her
The shining in her ears look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way
cannot lose her again
see her face which is mine
It is the face that was going to smile at me in the place where we crouched before come up out of the blue water
Sethe's is the face that left me
Sethe's sees me in her and  see the smile
She is my face smiling at me
It is the face lost
Now we can join
a hot thing
Sethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles
She offers her hand and Beloved rises
Denver exits to them and smiles
She extends her hand to Beloved's free hand
The three women stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as they walk toward the porch
The dusk sunlight creates   - three figures holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the carnival
Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's
They were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's

The girls rush into the house, and down the hall
Sethe enters
Then turns back to the door

cold day
Paul
sits against the church drinking from a bottle when a voice causes him to look up; Howdy
Stamp has his hands in his pockets, moving about
You got any more newspaper in that pocket for me, just a waste of time
Ain't interested
Stamp sits beside him
This is hard for me
But  got to do it
Two things  got to say to you
'm a take the easy one first
(laughs) If it's hard for you, might kill me dead
(he drinks) come looking for you to ask your pardon
Apologize
For what
You pick any house, any house where colored live
Pick any one and you welcome to stay there
'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you
But you welcome anywhere you want to be
My house
John and Ella
Miss Lady Jones
anybody
You choose
You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and  apologize for each and every night
Well
did get offered one place but just wanted to be off by myself a spell
Oh yeah
Oh that's load off
thought everybody gone crazy
Just me
You planning to do anything about it
Oh yeah
got big plans
He drinks from the bottle like an angry, broken man
It stabs at Stamp's heart to see him like this
in a horse and wagon drives up the path leading to the church
He leans stops before them and leans forward; Hey
(on his feet) Yes sir
'm looking for a gal name of Judy
Works over by the slaughterhouse
Said she lived on Plank Road
Plank Road
Yes sir
That's up a ways
Mile, maybe
You don't know her
Judy
Works in the slaughterhouse
No sir,  don't, but  know Plank Road
'Bout a mile up thataway
Paul drinks from the bottle
The White Man addresses him
Look here
There's a cross up there, so guess this here's a church or used to be
Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me
Yes sir
You right about that
That's just what  come over to talk to him about
Just that
Paul offers no response
The White Man clicks his tongue and drives off
Stamp breathes a sigh of relief
You remember your price, Stamp
Never found out
did
Down to the cent
$900
Always wondered though what Mrs
Garner got for my brother Paul
Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years
But then they hung my other brother Paul
up on a tree so  guess he wasn't worth the same
wonder what was Baby Suggs worth
And Halle
wasn't surprised when  found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti
Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost
breeder
No use thinking these things now
Oh but we got to
How we gonna know our price in the future
How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost
Who's gonna tell them
What are they gonna pay for us, if we free
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing
They'll know
They'll know as soon as they born
Cause it's inside us,Stamp
It'll be inside them
We'll pass it down
Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind
and the blood
and what it carries
and what it's worth
don't believe that
won't
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home
Last time  saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth,  saw Mister - sitting on a tub
He loved that tub
Like king on a throne
He was a hateful thing
Bloody and evil
But he was better than me
Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was
Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister
But wasn't no way 'd ever be Paul
again
Schoolteacher changed me
Was never no beating under Mr
Garner
Schoolteacher changed that
Why wouldn't a man run from that
Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that
And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else
And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub
He drinks
said  had two things to say to you only told you one
have to tell you the other
don't want to know
was there Paul
There in the yard
When she did it
What yard
When who- And then Paul realizes he's talking of Sethe
Jesus
It ain't what you think
You don't know what  think
She ain't crazy
She love those children
She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all
Leave off
She was only- Stamp, leave off  said
knew her when she was a girl
She scares me and  knew her when she was a girl
You ain't scared of Sethe
don't believe you
She scares me
scare me
And that girl in her house scares me
Who is she
Where she come from
Don't know
Just shot up one day from a stump
She what run you off
Not what  told you 'bout Sethe
Paul thinks a moment
Then, tears brimming in his eyes: Tell me something, Stamp
Tell me this one thing
How much is a nigger supposed to take
All he can
All he can
Why
Why
Why
Why
Why

The sun shines on a warm April day
a day abundant with growth and renewed hope
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124
It looks more worn than before
neglected, abused
broken window
the front door off it's hinge
a front step splintered and dangerous
124
-
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder
Camera enters; -
Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew
Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall
She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which seems withered, frailer since we last saw her
In her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue
wakes her up
Followed by a Her face registers fear
She realizes where she is, what time it is
and begins organizing breakfast
She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink
She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal   except for a   and a bowl of   about 1/4 full
She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food
She realizes there is none left
'  -
Denver finished dressing
She has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room
But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see the same disarray as downstairs
She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers; , sprawled across the bed, half naked
Her belly is huge, her body unwashed
She looks, and behaves, like a wild animal
broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed
Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat
She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's old quilt
You shouldn't be in here
Beloved jolts her head up to Denver
She doesn't like being looked at unawares
What do you know about it
sleep where want
You best leave that quilt alone
That was grandma's quilt
Beloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly tears the hole apart with one strong pull
Triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver; Breakfast ready
'm hungry
-
Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it on one plate which she sets on the table
She stands at the stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food off the bottom of the pan
Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth
Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs, as she pretends to wash the dishes
Morning
Morning, ma'am
Sethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well
Their eyes meet
Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the pan crumbs
She smiles; You hungry
Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers; No, ma'am
Sethe looks relieved
'll finish those
Why don't you sit down
Denver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother
Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down
But as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away; You don't sit with me
Baby, don't be like that
You don't sit with me
don't sit with people who leave me
Don't talk like that
Your mama loves you
had another dream last night
(as she eats) The dead man laying on top of me and had nothing to eat
And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light
Don't say those things
You forget about those dreams
You gave me the bad dreams
You left me behind
Mama told you - 'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby
My children my best thing
You my best thing
You're weren't nice to me
you didn't smile at me
That's not true
told you,  had to get you out, make you safe
so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever
Ma'am
No one pays attention to Denver
Beloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across the eye
the plate breaking
Hold back Denver - 'm fine
You
you go on upstairs
'll do the cleaning up
But mama
Go upstairs  said
Sethe's harsh tone is only for Denver
Denver exits the kitchen, afraid to leave them alone
As she moves from the kitchen, she hears; () want somethin' sweet
() We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby
() Not for me, you don't
You don't let me eat the pies
() No
Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies
Denver walks up the white stairs
'  -
Denver has straightened up her grandmother's room
Cleaned away the broken pieces of the lamp
Gathered the remnants of the quilt
She holds the quilt as she sits on the bed, facing the headboard
: : '  -
Baby Suggs, near death, lying in her bed, chuckles and coughs; You mean  never told you about your daddy
About the Bodwins who let me rent this here house while  do my shoe repairing
About your mother's feet, not to mention her back
never told you all that
shakes her head
Is that why you can't walk down the steps and out yonder by yourself
Denver can't answer
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters
You liked going there remember
Seeing the other children
Then all a sudden, you stop
There was a boy there
said mama was a jailbird
said he could prove it
Baby Suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter, hurt by hurtful words
My Jesus my
What people won't say
Why didn't you come and ask me
(Denver shrugs) 'Fraid 'll tell ya, huh
(Denver looks at her) Come here, child
Denver crawls into her arms
You got to go sometime
You got to go out there by yourself sometime
But you said
you said out there, there ain't no
what was that word
no
de- fense
No de-fense
There ain't
Then what do  do
Know it, and go on out the yard
Go on
'  -
Denver has crawled up and snuggled against the pillow in the same position as when she was nine in her grandma's arms
-
Denver has changed into a clean, pretty dress and is approaching the stairs when she passes Sethe's room
It's door is open
She looks in
Sethe stands with her back to the door, cleaned up, wearing her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival
Denver smiles, hopefully; Mama
Sethe turns, startled, to reveal - it is  in Sethe's best clothes
When Beloved sees Denver, she smiles tauntingly and strikes a pose
look just like her
Disgusted, Denver exits
-
Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen; Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate
As she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against pieces too small to clean
Mama let me help you
She wanted me to do it
Sethe continues her work, without even looking at Denver
Denver pauses a moment, realizing she is of no use here - but knowing she needs to help her mother somehow
She looks up to the kitchen, where every cupboard door is open revealing empty shelves
- -
-
Denver's hands slowly reaches towards the door lock - and 124
-
Denver opens the door, then pushes the broken screen door off it's hinge
She closes the door behind her
She begins her walk from the porch to the road
The first time she's ever gone alone
not knowing what she will face beyond the perimeters of her home
She reaches Bluestone Road and stops
She looks in either direction and sees not a soul
She takes a breath
She begins to walk - to get help
block from the house,    turn a corner and walk towards her
Denver stops, frightened, not knowing what to do
The    pass her, tipping their hats, saying; Morning
Morning
And they walk by
Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never got her mouth open in time to reply
Heartened by the encounter, she picks up speed
'  -
- a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver
Why Denver
Look at you
Denver manages to smile
It's been so long
It's so nice of you to come see me
What brings you
Unfortunately, Denver can't manage anything beyond the smile
Well, never mind - nobody needs a reason to visit
Let me make us some tea
Come on
Lady Jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside
'  -
Tea things sit on a table between them
Denver eats whatever she can
Lady Jones watches with care and concern
How's your family, honey
Denver swallows a bite of something with some tea, then; want to work, Miss Lady
Work
Start learnin your letters again
No
mean work work
Well, what can you do
can't do anything but  would learn it for you if you have a little extra
Extra
Food
My mama, she doesn't feel well couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but  could do chores in the mornings
Oh baby
don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves
But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so
We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry
No
No that won't do
Lady Jones can sense something far more serious is going on
124
/  -
Denver brings four eggs, some rice and some tea onto the kitchen table
Sethe's eyes well up
She looks at Denver as if for the first time
Her face an expression of gratitude
Suddenly; () Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed
Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room
Sethe stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the floor, ripping at her own neck
Denver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting herself
Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling her hair, clawing at her as well
124
-
Denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in the yard; -  ; On the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a  flutters to the ground
She reads it; -
Denver returns the empty basket to
Lucille Williams
Thank you
Your welcome
124
-
Beloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans
Sethe sits in the corner, as if waiting to serve her
124
- Upon the stump, sits a plate of cold rabbit meat, which Denver brings inside
'  -
Denver is returning a bowl to Grace, a friendly woman
No, darling
That's not my bowl
Mine's got a blue ring around it
Would you like to come in a spell
124
-
Beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating - her mouth still dirty from the meal
Sethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair
She is trying to mend a torn dress
Denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift
She hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman
Nobody
no sir
that's right
nobody's going be doing that
nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side
no sir
don't care
ain't laying that down
no sir refuse
that's right
that's right
Mama
Mama she's asleep
Why don't you eat something
She likes this dress
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there
Come sit at the table
Sethe considers this
She rises cautiously, then sits at the table
Denver rises and gets her some food, placing it before her
Please mama, eat something
Sethe nods
Denver is getting more and more frightened of losing her mother completely
Instead of protecting Beloved from Sethe, she must protect her mother from Beloved
' ;   -
white family home in a white Ohio neighborhood
, a benevolent black servant woman, opens the back door for Denver
Yes
May  come in
What you want
want to see Mr
and Mrs
Bodwin
Miss Bodwin
They brother and sister, darlin
Oh
What you want'em for
'm looking for work
was thinking they might know of some
(smiles) You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you
Yes ma'am
heard your mother took sick, that so
Yes ma'am
Well, come on in
You letting in flies
'  -
The house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and glass cases filled with glistening things
Denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits with Janey
You know what
've been here since  was fourteen and  remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are
Whiteman name of Garner brought her
He and Mr
Bodwin were good friends
That's how she got that house you all live in
Other things too
Yes ma'am
never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me
Always
Never be another like her
miss her
Bet you do
Everybody miss her
That was a good woman
Well,  don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help
(hopeful) Ya think
They getting older now and  can't take care of 'em like  used to
More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night
Now,  don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too
got my own family needs me
It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that
Fine
But what would  do at night
Be here
In case
In case of what
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad  can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after
Anything
(laughs) Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night
During Janey's lines, Denver looks about the house imagining herself here at night
her eyes happen upon on his knees, his head thrown back farther than a head could go, his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with money for delivery tips
On the pedestal are the words' ; They good whitefolks
Oh yeah
They good
Can't say they ain't good
wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that
But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it
All right
Denver nods, beaming gratefully - so gratefully that no words come, only tears
Janey reaches for Denver's hand and holds it warmly; What is it, child
What's the trouble with Sethe
Denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone
'  -
Ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting including Lady Jones, Janey Wagon,
Lucille Williams, Grace; But is it really the daughter, Janey
The killed one
That what she say
How they know it's her
It's sitting there
Sleeps, eats and raises hell
Whipping Sethe every day
'll be
baby
No
Grown now
The age it would have been had it lived
In the flesh
And whipping her
Guess she had it coming a little
Nobody got that coming
But Ella- you can't just up and kill your children
No, and the children can't just up and kill the mama
What's fair ain't necessarily right
(the women listen) Now you all know how  felt about the whole thing
know the rage Sethe felt in that shed that day
We all do
But what  could not understand, and still don't, was her reaction to it
Prideful
Too damn complicated for a black woman in her position before God
But whatever she done,  don't like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present
don't cotton to sin moving in on a house, unleashed and sassy
Every day life takes enough, takes all a woman has
"Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof" and nobody needs more
Nobody needs a grown up evil sitting at a table with a grudge
As long as that ghost showed itself from a ghostly place,  respected it
But once it take on flesh and come into this world, well, the shoe's on the other foot now
don't mind a little communication between worlds
But this here's an invasion
The women agree
Should we pray
Uh-huh
First
Then we got to get down to business

Denver comes down the stairs, entering the kitchen
Sethe, worn out, looking more beaten and ravaged than before, stands at the sink with an   chopping up ice
Denver speaks to her, but she does not turn or acknowledge her
Mama
Mama 'm going out
(no response) Mama,  got a job
Working over at the Bodwins at night
Mr
Bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town
'll be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime
We'll have some money, mama
Mama
Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized
Denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly; 'm going help you, mama
Don't you give up yet
Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and feels nothing
Denver exits
124
-
Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr
Bodwin when she hears; , gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd
towards 124,    ; Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles, crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they could find
124  ;    -
Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing
Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see
124
-
The women continue singing
: -
, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding toward 124 when he hears the singing as well
on that fateful day
: 124
-
The women continue singing as: Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's, exit the house
The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by the lack of fear between the women
Sethe is holding Beloved's hand
Beloved is smiling brightly at the beautiful singing
Denver looks to her mother; Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying
The sound of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism
She looks to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed although up until this moment was not conscious of missing
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage
In her ravaged mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back
No
No, he's not coming into my yard
He not taking my best thing
No
She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward
No
no
no
Mama
She passes Denver, feeling for the
No
As Mr
Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from 124
; , , , , Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and defend with the ice pick
And something within her is resolved
For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a wild animal
And a tear upon her face
Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the house and disappears from view
The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother
Mr
Bodwin looks on stunned
- , ; : -
Paul
is on his way to work when he sees; poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction
She spots him and smiles; Good morning, Paul
Paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her
Well, is it now
How you getting along
Don't pay to complain
You on your way home
No
Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory
Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins  might be able to put something away for me and mama
They treating you right over at the Bodwins
More than all right
Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff
Book stuff
She says might go to Oberlin
She's experimenting on me
Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil the possibilities that lay before her
Your mother all right
No
Not a bit all right
Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day
You think  should stop by
Think she'd welcome it
don't know
think 've lost my mother, Paul
Silence
That girl
You know, Beloved
Yes
She gone like they say
Haven't seen her since that day
Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but
don't think so
Mama thinks she's gone for good
Says she can feel it
You think she sure 'nough your sister
At times
At other times  think she was
more
But who would know that better than you
mean, you sure 'nough you her
She levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means
Well, if you want my opinion
don't
have my own
You grown
Yes sir Well, good luck with the job
Thank you
They pass each other until Denver turns back; And Paul
you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear
will
Paul watches her walk away
He watches as a runs towards her shouting; Hey, Miss Denver
Wait up
He watches as the two young people, the future, walk together
124

Paul enters the house and hears
He walks towards the keeping room, whose door is ajar; -
Sethe lies in bed with the remnants of Baby Sugg's quilt over her, as she hums her melody and looks out of the window
Sethe
(turns to him) Paul
She looks like she's dying
Aw, Sethe
He approaches her
You shaved
Yeah
Look bad
No, You looking good
Devil's confusion
What's this  hear about you not getting out of bed
(no response) saw Denver
She tell you
She comes in the daytime
She still with me, my Denver
(nervous) You got to get up from here, girl
'm tired, Paul
So tired
have to rest a while
(getting upset, shouts) Don't you die on me
This is Baby Suggs quilt
Is that what you planning
Oh,  don't have no plans
No plans at all
Look - Denver be here in the day
be here in the night
'm a take care of you, you hear
Starting now
Sethe looks at him - a long look - and sees in him that thing, that blessedness, "that makes him the kind of man who can walk into a house and make women cry, make women tell him things they could only tell each other"
What, baby
(cries) She left me
She's gone again
Aw, girl
Don't cry
Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody
We need some kind of tomorrow
She was my best thing
Paul leans down and takes her hand, entwining his fingers into hers
You your best thing, Sethe
You are
Sethe smiles, with tears in her eyes, looking almost surprised; Me
Me
-
beautiful, sunny day
The clearing is full
Everyone looks bright and hopeful
Dressed in bright, summer clothes
robust Baby Suggs is on her rock giving her best Call, as camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe
The only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine
If you cannot see it, you will not have it
Here, in this place, we are flesh
Flesh that weeps, laughs, dances on bare feet in the grass
Love it
Love it hard
Yonder they do not love your flesh
They despise it
They flay it
, my people, they do not love your hands
Those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty, Love your hands
Love them
Raise them up and kiss them
Touch others with them, put them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either
You  got to love it
You
Yonder out there, they ain't in love with your moth
They will see it broken and break it again
What you say out of it, they will not heed
What you scream from it they do not hear
No, they don't love your mother
You got to love it
And the feet that need to rest and to dance
The backs that needs support
The shoulders that need arms, strong arms 'm telling you
my people, out yonder they don't love your neck unnoosed and straight
So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up
Love all your inside parts, love 'em
and the beating heart, love that too
More than eyes or feet
More than lungs that have yet to draw free air, love your heart
For this is the prize
And with her twisted, broken old body And the crowd gives her music,
singing together
Among the crowd, we see
124
