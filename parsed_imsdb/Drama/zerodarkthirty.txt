Written by Mark Boal October 3rd, 2011 ,  -- We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments after the planes struck on 9/11, just before the buildings collapsed
:  11, 2001 We listen to fragments from a number of these calls
starting with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the caller's grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the situation is hopeless, that they are about to die
: : - own you, Ammar
You belong to me
Look at me
This is  , the 's man in Islamabad - a big American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking down to his tattooed neck
He looks like a paramilitary hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock
(') (explaining the rules) If you don't look at me when  talk to you,  hurt you
If you step off this mat,  hurt you
If you lie to me, 'm gonna hurt you
Now, Look at me
His prisoner, , stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded by four  whose faces are covered in ski masks
Ammar looks down
Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching and kicking
(') Look at me, Ammar
Notably, one of the  wearing a ski mask does not take part in the beating

- Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation room into the light of day
They remove their masks and we see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties
She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core that we will come to realize is off-the-charts
This is , a  targeter and subject-matter expert on her first overseas assignment
(to the guard) Are we gonna board up these windows or what
( ) Just off the plane from Washington, you're rocking your best suit for your first interrogation, and then you get this guy
It's not always this intense
'm fine
She's not
Just so you know, it's going to take awhile
He has to learn how helpless he is
Let's get a coffee
No, we should go back in
Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation room
You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor
She shakes her head
(') Alright
At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya
(') You might want to put this on
3
You're not wearing one
Is he ever getting out
Never
: - :    - Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes
Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of what is to come
This is her first interrogation and she is on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room
She looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water on the floor
Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation
It's you and me, bro
want you to understand that  know you, that 've been studying you for a very long time
could have had you killed Karachi
But  let you live so you and  could talk
() You beat me when my hands are tied
won't talk to you
Life isn't always fair, my friend
Did you really think that when we got you, 'd be a nice fucking guy
You're a mid-level guy
You're a garbage man in a corporation
Why should  respect you
And you're a money man
paperboy
Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising
(') disgrace to humanity
() 4
(') You and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people
have your name on a five-thousand dollar transfer via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker
He leans into Ammar's ear
Uncomfortably close
(') And you got popped with 150 kilograms of high explosives in your house
And then Daniel smiles, laughs
Mercurial
(') 'm just fucking with you
Beat
He laughs again
(') don't want to talk about 9/11
What  want to focus on is the Saudi group
Daniel shows him a photo
(') That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri
And  know this dude is up to some serious shit, and what  want from you is his Saudi email
() Feel free to jump in
() Ammar, bro,  know that you know this dude, just give me his email
and  will give you a blanket
will give you a blanket and some solid food
No response from Ammar
Daniel starts putting on his gloves
(') know that you know him
told you before,  won't talk to you
Have it your way
() 5
(') (to the masks) Let's go
It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel smothers Ammar's face with a towel
Ammar thrashes
Daniel considers his next move
(') ( ) Grab the bucket
Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room, where there's an   filled with  and a (') Put some water in it
She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking
(') 'mon, let's go
The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings the bucket back to Daniel
Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is now covered by a towel
Ammar thrashes with rising panic
(') Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef, you guys met in Tunisia back in the 70s
(gasping for breath) don't know, you asshole
Maya shakes her head "no
" That's not credible
() Why are you doing this to me
You're a terrorist, that's why 'm doing it to you
6
Fuck you
Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose
want emails of the rest of the Saudi group
Give me emails of the rest of the Saudi group
Give me one email, and  will stop this
Ammar doesn't speak
He can't
(') Who's in the Saudi group, and what's the target
Where was the last time you saw bin Laden Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth: and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned
He gasps for air
(') This is what defeat looks like, bro
Your jihad is over
Daniel stands
(') Get him up
The guards bring Ammar to his feet
Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist
(') Try to understand the concept here
have time, you don't
have other things to do, you don't
() It's cool that you're strong respect it,  do
But in the end, everybody breaks, bro
It's biology
Dan and Maya exit
They've learned nothing

Busy markets
Poor children
Dense traffic
Meanwhile, across town: -  - National flags
Imposing buildings
Armed guards
The outpost of a superpower
Maya drives through the checkpoint and up to the main gate
:   , : -  - Descending the lobby staircase with Daniel is  , Chief of Station, Pakistan, a smooth, vain, sophisticated former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood out of his fingernails
How did it go the other night
It was good
The local cops need tactical help
But he's Tier fucking One, baby
There's your money maker
This is the guy that's 's nephew
What's his issue
He's being a dick
If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD
am going to have to turn up the heat
He needs to give us the Saudi group now
They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the holding area
They walk towards her as Bradley considers what Daniel is asking for
8
- / He's gotta have that - given the family ties
Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss
Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money
Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in
(') (to Bradley, clocking her good looks) Was  lying or what
The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many females come through that door
(') ( ) Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our illustrious station chief
(as they shake hands) Joe and  did Iraq together
And we continue our Christian mission here
Nice to meet you
You too, Sir
How was your flight
They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing
Fine
She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right
How do you like Pakistan so far
It's kinda fucked up
9
You volunteered for this didn't you
No
Bradley smiles
He knew she didn't volunteer
They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an electronic door
( ) Third floor, northeast corner
She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away
Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff
Washington says she's a killer
The children's crusade
They want the next generation on the field
Listen,  have a meeting with  in twenty minutes
They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that
Did you see the cable from London
Dude, 've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days
: - ' Maya finds her desk
It's covered with grime
She tries to clean it as best she can, then sits and looks at the blank log-in screen of her computer
- group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting, chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table
10
We will get to know: , mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the National Security Agency ()
, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in the station who wears a skirt
Some dude tells the Malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy-- Here we go
Hold on - He goes to a big feast in Bangkok about a year ago
The guest of honor
Usama bin Laden
Laughter in the room
(') So  say, was Tupac there too
Right, but you forgot - you forgot Mullah Omar
and , two case officers, continue the banter: () This is worth 5 million bucks
You know we're going to have to chase it down
That's me, man
No job too small
That's why  have a gift for you, my friend
Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper
Daniel and Maya enter, a little late
Everyone, this is Maya
Maya, everyone
() 11
(') Please don't ask how it's going with Ammar because she's not going to fucking tell you
Ammar is withholding
Daniel nods
(') (reading from her ) Washington assesses that Abu Faraj is officially our new number three - moves to a wall chart of  leadership and repositions Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down from Usama bin Laden
Meanwhile, in the background, the riffs continue - - Best man for it
(
) London station is already asking if we think he's in contact with anyone in the
Like we're just keeping it from them
Jessica sits back down and gets down to business
The Jordanians are being really helpful with Ammar's transit papers
Jessica passes Daniel a file
Any imminent threats in here
They want the Consulate, the Marriott, it's low security
And they've got Majid Kahn talking about gas stations in the
And that's a conversation
Jessica shrugs
At this point, she believes that it is merely a conversation - not a fully realized plot
12
Honestly
There are six hundred questions in there
'd concentrate on Heathrow
The Saudis
Does it matter what Faraj thinks about Heathrow
How much latitude does he get to pick targets
think he'll give up the Saudis
But Heathrow is gonna be tough
Anyway
Anything from last night
Quetta base thinks they have a bead on the Arabs that escaped, and they're going to meet with the  this afternoon, hopefully to set up a raid down there
Great
And Lahore reporting  down there was painfully slow last night
Again
'm beginning to think it's not incompetence
agree,  spoke to the Chief about that
Anything on bin Laden
(reading from a cable) farmer on the Afghan border near Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped pattern in the hills, tall male in the center of the diamond, flanked by four guards
It's consistent with 's movements
That's supposed to be his royal guard
That's pre-9/11 behavior
Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge
() We don't have reason to believe he's changed security tactics
13
We invaded Afghanistan
That's a reason
And so the rivalry begins
Hey, boss,  got a guy for five thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi stand and snoop around a bit
No, don't need him, the diamond sighting is bullshit
See if the Paks will send someone to talk to the farmer
Anything else
We need to be putting runs on the board against Faraj
Speak to the case officers who didn't see fit to make it today
And thank them
'  - The loud  of the early morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch
: - Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya
Daniel switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar
Let's take it easy today, huh
Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of falafel
(') Hungry
The food in here sucks so got you some of this
Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels
(') Richard Reid, wow
was thinking about him
The guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane
Unbelievable
You know him, don't you
Slowly, Ammar nods
14
Yes
'm glad you said that
have an email from you to him
've had all your coms for years, bro
Who else is in your Saudi group
just handed out some cash for them
didn't know who the guys were
When you lie to me,  hurt you
Please
believe you
do,  believe you
Beat
(') Do you want the water again, or do you want something else
Please
Just give me a name
'-- Daniel jumps up
(') don't know
Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar
The masked guards walk to the rope pulleys
You see how this works
You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you
Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants
Maya flinches at the bare nakedness
(') Dude, you shit your pants
15
Daniel turns to Maya - (') You stay here, 'll be back
Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the naked, chained man
Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his eyes
Your friend is an animal
Please, help me
Please
long beat
You can help yourself by being truthful
The door handle turns
It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a in his hand
This is a dog collar
Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation
Maya flinches
Daniel is relentless: (') You determine how  treat you
Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash
(') 'm going to walk you
Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner of the room, then leans down to address his victim: (') What the fuck do you think is going on, Ammar
Wahleed has already told me that you know
At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a large wooden box resting on a platform
16
(') This box sucks
'm going to put you in it
Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out
(') When is the attack
( ) Sunday
Sunday
Sunday where
This Sunday or next Sunday
Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly
Monday
Is it Sunday or Monday
Ammar doesn't answer
The masked men approach
(') Which day is it
Partial information is treated as a lie
Saturday
Beat
The masked men open the box
(') Sunday
The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb
He shouts with his last reserve of energy: (') Monday
Ammar, which day
() Monday, Tuesday, Beat
17
(') Thursday
Beat
(') Friday
Daniel slams the box shut
Once again, he's learned nothing

: - : news footage of the massacre
Daniel, Jessica, and Maya look on in defeat
The "Saudi" attack they tried to prevent by pressuring Ammar has occurred
( ) Don't worry about the Saudis, they'll take care of business
Yeah, now
18
You warned them - they didn't take you seriously - this is what happens
It's not on you
Who said that
Zied
Fuck him
This is on me
Ammar is on me
And it's on her
(pointing to Maya) We can't let this be a win-win for No, no, no
You had - what - days - brief custody - and an unresponsive ally
The way you do this is you look ahead
London
Heathrow
Mass casualties
That plan is still active
Ammar doesn't have a clue about what happened
He knows
How
You have to be really careful with people in 's circle - they're devious
He's not going to talk about attacks on the homeland
He's going to withhold operational details on the network and probably on bin Laden
(flipping her argument) But he's been in complete isolation, he doesn't know we failed
We can tell him anything
Bluff him
He hasn't slept, Dan
He's clueless

, Daniel and Maya are seated at a picnic table with an appetizing spread of Arabic food
(-) (') Short term memory loss is a side effect of sleep deprivation
It should come back to you
The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood: Ammar
He stares weakly at the table
() don't know
How can  remember
After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people
Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself
Ammar is lost
But the food is tempting
(') Eat up
You earned it
Ammar eats
(') So you flew via Amman to Kabul to hang out with your uncle
Mukhtar
How did you know that
told you man,  know you
Alright, you got me - flight manifests
It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11
What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh
20
After 9/11  had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run
() You chose to fight
Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes
wanted to kill Americans
We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high
We couldn't cross
Sorry, who is the "we" in that sentence
Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time
() can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling
Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed
Maya makes notes on her pad
Who's Abu Ahmed
've heard of the other guys
He was a computer guy with us at the time
After Tora Bora,  went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North,  think, to Kunar
What's his family name
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti
Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed", it's a kunya
() 21
(') Ammar,  know the difference between a war name and an Arabic name
She got you there, dude
swear to you both:  don't know his family name
would have never asked him something like that
It's not how my uncle worked
My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi
He read us all a letter from the Sheikh
letter
What did it say
Daniel offers Ammar a smoke
(') Cigarette
Ammar accepts
Daniel's lights it
It said "Continue the jihad
The work will go on for a hundred years
" : - We fade into a dimly lit research room, where Maya is alone watching interrogation video recordings on an array of monitors
Some of the videos are rough; but most simply depict two people talking
The video she's watching now shows a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared with red stains
: You and  are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, yeah
The prisoner sits in a chair
He's hooded, but relaxed
22
Ok
Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what  want to do is  want to separate them from the people like you
Definitely, yeah
There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait
Yes,  remember him
nice guy
How close was he
What was his relationship to the leadership
don't know
Did he eat with you guys - did he eat with the good guys - or did he eat with the leadership
don't know, sir
have no idea about things like that
Yes you do, you don't need an idea - Maya hits pause and we see that her desk is filled with open windows of interrogations: she is analyzing ten videos simultaneously, comparing them to each other
- She plays another video showing a Turkish prison
When you met with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was this one of the facilitators
The Interrogator flashes a picture
The prisoner moans
23
(') Is this Abu Ahmed
Yes
- She fast forwards a video - shot in a Polish facility
The prisoner appears to be cold
, your boss
Mukhtar
Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'
say 'fucking ', but yeah, 'Mukhtar
' After Mukhtar was captured, what did Abu Ahmed do
Abu Ahmed,  believe he went to work for The Sheikh
- Maya is still in the research room
She's been going at this for hours and looks fatigued
: a different  from the previous video; is an older man chained to a desk
The exchange is in Arabic with an English subtitle on the screen: In Karachi, in 2003 or 2004
He was carrying a letter from bin Laden
: - Still going, looking exhausted now, Maya manipulates the controls of yet another video clip with a different and
We're now in a Moroccan facility
The interrogator shows him a photograph of a bearded man
Henceforth, The Photograph
24
Is that him
() Abu Ahmed
The interrogator holds The Photograph right in front of the prisoner's face, allowing us to see it as well
Say again
Abu Ahmed
Abu Ahmed
Abu Ahmed
Freeze frame
: - Yemeni prison - the dialogue is a mix of French and English: Abu Ahmed - is he the courier for bin Laden
Who knows who works directly for bin Laden
Let's say he's part of the mix
Were there other people who carried messages from bin Laden
Sure
How many other people
() Four or five
Let's talk about them-- The image freezes
Maya stares at the screen
25
- Maya is in the kitchen grabbing something to eat
Jessica, the only other person working this late, walks in, pours herself some coffee
How's the needle in the haystack
Fine
Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money
The rivalry is in full bloom
Sometimes it's friendly
Sometimes it's not so friendly
() You're assuming that Al Qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards
They're radicals
( ) Correct
You're assuming that greed won't override ideology in some of the weaker members
Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war, 'll give you that
Thank you
Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East

Hakim translates
Then the prisoner speaks
() It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they were always together
What did he do for Faraj
() He carried messages from Faraj to bin Laden and from bin Laden back to Faraj
Maya leans into Hakim - 27
We need to ask him something to see if he's telling the truth
We don't know if he really knew Faraj
Hakim speaks to the prisoner
He just told me the names of all of Faraj's children
think he's telling the truth
: - Maya is pitching Bradley in his office
Bradley sits with his feet up on his desk, holding The Photograph
Daniel is slouched on the couch in back
Jessica is perched on the arm of the couch, bare legs crossed
Bradley notices
Maya stands
Twenty detainees recognize that photo of Abu Ahmed
They say he's part of the inner circle of guys who were hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11
() lot of them say that after 9/11, he went to work for
() When  got captured, he went to work for Abu Faraj, primarily as a courier from Faraj to bin Laden
Well, that's good
You still- Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the outside of the network - part of a series of cutouts and dead drops - or if he has a direct connection to bin Laden
Does bin Laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly
Or is Abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers, so that's why everybody knows him
28
That's not all you don't know
You don't have his true name, and you don't have a clue of where he is
We know that he's important
The fact that everybody's heard of Abu Ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that
Maybe
Detainees could withhold his location for any number of reasons
Perhaps they don't know; perhaps this Abu is just a cover story and he's really a fucking unicorn
The withholding doesn't reveal what you want it to - does it
No
And if you did find him, you don't know that he'd be with bin Laden
We don't know what we don't know
( ) What the fuck is that supposed to mean
It's a tautology
(back to Maya) Listen, not one single detainee has said that he's located with the big guy, just that he delivers messages
Am  wrong
No
No
It's still good work

Don't you want to see what's in the folder

: - Both Maya and Faraj look tired
This has been going on for hours
lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed was bin Laden's courier and that he worked very closely with you
35
You're thinking of Abu Khalid
Who
Al Buluchi
My courier for the Sheikh
Okay, so you're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong, and there's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that 've never even heard of
Why should you have heard of him
What does this Buluchi guy look like
Tall, long white beard, thin
He uses a cane
Kind of like Gandolf
Who
When was the last time you saw him
month ago, in Karachi, but  don't know where he is now
Sometimes wouldn't even see him, he would just tell me where to leave the messages
don't believe you
The  in the room with them leans forward and  Faraj across the face
Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains flat and steady, unmoved by the violence
She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago
36
(') You're not being fulsome in your replies
You can't force me to tell you something  don't know
You do realize this is not a normal prison
You determine how you are treated, and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information  need
The guard slaps Faraj again
Faraj is impassive
: - Maya looks on impassively as Faraj is subjected to harsh treatment
: - Maya is retching in the stall
: - - Maya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage
The cage is empty
Faraj is completely denying knowing Abu Ahmed, and that's using every measure we have
He's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you're putting on him
Do you want to take a run at him
No
37
No
Since when
You know, 've been meaning to tell you: 'm getting outta here
What
You okay
'm fine
've just seen too many guys naked
It's gotta be over a hundred at this point
need to go do something normal for awhile
Like what
Go to Washington, do the dance, see how that environment works
() You should come with me
Be my number two
You're looking a little strung out yourself
Maya looks at Dan
No longer the man he once was
She doesn't hide her disappointment
'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony
They killed my monkeys
Something about an escape
Can you fucking believe that
Sorry, Dan
Look, Maya, you gotta be really careful with detainees now
The politics are changing and you don't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes
know
38
And watch your back when you get back to Pakistan
Everyone knows you there now
: - Back in Pakistan, the country has indeed changed to a more militarized police state, and as we establish the new environment, we find Maya's grey sedan
-     - The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by
The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes
motions for her to roll down her window
Where are you going
To the Marriott
assume you noticed the dip plates
But you have a bag - The policeman motions to a   resting on the rear seat
It's a gym bag
Maya does not get out of the car
She stares at him defiantly
He advances forward a bit
She rolls up her window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell phone
The policeman walks away to rejoin his group
The police confer
The original policeman returns, this time with several other cops
They knock on the glass
Hard
Maya stares straight ahead
: - Jessica is waiting at the table in a beautifully appointed room
39
:   - ,  - 20, 2008 Maya walks in, flustered
Fucking checkpoints
Maya sits down, absorbed in her Blackberry
Maya
Yeah
We're socializing
Be social
Maya puts away her blackberry
() Okay
Look,  know Abu Ahmed is your baby, but it's time to cut the umbilical cord
No, it's not
So Faraj went south on you - it happens
There are still cells in London and Spain planning the next round of attacks
can work on it at the same time - plus  think it's a good thing that he lied
No, not at the expense of protecting the homeland, you can't
Wait a minute, why is it a good thing
You sound just like Bradley
He doesn't believe in my lead either
() 40
(') () It's a good thing because the fact that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is revealing
The only other thing he lied about was the location of bin Laden himself
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to protect as bin Laden
That confirms my lead
Or it's confirmation bias
() We're all just worried about you, okay
Is that okay to say
Maya rubs her eyes, not liking where the conversation is going
She forces a smile
(') Where's Jack
He's probably stuck in some check- point somewhere
You two hooked up yet
Hello,  work with him
'm not that girl, that fucks
It's unbecoming
So
little foolin' around wouldn't hurt you
() So no boyfriend
Do you have any friends at all
She doesn't
Jessica's phone rings - (') It's Jack
( ) Hey - that's okay - ,
-- -- 41
-- , ,      , -- As alarms wail, Maya struggles to her feet, grabs Jessica by the arm, and they stumble to safety
- Toward the destroyed kitchen, helping each other over obstacles, twisted metal, gaps in the concrete, etc, past injured workers and burning flames
-  - They continue moving through the debris as the smoke intensifies
They find each other's hands and grab tightly
: : The destroyed Marriott
(
) The blast left a crater 10 meters wide in front of the hotel
The Marriott, one of the most popular destinations for locals and Westerners
-  - We're high above the wild hinterlands of the Hindu Kush, gliding over the rocky slopes and the pine forests
:  , We move from peak to peak until we find a remote valley, and we zoom down
and nestled in the valley we can just make out the barest outlines of a tiny village of mud huts
Now we are inside a hut and we've shifted to the perspective of a hand held camera, as if someone inside this stone age interior is filming on our behalf, and we see a hard floor, thin gaps in the walls, and    talking casually, eating and drinking tea
42
We pan across the weathered faces, long beards, and see a video recorder resting on a ledge
: -  - Jessica strides excitedly, almost breaking into a run, through the warren of cubicles that lead to Maya's desk
- '  - Jessica beaming as she approaches Maya
The Jords have a mole
What
Jessica pops a  into Maya's computer, loads a file that plays the same video clip we have just seen
He made this video to prove his bona fides
Shut the fuck up
The camera stops on one man,
() Humam Khalil al-Balawi, he's a Jordanian doctor
He's really motivated
Maya practically bolts out of her chair
Together, they start walking towards Bradley's office - This could be it
This is it
-  '  - Bradley has just finished watching the video
Maya and Jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict
43
He's right there in the inner circle
don't buy it
Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda
The Jords worked him for a year
Dinners, money
They've convinced him that it's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing it
Yeah, so the Jords say
( ) You're right
We can't rely on the Jords
We have to evaluate him face to face
( ) He may not be that smart
He may be full of shit - but we have to talk to him to find out
The key is to meet him so we can figure out for ourselves what he can actually do
He really asked for a dialysis machine
You can fill the damn thing with poison
: -   - Maya and a few analysts are watching  - President-elect Obama is being interviewed on 60 Minutes when Jessica comes into the room with disappointing news - The meeting with Balawi is off
He can't come here to Islamabad
Can't or won't
44
He's not going to travel - security - The  interview with Obama reaches the subject of enhanced interrogation, and the women pause to listen to the President- elect declare, "America does not torture
" Then they continue: (') He wants us to go to him
He'll meet in Miram Sha or the tribals
He knows we're white
You'll get kidnapped up there
, an analyst, adds his two cents to the conversation - We could do it somewhere else - Germany, or the
He's got a clean passport
He's not going to travel out of Al Qaeda territory
And you're not going to him
'm not
Believe me
() We're stuck
What about Camp Chapman
Afghanistan
That could be safe territory
: - ,  - We survey the sprawling base from above
:   - , Helicopters and Humvees traverse the base
-  - Jessica applies icing to a birthday cake as she cradles a 45
( ) This may be going overboard, but baked him a cake
Muslim's don't celebrate with cake
Don't be so literal
Everyone likes cake
It's not too late for you to come, you know
It will be fun
: - Maya sits in front of a series of monitors
She watches a live Predator feed
don't want to be a straphangar
It's your show
You were the first to see the potential in this
(
) Come on
We've got lots of wine
The target on Maya's monitor disappears in a puff of smoke
Cool
Bring me back a bottle
(
) will
: Jessica pours two glasses of wine and raises a toast to her colleague,
Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11
To big breaks and the little people that make them happen
Clink
46
(') So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit
and  think the money is persuasive
25 million dollars
That buys a new life
Do you think he might be exaggerating his access
Possibly
But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise
In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden
And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table,  think he gives up the Big Man
And if he doesn't, we kill him
: - The same gathering as the day before, waiting under the merciless sun
:  30, 2009 Jessica turns to her crew, which includes , a young operative, , a Jordanian intelligence agent, and the base's   , among others
They rehearse the impending meeting
So John
(John turns to her) When he arrives, 'll set the tone, and then 'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection
Roger that
Then Lauren,  know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks
We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty gritty
47
Jessica turns to Zied
(') Is that order okay, or do you want to introduce everyone
'll introduce you, and you introduce your team
He knows this is a high level meeting
Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building
Right
And Lauren
Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that
Be concise
The Director is in the loop
And wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President
Yeah, 'm on it
They take in the possibilities
Now,  just need to get Balawi's ass down here
- Waiting and waiting
No cars approach
The sun beats down
: - Several hundred yards before the Camp entrance is a beat-up The car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesn't proceed
(to the Security Gyard) Why are there gate guards there
We talked about this, no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives
You might have spooked him already
Procedures only work if we follow them every time
48
This time is different - 'm sorry can't explain, but it's for a good cause
Look, 'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay
It's not just about you
just need them to go away for a minute
You can search him as soon as he gets here
The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio: ( ) All stations, go ahead and stand down
( ) Roger
- The guards move away from their post
The sedan drives past the gate into a maze of barriers
We follow the car as it navigates the maze of  barriers, kicking up a cloud of dust
- Jessica runs back to her team and flashes a thumbs up
She smiles and pulls out her phone, sending a text
:  : He's here
Brb : Cool
The car navigates the second set of barriers
- '  - Maya types on her computer: Wassup you talking yet 49
- Jessica looks up to see the car approaching and puts the phone back in her pocket
The sedan is now 50 yards away
Okay, he's coming
We're gonna search him when he gets here
Everyone prepares
The car gets closer and closer, a driver in front and a passenger in back
- ' Maya texts again: Answer when you can
- The sedan pulls to a stop
taps on the backseat window
Balawi exits on the passenger side
His free hand is in his pocket
(to the other guard) Is he supposed to limp like that
Take your hand out of your pocket
Hey
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar (raising his M4) Get you hand out of your pocket
Allahu Akbar
Jessica's smile fades And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket and the resulting shrapnel storm pulps the crowd, massacring them all - : 50
,   - Maya looks at her computer screen
She sees her last instant message
And waits for a response
Beat
Maya looks up, concern on her face
: - The explosion smoke still hovers over Camp Chapman
News reporting of the attack plays over the horrific image
- '  - Maya huddles on the floor under the corner of her desk
'  - The office has thinned out, and most people have gone home for the day
Maya is crouched in the corner
wounded animal
Jeremy, the case officer from the conference room, approaches and gives Maya a computer disc
You okay
No response
(') didn't think this day could get any worse, but bad news from Saudi intelligence
The courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead
It's a detainee video
Maya still fighting to contain her grief, takes the file as an almost welcome distraction
She puts the disc into her computer and hits play
:   being interviewed by a holds the photo of Abu Ahmed we've seen so many times
He's dead, in Afghanistan, 2001 buried him with my own hands
Where

Kabul
Maya stares at the screen
don't believe this
Sorry, Maya,  always liked this lead
Jeremy leaves Maya at her computer
She continues to stare at the screen
'  - Maya is still by herself
Her friend Jack approaches - () Hey
Sorry,  just got here
What are you gonna do
'm going to smoke everybody involved in this op, and then 'm going to kill bin Laden
Off the darkness in her eyes we - : -   - The staff has gathered to hear a word from the boss in a large conference room; it's packed shoulder to shoulder with dozens of people, including Maya, Jim, Jack, Hakim, and Bradley at the front

() 52
(') If you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working Al Qaeda, want you to know that you're wrong
This is it
There's no working group coming to the rescue
He stares at his staff
(') There's nobody else, hidden away on some other floor
There is just us
And we are failing
We're spending billions of dollars
People are dying
We're still no closer to defeating our enemy
: (') They attacked us on land in 98, by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001
They murdered three thousand of our citizens in cold blood, and they've slaughtered our forward deployed
And what the fuck have we done about it
( ) What have we done
() We have twenty leadership names and we've only eliminated four of them
Beat
(') want targets
Do your fucking jobs, bring me people to kill
- The office has grown bigger and busier and the cubicle maze is filled with many new faces of young agents excited to be in Pakistan
Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing a report
She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago
This is
Hi
painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this
53
She hands Maya a file
(') It's him
He was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed
They told us to watch out for him, apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to
() He was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco en route to Kuwait
Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti
This must be Abu Ahmed
Doesn't matter, but  wish  had that five years ago
How come never saw it before
Nobody saw it, most likely
There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and
() Things got lost in the shuffle
Human error
Maya turns her attention back to the   and as Debbie keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of of Al Qaeda personnel
While a few of the men are African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly beards
(') ( ) Anyway  thought you should know about it
() just want to say 've heard a lot about you
You inspired me to come to Pakistan
Maya's eyes narrow
She keeps looking at the (') Maybe you'll let me buy you a kabob sometime
54
() Don't eat out
It's too dangerous
Maya stares at the Al Quaeda mugshots - a thought crosses her mind
: -   - Maya on the speaker phone to Daniel
We intercut
Daniel is now a suit in Langley
( ) Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed
Fuck
Really
( ) He was in the files this whole time
The family name is Sayeed
Ok, but he's dead
So doesn't that make him a little less interesting to you
He may not be
We now know that Abu Ahmed is one of eight brothers
All the brothers in the family look alike
Three of them went to Afghanistan
Isn't it possible that when the three eldest brothers grew beards in Afghanistan, they started to look alike
think the one calling himself Abu Ahmed is still alive
The picture we've been using is wrong
It's of his older brother, Habeeb
He's the one that's is dead
Okay, what are you basing this on
- We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed dying
() 55
(') We just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed
But if somebody as important as Abu Ahmed had died, they'd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place
Plus, the detainee said that Habeeb died in 2001
We know that Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar
That means it's probably one of the other brothers that's dead
In other words, you want it to be true
Yes,  fucking want it to be true
Maya slams the desk
Calm down
Beat
am calm
State your request
Move heaven and earth and bring me this fucking Sayeed family's phone number
: ,     - ,
- dark (window shades down) executive office, where in the shadows a white American man in a nice suit is kneeling on a prayer rug and saying the Islamic daily prayers
Daniel waits as the man recites the prayers and presses his pale forehead to the carpet
This is
He is the head of the agency's    (George's boss)
As-Salamu alaykum

Alaykum salam
need a couple hundred thousand
Four max
Where you gonna get that
From you
You think so
This could crack open the facilitator Maya's been looking for by giving us a phone number
() She's your killer, Wolf
You put her on the field
(reciting a phrase from the , in Arabic, then loosely ) Allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk
nods
If the blatant attempt to play on his Muslim belief bothers him, he doesn't show it at all
As you know, Abu Ghraib and Gitmo fucked us
The detainee program is now fly paper
We got senators jumping out of our asses, and the Director is very concerned
They will not stop until they have a body
There it is
The quid pro quo
There's a reason he's called The Wolf
Daniel considers all that he'll go through if he volunteers to be the fall guy for the controversial program
ran it
'll defend it

After a few sips of his drink
It's good to be back in Kuwait
It's good to see you again, it's been awhile
The businessman doesn't answer
(') need a favor
Why should  help you
Because we're friends
You say we are friends
How come you only call me when you need help
But when  need something - you are too busy to pick up the phone don't think we are friends
Fair enough
How about a V10 Lamborghini
How's that for friendship
-   - They wait while a Lamborghini , disheveled, clearly just awakened, unlocks the door of the dealership
(to the Kuwaiti ) The poor fucker had to get out of bed
(to the Salesman) As-salamu alaykum
Thanks my friend
They step inside and the salesman flicks on the lights revealing shiny cars displayed like jewels on rotating 58
platforms
While the Kuwaiti businessman peers inside a silver model, Daniel confers with the salesman like he's bought twenty of these cars
Is this a Balboni
Fuck me
This is nice
What are you thinking
think 'll choose this one
The salesman retreats to a back office
That's a nice choice, my friend
Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper
Who is it
Who do you think
The guy's a terrorist
His mother lives here
just need her phone number
There will be no repercussions in Kuwait
Somebody might die at some point in Pakistan
They shake hands
: - : Sound graphs of phone calls fill the screen
We cruise through rows upon rows of server facilities, a single monitor in front traces a call to Rawalpindi, Pakistan
: -    - Maya chews on a peanut butter & jelly sandwich
Jack calls her on her cell
Hey, Jack
59
You're not gonna like this, he's on the phone, but there's no team to deploy right now
Fuck
She dashes out runs down the hall to an Exit sign - bursts through the door to a staircase - - Flies down the staircase - down to another floor, barges through the door - -   - The station's surveillance team leader, , unstraps his flack vest
He looks like the kind of guy you don't mess with
so of course Maya barges into his space like a locomotive
How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi
For one thing, it's dangerous
For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence
That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time
Still, it wouldn't work
Why
The guy never stays on the phone long enough
You haven't tried
Look,  don't have the personnel
60
That's bullshit
As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan
Larry pushes past her to leave, and she follows him
Right,  understand
But  don't really care if your guys get sleep or not
Maya looks at Larry's team sleeping on the couch
- The conversation continues in the bar, for Maya has not relented, although the tone is softer now
She offers Larry a beer
He takes it
This guy you're obsessed with, what's his name again
Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti is the nom de guerre
His true name, we think, is Ibraheem Sayeed
His family lives in Kuwait
Wasn't it, like, eight brothers - and a million cousins - that we know about - anyone could be calling home - know - - It's not like he's saying, "Hey mom, it's me, the terrorist
" Over the course of two months, he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice
And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied
He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception -- implying he was in the Tribals -- but he was in () 61
(') a market in Peshawar
'm sorry, but that's not normal guy behavior
That's tradecraft
Maybe he just doesn't like his mom
() Look, if he talks about an operation, or refers to anything remotely fishy, 'll get on him
Okay
No
Not okay
Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone: he works for bin Laden
The guys that talk about ops on the phone don't get that job
Larry looks away
(') lot of my friends have died trying to do this
() believe  was spared so  could finish the job
The girl is a true believer - as pure as they come
Larry looks at her
Her sincerity is persuasive
And just like that, he decides to help her
: - , Hakim walks through a crowded call center
Larry joins him from a back entrance
They look around: nothing
- Hakim parks in front of the Rawal Call Center
-  - The call center is arranged into two rows of cubby-holes, each separated by a privacy wall
Hakim searches the place, finds nothing
: : News reports of the attemped  bombing
62
(
) It is in surveillance video and pictures like this of the explosive- laden vehicle just moments before it was parked, that police hope to find the man who wanted so badly last night to leave a body count in Times Square
: The  news report continues playing in the bg
Bradley is moving as fast down a hallway
Coming towards him like a shark from the other end of the hallway: Maya
Bradley looks determined not to deal with her right now, and lowers his head, but she spreads her arms slightly and basically blocks his passage through the hallway really need to talk to you about beefing up our surveillance operation on the caller
We don't have a surveillance operation on the caller
(turning to Maya) Someone just tried to blow up Times Square and you're talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working with Al Qaeda
Maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability to bend Bradley to her will
He's the key to bin Laden
don't fucking care about bin Laden
care about the next attack
You're going to start working on American Al Qaeda cells
Protect the homeland
bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland
() 63
(') If it wasn't for him, Al Qaeda would still be focused on overseas targets
If you really want to protect the homeland, you need to get bin Laden
() This guy never met bin Laden
This guy is a free lancer working off the fucking internet
No one has even talked to bin Laden in four years: he's out of the game, he may well even be dead but you know what you're doing
You're chasing a ghost while the whole fucking network grows all around you
For a moment she is silenced by Bradley's reprimand but then Maya's obsession speaks for her - and like a woman possessed she recklessly goes at him: You just want me to nail some low level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in Pakistan you got a real terrorist
But the truth is you don't understand Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda
Either give me the team  need to follow this lead, or the other thing you're gonna have on your resume is being the first Station Chief to be called before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin Laden
You're fucking out of your mind
need four techs in a safe house in Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in Peshawar
Either send them out or send me back to  and explain to the Director why you did it
: - Maya, despondent, sits at the bar, drinking a beer
64
Jack approaches
Fuck the mom, we got the man himself
Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter
(') Yesterday your caller bought himself a cell phone
And every time his phone rings - (he taps the cell ) - This phone will ring
Did  hook you up
Maya throws her arms around him
love you
: -  - Larry drives his team around the narrow streets of Rawalpindi
In the backseat, the   studies his laptop-like tracking device
My guess is that he lives close to where he's making the calls, and it makes sense he'd be living in Rawalpindi because there's an Al Jezerra office there
- We focus on a  of Pakistan on the wall
Maya is indicating neighborhoods in Rawalpindi
She's briefing Bradley, Hakim, Larry and a few other people
It would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if he's sending either from bin Laden or from an intermediary
When he wants to make a call, he leaves the house, walks a few blocks, then switches on the phone
We need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him
65
/  - Larry is at the wheel, moving slowly through a dangerous part of town
The streets narrow
Two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of Larry's van and stop
The riders pull out guns
- We got a shooter
Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind them, and Larry slams on the brakes
The  raises an M4
We're blocked
Let me talk to them
Hakim gets out of the car and walks toward the men
We can't hear what they're saying
At last, Hakim comes back to the car
They said white faces don't belong here
If they don't move, shoot them
tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave
-  -   - On a large wall map, Maya circles "Peshawar" in red

The Geo Locator starts to  - a blinking red light

They slow to a crawl
The , stuck in traffic
Can't move
Larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market - -  - It's packed
All  - most with traditional beards worn by Al Qaeda members - many talking on cell phones
Impossible to tell who is who
Impossible to find this needle in a haystack
: -   - The search continues
Hakim prowls a back alley
Then goes up on a rooftop to survey the activity below
-   - Hakim is on a street corner conducting surveillance
We follow him into a crowd and then lose sight
We find him again, another street, another fruitless search
As Hakim goes from street to street, we hear: We got a signal on Tipu Road for ten minutes
Then he went to Umar Road for five minutes

Who's that
'm saying that's Bushra
The brother's wife
How do you know the gender
78
(points on screen, to a thin line) This is a clothes-line here, for laundry
Men don't mess with the wash
We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back to the house
(') It takes her about four seconds to move from there to the front door
So she's on the older side
What's that up there
(pointing to the other ) Those are kids
They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks
( ) You can see their height relative to this - these are cows - so they're probably between seven and nine
Boys
Another  comes out of the house and moves to the clothes- line and grabs some laundry
Your female is moving fast
That's what  wanted to show you
(to the Imagery ) Can we pause this please
( ) That's not the same lady
That's female #3
So you found two males, three females
That's correct
Maya suddenly gets it
79
You're missing a male
Yes we are
Wow

- George is on one side of a conference table, on the other side is the    , , and the If there are three females, there ought to be three males
Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands
We think there's a third family living in the house
:   - So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do  just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him
Hope
Hope is not a targeting layer
You give up your hope right now
We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there
We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall

One of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to the children
We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of discovery
() 80
(') We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply - 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting
We've looked for ways of collecting available from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash
We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood
lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away
(') That didn't work out
We thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter
What was wrong with that, exactly
He looks up
What was wrong with that
The sample would be too diluted
And it's asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone
They don't make telephone calls from the compound
We pulled the cell tower nearby
And 'm also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white and drive around a bit and we could see him
Don't they get groceries
The unidentified third male does not get groceries
He does not leave the compound
He does not present himself for photographs
() 81
(') When he needs fresh air, he paces around beneath a grape arbor, but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views
This is a professional attempt to avoid detection - real tradecraft
The only people we've seen behave this way are other top level Al Qaeda operatives
The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant who slides a big folder across his desk to George
We did a Red Team on your analysis
According to them, this behavior could belong to someone other than Al Qaeda
They did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior Al Qaeda operative
But they also said there's a thirty-five percent chance he's a Saudi drug (reading from the ) fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers
Basically, we agree with you, the house screams security, it screams someone who wants privacy, it even screams 'bad guy', but it does not scream bin Laden
You get the point
() If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at least prove it's not somebody else, like a drug dealer
Beat
The meeting is adjourned
As they walk out -- 82
You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program
() Who the hell am  supposed to ask
Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up
He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden
You'll think of something

- The same group around the same conference table
He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs
He has no internet access to the house
He makes no phone calls either in or out
Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money
And if you're going to say he's retired, 'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons
And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production
The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently
83
The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy
He needs proof
: The National Security Advisor and his team file out
George approaches
have to admit,  just don't get the rhythms of politics
You think this is political
If this was political we'd be having this conversation in October when there's an election bump
This is pure risk
Based on deductive reasoning, inference, supposition and the only human reporting you have is six years old, from detainees who are questioned under duress
The political move here is to tell you to go fuck yourself, and remind you that  was in the room when your old boss pitched  Iraq
at least there you guys brought photographs
You know, you're right,  agree with everything you just said
What meant was, a man in your position, how do you evaluate the risk of not doing something, the risk of potentially letting bin Laden slip through your fingers
George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake
(') That is a fascinating question
George walks away
After a beat, the National Security advisor calls after him
Hey
George turns around
The National Security Advisor approaches him

But the President wants to know: if we were going to act, how would we do it
Give us options

The General continues his briefing

But it can hide
Excuse me
Can  ask a question
What do we need this for in Libya
Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non- existent
Maya looks over, not sure what to say
Gentlemen, can  have your attention
My name is George

This is a title fifty operation
() 85
(') Some of us have worked together before
This is a good one
Maya, do you want to brief them
Maya looks at the SEALs
Folds her arms
This isn't going to be easy
There are two narratives about the location of Osama bin Laden
This registers on the SEALs
(') The one that you're most familiar with is that  is hiding in a cave in the Tribal Areas, that he's surrounded by a large contingent of loyal fighters
Beat
(') But that narrative is pre- 9/11 understanding of
The second narrative is that he's living in a city - living in a city with multiple points of egress and entries and with access to communications so that he can keep in touch with the organization
You can't run a global network of inter- connected cells from a cave
Beat
(') We've located an individual we believe based on detainee reporting is bin Laden's courier
He's living in a house in Abbottabod, Pakistan
And we assess that one of the other occupants of the house is
Excuse me
You got an intel source on the ground
No
86
No
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden
We've been on this op before, you know
Bin Laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world
By locating the courier, we've located bin Laden
That's really the intel
That's it
Quite frankly,  didn't even want to use you guys, with your dip and your velcro and all your gear bullshit
wanted to drop a bomb but people didn't believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb, so they're using you guys as canaries on the theory that if bin Laden isn't there, you can sneak away and no one will be the wiser
() But bin Laden is there - and you're going to kill him for me
() Bullets are cheap
: - '  - George is shaking his head as he talks to Wolf
They are nervous downtown
don't think we'll get approval this decision cycle
They look up and notice that Maya is standing outside George's office staring at them through the glass
She angrily wipes the number 128 off the window and changes it to 129
Wolf nods
It's her against the world
87
Oh yeah

We've spun up the SEALs - we've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound, and the collection is not going to get any better
We have to keep working it
You're going to come into work one day, and there's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale' sign in front of that compound
George drops his tray down
Maya, you didn't prove it

At the far end of the table are back benchers, including Maya
'm about to go look the President in the eye and what 'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing
Now, very simply
Is he there or is he not fucking there
He looks to the Deputy Director
We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences remember Iraq  very clearly, fronted that and  can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case
88
Yes or no
We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability
'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there
The  Director points to Wolf
concur
Sixty percent
'm at eighty percent
Their is what convinces me
You guys ever agree on anything
Well,  agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and  spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows
Maya shoots Daniel a look
What a traitor
(') 'd say it's a soft sixty, sir
'm virtually certain there's some high value target there, 'm just not sure it's bin Laden
The  Director leans back in his chair
This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it
'd like to know what Maya thinks
We're all incorporating her assessment into ours
Maya can't take it anymore: One hundred percent, he's there - okay, fine, ninety-five percent because  know certainty freaks you guys out - but it's a hundred

, The gate charges go off
only to reveal a   behind the gate
That's not a door
Failed breach
They hustle to the next entry way and prepare another breach : - The   hears that the SEALs outside are preparing a charge
radios in (
) ( ) This is Echo 11, we're going to breach the main gate
( ) Negative
'm internal, 'll let you in
The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs walk inside
As a group, they move towards the main house, arriving at the South side front door
The door is open and they enter - - Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights, the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway
Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes, greet them like the innards of a haunted house
One of the 's catches movement:  figure with an -47 scrambling through clutter, then disappearing around a corner
Abrar
The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, , re-appears at the end of the hallway
He pokes his head out - 100
- And is shot by Justin
He falls out of view, whimpering in pain
-    - Justin walks quickly to Abrar
-     - is down, bleeding
- Justin fires another round into Abrar as '  comes flying in from the sleeping quarters and shields him with her body
- Justin shoots her
She falls
Abrar is underneath her - he is still breathing, gasping and - Justin shoots him again, silencing him - Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition - Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes
- Justin turns away -    - Justin and a  proceed down the hall to the heavy gate that blocks access to the stairway while another stays behind
Somewhere, children are screaming
Shut those fucking kids up
the kids quiet down
(') Talk to me
There's no fucking way we want to blow this thing
The gate is solid
(
) ( ) This is Echo 11 - we're at our primary set point, prepping to breach
( ) Wait, Echo 11 - we're internal on the south side - this is a negative breach
101
( ) Roger
We're ready to make our entry out here
( ) Roger that, we're coming to meet you
(to the Breacher) Stay with these kids
Don't let them in the back room
: - In the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house, Justin and Patrick find themselves side by side - and the old friends take a moment to reconnect while the rest of the team places charges and prepares for the next phase of the assault
() You good
Yeah
forgot
were we supposed to crash that helo
Patrick allows himself a smile
Ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door
popped him from the outside
fucking smoked Abrar and his wife
( ) (alt:  think she was ) Still alive
She's gonna bleed out
What a fuckin' mess - The door blows - and they keep moving - 102
-    - The SEALs reach the staircase, which is sealed off by a separate metal gate than the one inside the hallway
Breacher up
charge is prepared
Justin, who is now inside one of the side rooms, sees Jared standing close to the door
Hey man, move
Jared moves just as - - - Boooom
-- The door  like a missile right into where Jared had been standing
( ) Thanks
Yeah
: -     - Saber goes up the staircase, Patrick following closely behind him, climbing up to see - -   - man ducks out of sight
Saber calls to him
Khaled
Saber waits with his carbine raised
Anxiety crosses his face
He's vulnerable here, an easy target if Khaled were to come out blasting
(') : 103
Khaled hears his name being called from below
few feet away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded -47
He goes to the gun and picks it up
He hears his name again, "Khaled
" And the voice sounds friendly, urgent
Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and heads back to the sound of his name
Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the stairway and fires - killing him instantly
Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb the staircase leading to the third floor
: - The neighborhood, awakened by the crash and gunfire, stirs to life
Hakim and the SEALs notice  flipping on
And down the block, a group of several young men appear on a roof
(raising his weapon) This is Echo 05, 've got unknowns gathering on the Southwest Rooftops
Hakim, move those guys back
(speaking in Pashto) Go back brothers, this is official government business, and there is nothing to see here
'm going to start wasting them
Please
They will kill you
The onlookers pause
aiming lasers dance across their chests
(') They will kill you
They turn and go
104
-   - - SEALs clear the  floor as women and children flow into the hallway
grabs one of the wives and pulls her out into the hallway, while another female disappears behind a large , and he grabs her too
-   - Justin opens a file cabinet, stuffed with documents
Saber is climbing the stairs, gun up, towards the third floor, when he sees a flash of movement across the landing above him
He stops climbing and - ( ) Osama
Osama
Beat
Beat
Sweat on Saber's face (') Osama
man appears at the end of the third floor hallway
-- Ssssht
a bullet strikes him in the head - knocking him back into a bedroom - Saber fires again, missing - And proceeds down the hallway, going full speed now, Patrick right behind him, sprinting into the bedroom ' Two women stand at the entrance of the room
Saber rushes them and with a football tackle, slams them into the wall
Patrick enters the room and fires several rounds into the man on the floor
( ) Possible jackpot
The women Saber is restraining are wailing, struggling to get to their husband, as a ten year-old boy rushes up to the body
105
Patrick pushes him away and kneels down to get a better look at the body
(') ( ) Dude, do you realize what you just did
: -    - questions the wives
( ) Who is he
He is al Noori Hasan
(shouting back to ) She says it's not him
Talk to a kid
Jared kneels down next to a nine year-old girl huddled in the corner and snaps open a chem light
He gives her the glowing green wand
( ) Daughter, what is his name
The girl makes no reply
: - - (
) (through the radio) For God and Country, Geronimo
Maya gasps
- The Commanding Officer issues orders
106
( ) All Stations: target secure, target secure
- ( ) Roger
Copy
Target Secure
(
) Target Secure - commence
- Justin flicks on the lights
Moving fast he picks up a tower and throws it to the floor, cracking it open, rips out the   and tosses that into the bag
As we pull back and realize the enormity of the task in front of him - The lights show an organized office, crammed with information, stacks of files, disks, video equipment
Twenty years of jihad
(to his team) Do not leave a hard drive
The SEALs gather everything they can
- Saber walks down the staircase in a daze
We stay with him as he descends, noting the faraway look in his eyes - -   - Saber walks into the office where the  (Sensitive Sight Exploitation) is underway
( ) What's up
shot the third floor guy
Good for you
You want to help
107
Justin tosses him an  bag
: - - The command team studies their monitors
52
( ) inbound
: The   is talking on two radios at once - one to his men, the other to brass back at Jalalabad base
( ) Echo 05, this is Red 02, how long do you need for
- ( ) At least ten minutes
( ) You have four
- ( ) This is a gold mine,  need more time than that
( ) If you're not at the  in four, 'm going to leave your ass behind
- Justin yells to his team
108
Four minutes
: Hakim arrives at the crashed helo
He crawls into the interior and finds a
We follow this bag: Hakim jogs into the main house with the  , and through his , we see slow down for the first time since the raid began, noting the destruction: - blood stains on the walls, - Bodies pierced with bullets, - Wailing children
( ) Where do you need the bag
(
) Third floor
: - SEALs roll the body into the  as Patrick and another collect articles of interest
Two SEALs zip up the bag and carry it out
Just as
- Justin's team leaves the office
- The body bag is laid in the courtyard
- The   slides into the belly of Prince 51
While he places charges, another  climbs up to affix charges to the roof and rotors
and like a tight roper, he walks out on the tail of the helicopter, when suddenly his foot slips, piercing the tail's thin skin, and he nearly falls off
He manages to place a last charge - but the remainder of the tail piece will not be detonated
109
- Back at the whirling helicopter, the SEALs shove the into the interior compartment and jump in after it
The helo rises into the night
: - 51 explodes, sending shrapnel and a fireball high into the air /  52 - The SEALs watch the flames as the compound shrinks beneath -   - The fire of the exploded crashed helo blazes in the night
52 - The SEALs sit silent in the cabin, body bag at their feet
: -     - Bathed in the bright white lights, Maya waits for the helo
Concern on her face
At last, she hears it
moment later,  52 hovers into view and lands
Patrick and several SEALs run out, carrying the bag
The place is swarming with , SEALs, and  agents with large bio-metric scanners - loud shouting everywhere: "mark media, first floor, who has a pen, etc
" Maya makes her way towards the hangar tent
She pushes through the busy SEALs
Maya sees it now - way in the corner of the hangar
110
She walks and walks towards the bag
She is alone with it now
She unzips the : Maya
Seven years telescoping to this moment
The end of a journey
She stares at the body for a moment then turns to look across the room where   meets her eye
She nods
( ) Sir, the agency expert gave a visual confirmation
Yes, Sir, the girl
Hundred percent
Maya gazes at the bloodied face, then turns away and zips the bag
and leaves the tent
Her eyes afire
: - Maya waits on the tarmac, alone
-17, one of the largest most impressive planes in the American fleet, rolls to a stop and the hatch opens
She climbs the ladder - -17 - The cavernous cargo plane is empty of passengers
The pilot motions to the seats
Are you Maya
Yeah
That's the only name they gave me
() You can sit wherever you want, you're the only one on the manifest
111
Maya sits down, buckles in
The  heads back to the (') You must be pretty important, you got the whole plane to yourself
Beat
(') Where do you want to go
She's speechless
Overwhelmed
Finally, she lets go
Those luminous eyes become pools of relief and pain
