confidence by Doug Jung First Draft March 2000 : (
) So 'm dead
: -  -  () Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage
pillar of steam rises from an underground grate
It's the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids
We see  , a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run for Congress some day
At first glance
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution style
His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling in a strawberry field
(
) And  think it's because of this redhead
(
) Know who  am, Jake
The Anti-Christ
(
) No
'm not the Anti-Christ
Or the Prince of Darkness
'm just a guy looking for some answers
There's the   "" of a gun being cocked
The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull
The voice and the gun belong to  (40's)
With his suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a "Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch"
(cont' d) Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake
Gee
What makes you say that
Your life flashing before your eyes
Just the last three weeks
() 2
: That's not a bad place to start
: -  - Title: Three Weeks Ago
The same alley
The door of a building bursts open as (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles out breathing heavy
The dim light of a bare bulb glares off the sweat on his forehead
moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying a large black revolver
lost my head
'm
Sorry
don't know what happened
-y-you fucking shot him
That's what happened
had to
That motherfucker was about to welch
You saw what he was doing, right
You heard him
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically
can't be here
You understand can' t-- Listen to me
It went to shit
It happens sometimes
In the distance,    , growing louder
Oh Jesus
to me
We don't have much time
We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me
Jake takes a tentative step forward
Lionel sees a on Jake's shirt and recoils
The   , Jake turning his head towards it
() 3
: What-- What do we do
Help me
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of
: - dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar
single overweight  sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he
Jake and, Lionel Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway
, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar
Placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money
lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood
Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in disbelief
Come on
Grab his arms
Lionel stands frozen
Jake, drops the dead guy's legs with a
Lionel
He's dead
Yeah, maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it
Help me
Grab his arms
The   grow
Tick-tock
If you wanna help, then help
If not, shut up
Your mess
Then shut up
My place
() 4
: Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set Jake off again
Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles
Oh please
Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under the bar
(cont' d) You think this kinda shit hasn't happened here before
Given it's usually on Thursdays
And usually,  gotta tell the cops, "No, Officer
didn't really get a good look at the shooters
" Usually anyway
(without looking up) didn't see nothing
And  swear if you let me go now,  won't say- Relax, porkchop
The   sound like they're right outside
can't be here
Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles
Then go
Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money
What about
The money
What about this situation makes you think  can answer that question right now
Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the He runs for the door without a second thought
T0: 5
-  / - Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to street-level just as a    to a halt in front of the bar, lights flashing,
On the door is the emblem for the Lionel does his best to look casual as jump out of the car and rush the Euclid
One of the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner-- (
) Everybody
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a full sprint down the street
: - , a middle aged cop with a couple of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun drawn, in a dramatic stance
(yelling) said, freeze you motherfucking, cocksucking, scumbags
The second middle aged cop, comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski
We're clear
Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him
(still yelling) Or 'll blow off every one of your fucking heads
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing
We     Jake, Miles and   (the Patron) sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy
Stop waving that thing around
You sure we're clear
() 6
: Guy looked like he was trying not to shit himself
(re: the Dead Guy) Nice
What took so fucking long
The Dead Guy stirs-- , late 20's, dressed in a blood soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face
/ 've been lying in this shit like half the night
You guys were late
We had to go to a Mexican stand-off
And you know  hate guns
Jake tosses the revolver on the bar
We were fighting crime
Keeping the city streets safe for drug dealers and pedophiles everywhere
Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases
Gordo strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib
Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood
nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was
Shit
told you, use less powder
But you won't get that splatter effect
Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the pile
() 7
: Then these go into your cut
Big Al moves over to the bar
Hey, Jake
When am  gonna get to play the Inside
Gordo plays the inside
You're the Shill
Yeah, but come on
All  get to do is cry and get insulted
What are you talking about
You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do
(off Al's smile) We got it down cold, Al
You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you
' m gonna go get eggrolls
Anyone want eggrolls
Al slaps Jake on the back and exits
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder
What
can feel you looking at me
That's a lot of cash
He came up with it pretty quick
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead
Did you see how fast he ran out of here
It's done
He's not coming back
guess
gotta drop a dime
Did anybody mess up the hoop
It's clean
Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway
() 8
: Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands them to Rottovich and Sobozinski
Ten percent
You guys got sack, 'll give you that much
Confidence
It's just confidence
Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their newly padded pockets
(patting his pocket) Feels a little light, Jake
Next time we're in for twenty
Twenty
My ass
What are you talking about
Ten's standard
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture
We got a good thing going here
You want to blow it over an overbite
Don't get me wrong, Jake
like you boys
You guys are the steadiest business in town
But what can  say
Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down
You guys got sack
Was that a threat
Did  hear a threat
() 9
: (cont' d) Last  remember, we were talking economics, then this
What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street
Well, shit
Then we gotta pass the call to someone else
Sobozinski and Rottovich exit
(shaking his head) Cops
: -  () Butch shaking his head, still holding the gun
Grifters
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself
It's all about the money, isn't it
Isn't it always
: -   - suite in the upscale hotel
Miles answers a  on the door-- An expensive   stands at the door in an overcoat
(
) It's what makes us run
And despite what they say, it can buy you love
Are you ready for me, Ralph
She lets the overcoat fall open, revealing her lack of clothing
: -  - Gordo stands in front of a mirror trying on a new suit
The sales people fawn over him
() 10
: (
) It can buy you a new and better you
just don't know if this says, "me"
What's the fabric
: -  ' - Big Al has a cordless phone to his ear
(
) It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist
It's Alfonse
want to settle up haven't been ducking you
told you 'd get it
Big Al picks up a  -  and leafs through it while on the phone
: -  - Jake walks down the crowded street, passing the bars and restaurants of SoHo
His jacket's buttoned up to hide the blood stains
(
) It can make you think you're on top of the world
Jake passes a group of well-dressed, well manicured people waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called "Wax
" Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at the moment
An outsider
An attractive blonde in her late twenties, , bumps into Jake
(innocently) Oops
She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return
They stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked away by an  , dressed in an expensive suit
() 11
: Jake's smile fades as he watches her saunter into the bar, but not before she throws him another glance over her shoulder
Jake continues on into
: -  - semi-crowded bar
Not hip and trendy like "Wax
" Jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders a drink
He takes a second to look around at the cliques of people talking, laughing, having a good time before he pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket
Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword section
(
) And if you believe that money can do all that for you, you're the perfect mark
Jack Kerouac said that if you own a rug, you own too much
don't necessarily like Kerouac and driving cross country isn't exactly my idea of a good time, but the guy's got a point
Jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle
: - ' - Jake enters a sparsely furnished loft
The skyline of Brooklyn twinkles through dirty, picturesque windows
Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an answering machine
You have no new messages
(
) If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose
And when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always gotta remember how much of it's just luck
Jake stands his sparse little world, addressing the quiet before he fishes for his wallet, which he can't find
(
) Oops
() 12
: The realization makes Jake smile
Then a   spins him around to see a , flapping up against the inside of a partially opened window
Visibly upset by the bird, Jake moves towards the window and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to escape
Dumb fucking luck
Jake stares out the window after the bird
T0: - ' - nicer apartment than Jake's
Lionel Dolby, the Mark from the Euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase
There's a  on the door that stops Lionel dead in his tracks
Another
Lionel still frozen
The door flies open with a
In the doorway, we see , an older mountain      of a man dressed in a plain black suit
Behind him is        (late-20's), dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could      spot from 20,000ft
Mr
Dolby
King would like a word with you
-r-right now
Please
We have a car waiting apologize for the door
T0: - ' - Jake stirs on the futon oddly placed on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the phone
Yeah
(
) You better get over to Al's
Now
() 13
: Miles hangs up before Jake can answer
: -  '- Jake stand's with Miles in the sparse living room
Big 's body sits reclining on a Lazy Boy chair, eyes bulging open
An open carton of food rests in his lap
feast of take-out Chinese surrounds him
The  blares an old episode of "The Little Rascals
" There's a singed, neat bullet hole in his forehead
was supposed to meet him for breakfast
He likes that new  they just opened, you know
He likes to order that thing
The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got
Miles
Sorry
'm just
Look what they did to him
Right in the middle of his egg- foo-young
Big Al stares up at them with those bulging, vacant eyes, his mouth hanging open
Jake reaches down and grabs the remote control and turns the  off
(
) Big Al used to send money to his Father, some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a  hospital in Cleveland
Al was like that
That's why Al never played the Inside
: - - Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake and Miles
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night
They just pulled him out of the East River
Well, this is just fucking great
() 14
: It gets worse
Now  know     why he was such a good rope
mean,     cash
That much and we never had    to put him on the "Send
" Turns out     this ducking Moe was an accountant for    the King Pin
Gordo throws Jake a hard look, letting the news sink in
Jake can only slump back into the booth
Who's that
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money
He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday
`Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo
" What's a King Pin
Gordo looks to Jake, but can see that he's still processing the information
Currently, the King Pin is a very large- type pole stuck up our asses
Mob
Independant
Same shit, just independant
They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book
Big
Fat
Bald
So what
We hide, right
(shaking his head) What are you
New
Let me tell you how good this guy is
Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up
Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month
So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right
What does Al do
() 15
: (cont'd) Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond
Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop
No
He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole -type
How  fleeced
You're pissed we didn't get credit
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said
Except anybody that's ever met Big A1 knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating
This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and-- -  ' - Big Al sits on the Lazy Boy, about to take a big bite of egg foo young
He stops as the front door is kicked open with a
(
) Shazaam
Big Al's eyes grow huge as we hear a
(coat' d) Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young
The whole thing took about two and a half hours
That's how good he is
We sure Big Al threw him to us
Come on
All three of them turn their attention out the window
They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if any one of them is looking back
bird flew into my house last night
Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to respond
() 16
: (cont'd) It's bad luck
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split
We'll meet up anywhere
Akron or Austin or Atlanta
Anywhere
He'll find us
We go talk to him
Whoa
What
We're going to give him the money back
You know what we're doing with the money
And what about Big Al
Leave him
Someone's going to find him eventually
Then they'll start looking for us, too
approaches
What can  get you guys
Coffee
And a valium
Jake turns his attention out the window
: -  -- basement bar in a crummy neighborhood
There's no sign, but everything about it says, "Condemned
" (
) The Euclid was our place
: 17
-  - Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at the bar of the run down watering hole
Jake stands placing neat stacks of money into a Fed-Ex box
(
) Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a card game
We used it every now and then for a rag, but mostly it was our office
Our Power Point
Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of money from their pockets
It's not as much as Jake put in
That's it
/ Bills
/Had that thing
Shaking his head, Jake seals the Fed--Ex box, then hands the form to Miles and
Picks up the phone
(cont'd) Do we want insurance
(off their looks) 'm just asking
Just mail it to the hospital
(dialing) Mr
King, please
It's regarding an accounting problem
Yes
Correct
know where it is
That will be fine
Thank you
Jake hangs up the phone
When
Tonight
Just me
Fuck that
We're going too
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second
Is this the best thing to do
Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second
() 18
: Meet me at my place later
How do you know the King's going to let you walk
'm getting a ride
Jake picks up the phone and dials another number
: -   - neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is
police car comes to a stop in front
Rottovich and Sobozinski in the front seats
Jake gets out of the back
The King, huh
Nice going
try
Don't dick around too long
And if he stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding, call a cab because you are not getting back in this car
Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus stand vigil
Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit
We appreciate your punctuality
Mr
King is expecting you
Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake down
Lupus
What
You said pat him down, 'm pattin' him down
Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way
() 19
: It only takes a moment to be polite
My apologies, Mr
Vig
If you wouldn't mind
Jake steps back and raises his arms
You the one that did it
You the one that got Al
Mr
King prefers to farm out for that kind of work
(gesturing to the door) Please, after you
Harlin gives the Officers Sobozinski and Rottovich a slight nod of acknowledgment
: -  - Harlin and Lupus lead Jake through the cavernous gym
All around them, huge, sweaty, boxers work the speed bag, jump rope, spar, etc
There's not one that doesn't look like he's spent some time in the State Penal Boxing League
(a little nervous) Uh
Which one's the King Pin
He's in the back taking a steam
Jake nods and let's out a silent sigh of relief
: -  - huge room filled with steam
Harlin and Lupus stand by the door as Jake cautiously steps in
is being played-- Could be Yanni
Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth robe is
His large body is less fat than just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the baldest head you've ever seen
sits next to the King Pin working on his nails
() 20
: Ow
Watch the pinkie
This isn't so bad
Jake almost has to stifle a laugh
(cont'd) Every time, you get the pinkie and get a hang nail
( to Jake) You Jake
Jake nods and the King motions for the manicurist to leave
Grifter huh
Where have you been on the grift
Couldn't been here long 'cause  would have heard of you, Skippy
Jake
You can call me Jake
Here and there
Here and there, Scooter
Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston
The bay area
Some action in London, `til it turned nickel and dime
Or how about that little stint down in Miami
Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there
You guy's pretty good
have a good crew
Minus one
Jake visibly bristles
Minus one
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket
Good suits, good food
The Underworld of the Underworld
grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts
like that
like the idea of that
These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low
() () 21
: (cont' d) It's all take, take, take
You can' t just be fucking witty about it
guess it lacks a certain style
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find
You can't cheat an honest man
You can't cheat an honest man
But a man like Lionel Dolby
apologize for the inconvenience
The King picks up a long, metal nail file
Honest mistake
Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven
can't do that
Why not
Let me rephrase--  won`t do that
Let me repeat-- Why not
Because you killed one of my crew
Buddy, that was business
Besides, you have more crew
Then there's you
'll get the money back, plus interest
go on the grift for you
You get a cat,  get a cut
And we get square
(laughing) Fucking grifters
love it
You got balls, 'll give you that much
() 22
: No
Just confidence
The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake
' ll be honest with you, Kid grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar --fucking-- suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me
First thing  have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me
You tried it once
We got caught
So you know it won't happen again
With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck
know it won't happen because you're going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team
few pained  from Jake as his knees buckle
Mr
Vig arrived with an escort
The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall
Grifters
Always working  an angle
Alright
can see you got   some vision
But  give you the Mark
tell you the who and you give me the  how
Lupus go with him
Lupus snaps to attention
What
Consider him part of your crew
Consider him a part of me
Jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look
He goes
Now let me see your hands
() 23
: The King picks up the nail file again
Why
You ask a lot of questions
Come on
(motioning with nail file) Let me see `em
Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of him
They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up for the King
(cont' d) don't like to ask things more than once, Junior
want you to know how much that irks me
The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers with the nail file
Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his fingers
Jake shuts his eyes
Then opens them to find the King now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress
You have incredibly soft hands
Good cuticles
They' re like a baby's hands
Grifters with rough hands
You know that they're probably not that good
Means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet
But you
Smooth
Supple
The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own meaty paws
(
) Are you insinuating that the King Pin is of an alternative lifestyle
: -  () Jake shakes his head slowly
'm not saying anything
Besides, you're one to talk
You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley
() 24
: And these cops
What do they get
: -  - Rottovich and Sobozinski sit staked out in front of a small cigar/magazine store
(
) Just a tip
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway
Heroin
What the hell do you do with heroin
You sell it
To who
Don't be an idiot
How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer
If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand
You think this is a good idea
We never did this kinda shit before
What's he going to do
File a missing drugs report
If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns
hooded figure turns a corner onto the street, heading for the Cigar Shop
He wears a knapsack slung over his shoulders
Hope so
Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me
One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up
One fifty
It's not even covered
It's cosmetic
They don't cover cosmetic
() 25
: (cont' d) Last year  had a tooth capped
The dentist tells me 'm not covered for caps
It's cosmetic
: -  - Parked across the street and well hidden among the other parked cars
, a guy in his early 40's in the kind of suit you'd find on a "2--for-1" rack
He sits pointing a   out the window, wearing headphones
He chews on gum loudly
(
from headphones) Bullshit it's cosmetic
My fucking tooth was cracked in half
made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity
The department's dental is for shit
(
from headphones) Whoa, whoa
There he is
We  the     , then Moonan puts down the mic and hits "" on a microcassette recorder
Confessions of a poor brusher
Moonan takes a second to remove his gum, then checks his teeth in the rearview mirror
: - /- Rottovich and Sobozinski walk quickly down the street
Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder
As he gets closer, we see that he's just a  of about ten or eleven
Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid's hood
You know who we are
The heat
() 26
: Rottovich can't help smiling
That's right
We're the heat
(yelling) `
The Kid jumps back startled and throws his hands up
The cops share a laugh
Alright
Put your hands dawn
What do you got in the bag
Something for my Pops
see
Well, your Pops has been making you carry around drugs for him
We're going to have to take them
The Kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack over
Rottovich opens it and pulls out , wrapped in plastic
He nods to Sobozinski
The Kid stays rooted right where he is, looking up at the Detectives like a lost puppy
My Pops is going to be mad
Give the kid a twenty
Sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills for the kid who then sprints away
What's the world coming to
Everybody's on the friggin' take
Rottovich and Sobozinski head off with the knapsack
: - - () Butch and Jake
Keeping the Fix happy
() 27
: You never know when you can use a crooked cop
Keep going
want to know how you got Lionel Dolby
So you want to know how to play the Big Con
In this case, you might say  want to know how not to play the Big Con
Butch shoves the gun a little harder into Jake's head
: - - trendy bar, dimly lit and packed
We  along the hip crowd and  on Jake speaking with a   dressed in black Armani
(
) First thing about being on the grift
You're only as good as your Mark
The Roper's the guy who finds them
Jake buys another round to the indifferent Slick
(
) They all have money one way or another
Some of them come from money
' --- Slick  into a wearing a ten-gallon hat
He doesn't smile
(
) There's that saying-- Show me an honest man and 'll show you a natural born liar
There's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good
It's that little itch on the back of you neck
You may not even know it's there, but it is
The Fat Texan  into a  -type suit, who remains stoic as Jake reaches over for another round of drinks
() 28
: (
) good Roper knows how to scratch it-- You the outdoorsy-type

You play the market

" You saw "the 'Riverdance" twice
" had a roommate in college who was gay

) It means that in fifteen minutes we're on good terms
Thirty, 'm your buddy
Euro-Trash  into an distinguished looking as he takes a sip
(
) In an hour, 'm your best friend
Jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his knee
(
) Give me a day and you'll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time
It's too late for you
Jake looks up as the    into  , the nervous mark from the earlier con
(
) have your confidence
-: Dolby's lips loosen in a wide
Jake smiles back
He puts his drink down, then takes the drink from Dolby
They remain talking as  -- : - - Under the light of a streetlamp, the two continue to talk

) tell you the "Tale"-- It's the story of how we're going to make easy money
No one gets hurt
And here's the guy who's going to help
That's when you meet the Insideman
() 29
: Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly anxious
Introductions are made
(
) The Insideman's the one with the know- How, the scoop, the angle
But maybe 'you' re the suspicious type
So give you the "Convincer
" We both put up a little and we get a little back
Just a taste
Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to Dolby
(
) Just enough that when  tell you we can make more off of it, you agree
Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically
He hands the envelope back to Gordo
(
) That`s when  put you on the "Send
" You put in -a little, you got a little
Put in a lot
"send" you out for mare
As much as you can get
: - ' - Jake stands    , loading a big, black revolver with bullets
Doesn't matter what the con is
Insider trading, a line we got on   a bookie club, insurance scam, whatever
You saw the money and you want it
More of it
Who cares   if you have to bend the rules a little
As long as no one gets hurt
Jake spins the gun cylinder then  it closed, pointing it straight at the
(cont'd) Then someone does
: 30
-   - flash of Gordo's stunned face before his chest Jake stands holding the smoking gun
Dolby looks around in shock
(turns 'to face ) Frankie Suits always said, that what you have to understand about any confidence game, is that it's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part
The Roper, the Insideman, the Shills
Everyone except for the Mark
Gordo lying in a pool of blood
(while playing dead) 've been shot
Oh
The humanity
Big Al sits cowering at a table
(monotone) God
No
Please
Don't kill me
Miles casually washing glasses
(indifferent) You better hurry
The police will be here any second
(breaking character) don't really understand my motivation with this
Why am  washing glasses
(still facing camera) Now you're an accomplice in a homicide
Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg
Dolby turns to Jake, eyes wide, lips trembling in fear
(turning to Dolby) You should be running out the door, desperate to forget this ever happened, ready to repent your greedy ways
() 31
: Dolby eyes the briefcases of money
What about
The money
(turns back to ) Then there it is again
That little itch
There's a guy holding a smoking gun, a guy bleeding all over the floor and still, all you can think about is the money
You twisted fuck
So we gotta give you the "Blow-off"
We make sure that you never, ever want to look for us again
We get you off our backs
Forever
Jake stops for a second and listens
He points over his shoulder and on cue     in the distance
And that's why you need the "Fix"
Dolby bolts for the door without the money
: - - Dolby tries to act casual as he walks away
: -   - Rottovich and Sabozinski enter the front door
(
) The New York Police Department's finest
Half as smart and twice as crooked as the guy they just chased away
: -  -  () Butch eases the gun off Jake's head
So how'd you get caught
() 32
: Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions
Usually, it takes a little longer
: - ' -- Empty except for Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lupus, dressed in another of his trademark loud sweatsuits
We're working for the King
(re: Lupus) Wait a second
Who's the mope
'm the King's eyes and ears
Just in case you decide to get cute
So we gotta short con our way out of a hundred and fifty grand
That could only take like, a year
No
Big con
One rag
One rag and we get out from under all this
But we need another Shill
What do we need another Shill for
Breasts
: - -- crowded night
, the attractive blonde from earlier, flirts with a well dressed,   who has his hand firmly planted on her ass
She squeezes his hand and gives him a quick peck on the cheek before walking away
She takes a look at the man's wallet she just lifted before putting it in her bag
From out of nowhere, Jake bumps into her
() 33
: (not so innocently) Oops
Jake takes her by the arm out to
: - / - Jake pushes Lily through the back door where she finds Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting
Her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder
What is this
You guys cops or something
We're not cops
You gotta be kidding me
Her
Yes, her
Where's my wallet
Your what
Jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor-- few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring
Jake picks up one of the wallets filled with cash
(cont'd) That's not-- (pocketing the wallet) You interested in a little work
Lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them all suspiciously
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think 'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a bad fake
, you're fucking crazy
(lighting the cigarette) Jake
34
Take a deep breath and count to ten
It's not that kind of work
You're Lily, right
Says who
You're working Daffy's block
He was going to break your kneecaps
Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me
Lily takes a second to look the guys over
Miles gives her a wink
Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him
We have work
It pays a lot
Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up
Oooh
Sassy
What do you care who feels me up, Jake
Unless it kinda gotcha going
Did it, Jake
Getcha going
Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin
Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing
She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his
She whispers
(cont' d) Keep the wallet
We're even
Take a deep breath
Count to ten
And go fuck yourself
Lily pushes past Jake and heads out of the alley
Is it just me or is there something really hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself
Gordo gives Jake a nod of approval and Jake takes off after Lily
: 35
-  - Lily down the street, Jake giving chase
Alright
Hold up
You win
You got the job
Gee thanks
Now  don't have to find that bridge to jump off
Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way
We had to see what your deal was
'm just a little superstitious
Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time
What do you want me for anyway
You don't even know me
just have a good feeling about you
Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before
Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm
None
No
(beat) What's my cut
You get an equal cut
What do  have to do
Just play a part
little acting
Lily steps back and hails a cab
Make a wish
She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store window reading "11:11p"
Eleven-eleven
If you're superstitious, make a wish
() 36
: Lily hops into the Cab and tosses Jake's new wallet onto the sidewalk
(cont'd) That's twice
The cab pulls away
Jake looks up at the clock-- "11:12P"
: -  -  () Butch smiles
can see why you liked her
That was it
We had our crew
Now we needed the Mark
: -  - Jake stands in front of the crew: Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus
Morgan Gillette
Gordo and Miles both do their best to contain their disbelief
Why
Because that's who the King Fin wants us to fleece
And Gillette's perfect
: -    /-- circle of   sitting at a conference table
(
) His grandfather used to run liquor during prohibition and his father made a bundle in illegal importing and exporting
That makes him a third generation crook
() 37
: (cont' d) He's been tied into pretty much everything; drugs, mob, money rinsing
We        and settle on , a man in his early fifties with the sharp, angular features of a reptile
We  with Morgan as the meeting breaks and everyone heads for the door and into
: -    /- Gillette is greeted by a handful of
Butch is with them, staying in the periphery
(
) There's a story going around that he helped fund the Contras back in the eighties
Gillette and his crew head through a large glass revolving door to
: -    - busy mid-day New York sidewalk
Gillette heads towards a waiting Town Car
Most of his money's clean
lot of it isn't
The best part is that we know exactly where it is
As Gillette and his crew disappear into the car, we up to see the front of the building which has a large sign reading, "City Bank of Manhattan;  Gillette Family Company
" : -  -- Jake looks over the crew, who are less than convinced
How much we going after
Two million
Miles lets out a whistle
() 38
: We only owe the King a hundred and fifty
We get fifty percent
And we get clear of the King
Jake looks over at Lupus for confirmation
That's worth it right there
You ask me,  don't think you can do it
'm with Jack LaLane
That guy's untouchable
That's why we don't go after him directly
: -    / Empty
The marble floor spotless, the dark oak teller windows vacant, a row of desks
(
) We find a doable guy in Gillette's bank
Someone about mid-level
Not too high, not too low
lone man,  ,  behind a desk on the empty floor and sits behind a computer terminal
(
) We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital
The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast
Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need
(
) How's that
He works for Gillette
(
) We pay better
() 39
: An envelope stuffed with cash  on the desk next to Ashby
: --  -- Crystal clear water gently rolls onto a white beach
(
) Our guy gets us approved for the start up capital
But, the money can't be transferred to any one person
On the given day, the money's wired into a corporate account in an off-shore bank
: -  ' - Another empty bank
lone   behind the counter
(
) That same day,  show up in the Caymens with the proper
and corporate papers to make a withdrawal
Jake  on the empty bank floor, walking confidently up to the Teller with a   in hand
MILE5 (
) Uh
(
) What
MILE5 (
) 'm just thinking out loud here, but
Two million in a briefcase
(
) Good point
Jake approaches the Teller, now wheeling a behind him by the handle
Jake presents the Teller with a series of papers and a photo
(
) It's bank policy not to release this money in cash because it's under a corporate account
() 40
: The Teller turns to a computer printer and removes a check
Jake signs a few documents and places the check into his pocket
: -  /-- Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the bank
Not even a car: Jake strides out of the Grand Caymen's Bank and walks across the street to another building with a sign reading "
" : -     - Again, empty
Jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter
and greets him with a smile
(
) So we cash the check at another bank
Jake slides the suitcase and the check over to the Teller
: -  / - Like the banks, empty
Jake walks with the suitcase down the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under a sign marked "Customs
" (
) Now, this is the most important part-- You can't just walk into the United States with a suitcase full of cash without evoking the words "cavity search"
As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge behind it
(
) That's why you need someone on the inside at Customs
Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him
The Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope stuffed with cash under it
() 41
: The Officer literally looks the other way as he pockets the envelope and waves Jake through the gate
: -  - Jake exits the terminal
Outside, the street is empty, not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a cab
Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk" signal is given
(
) Then we disappear
As he walks away,   some   carrying luggage
Then a
Then an
Gradually more and more people and cars, each into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in the crowd
: -  - Jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions, which are the same all the way around-- Slack jawed disbelief
(breaking the silence) This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea 've ever heard
People have tried this before, Jake
It's never worked
Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it
Last year, Mumps got pinched in
It never worked before because , they didn't flush the bank enough; , their corporate papers were for shit; , they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs
Yeah, or , it's a dumb fucking idea
Then what do you want to do, Miles
Run
() 42
: We never had a problem with that before
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before
What are you talking about
Yes we have
And we would have been beautiful about it
We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it
Then we woulda moved on `til the next local putz caught on
We're getting a little old for running
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison
Are you pissed about Al
'm pissed too, but ' m not like "twenty-five to life" pissed
'm getting clear of this
If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money
Gordo
Yeah
Whatever, Jake
No, not "whatever
" You're either in or you' re out
silence falls over everyone
'm in
Her eyes stay on Jake as a smile grows across her face
: -  - Jake dials a number
(
) agreed with Miles
It was, hands down, a dumb fucking idea
() 43
: (
) But they bought it
Now  had to deliver and  needed help
(into phone) Yeah, it's Jake
How'd that tip work out
: -  () Butch takes out a cigarette
But there were other factors
Factors that weren't clear to me until now
: - 16TH /- An office of empty chairs and desks
Through the windows we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct , still dressed in the same shitty suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski enter
Gentlemen
Special Agent Gunther Moonan
Moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best Kodak smile
Special Agent
You are Officer Richard Rottovich
And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski
'm looking for Jake Vig
Who
've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now
Problem is, the guy's the invisible man
spook, a spectre, a ghost
Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head
() 44
: Moonan holds up crime scene photos of Big Al's body
(cont'd) Preliminary forensics suggests he was
Sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours
Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell
Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time 've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time 've even gotten a whiff of him
Look Special Agent Moonan
We don't know what you're talking about
Moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits
(
from tape) Don't be an idiot
How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer
If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand
Moonan kills the recorder
Oh yeah,  almost forgot
The two serious looking gentlemen outside
Internal Affairs
The Officers look out the window to see in suits
Do you want to know the first time had a line on Vig
He sent me a birthday card
(off their silence) Belated, but it's the thought, right
Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor
But, then again you guys probably know him better than  do
In fact, 've only met the guy once
But now, now have you
The next best thing
His partners
His "Fix
" What do you want
() 45
: You help me catch him
Whatever he's into next,  want you to be into
And what you're into, 'm into
If it all goes well, those two guys from  will never have to hear this tape
'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross-departmental investigation
This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it
What do you get out of it
Peace of mind
That's it
Not everyone's on the take, Walter
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now
want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick
Literally
It's not a bad deal, gentleman
get peace of mind
You get Detective Sheilds
But this is the best part, Walter
Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile
Capice
Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent
Good
One more thing
You gotta give up the booty
can't have you guys running around with heroin
'
() 46
: (
) Let me tell you something about Moonan
: -  -  () serious look comes across Jake's face-- Hate
Butch eases back with the gun for a second
He's just as crooked as the next guy
You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars
Cue the fucking violins
Come on
It's getting cold
: -   - Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lily next to him, all crammed into a booth
Am  the only one who feels like we can't make a move with this guy on us
We should ditch him
Just watch every thing you say around him
Every word, every move
It all goes back to the King Pin
Lupus exits the restroom, heading back towards the booth
How's the hoop, superstar
Clean
What is it with you and bathrooms
He doesn't like using a bathroom unless he knows it's clean
Manly
() 47
: You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder
This is New York city, Sister
Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda
You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob
Let's do the list
Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease- Here's what's going to happen
Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank
Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance
Is it all fugasi
No, the corporate papers have to be legit
But you gotta score an clean one
Talk to Suits
gotta get us a Banker
What about Customs
'll worry about Customs
Hey, ' m not just along for the ride, so  don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut
Take a deep breath
You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something
Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him
: -  - Boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc
Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who's dressed in shorts and a t-shirt
He wears boxing gloves and headgear
Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring
How much
() 48
: think two million
What do you need from me
Permission
Go
If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid
need you to stake me
Stake you
need you to stake me
can't do it without it
It's just a couple hundred grand
Taken out of our cut when we're done
King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second
That's more than you already owe me
What happens if you fuck this up
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Hey Skippy
Do  have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead
Mr
King,  think--- (w/ a look) Hey,  got it
Take some mental notes
You just might learn something here
Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes
Listen, Scooter--- No, you listen
We're partners now and even though 'm running the show for you, 'm still running the show
That means  get a little respect
So don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit
It's Jake
(beat) () 49
: And  gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape
few of the  training around stop and turn
The King Pin lowers a glare at Jake
Take off your shirt
Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming
Excuse me
said take off your fucking shirt
few more  stop and turn
Jake notices he's being watched
The King Pin takes a step towards Jake
Fine
You want me to take it off, 'll take it off
Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King Pin, arms crossed
It's getting weird
Look at you, you skinny prick
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you
The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt
Harlin and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance
The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly large, incredibly round stomach which he  loudly
Come here
Feel this
No thanks
'm good
Come here
The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach
It just got weirder
Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake and the King Pin
() 50
: You guys are freaking me out
Shut up
Feel that
That's solid muscle
Not an ounce of fat
Go ahead
Punch it
am not going-- The King starts to get that look again
Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach
He shakes his fist in pain
Come on
Harder
think  just broke my hand
Harder
Remember,  killed your buddy
Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King as hard as he can
The King just smiles
(cont'd) All muscle
The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising speed
Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right there
With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness
Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into the ring
Maybe it's true
Maybe you can't cheat an honest man
Me
'm about as dishonest as they come and that's the truth
But if you even think about trying to con me they'll find fucking pieces of you in each of the five boroughs
Pieces of you, pieces of her, pieces of your whole crew
Can't be any mare honest than that
'll stake you, but that's three hundred fifty you're in the hole and consider the juice running
Now go make me proud
Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up
Lily looks at Jake with a pained expression
() 51
: You get all that
Everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts
: -   () Butch lets out an easy laugh
Nice
We got our stake
Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank
: - flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day
Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building
Miles reads off a piece of paper
(
) What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit
Michelle Strigo
Loan officer
Miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit, They follow her down the street
(
) Guy like me, with people like that
'll tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you
It's like a personal ad you wear over your head
Jake watches as she hails a cab
, also hailing a cab goes for the same one
Michelle gets into a screaming match with the man
---    appears over her head "Single, volatile, confrontational woman seeks "man" for economic security and house chores
" No
: 52
-     - flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day
Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building
Jay Houlser
International finance
Miles points out a  , a young guy in suit
They follow him
: -  - Jake and the others watch Jay standing around the bar silently scoping the place with a group of young tucks(dressed oddly alike)
,   --    appears over their heads: "   seek acknowledgement of monetary earning potential from Supermodel-types ages 20- 25
" No
: -     - The same flood of people exit the bank
Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building
Alice Tanner
Finance Director
Miles points out  , a mousy looking woman in a bad skirt
She gets to the intersection and waits for the light to change, even as hordes of others jaywalk the way New Yorkers do
--    appears: "Single woman looking for opportunity
Plays by the rules and willing to claw her way up to middle management
" No
: 53
-     - Again the flood of people
Again Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait
Grant Ashby
of Corporate Loans
Miles points out a  , a schlubish middle aged balding guy walking down the street
They follow
: -      - Dark oak and brass, the bar plays host to legions of Suited Urban Professionals gathered in cliques
Jake and the others watch as Ashby makes his way through the crowd, taking a seat alone at the bar
--    appears over his head: "  seeks end to safety of tedious and solitary lifestyle
Moral and ethical constitution flexible
" (
) What you're looking for in a      mark is someone who's got nothing to      lose
No friends, no family, no life
You're looking for a guy who doesn't      own a rug
Jake watches as Ashby orders a drink and pulls a newspaper from his coat
He opens it to the crossword-- Just like Jake would
Him
You sure
Jake watches Ashby do the crossword puzzle alone
' m sure
: -  /- Jake, Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus enter a warehouse housing racks of clothes
() 54
: Now we had the con and the mark
We needed to look the part
They're greeted by  , an ancient rake-thin man, perfectly coiffed and exceptionally dressed
(
) Frankie Suits was a legend in certain circles
He
Was on the grift since he was ten
Last of the red hot grifters
Suits grabs Jake with a hug
It's a heartfelt one
The others exchange greetings with Suits who moves over to Lupus and studies his loud sweatsuit
(
) Back in the day, Suits made money running fight stores and the wire with a Fix so tight it was like a legit business
never understood what the point was if grifting became like a regular job
We need wardrobe
(re: Lupus) So  see
In from Long Island
You fellas take a look around
Hey Suits
You got anything in like a eleven or twelve ounce Super 100 worsted
Miles gives him a look like he's speaking latin
Jake and Lily follow Suits into
: - ' - spare little office piled high with clothes
Suits reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a large envelope and slides it to Jake
() 55
: Corporate papers with the New York State seal, insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records
There's also the
you asked for
Corporate papers with the New York State seal, insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records
There's also the you asked for
Jake takes out the papers and gives them the once over
He then puts an envelope thick with cash on the desk
Aces, Suits
Not easy   pickin's
Papers like these speak to   larger issues
Sorry about Alfonse
(off   Jake's nod) You into   something big
Pretty much
In over your head
Pretty much
Suits eyes Lily
Can  speak to you in confidence
Huh
Oh
She's alright
Suits gives Lily another suspicious look
Try and keep up
You ask for      the Advantage Goods, then you guys      come in looking to be Bean Traps
So        gotta think you're either working the      mace or playing the Jug Mob
little bit of both
Lily watches in utter confusion
Hey,  been on the ramp all my life, so got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake
() 56
: (cont'd) saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and  thought, "the kid's a prodigy
'" But  know that if you're using these goods
So then figure, what's worth that
You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund
Who's the Mark
Can't say
Then who's the Banker
The King
dead look comes over Suits
The King
Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that
They put the lug on for nothing at all
can handle it
don't doubt your talent
You looking for that place in the hall of fame
It's not history
So what do you want
want to get out from under all this for good
And  want to fuck them all doing it
Then  gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want
Jake considers those words for a moment
Yes  can
Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods
The he gently rests his hands on the papers
() 57
: Still time
Can't do it Suits
can't lay down for this one
Okay
Here's the thing
You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed
Then it's Blue River Land for everybody
Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape
Usually it's the shape of an arrow
hate to do it, but after this, gotta give you the blowoff
We Jake, Jake
Suits holds out his hand
Jake takes it
We're Jake
They shake, knowing it'll be the last time
: -  /- We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office
Lily can see that it's thrown Jake a bit
What the hell's his problem
Don't worry about it
It's just that  left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do  know not to worry
Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down
You need to get a haircut
What
And some new clothes
Why
() 58
: We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy
You gotta do this thing and  don't even know if you can
You're just going to have to trust me
don't trust anyone
Then show me how
: - ' - Jake and Lily enter the store
Jake takes a quick moment to case the place--  few scattered , some being helped by
All the Customers look like the uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's
(to himself) Oh yeah
This is good
This will do nicely
(to Lily) This is about confidence
Your confidence and their confidence
You get their confidence by giving them yours
Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow turn around the store

: Perfect
' ll just go put this in, Mr
Lewis
The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away
change comes over Jake
It's subtle-- Posture, facial expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there
Mr
Lewis
Mr
Lewis turns and looks at Jake
There's no real hint of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old friend
It is you
Hello
Jake extends his hand
Sorry, -- Jake
Jake Pearson
go to lawschool with your daughter
Carolyn
We met once or twice
Mr
Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude
Of course
Jake
Nice to see you
Well, it certainly is a coincidence
Here of all places
How is Mrs
Lewis
Great
Thank you
The Salesgirl returns
Excuse me
believe you're holding something far me under Pearson
Do you have a ticket
() 60
: You   know, this is kind of embarassing, but   my wallet was stolen yesterday and 'm   afraid the ticket was in it
But the   name's Pearson
While you're back there, could you make sure that Carolyn is spelled with a "y"
The Salesgirl nods and disappears again
(cont'd) What brings you down from Boston, Jake
Taking advantage of the long weekend
My wife and  are just taking a little vacation
Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over
Carolyn's down this weekend too
Lily approaches
When she does, Jake pulls her close and gives her a loving kiss on the lips
It throws Lily for a second
Uh
Everything okay
Honey, this is Mr
Lewis
Carolyn Lewis's father
Mr
Lewis, this is my wife, Lily
Lily and Mr
Lewis exchange handshakes
'm sorry, honey
'm almost done
Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist
It's okay
'll be looking for earrings
Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves
Attractive girl
() 61
: Thank you
Actually, it's our first anniversary   this weekend
She thinks 'm here to   pick up something for my mother, but   it's actually a gift for her
Think    've fooled her
Take it from me, you never do
But congratulations
Nice to be married, isn't it
Very much so
Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's pretending to be
The Salesgirl returns
We have Carolyn with a "y"
'm sorry, there's nothing under Pearson
If we had an invoice number-- Jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious
told you
My wallet was stolen
Please
Check again
Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on earrings with another Salesperson
Good luck
Congratulations again
He and Jake shake hands
Thank you, sir
You know,  hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps  could give you something for her
It's a check
We split the cost on a few books and haven't had the chance to pay her back yet
Could you
Sure
Jake pulls out a checkbook and pen
(writing) That'd be a great help
() 62
: The Salesgirl returns
'm sorry
Nothing under Pearson
You're sure
This is
Just a complete disaster
What was it
Jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case
ring for my wife
Alot like that one
In fact, it was that one
That's no problem
We have those in stock
Thank you
Sorry, 'm just a little anxious to give it to her
You take out of state checks
With identification
Jake stops writing on the check and locks up
understand that, but  had my wallet stolen last night
Is there any way
'm sorry
Jake's anxious look comes back
know it's policy, but
(looking over at Lily) The thing is
It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend
It's a very, very special night for my wife and
This ring is my gift to her and  think she's going to really love it
can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch
can send you
later
() 63
: (sympathetic) 'm sorry
(clearing his throat) This is embarrassing
Jake
Jake looks up and rips the check out from his book
'm sorry, sir
Thank you very much for doing this
And please tell Carolyn hello for me
Jake seems to be lost
Mr
Lewis looks over at Lily, who gives him a friendly smile, then back to Jake
Why don't you let me put the ring on the card and you can write me a check in return
Unseen to Mr
Lewis, one corner of Jake's lip goes up in a grin
: - '/-- Jake and Lily exit the store
Jake hands Lily the trademark colored box
Happy anniversary
Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed
Jake Looks up to see Mr
Lewis watching them as he tries to hail a cab
Jake's demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile
Smile
You just got a present from the man of your dreams
Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box
Now we gotta give him a strong finish
() 64
: Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into her eyes
She leans in and they kiss--  deep, slow kiss that makes people have to walk around them
Mr
Lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into a cab
Jake and Lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away
Lily finally breaks the kiss--- Slowly
He's gone
Uh-huh
gotta go get a haircut
Uh-huh
Jake watches as Lily walks away
She looks back at Jake once before disappearing around a corner
: -  - Moonan sits on a desk, ear to a phone
(
) It was all in play
Everything
It's Moonan
'm in New York
Listen,  got Vig
He's here and 'm this close
Look,  understand that, but 'm telling you this time
Obsessive is a big word to use
Goddamn it, Lou
'm telling you, this is it
Yeah
figured you'd feel that way
So here's the deal
Call Kylie over at the Bureau
Tell him got something that might interest him
guy they call the King Pin
think there may be a corruption case brewing here, too
That's right
So even if don't get Vig, you'll still have something to show
Rottovich and Sobozinski enter
() 65
: (cont' d) Good
gotta go
(hanging up) So, what do you have for me
Whaddya mean
We got dick
You guy's are not working with me here
just got off the phone with my boss
After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little 'm welcome back if we come up short
And now here you guys are,
Moonan kicks a chair across the floor
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin--- (composing himself) Look, 'm not a confrontational person by nature
Moonan walks over to the fallen chair and picks it up
need answers and the only two things you've given me are jack and shit
You gotta do better
You gotta do better or  swear on my sweet dead grandmother's grave, 'm gonna make you guys an --fucking- cautionary tale
Moonan kicks the chair down again, sending Rottovich and Sobozinski back a few steps
: -  - () Butch takes out two cigarettes and lights both, sticking one in Jake's mouth
Thanks
Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match
() 66
: (cont' d) Back in  or , one of the ' s, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were
Then, well
It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had
So three on a match is bad luck
You're a superstitious fucker
Luck's a funny thing
Especially the bad
Like what
Having a gun pointed at you for one
It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad
Three on a match, black cats
Believe it
Believe it all
: - ' - Miles, Jake, Lupus and Gordo sit around in silence
They're all dressed in new suits
(
) (overlap below) But if you wanna talk about bad luck
Where the hell is she
Just then, a  on the door
Jake opens the door to reveal Lily, dressed in an expensive business suit and sporting a sophisticated cut of new (
) Redheads
Gordo, Lupus and Miles look up at Lily
Oh shit
() 67
: Lily stands at the door watching Jake freak out in disbelief
and her new red hair

) Top three all-time worst red-heads

) Lizzie Borden
Axe murder

) Judas

(
) Shirley Vig
Abandoner
The action resumes
Nice to see you too
Why are you getting so bent
She takes a step into the apartment
You just put a mother of a jinx on us
Lighten up
(
) But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes
bird in your house
Lily takes her jacket off revealing a delicate blouse, decorated with a design of flowers and a

- ' - It's the scene earlier, when Jake finds a  rapping at his window to get out
(
) bird enters your house
: ()
-  ' Big Al's bulging, vacant eyes stare straight at us, his mouth hanging open
(
) It means death
'
The action resumes
You have no idea what you've done do you
No idea
What is this
Jake points to her hair
You told me to change my hair
(re: the shirt) What about this
Do you have any idea what this means
You've killed us
We're dead
Did  miss something
The red hair
It's bad luck
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake
Like that matters
You can't fool bad luck
You can't get by on a technicality
You can't trick karma
Lily grabs her jacket and starts out the door, then turns back around to Jake
() 69
: So much for that good feeling, huh
Silence
Jake can feel the eyes on him
Anybody says a word  swear to God
Jake takes off after her
: -  -  () Butch cracks a big smile
She had you tempting fate
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy
The same numbers everyday for sixteen years
One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers
They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million
steps out from behind Butch
Guess he passed on that unlucky- asshole gene
Lily looks down at Jake and the gun pointed at his head
There's not even a hint of sympathy
You should have trusted me Jake
: -      - Jake turns and looks at the crew, Miles, Gordo, Lupus and Lily behind him
Grant Ashby sits alone at the crowded bar, doing his crossword puzzle
Jake a smile and saunters over to the bar
She up for this
() 70
: She's up for it
Ashby sits finishing a drink
Snippets of and  from the cliques around him catch his attention, but he remains alone
(
) Is this seat taken
Ashby turns to see an   pointing to the empty seat next to him
(brightening) Uh, no
Please
Thanks
The Blonde grabs the barstool and starts to walk off with it
rejected look from Ashby
(
) Sorry 'm late
Lily appears next to the Blonde
Ashby looks around to make sure she's talking to him
But 'm not that late
You didn't have to give away my seat
(getting it) wasn't sure if you'd make it
Oh,  didn't know you
Here
Sorry
Lily takes the barstool back
No problem
The blonde woman leaves as Lily sits down next to Ashby
Thanks for playing along
just have to sit for a while
Tough day
() 71
: Brutal day
They say the streets are lined with money down here, but  guess you have to know the secret handshake
What are you drinking
Uh, Maker's Mark
Rocks
Lily signals the  for two more drinks
My name's Grant
Grant Ashby
Oh god
'm overbearing and rude
Lily
Lily Finn
They shake, Ashby's demeanor brightening again
So, what do you do
It's more like what aren't  doing
My partners and  are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company
We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there
Silicon Valley
That's right
So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east
Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
The drinks arrive
Lily hands the bartender a twenty
can--- On me
For the seat
Cheers
She flashes a trademark smile as they  glasses
So we've been meeting with banks all day
It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word
() 72
: Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us
No, no
Nothing like that
work in a bank
(leaning in) Really
Wish we had met eight hours ago
Ashby nods and shyly looks away
He could be blushing
Lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking over her shoulder
(getting up) My partners are here
Ashby reverts back to schlub mode
Oh
Well, thanks for the drink
You're welcome
was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us
Ashby brightens again
: -      /- Ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of him
He looks remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging around with a group of friends
(
) She got one leg out from under him
Now we had to lean
73
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk
They all break out into
So this is our boss, right
He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired
Your whole team's fired
" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo-- But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo
He was in the bathroom
So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling
And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a  World Magazine
More
haven't been able to use a public bathroom since
Especially with the thing
Lupus's non-sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the conversation to a grinding halt
Uh, right
And that was it
That's when we decided to start our own business
No more shithead bosses
envy you guys
Taking a chance like that
Masters of our own destiny
So far, masters of our own demise
What bank are you with
City Bank of Manhattan
() 74
: That's that Gillette guy, right
(off Ashby's nod) You Like him
As a boss,  mean
He's
He's okay
(goading) Come on
No
More
What do you do over at your bank, Grant
What do  do
'm the  of Finance
The group exchanges Looks
Wow
We haven't met with anyone your level yet
So that means there's you, then the
(Confidently Yeah
That's right
(
) Here's where a little research comes in handy
Corporate banks give out titles like calendars
It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan
Well, typically speaking, they're not
As long as you can demonstrate-- () 75
: capacity for gross fund recovery
Yeah, we got that part
That's right
And tech firms
They 'tend to scare people off
They scare people off because most people lack vision
Vision and balls
Present company excluded of course
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back
We know exactly how we're going to make The money back
There in lies the Catch-22 don't follow
An uncomfortable silence falls
Jake
It's alright
Grant's one of the good guys
She throws Ashby a flirty smile
Yeah
He's our boy
Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm
It's meant to be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's head to the side
Ashby lets out an uncomfortable as he rubs his arm
(leaning in) Listen, what 'm about to tell you, 'm telling you in confidence, okay
(off Ashby's nod) Have you ever heard of a company called Big
Com
Big
Com
That Internet thing
() 76
: Right
The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do
They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company
Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever
The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real
The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works
So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan
Sort of like a letter of intent
Exactly
But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette
It could kill a deal
But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore
And you have this letter of intent
(quietly) Yes
That's why  wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little
We're getting down to the wire
Apparently another company has a similar product in & right now
If they beat us to it
Off the record, 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help
Ashby considers for a moment
Should we get another round
Jake and Lily share an almost imperceptible look
: 77
-  - Jake, Lupus, Miles, Gordo and Lily walking, still on a celebratory high
Poor bastard never knew what hit him
Jesus,  almost felt sorry for the guy
gotta work off some of this adrenaline
got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn
Anybody want in
' m going home Let's go, Jake
Uh
No thanks
'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off
You sure
Jake looks over at
Lily then nods
Gordo, Miles and Lupus start to head off
Lupus
Lupus turns and Jake moves closer
(cont'd) When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al
You going to have the time
'11 find the time
Lupus nods and heads off
Jake watches them go
Look at you
You want to go
For what
couple hundred bucks
() 78
: think you'd do it for free
You' re almost drooling
You like the rush
It's what  do
It's my job
Why
Your mother not breast feed you or something
Are you asking me if  have something to prove
Do you have something to prove
Not in that repressed anger sort of way
'm your basic underachiever
Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option
Good quality porn has it's place in the world
Whatever
But you
get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything
So why this
'm good at it
Lying, cheating
Manipulating
'm good at it
It's more than that
Intuition
It doesn't make you Yoda
Like tonight
You killed that guy tonight
But  knew you would
So that was my part
Smile and shake my ass
No
You have another part
You'll know what to do
() 79
: How do you know  will
Intuition
: - ' - Illuminated only by the light coming from the windows
Jake runs a hand down the length of Lily's bare back
She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss
Lily's hand moves down Jake's arm until it finds his hand
You have really soft hands
Like a baby's
(remembering the King) Don't ruin this for me
They roll off the bed onto the floor, a naked tangle of arms and legs, their hands still entwined
: -    () Jake takes a deep breath, Butch and Lily behind him
Is that what it was, Jake
Was it love
You know when the first con was ever played
It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden
Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment
Then she fucked him over with an apple
(with a dry laugh) Redheads
Jake continues to
: 80
- ' -- Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum-pit studio apartment
Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck
spoon in a glass from the growing  of a passing subway train
The  rises to an almost deafening volume
Jake's a little alarmed
Lily, oblivious
(drowned out by the rumble) How do you deal with--- (yelling) (yelling back) ,  -- (the subway passes) Deal with that
Lily shrugs indifferently
Do you think we can do it
Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some of last night's magic
Maybe
Even if we don't, you'll be alright
You're not in the hole with the King
Lily rolls away from Jake
Undaunted, Jake starts kissing her back
Who says you have to know the King to be in a whole
actually did have a real job once
When  was in high school,  worked as a candy striper
Sounds respectable
Not the way  did it
was loaded half the time
don't know how you could change bedpans sober
() () 81
: (') used to hang out with this guy, Glenn
He was an x-ray technician or something
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now
Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck
He wasn't my boyfriend
had a boyfriend at the time
What was his name
Anyway, Glenn was like thirty
was only fifteen
But he was a nice guy
Real sweet
Liked to talk
We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me
We were friends
trusted him should have known it was weird
But, then again  was weird
You guys got busted
This is a great neck
Jake still kissing
No, we never got busted
We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and  was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know
was thinking about letting him be my first because  loved him
(pause) What the hell was his name
Glenn talked you out of it
Sort of
was telling him about this great love of my life who's name  don't remember, and  could see
He was getting pissed
thought it was just because he was worried about me, but
() 82
: (cont'd) He told me that  was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me
Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back
He climbs on top of her
He was looking out for you
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off
(pause) He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me
" Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her
Shit, what was that guy's name
really liked him
Lily
Jesus Christ
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and  went home
The next day,  finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest
Three or four times
Jake slides off Lily
Did, uh
Did you kill him
don't know
packed up my shit and ran away
To this
So unlike you, guess  do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way
Jake considers for a second
No
You trusted him
You were just getting square
You know why  told you that, Jake
(turning towards him) Because  trust you too
() 83
: Jake tries a reassuring smile even though he's not sure it's something he should be smiling about
The spoon starts to  again as another subway train in the distance
: -  - () Lily shakes her head in disbelief that Jake would tell the story
Sorry, honey
But  figure if we can't all share at a time like this
Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily
You got some issues, huh
(with a hiss) can take care of myself
Butch freezes as     in the , growing  then  again
He puts the gun back to Jake's head
Hurry up
: - ' - Ashby sits behind a desk in front of the crew
In front of him are the corporate papers
(
) We had to finalize the deal
Everything looks in order
This has to happen fast
know
It won't go unnoticed
There'll be red flags
Jake slides an envelope across the desk
() 84
: What's this
You need some convincing
Consider it a convincer
Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope
Let's just slow down for a second
You're worried about recouping the loan
already told you
No,  understand that
What  mean
What 'm trying to say
was actually wondering about
Well, my cut
-  bead of sweat rolls down the back of Ashby's neck
(
) Then there it is
Ashby gets the itch
The standard ten
Ten percent
Of how much
Two million
We're going to make it back, Grant
Three or four times over
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow
There's a pause before Ashby smiles, then reaches around to scratch his neck
: -    /- Jake exits Ashby's office with Lupus, Gordo, Miles and Lily
They all follow Jake down the hallway
() 85
: You'll be there
Eight
flight
Calls
We'll use the Euc
They pass the glass partitioned conference room
Jake looks inside to see Morgan Gillette holding court with a bunch of
Butch stands behind Gillette
For a second, Butch and Jake's eyes meet
: - - Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and Lupus
As they move through the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and Sobozinski appear behind them
Hey Jake
Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square in the face
Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an alley
That tip not work-out for you fellas
Tip was fine, Jake
We were a little more curious about the Fed
Hey, listen
If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business
Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach
Miles and Gordo lurch forward-- (pulling his gun) Back up
You want  should hold him down
() 86
: Gordo throws Lupus a look
Special Agent Gunther Moonan
Ring a bell
Gunther
think 'd remember a Gunther
Ring it for him, Sobo
Sobozinski punches Jake again
Oh yeah
Moonan
remember now
Thanks
Well he's   in town and he sure as shit remembers   you
What are we going to do about this   Jake
We can't afford to have a Fed   onto us
Wouldn't dream of it
Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him to the ground
don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand
We get a big piece
If we find out you're keeping us out, may suddenly develope a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself
Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake
(gasping for breath) Something stupid
Good boy
And don't leave town
(to Rottovich) always wanted to say that
As the cops exit, Lily, Miles and Gordo rush to Jake
() 87
: People don't like you much, do they
Jake lets out a pained  as they help him up
: - - Rottovich and Sobozinski get in the front of a squad car
In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel section of the  Times
Did he buy it
think so
What'd he ever do to you anyway
Let's just say he burned me once
Moonan calmly turns the page of the paper
(
) Why's this guy so hard up for you
You're not exactly a threat to national security
: -  - Jake sits at a barstool, battered and bruised
Lily tends to him with a towel
Miles and Gordo pour drinks
Lupus sits at a table, watching
We go way back
: -  - mechanical rabbit springs forward
Greyhounds bolt out of the gate
(
) About four years ago, we were working in Miami, turf fixing for some local goon
: 88
-- - Gordo, Miles, Big A1 and Jake watch the race with indifference, surrounded by excited
(
) Turns out this local goon was being watched by the Feds, which means we were being watched by the Feds
One in particular
Through the crowd, we catch a glimpse of Moonan, in sunglasses, watching the guys
(
) Special Agent Gunther Moonan
Jake turns and catches Moonan looking at him
: - / - Moonan walks over to a car
(
) He didn't really have anything on us, but  figure, maybe this guy's good for a Fix
So  ask him out to dinner
Moonan pulls a piece of paper off the windshield that reads: "La Scala 2night
" : -  - An elegant restaurant
Jake sits confidently in an expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed Moonan across from him
(
) These guys we have now, sure, give them twenty bucks and they'll look the other way on a parking ticket
But a Fed
You get a guy like that as your Fix
Jake nonchalantly slides a fat envelope over to Moonan
Moonan picks it up and finds a wad of cash
(
) It was probably a stupid idea
There am, Armani and Rolex
There he is, Penny and Timex
() 89
: Moonan smiles and slides the envelope back over to Jake with a disappointed shake of his head
(
) So  took a shot
But now he had me on attempted bribery of a Federal Agent
As Moonan stands, we see Big Al get up from the next table
A1 "bumps" into Gordo, dressed in a waiter's white jacket
Gordo "trips;" spilling scalding hot coffee into Moonan's lap
Jake casually gets up and leaves
'
(
) That's when Gordo comes in with the Hazelnut French Roast
-- Moonan falls to the floor, holding his crotch in agony
: -  / - Miles pulls up in an old Cadillac, picking up Jake at the entrance
They pick up Gordo and Big Al from a side door and drive off as Moonan limps out of the restaurant, still holding his crotch
: -  -  () Jake finishes the story to Lupus
And that's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and  became friends
Lupus nods, satisfied
Moonan
Here
Shit
So what
We just stay clear of him
Jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over
Jesus
Take it easy
() 90
: No, 'm not going to take it easy
You can't stay clear of this guy
He will be on this until the end of time
What do we do
We change the scam
There is no scam
've got a fucking sign on my back
can't leave town now and come back   with a suitcase full of money
You get    it
It's over
We walk
Jake-- What do  always tell you guys
Don't spend it all
Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck
Save some
Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate
That's it
The gig's up
That's it
What are you talking about
We can still do this
Jake,  mean, come on-- No, no, no
Not  this time
am doing this for your own good
You guys have got to learn when to stop
You with the Armani
You  with the hookers
Escorts
Do you even remember Al
Do you remember what he looked like sitting there
You are such a raving pussy sometimes
Hey, we fucked once, honey
That hardly makes you a good judge of character
And don't think  didn't know you were working some angle with that either
() 91
: Everyone's working an angle, right
There are three people  trust-- him, him and a guy who got killed
don't know who you are
You're like some stray doq that wandered into the house
So 'm telling you to cut loose of this
No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette
Just go wherever it is you would go
It's over
Lily looks around the room
No one seems to be backing her up
What about
What about what
What about the money
Jake stops and levels a look at Lily
So there it is
You got that big itch you need to scratch
It's all about the fucking money
What do you want, an apology
No,  want my cut
'm going to say this one last time for You, so take a deep breath and count to ten
There is no cut
Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake
You're an asshole
With that, she grabs her coat and leaves
Lupus sits quietly, taking it all in
So that's it
That's it
() 92
: King ain't gonna like this
Don't worry, 'll settle up with your boss
We haven't skipped town yet
What 'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care
See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me  think he's jealous
Of what
They're both crooks
Exactly
`Cept this Gillette guy
He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit
Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door
My fucking heart bleeds
Your buddy
That fat guy
The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked
He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled
It ain't personal
It's business
Point, Lupus
Give us a point
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next
And he don't even like you, Jake
Lupus stares blankly at Jake

So much for honor among thieves
You would have cut loose your friends, your girl

You were scared, Jake
You - Lost your nerve
You lost your confidence
You weren't being noble
You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself
Admit it
It's not true
Yes it is Jake
Yes it is
They were right there for you
She was right there for you
Look at her
Jake doesn't move
Butch grabs him by the hair and turns him towards Lily
(cont'd) She trusted you and you sold her out
Be honest
Be a man
Tell her, Jake
Tell her that you loved her but the money meant more to you
Butch kicks Jake in the gut

She knows a lot
She could be a pain in the ass
Jake looks up
No
She won't
She's not going to be a problem
Lupus cups the phone
He wants to talk to you
(whispering) Don't tell him  said he was jealous of Gillette, okay
Jake reaches over and grabs the phone
Uh huh

Okay

Jake hangs up the phone
What'd he say
Oh,    you know
Don't fuck this up

Harlin easily grabs the bat and backhands Lily

She raises the pan again
But before she delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing his leg to shoot out from under him

Not that  recall
What do you want us to do about it
Let's see
Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught
We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation
don't much like that idea
Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs
Now, that'll be something
We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud
We double our money
