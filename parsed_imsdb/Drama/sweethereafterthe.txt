It is a bright summer morning
Father, mother, and a three year old girl are still asleep
They are naked
light breeze drifts into the room
The scene is serene and softly suspended
Head credits appear over this idyllic image
The little girl turns in her sleep
dog barks outside
/
-- From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash
The image is shot through the windshield, from the driver's point of view
The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels and gushing water
-- Inside the car  , a man in his mid-fifties, listens to a stirring piece of music
The sound of the car wash is filtered out by the strains of music
-- The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large city
young woman, , enters the booth and lifts the receiver
-- is going through the wash
The automatic mops and buffers embrace his car with water and suds
The cellular phone in the car rings
picks it up
Yes
Yes, 'll accept the charges
-- is on the phone
There's a figure outside the booth waiting for her
Daddy, it's me
How are you doing
That's great
Where are you
What's that sound
-- in his car, playing with the volume on his radio
'm in a car wash
-- car wash
Wow, 've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash
Make sure you've got the windows closed
-- (over the phone) Remember that time we were having the car washed and  started playing with the automatic window
How old was , Daddy
Five or six
got absolutely soaked, remember
Why are you calling me, Zoe
-- Why am  calling you
You're my father
'm not supposed to call you
What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy
-- Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe
(over the phone) So what's the problem
The problem is  have no idea who 'm talking to right now
(over the phone) 'Cause you think 'm stoned, Daddy
'Cause you think 've got a needle stuck in my arm
Is that what you're thinking, Daddy
Pause
doesn't respond
-- Are you wondering if  scored, Daddy, and 'm calling you for money
That 'm begging
God, don't fucking believe it
-- is emotionally stunned by ' voice
She is heard over the phone
(over the phone) Daddy
Are you listening to me, Daddy
The music that  has been listening to becomes louder as he stares at the spinning felt wheels of the car wash
(') Yes
Why can't you talk to me
just need to know what state you're in so  know
how to talk to you
how to act
is in pain
He closes his eyes
-- The phone booth is deserted
is nowhere to be seen
Over this image, the sounds of a band playing a blues number
-- The blues number continues as the camera cranes down to the bandstand of a country fair
local band is rehearsing
Around the practising band, various carpenters and technicians are making final preparations for that evening's big event
One of the people watching the band is  , a man in his early forties
He watches his daughter, , as she sings into the microphone
is sixteen
stares at her father as she sings
looking back at his daughter
He is intensely proud of her
is a carpenter, working on at the fair site
He gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the grandstand
-- of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens
Her face is full of sweetness and trust
in a crowded airport washroom, watching a young father, , trying to change the diaper on his three year old daughter
stares at the little girl, his face registering a wistful smile
is having a hard time trying to find the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her at the same time
Need a hand
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag
know my wife packed one in there
comes forward and searches through the toddler's bag
You always think you're prepared for these things
Tell me about it
How old is she
Almost three
(finding a towel) Is this it
Perfect
Here we go
Thanks
lays the towel across the counter, and dries the little girl
watches as  puts a new diaper on her
The toddler stares up at , her eyes are playful
stares at the girl's face
-- back to  honking the horn of his car, trying to get someone's attention
No response picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator
Yes, operator, 'm in a strange situation
'm calling from my car, and  appear to be stuck in a car wash
car wash, yes
Is there anyway you could
Hello
Hello
The line has died
searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to get out of the car without getting soaked
as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself from the onslaught of water with his umbrella
He is immediately soaked by a large mop
The camera watches as he makes his way towards light at the end of the wash
-- walks into the office of the car wash
No one is there
There is an ominous buzz coming from another room
moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto repair establishment
He moves into a larger room, full of discarded auto parts
The buzzing noise is coming from an electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge of screeching feedback
Someone was just here
They are nowhere to be seen
Hello
No response
picks up the guitar, which begins to produce a terrifying electronic feedback
-- and  wander through the fairground
Various rides and concession stands are being set up

That was great
Really
You're going to blow everyone away
You mean it
Of course
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure
am
Really
It was awesome

Sensing his sincerity, she throws her arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement
'm so happy, Daddy

In the fading light, a magnificent mountain range is seen in the background

After a few moments   appears
She is an exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive but very run-down
stares at ' soaked clothes
Hello
Is it raining outside
No,

Pause
stares at , her expression somewhere else
(') Do you have a room
Will you be spending more than a night
Hard to say

Are you a reporter
No
, ' husband, appears from the darkness
You here about the accident
stares at ' haunted eyes, then looks back at
He immediately knows their story
Yes
'm a lawyer
realize this is an awful time, but it's important that we talk
-- group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the country fair
and  walk into the shot, eating ice cream cones
waves at someone he recognizes in the distance
Let's sit down
nods, her mind elsewhere
-- and  are sitting at an outside table, finishing their cones
school bus pulls up into the fairground
watches as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside
smiles at this scene
notices, turns around to see the children, then turns back to
What's so funny
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals
It's like the biggest thing in her life
, a warm and cheery woman in her forties, leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on the fair site
Alright, kids
want you all to listen to me
Rule number one  No one is allowed to stick their fingers into the cages
don't care how cute some of these animals may be, the fact is they don't like being here, no matter how many ribbons some of them have won
--  -- is having a meeting with  and in their livingroom behind the reception area
has a pad of paper and is taking notes
Kyle Lambston's a drunk
Nobody likes him
He's a nasty piece of work
In what way
Been drinking since high school
Fucked himself up
Used to be smart enough
Any criminal record
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions
Drunk driving
Lost his licence
That's why he don't work no more
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on
What little money comes in goes to booze
How does the family survive
Don't know
Food banks, welfare, church charity
They scrape by
looks at , who has remained silent
What about Doreen
She
she was a friend of mine
When
At school
She fell for Kyle just before we graduated
Got pregnant, and
went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own
Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle
That's the local bar
(nodding) coming home drunk and  guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that
and
hesitates
Taking it out on her
stops taking notes, and looks at the
He beat her
nods
crosses the  off of his list
He looks up at  and
(') You see, to do this right, to actually have a chance at winning - of getting some money to compensate you for the loss of your boy - we need folks like you
Sensitive, loving parents
People with no criminal background or history of trouble in town
Do you understand
The  nod
(') Now, of all these parents you've told me about whose kids were killed, who would you consider to be good upstanding neighbors
stares hard at
What do you mean
People who will help our cause
Pause
Well, there's the Hamiltons
Joe and Shelly Hamilton
(caustically) Yeah, right
Beat
looks at , waiting for an explanation
(') mean, everyone knows Joey steals antiques from summer cottages
Resells them to dealers in the city
He's been doing that for years
regards  with a slight smile of admiration
That's great, Wendell
That's the sort of thing  need to know
So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on
There's the Prescots
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town
He's about to lose his house and car
But Charlene
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night
Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on
She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts

They're all inbred
The Ottos

He was their adopted son beautiful boy

That's good

What do they do
Crafts

Wanda does these photographic things
That's one of her pictures on the wall
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed
You don't know that
Have they ever been busted
No
You don't know is what you mean

He answers it
Yes, 'll accept the charges

It's a private call
The  nod as  moves outside

Zoe
Zoe, where are you

The image is silent
This scene takes place two years after the accident

He summons a  over

The  checks the headset and confirms the problem
'll find you another pair
The  leaves
young woman seated beside  hands him her headset
You can have mine
takes ' headset
Their eyes lock for a moment
(') Yes, we do know each other

Alison Jones

(pretending to remember) Yes
Ally
That was my nickname
Ally
That's right
How are you
'm just fine, Ally
What about you

Still working with my father
And what does he do again
He used to work with you
Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife
Pause

Ally Jones
How is Mrs
Stephens
We're
not together
'd heard that
But she's well
Yes
fine
And Zoe
How's Zoe
Pause
The  comes back with a new headset
She notices the set that  has given him
Oh, you've beaten me to it
The  hands the headset to

The camera has remained fixed on ' face
-- and   are waiting for the school bus with their adopted son
The bus arrives, and the door opens to reveal , who is driving
Good morning, Wanda
Hi, Hartley
Hi, Dolores
watches as  and   affectionately say goodbye to their boy
gives  a photograph, which has strong psychedelic influences
shows it proudly to (') What do you think
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting
(laughing) You hate it
didn't say that
could wrap it up
Protect the other kids
'll just strap it on the roof
It's for the school bazaar
Oh, it's bizarre alright
'mon Bear
Let's get you out of here
Away from your crazy Mom
(voice over) The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear
They were the only parents who did that, together like that
guess they're what you might call hippies
(voice over) What do you mean by that, Mrs
Driscoll
'  -- and  are in the modest livingroom of ' house
The conversation continues from the previous voice over
In the corner of the room sits , ' husband
has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be completely paralyzed
His presence, however, is intense and powerful
frequently looks over to  during his conversations with
is always watching him like a hawk, making  uneasy
Dolores
No one calls me 'Mrs
Driscoll'
What do you mean by that, Dolores
About the Ottos
Yes
What do you mean by 'hippies'
mean, the way they look
Their hair and clothing
Do they have any reputation for drugs
No, nothing like that
The Ottos are what 'd call model citizens
They're regular at town meetings
They give their opinions  in a respectful way
They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers
And they loved Bear
Oh yes
Like  said, they always came out together to see him off to school
It's like he was their little treasure
He was such a beautiful boy
That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott
turns around to find the picture of
It is right behind ' head, so  has to divide his attention between the cute  of  clutching a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ' glaring eyes
The  of various children with their pets
Some have ribbons
(') (voice over) Those are all from the fair last year
Abbott and me were judges at the pet show
For rabbits
(nodding) Abbott used to breed them 'til he had the stroke
Bear won first prize
Just look at the smile on his face
He was one of those children that bring out the best in people
He would have been a wonderful man
as he stares at the photo of
-- The camera is outside the bus, looking at  as he finishes waving to his parents
'
of  and  disappearing as the bus pulls away
-- The camera moves inside the crowded bus, peering at the childrens' activity as they play with each other in the bus
and   are seated at the back of the bus, looking out the rear window, waving at someone
-- and  are seen waving at
, driving behind them in his pick up truck
He waves back at his children
(voice over) Billy Ansel started honking at us up around Upper Hat Creek
He always started to do that when he caught up to the bus
He'd wave at his kids, Jessica and Mason, who always sat at the back
Normally, he followed us the whole distance over the ridge towards the school
'  -- The conversation between  and  continues from the previous scene
So Billy was driving behind the bus at the time of the accident
nods
Her expression is distant
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus
They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other
It comforted him
From what
(confused) From what
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of
Financial pressures
run-ins with the law
No, nothing like that
Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago
He took over raising the children by himself
It was obvious how much he missed Lydia
You talked about it
No
(beat) saw it on his face
Pause
stares at
' - -- Through the windshield, the camera fixes on ' face as he stares at his children
Inside the cab of his pick up,  dials a number on his cell phone
He continues to wave at his children as he speaks into the phone
(into the phone) Hi
Can you talk
'm on my way to work
'm waving at them now
What's that noise
--  -- is on a cordless phone
She has just finished cleaning a room
is hammering in the background
Wendell's working on the roof
He thinks he's fixing a leak
As far as 'm concerned he's just punching in a few new holes
' - -- smiles as he continues the conversation
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight
She'll be there around six
Billy, that's too early
She said she's got to be home by nine
Can't you make it later
Look, 'll be waiting in the room
You get over as soon as you can
Okay
guess
-- The bus and the pick-up are travelling through a beautiful mountain pass
-- continues his conversation with  as they eat dinner
'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay
Are you still in touch
Not really
The last time  saw her was at that clinic
That was a long time ago
Which one
Which one
Which clinic
don't remember the name
It was near a beach
Sunnyridge
That was a long time ago
Beat
proceeds cautiously
So there were others
(as he eats) Other clinics
Oh sure
Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units
Then
when did she get better
She didn't
But you said
That's where 'm going
To see her
She's in trouble
Yes
(beat) Do you find there's something strange about this meat
stares at her plate
summons the Some more wine
'm afraid this meat is overdone
'm sorry about that, Mr
Stephens
Would you like to try the fish
What is it
Poached salmon
considers this
He is polite, but slightly edgy
Do you have a cold plate
We do
Is there shrimp on it
Yes
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp
(smiling) 'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate
Well, let's see what we get
The  leaves with ' food
gets up
(') (to ) If you could excuse me for a moment
nods

picks at her meat undecidedly
-- In the mirror of the tiny washroom of the plane, washes some water on his face
He stares at his reflection in the mirror
-- approaches the house of  and
He gets out of his car and knocks on the door
answers
She has been crying
The two stare at each other
Mrs
Otto, my name is Mitchell Stephens
The Walkers told me you might be willing to talk to me
Pause
(') 'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs
Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand
know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk
Who are you
'm a lawyer
You can't come here
Please, let me explain
'll only take a moment of your time
No
Please
pauses, stares at , then lets him in
-- walks into the  residence
It is a large two- storey space divided into several smaller chambers with sheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian madras - that hang from wires
On a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is a large wood-burning stove
few feet from the stove, sitting on an overstuffed cushion, is
is listening to music on his headphones
He is very stoned
moves over, and pulls the headphones off her husband's head
We have a guest
What did you say your name was
Mitchell Stephens
hands them a card
reads it with deliberation
The Walkers sent him by
rises up
He stares at
tense pause
You want a cup of tea or something
cup of tea would be nice
(beat) Would it be alright if  sit down for a few minutes, Mrs
Otto want to talk to you
stares at
No response
waits a beat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large pillow
He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold them under his chin
(') The Walkers spoke very highly of you
You've been retained
Yes
Their child died, and they got a lawyer
Pause
assesses ' energy
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger
Not their grief
Who did they get for that
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs
Otto
That's why 'm here
To give your anger a voice
To be your weapon against whoever caused that bus to go off the road
Dolores
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years
Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal
few million at the very most
The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus
You think someone else caused the accident
Mrs
Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident
The word doesn't mean anything to me
As far as 'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner
Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement
They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference
That's what's done, Mrs
Otto
've seen it happen so many times before
returns with the tea
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr
Otto
How many times has she steered clear of danger
What went wrong that morning
takes the cup of tea
(') Someone calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety
It's the darkest, most cynical thing to imagine, but it's absolutely true
And now, it's up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt, or add an extra yard of guard rail
It's the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society
By what  do
Pause
So you're just the thing we need
Excuse me
Isn't that what you want us to believe
That we're completely defenseless
That you know what's best
Listen to me, Mrs Otto
Listen very carefully
do know what's best
As we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves
And this makes me very, very mad
It's why  came all the way up here
If everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school
promise you that  will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job
Who is responsible for this tragedy
Then, in your name and the Walkers' name and the name of whoever decides to join us,  shall sue
shall sue for negligence until they bleed
Pause
want that person to go to jail
For the rest of his life
want him to die there
don't want his money
nods sympathetically
It's unlikely that anyone will go to prison, Mrs
Otto
But he or his company will pay in other ways
And we must make them pay
Not for the money or to compensate you for the loss of your son
That can't be done
But to protect other innocent children
You see, 'm not just here to speak for your anger, but for the future as well
(beat) What we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time
Pause
looks at ' teacup
didn't ask if you wanted milk
No
little sugar though
We've only got honey
'll
take it straight
maintains his eye contact with
Are you expensive
No
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit,  will require no payment until after the case is won, when  will require one third of the awarded amount
If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing
It's a standard agreement
Do you have this agreement with you
It's in my car
gets up
(') 'll just be a minute
Anyhow, you should discuss this all without me before you make any decision

He gets inside and closes the door
Once inside,  opens his briefcase and takes out an agreement for the
Something inside the briefcase catches his attention

It doesn't matter
Two weeks later she's on the street
New York, Vancouver, Pittsburgh, Toronto,
The next time  hear from her, it's a phone call scamming for money
Money for school, or money for a new kind of therapist, or money for a plane ticket home
'Oh Daddy, just let me come home
Please, Daddy,  have to see you
'  But she never comes home
'm always at the airport, but she's never there
Ten years of this, ten years of these lies, of imagining what happens if  don't send the money, of  kicking down doors and dragging her out of rat-infested apartments, of explaining why that couldn't be my daughter in a porn flick someone saw
well, enough rage and helplessness, and your love turns to something else

It turns to steaming piss

Have you been waiting long

Billy, do you have to smoke
Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking

He notices some work tools in the washroom
What's all this
Wendell put some fresh enamel on that break in the tub
Does this mean  can't take a shower
No
It should be dry by now
nods
He turns around, looks at , and begins to unbutton her shirt
stops him, smiles, and kisses After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt, and slips off her jeans
She moves to the bed
What time's he coming home
When the game's over,  guess

She reads from Robert Browning's The Pied Piper of Hamelin
By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty
What's a ditty again
It's like a song
Oh
When begins my ditty, Almost five hundred years ago, To see the townsfolk suffer so From vermin, was a pity
What's vermin again
Rats
They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats
And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats
Nicole
Yes
Can  sit beside you on the bus tomorrow
Don't you usually like to sit at the back
To wave at your Dad
want to sit beside you tomorrow
Okay
covers , and gets up to leave
Nicole
What, Mason
Did the Pied Piper take the children away because he was mad that the town didn't pay him
That's right
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats
Because
he wanted to them to be punished
The people in the town
Yes
So he was mean
No
Not mean
Just
very angry
Oh
Should  keep reading
Okay

Tomorrow 'm going to put Sean on the bus
He won't want to go
He never does
He'll cry and want to hold on to me
That's because he misses you
Yes
It's natural
Your kids never cry
Well, maybe that's because they know 'm going to follow them
Behind the bus
They can look forward to that

Why
don't know
Nicole, 'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity
Don't feel bad
Unless you feel strange about wearing it
No
mean,  remember Mrs
Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but don't feel funny about that really liked her
And she really liked you
She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or
trails off, suddenly consumed with sadness
What do you mean 'outgrown it'
'm not sure
Oh
(beat) Right
turns to leave, taking the clothes with her
(') Goodnight, Mr
Ansel
Goodnight, Nicole
leaves the house and walks towards the car where her father is waiting
'
-- gets into the car beside her father
What took so long
Nothing
stares at the bundle of clothes on 's lap
What's that
Mrs
Ansel's clothing
Does it fit
nods, staring ahead, as  starts the car and drives away
-- drives up the driveway to the Burnell home
He opens the door, and takes a blanket from the back
gets out as well
The two walk towards the barn
(voice over) Once more he stept into the street, And to his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; And ere he blew three notes such sweet soft notes as yet musician's cunning Never gave the enraptured air - There was a rustling, seemed like a bustling Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering, And, like fowls in a farm-yard when the barley is scattering, Out came the children running
All the little boys and girls, With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after The wonderful music with shouting and laughter
Inside the barn,  and  are engaged in a sexual embrace
The camera glides past them as 's voice continues to read from the poem
(') (voice over) When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side, wondrous portal opened wide, As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; And the Piper advanced and the children followed, And when all were in to the very last, The door in the mountain-side shut fast
-- - of  in the bus as it makes it's way to school
She seems to be listening to her own voice as it reads from the poem
(voice over) Did  say, all
No
One was lame, And could not dance the whole of the way; And in after years, if you would blame His sadness, he was used to say,- 'It's dull in the town since my playmates left
can't forget that 'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see, Which the Piper also promised me
For me led us, he said, to a joyous land, Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And everything was strange and new
On this last line, 's lips begin to move, as she repeats the line out loud to herself
(') Everything was strange and new
-- shot of the schoolbus making its way through the winter terrain
' voice is heard over this sweeping panoramic shot
(voice over) By the time  reached the bottom of Bartlett Hill Road,  had half my load, over twenty kids, aboard
-- The bus comes to a stop where a couple of children in bright snow suits are waiting by the side of the road opens the door and the kids climb in
(voice over) They had walked to their places on the main road from the smaller lanes and private roadways that run off it
Bright little clusters of three and four children - like berries waiting to be plucked
'  -- is continuing her conversation with
(smiling to herself) That's the way  thought of them sometimes
Berries
Yes
Like  was putting them into my big basket
Clearing the hillside of its children
Pause
stares at , disturbed by this image
looks back at him
(') Abbott and  used to do a lot of that in the spring
Berry-picking
Yes
The old-fashioned way
And what's that
With our hands
nods, stealing a glance , who stares at him intensely
--  -- The bus pulls up across the road from the Bide--Wile Motel
watches as  walks her little boy, , across the road to the bus
(voice over) Anyhow, my next stop was across from the Bide--Wile, which is owned and operated by Risa and Wendell Walker
Risa walked her little boy, Sean, across the road, which was customary
Sean had some kind of learning disability
He was behind all the other kids his age in school and was too fragile and nervous to play sports
'  -- continues to talk to , who takes notes
(smiling) strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him
He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six
Were his parents
attentive to him
What do you mean
You mentioned that he had a learning disability
That's right
Did his parents attend to that
What do you mean
Did they give him special care
The Walkers loved Sean
He was their only child
the object of all their attention
mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man
That's his nature
But Risa, she's still got dreams
--  -- opens the door for
is wearing a down parka over her nightgown and bathrobe and is wearing slippers
Morning, Dolores
Hi, Risa
Aren't your feet freezing
looks down at her slippers
guess they are
gets to the landing of the bus, then turns around and looks at his mother
He extends his hands like a baby wanting to be hugged
want to stay with you
Pause
stares at her son with great intensity and feeling
Go on now, Sean
Go on
turns away and looks into the bus full of children
'mon, Sean
Sit next to me

whispers something to him, and he makes his way for
goes to the back of the bus and sits beside his sister,
moves tentatively towards
Back on  and
Is he okay
don't know
Temperature
No
He's not sick or anything
It's just one of those mornings, guess
'  -- continues her conversation with
But  never had 'those mornings' myself
Not so long as  had the schoolbus to drive
Not so long as had my kids
is lost in this memory, realizing she will never drive the children again
tear runs down her cheek
, sensing his wife's mood, activates his electric wheelchair and maneuvers himself towards
watches as  grasps ' hand
-- is seated in the bus next to
She is staring at the large speedometer on the front panel
The speedometer reads 51 miles an hour
-- and , ' children, wave at their father from the back of the bus
' - -- waving back at his children
His expression suddenly changes as he sees
-- From ' point of view, the schoolbus smashes through the guardrail and the snowbank
It plummets down the embankment to the frozen-over pond
Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far side
The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus is swallowed at once by the freezing water
The sound of the ice breaking is terrifying
(voice over) It emerged from the blowing snow on the right side of the road
It might have been a dog or a small deer or maybe even a lost child
It might have been an optical illusion or a mirage
Whatever it was, for the rest of my life  will remember that red-brown blur
An eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the accident
-- The camera is high above the bed, looking down on a sleeping family
This is the same image as from the beginning of the film
, a , and a    , naked in bed
(voice over) Every time  get on one of these flights to rescue Zoe,  remember the summer we almost lost her
She was three years old
It happened in the morning, at this cottage we used to rent
We were all sleeping together in bed
It was a wonderful time in our lives
We still thought we had a future together, the three of us
Did you ever visit the cottage
-- is telling the story to
don't think so
woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing
It was laboured looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen
grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face
What happened
didn't know
was in a panic guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor
The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell
Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while dialed the hospital
finally got a doctor on the line
He sounded young, but cool
He was confident, but there was a nervousness
He have been an intern
This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this
He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as  was
stares at , taken by his need to chronicle and detail this irrelevant stranger
-- ( ) is on the phone
The camera is behind his head
In front of him,  () is breast-feeding the ()
(voice over) He surmised that there was a nest of baby black widow spiders in the mattress
He told me they had to be babies, or else with Zoe's body weight she'd be dead
He told me had to rush her to the hospital
He was alone
There was no ambulance available
'Now you listen', he said, 'There's a good chance you can get her to me before her throat closes, but the important thing is to keep her calm
'  He asked if there was one of us she was more relaxed with than the other said, 'Yes, with me
' -- continues telling the story to
Which was true enough, especially at that moment
Klara was wild-eyed with fear, and her fear was contagious
was a better actor than she was, that's all
Zoe loved us equally then
Just like she hates us both equally now
(beat) The doctor told me that  should hold her in my lap, and let Klara drive to the hospital
He asked me to bring a small, sharp knife
It had to be clean
There was no time to sterilize properly
He explained how to perform an emergency tracheotomy
How to cut into my daughter's throat and windpipe without causing her to bleed to death
He told me there'd be a lot of blood
said  didn't think could do it
'If her throat closes up and stops her breathing, you'll have to, Mr
Stephens
You'll have a minute and a half, two minutes maybe, and she'll probably be unconscious when you do it
But if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don't let her little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might just make it over here first
You get going now', and he hung up
-- little girl staring innocently into the lens as a male voice sings a lullaby to her
It is now recognized as ' voice, singing to his daughter as she is driven to the hospital
(voice over) It was an unforgettable drive was divided into two people
One part of me was Daddy, singing a lullaby to his little girl
The other part was a surgeon, ready to cut into her throat
waited for the second that Zoe's breath stopped to make that incision
-- stares at  as he finishes his story
What happened
Nothing
We made it to the hospital
didn't have to go as far as  was prepared to
But  was prepared to go all the way
-- An open sky
' face appears in the frame, looking down at the camera
The camera is staring down at  as he identifies the bodies of his two children
The camera is at a great height
As  walks away, the camera floats down, slowly moving on his face
-- 's
of his wife, , tugging a sled through the snow
and  are on either side of her
The three figures are seen from behind, trudging their way through the winter landscape
This image has a ghostly quality to it
It is filmed in slow motion
Suddenly, a snowball enters the frame and hits  on the back of the head
She turns around, laughing into the camera
--  -- -- in his chair in Room 11 of the Bide--Wile
He is alone, smoking a cigarette
slight faraway smile on his lips
After a moment, the door opens
It is
They stare at each other
Silence

sits on the bed
Pause
(') Are you going to the funeral
Pause
stopped by the station a while ago
stared at the bus
could almost hear the kids inside
There was a lawyer there
He told me he'd gotten you signed up
Is that true
Something made this happen, Billy
Mr
Stephens is going to find out what it was
What are you talking about
It was an accident
Mr
Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus
Risa,  serviced that bus
At the garage
There's nothing wrong with it
or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough
You believe that
have to
Why
Because  have to
Well  don't
gets up to leave
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses
That she was wearing it when the bus crashed
Yes
Why did you do that, Billy
You think that caused the accident, Risa
That it brought bad luck
Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer
Or maybe they're the same thing
is crying
opens the door
(') You know what 'm going to miss
More than making love
It's the nights you couldn't get away from Wendell
It's the nights 'd sit in that chair for an hour
Smoking cigarettes and remembering my life before
stares at  painfully, then leaves
-- is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder
The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact
Most of the windows in the rear have gone
There is a ghostly quality to this image, as though the video light is searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck
turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus
He hears a truck approaching the garage from the distance
It's retreats to his parked car as stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the truck
leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows over the inside passenger seats
stares at the bus a long time
approaches him
'm here about your children, Mr
Ansel
takes a moment, then turns around to face
The two men stare at each other
(') My name is
Mister,  don't want to know your name
understand
No you don't
can help you
Not unless you can raise the dead
hands  a card
Here
You may change your mind
looks at the card
Mr
Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if was to beat you right now
Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month
Because that's what 'm about to do
No, Mr
Ansel
wouldn't sue you
Leave us alone, Stephens
Leave the people of this town alone
You can't help
You can help each other
Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit
Your case as an individual will be stronger if 'm allowed to represent you together as a group
Case
The Walkers have agreed
The Ottos
Nicole Burnell's parents
It's important to initiate proceedings right away
Things get covered up
People lie
That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly
Before the evidence disappears
That's why 'm out here tonight
know Risa and Wendell Walker
They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer
And the Ottos wouldn't deal with you
We're not country bumpkins you can put a big city hustle on
You're trying to use us
You're angry, Mr
Ansel
You owe it to yourself to feel that way
All 'm saying is let me direct your rage
stares at  with a cold intensity
The cell phone in ' car begins to ring
(') That's my daughter
Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead
She's a drug addict
Why are you telling me this
'm telling you this because
we've all lost our children, Mr
Ansel
They're dead to us
They kill each other in the streets
They wander comatose in shopping malls
They're paralyzed in front of televisions
Something terrible has happened that's taken our children away
It's too late
They're gone
The phone continues to ring, as  stares at
turns to look at the ringing phone
'  -- is getting ready to leave
is still grasping onto ' hand
have a question for you, Mr
Stephens
What's that, Dolores
told you that  was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened
That's how  remembered it
But the truth is,  might have been doing sixty
Or sixty five
And if that's true, that  was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then
That would complicate things
Because 'd be to blame, right
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour
Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years
He knows that
Billy
Yes
He does
Billy said that
nods
(') You've talked to Billy
did
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to
Mrs
Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect
Pause
plans his next step
(') But in order to do that, you must let me bring a suit in your name charging negligent infliction of emotional harm
That's what 'm now asking you to consider
Pause
is lost
(') It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event
What other people
Excuse me
Who's been talking to you about what 'm feeling
Who should care about what 'm feeling
stares at
Dolores, people have to know that you've suffered too
And they won't understand until you let me clear your name - your good name - once and for all
Will you let me do that
Will you let me do my duty
Suddenly,  says something
He twists his face around his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a string of broken syllables and sounds
After this outburst, looks at , a comforted smile on her face
You heard what Abbott said
Yes
Anything you didn't understand
There might have been a word or two that slipped by
Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure
Abbott said that the true jury of a person's peers is the people of her town
Only they, the people who have known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt or innocence
And if  have committed a crime, then it's a crime against them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment
stares at , who stares back
That's what he said, is it
Yes
Abbot understands these things
'  -- leaves the  house, watched by

The camera fixes on ' expression as she stares ahead
(voice over) They say 'm lucky because  can't remember the accident
Don't even try to remember
You just think about getting well, Nicole, that's all
The camera is always fixed on ' face when her voice over is heard
(voice over) know 'm as well as  ever can be again
So shut up, Mom
To stay like this, to live like a slug, 'm going to have to work like someone trying to get into the Olympics
Just wait till you see what we've got waiting for you at home
-- , in a wheelchair, is being led down a hallway with her family
(voice over) It's an incredible relief to be leaving the hospital
'm so sick of looking at my doctor, listening to Frankenstein ask me stupid questions about what  was feeling
-- is being wheeled to the front door of the hospital
(voice over, continuing) He thought it was cute when  called him Frankenstein
It wasn't feel like his monster
Isn't it a lovely day
What happened to summer
Summer's over
It's fall
And winter
Well, winter's far behind us now
How was it
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam
nods
Good thing  was in Florida
doesn't know quite what to make of ' joke flashes  a smile
She doesn't return it
-- arrives at home
The car pulls up in front of the modest house
opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it
He points out the ramp he has built for
The ramp is painted green
How do you like it, Nicole
The ramp
Pretty slick, eh
Very slick
Do you like the colour
It's okay
And  had to widen a few doors
You'll see
-- Inside the house
The interior of the house is dark and somewhat tawdry
The ' are almost poor
But  then leads  into the special room he has built for her
It seems like another world
Every detail has been lovingly attended to
No expense has been spared to make this room as attractive and inviting as possible
room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his crippled daughter
What do you think
Pause
wheels around, trying to control her emotions as she inspects the room
phone rings in the background
goes to answer it
fixes her gaze at the back of the door
The door needs a lock
(taken aback) Sure
'll fix it right away
goes to get his tools

Can  come and visit you here
You better
And you can sleep in my new bed with me too
grabs her sister's hand, and  moves in close to her
comes back with the tools
He starts to screw in the hook
(') That's too high
'll never reach it
(nervous) Oh
better get some spackle
leaves again
Mommy says you need to lock the boys out
What boys
don't know

So do you like your new room
It's interesting
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here
He wanted to make it absolutely perfect

She notices a new computer on a desk
(') Is this mine
Yes
It's a present
From you
No
From Mr
Stephens
That was him on the phone just now
He was calling to see how you were
Who's Mr
Stephens
He's a lawyer
He's our lawyer
You and Mom have a lawyer
Well, yes
He's your lawyer too
My lawyer
Why do  need a lawyer
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home
Aren't you hungry, honey
Want me to fix you something
No
What's this lawyer business

Jenny, why don't you go and play outside

He's given me some stuff too
Toys, and some books
Jenny

When she's outside,  continues
(') He's a very kind man
And he knew that you'd need a computer for doing schoolwork
-- wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she watches her sister climb a tree
follows her outside
It's because of the accident, Nicole
Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers
lot of people
well, people in this town are very angry
Us included
But you didn't lose me
No, honey
And we will thank the Lord for that every day and night for the rest of our lives
But you almost died, and you were badly injured, and you won't be

of  playing on a tree branch
You're going to need special care for a long time to come
It's not going to be easy
Not for you, not for any of us
Because we love you so much
And it's going to cost money
More than we can imagine
What about insurance
Doesn't insurance pay for these things
Partly
But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover
That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer
To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest
How will he do that
Well, Mr
Stephens is representing several families
The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and  think a couple more
Mr
Stephens is suing the town for negligence
He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right
He's a very smart man
stares at her sister who's at the top of the tree
turns to look back at
There's a tension, as it seems as though  is going to let herself fall
(voice over) That's the first thing  heard about you
That you were a smart man
That you  were so smart that you were going to sue the town, then make us all feel better
-- to the scene outside the gas station between and
The cell phone in ' car has begun to ring
The two men stare at each other
(voice over) You're good at that
Good at getting people to believe you could do something for them
Something they could never do for themselves
breaks the silence
That's my daughter
Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead
She's a drug addict
Why are you telling me this
'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr
Ansel

-- Back to the scene between  and
The cellular phone is ringing
breaks the stare with  and moves to his car
The camera follows him, as  moves back to his truck in the background
gets in his car and picks up the phone
Yes, 'll accept the charges
Daddy
-- Yes
'm calling because 've got some news for you, Daddy
Some big news
News
Don't you want to hear
Yes
Give me your news, Zoe
You always think you know what 'm going to say, don't you
You always think you're two steps ahead of me
The lawyer
Tell me your news, Zoe
Okay
went to sell blood yesterday
That's how it is
'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and 'm selling my blood
That's not news, Zoe
No
But this is
They wouldn't take my blood
-- Image of  as a little girl in ' lap
Her face is swollen
She is being driven to the hospital
is singing her a lullaby
MiTCHELL's conversation with  continues over this image
Do you know what that means, Daddy
Does it register
Yes
tested positive
Yes
Welcome to hard times, Daddy
Pause
What do you want me to do, Zoe
'll do whatever you want
need money
What for
You can't ask me that
Not anymore
You asked me what  wanted
Not what  wanted it for
want money
Do you have the blood test
You don't believe me
You don't fucking believe me
Of
course  do
just thought
could get you another test
In case the one you got
was wrong
like it when you don't believe me, Daddy
It's better you don't believe me but have to act like you do
Pause
(') can hear you breathing, Daddy
Yes
can hear you breathing too

Oh God, 'm scared
love you, Zoe
'll be there soon, and 'll take care of you
No matter what happens

It is now red
-- meets
and  are also seated at the table
The meeting takes place in the kitchen/diningroom
Well, Nicole, 've been wanting to meet you for a long time now
Not just because 've heard so many good things about you, but because, as you know, 'm the guy representing you and your mom and dad and some other folks here in town
We're trying to generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered, and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again
You're central to the case 'm trying to build, Nicole
But you'd probably just as soon let the whole thing lie
Just get on with your life as quickly and smoothly as possible
nods
Pause, as  waits for her to go on
don't like thinking about the accident
don't even remember it happening
Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and
You hate that
nods
What she means, Mitch
silences  with a gesture of his hand
People can't help it, you know
They really can't
When they see you in this wheelchair, knowing what your life was life eight months ago, people are going to feel sorry for you
There's no way around it, Nicole
You and  just met, and already  admire you
Who wouldn't
You're a brave tough smart kid
That's obvious
And  didn't know you, know how exciting and promising your life was before the accident
But listen, even  feel sorry for you
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long
Then you start to feel
unlucky
That you didn't die
Like the other children
Yes
Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and
Nicole
It's the truth
regards  with calm authority, as though he's telling her the time
It is the truth
Pause
looks back at
(') It would be strange if you didn't feel that way
(after a slight pause) What do you want me to do for you, Mr
Stephens
-- fifteen minutes forward
The scene shifts to the livingroom
and  are alone in the room
comes back from another room, as  appears from the kitchen with a plate of cookies
(voice over) That got you talking about depositions and lawyers
By the time Daddy came back from the washroom and Mom came in with her tea and cookies, you were going on about how tough it would be for me to answer some of the questions those other lawyers would ask
They work for the people we're trying to sue
Their job is to try to minimize damages
Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them
You have to think of it that way
As people doing their jobs
No good guys or bad guys
Just our side and their side
won't lie
don't want you to lie
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole
Not in a situation like this
You seem very sure about that
'm absolutely positive
turns to face
She stares at him
No matter what 'm asked, 'll tell the truth
looks back, expressionless
That's fine
want you to be absolutely truthful
And 'll be right there to advise and help you
And there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and that's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set
It'll be the same for everybody
They'll be deposing the Ottos and the Walkers, the bus driver
Dolores
Yes
Dolores
and even your mom and dad
But 'll make sure you go last
Why
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this
It's not going to be easy, Nicole
Do you understand that
nods
When do they award damages
Depends
This could drag on for quite a while
But we'll be there at the end, Sam
Don't you worry
(voice over) At that moment,  hated my parents - Daddy for what he knew and had done, and even Mom for what she didn't know and hadn't done
You told me it wasn't going to be easy
But as sat there, staring at Daddy, knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my life

listens, along with , the opposing lawyer
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole
He looked frightened
Why would he be frightened
don't know
But it was weird in terms of what happened next
Sean was still watching his mother
shut the door with one hand, and released the brake with the other, and waited for a second for Risa to cross in front of the bus
There was a sixteen wheeler behind me, and heard his air brakes hiss as the driver chunked into gear
looked into the side view mirror, and saw him move into line behind me
Then suddenly Sean shrieked
-- leaps to the front of the bus
Mommy
(voice over, from the court chamber) What happened then
(voice over) Sean was all over me, scrambling across my lap to the window glimpsed  Risa off to my left, leaping out of the way of a red Saab that seemed to have bolted out of nowhere
The scene is horrifying, as  watches his mother just missing a terrible accident with the speeding vehicle
(') Sean
Sit down
Your Mom's okay
Now sit down
sits back down beside
slides open her window, and speaks to
(') You get his number
is stunned
(') (voice over) She was shaken, standing there with her arms wrapped around herself
She shook her head, turned away, and walked slowly back to the office drew a couple of breaths and checked Sean, who was seated now but still craning and looking after his mother
-- The deposition continues
smiled at him, but he only glared back at me, as if  was to blame
-- of the bus as it makes its way through the mountains
' voice is heard reading The Pied Piper from the scene with the  children
(voice over) For he led us, he said, to a joyous land, Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And everything was strange and new
-- montage showing the faces of the various children in the bus
These images are intercut with ' deposition
-- The deposition
is trying to control her emotions
remember wrenching the steering wheel to the right and slapping my foot against the brake petal wasn't the driver anymore
The bus was like this huge wave about to break over us
Bear Otto, the Lambston kids, the Hamiltons, the Prescotts, the teenaged boys and girls from Bartlett Hill, Sean, Nicole Burnell, Billy Ansel's twins, Jessica and Mason
all the children of my town
-- and  are watching television
Lumberjack log- rolling
, in her wheelchair, is reading a book off to one corner
comes into the room
That was Billy Ansel on the phone
He wants to come over to talk to us
Did he say what about
No
Was he drinking
Could you tell
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed
Mom
Come on, Jen
let you watch your nature show
reluctantly kisses her father goodnight, then
As she leaves the room,  starts clearing the table
(') Is he coming over now
Right away
That's what he said
is anxious
He looks over to
What are you up to, Nicole
Nothing
Nothing good on your
As opposed to this
stares at
(') Besides, 'd like to see Billy
stares at the television
On the television screen, an image of a studio audience applauding
The image is silent
The
is on
(') (voice over) That wasn't true
didn't want to be seen by anyone whose kids had been killed by the accident
Especially not Billy Ansel
turns her attention back to her parents
(') Actually, now that  think about it, 'd just as soon stay in my room
shoves her wheelchair towards her room, as the camera remains on her face
(') (voice over) remembered all the times  had tucked Jessica and Mason into bed
How they loved to have me read to them before they slept
There was nothing for me to say to Billy, except 'm sorry
'm sorry that your children died when my parent's children didn't
-- pulls up to the  home
He gets out of his pick up and approaches the house
-- From her room,  watches as  approaches the house
He leaves her view as a knock is heard at the door wheels over to the door and presses her ear to the door so that she can hear the conversation
-- Hey, Billy
What brings you out on a night like this
'mon in
Take a load off
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy
There's a piece of cake left
No
No, thanks, Mary
/ -- leads  into the livingroom
So what brings you out tonight
Well, Sam,  might as well tell you the truth
It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with
want you to drop the damned thing
Pause
don't see how that concerns you, Billy
It does concern me
Well,  don't know why it should
There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits
We're hardly unique here, Billy
mean, can understand how you feel
How
Well, it being so depressing and all
But it's reality
You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea
Why not
Because it's what we have to do
Well  don't want a damned thing to do with it
Okay, fine
So
stay out of it
Pause
stares at
Tension
've tried to stay out of it
But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam
You've gone and got yourself this lawyer
Mitchell Stephens
You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos
So
mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam
Force me to testify in court
He came by the garage this afternoon
Gave me this piece of paper
reaches into his pocket and shows the paper to
Why would he do that
You didn't have anything to do with the accident
Because  was driving behind the bus, Mary
Because  saw it
saw it happen
is harrowed by this image
and  stare at him, frightened by his intensity
(') If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing
That won't happen, Billy
Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys
The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus
know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time
That'll be the end of it
That's wrong, Sam
You know that
We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years
This is never going to go away
'mon, you know that won't
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards
We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages
Yesterday,  heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad
The rescue squad
Because they didn't act fast enough
listening from her door
(') If you two dropped the case, then the others would come to their senses and follow
You're good sensible parents, you and Mary
People respect you
Pause
No, Billy
We can't drop the lawsuit
You know how much we need the money
Why
You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board
We all did
It's not enough
For hospital bills
For Nicole
'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about
'll even give you the money  got for my kids
(beat) That's what we used to do, remember
Help each other
This was a community
'm sorry
stares at
used to like it here
used to care about what happened
Now think 'll sell my house and move the fuck away
Billy, please
The children
The children

He moves to leave
He pauses at the door of the kitchen
(') How is Nicole
Is she around
She's resting
In her room
Say hello for me
-- walks to his car
and  watch him from the porch/ramp
(calling out) We're getting on with our lives, Billy
Maybe it's time you got on with yours

She is crying

Are you sleeping
No
Nicole, tomorrow Mr
Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse
thought 'd take you over
Great
You seem
don't know
well, distant,  guess
Hard to talk to
We used to talk a lot, didn't we, Daddy
About all the things you were going to do for me
What do you mean
mean 'm a wheelchair girl now
It's hard to pretend 'm a beautiful rock star
Not like you used to tell me
Remember, Daddy
All the people that were going to discover me
Where are they now
turns away from
(') (voice over) He couldn't look at me
But looked at him
Right at him
His secret was mine now
We used to share it
But not anymore
Now, owned it completely
Well, okay
'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning
That's okay with you
Great
Silence
gets up to leave the room
(') (voice over) Before, everything had been so confusing
never knew who was to blame
But now  know
He's just a thief, a sneaky thief who had robbed his daughter
Robbed me of
whatever it was that my sister still had and  didn't
And then the accident robbed me of my body

They don't exchange a word
-- is carrying  up the stairs of the community centre
There is no ramp, so the wheelchair is left at the bottom
He is having difficulty, because  is keeping her body stiff and won't hold on to him
-- is wheeled across the floor of the community centre to a table where the depositions are being made
, , and the  are waiting for her
(voice over) The last time  was in the community hall was for the big Christmas party almost a year ago
It hadn't changed
-- The deposition
watches his daughter as she speaks confidently into the microphone
The  takes notes
is answering questions from the opposing lawyer
is also taking notes
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house
Yes
What time in the morning was this
About eight-thirty in the morning
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you
No
was alone
My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning
Like what
mean,  don't remember a lot
object to the form of that question
Note that
Was the bus on time
Yes
And where did you sit that morning
My usual place
On the right side
The first seat
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning
Until the accident
No
(beat) Yes, there was
Worried about this new information
(') It was when Sean Walker got on
He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother
Mason Ansel was sitting beside me
asked him to move, so could quiet Sean down
When the bus started up, a car came around the corner and almost hit Sean's mother
She was okay, but it really scared Sean, because he watched it out the window
And was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did
Pause
is nervous
No, she hadn't even started to move the bus
It was the car's fault
is relieved
There was nothing reckless in Mrs
Driscoll's behavior
object to that form of question
Note that
(answering the question) No
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up
Yes
You remember that much
As 'm talking, 'm remembering more about it
is worried
Note my objection
She said, 'As 'm talking
' Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto the Marlowe Road at what's called Wilmot Springs
Yes
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods
And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual
remember that
'm remembering it pretty clearly
(eyebrows raised) You are
Yes
(worried) Note that she said 'pretty clearly'
Not 'clearly'
And what was the weather like at this time
It was snowing
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, will object to that question
will offer that report
Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time
Before the actual accident
Yes
stares at her father as she responds
was scared
Why were you scared
This is before the accident, Nicole
Do you understand what 'm asking
Yes,  understand
Why were you scared
Dolores was driving too fast
Silence
is watching his entire case crumble
Mrs
Driscoll was driving too fast
What made you think that, Nicole
The speedometer
And it was downhill there
You could see the speedometer
Yes
looked
remember clearly now
It seemed we were going too fast down the hill
was scared
looks at , who stares back
How fast would you say Mrs
Driscoll was going
To the best of your recollection
Seventy-two miles an hour
Seventy-two miles an hour
You're sure of this
Positive
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs
Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time
told you  was positive
The speedometer was large and easy to see from where  was
The speedometer from '
It reads fifty-one miles an hour
(voice over) You saw the speedometer
Yes
Did you say anything to Mrs
Driscoll
No
Why not
was scared
And there wasn't time
There wasn't time
No
Because the bus went off the road
And crashed
You remember this
Yes
do now
Now that 'm telling it
(defeated) She said, 'Now that 'm telling it'
Note that
What do you remember about the accident
remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything
And that's all guess  was unconscious after that
That's all
Then  was in the hospital
smiles and makes some notes in his pad
He talks to  without looking up
Do you have any questions, Mr
Stephens
stares silently at  for a long time
(voice over) Daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something
Like what, Daddy
Like 'What about my money
' and  stare at each other

Thank you, Nicole

wheels herself over to her father
Let's go, Daddy
-- is in the car in front of the community centre
She stares at  as he argues with  on the steps
(voice over) Daddy took a long time
guess he wanted to have a few words with you
He must have tried to tell you that was lying
Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if  was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead
As ' words are heard, her point of view of  and arguing is seen
The movement of their lips is in sync with ' voice over
(') (voice over) Everyone's lawsuit is dead
Forget it
Tell the others to forget it
It's over
Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied
kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam
comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat
stares at him as he starts the car

He knows who the liar is

What's going to happen to Dolores

Will the police do anything to her
It's too late for that
