17 Written by Jason Filardi October 2007 - few cars scatter the parking lot
hear  followed by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net
/ - An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless  ', 17
Mike stands feet  the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots
This kid's automatic
Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and short shorts circa 1989
Mustached and curly haired  , 40, enters
Hey, 'Donnell, save some for the game
Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach
Just warming up, Coach
Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel
First game of the season and the scouts are already lining up
You have half the season  know you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want, Mike
That's the plan coach
The rest of the   basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a
Round up, Jock Straps
Picture time
The Team assembles in the middle of the court kneeling in front holds a sign, ` , 1989'
Hold on
Ed's not here yet
, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs- 2
Who cares
He's the water boy
And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture
shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom
Hey
Hey
Knock it off
Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors burst open
, 17, sporting a jacket over a costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his clothes off
Sorry 'm late
was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard
Fall in, Freedman
Hurry up
Ed takes a spot next to Dom
And 3, 2, 1- see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his underwear
And with the flash  cut to: / - The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court
On the opposite end, a  in  warms up
Lights dim
Cue  Hammer's `Can't Touch This' at center court perform the Hammer
around the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance
Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike
Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends- Alright, Ladies, bring it in
The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats
Ed hands waters to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike
3
Ed,  can't help you with the girls if you keep showing up places dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy
Okay
Dude, don't look now but think Muffy Campanella is scopin' you hard
For real
Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her
Smile, pud
Ed flashes a goofy smile
mimes puking
(') My bad
'  (o
s
) Mike
, 17, an 80's beauty, stands at the end of the bench
Who's that stone cold fox
Oh, it's my girlfriend
(walks over) 'm glad you're here, Scar
This whole scout thing's got me wicked nervous
Dom dribbles past, smiles at Scarlet
'm dedicating my first basket to you, Scarlet
Way you shoot that might be mid- season
(to Scarlet) Everything cool
She smiles nervously, lies
Oh yeah
Everything's totally copacetic
4
Totally
Totally
blows the whistle
Let's go
Remember, Boys, winners get the girls
Losers please themselves
(to Scarlet) Excellent
Gotta run
He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back- (') What's wrong
: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate
He steps away from Scarlet towards center court
Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically Do you really think Muffy's in to me
Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed
Takes his place for the jump ball
The Crowd stomps and cheers
The Ref is about to toss the ball
Mike looks up at the stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit
Mike's torn
Play or go after her
He goes after her
Where you going
'Donnell
/ - Mike rushes in
Scar
Wait
She turns, slumps against the wall
Mike catches up to her
Mike leans in and kisses Scarlet

Luxury
Manicured
The sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as  settle in on a large,
' /'  - ', now 36, angrily slaps the alarm off

He climbs out of bed, bones creaking, stiff, groans
- showered, suited Mike stands before the mirror, knots a tie around his neck
() Today is going to be a good day love my job
am a lucky man
Who's lucky
Mike 'Donnell
Mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself
' /  - , now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers
protrude from every inch of his body, neck and face
at least 5000 needles
,   adds more to him
Can you feel your Qi flowing freely
'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding
Mike enters, shakes his head in amusement
What are you doing now
Ed looks over, sees Mike watching
6
There he is
There's Mr
Sunshine
Fei Jing Acupuncture
It's all the rage
Makes you look five years younger
Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in pain the entire way
He pours himself a shot of from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately  it all over the place
(') (calls to Acupuncturist) What's this brown stuff again
Rhinoceros urine
Pure protein
Delish
(to Mike) The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing
Then why are you letting her stick needles in you
Because she's hot
But today's not about me
It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager
better be
've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company
No negativity
Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed
You, Michael Shawn 'Donnell, are a winner
winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house
Are you kidding
It doesn't get any better than this
() 7
(') gotta get back
My legs just went numb
Good luck today
Ed drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist
- Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level building
Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'
/  - cover the walls
Smiling faces, happy couples
little pills
Surrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues , 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away
Mike sits amongst them, the only male present
glum look on his face
, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him
Congratulations, Mike
You deserve it
You're like a totally amazing salesman
Thanks, Wendy
That like totally means so much to me
, 23, boss, strides through the door
Good morning, peeps
As you all know, today 'll be naming the new regional sales manager
What's it take to be an
Leadership skills, a comprehensive knowledge of today's prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier
Mike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket
(') All being said, congratulations- (Mike begins to rise) Wendy
Dumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat
Wendy springs up out of hers,  and
8
(') Now go out there and sell some drugs peeps
The Women stream out
How could you do this to me
've been a salesman here 18 years
Wendy's only been here 2 months
Look, your sales are admittedly better but she has the college degree
What can  do
You can give me the promotion, Roger
Things have changed
couldn't even hire you now with only a high school diploma
My hands are tied, bro-ski
Mike swallows his pride and exits
/  - Mike pulls into the empty parking lot, climbs out of his car and into the building
/ - Mike hurries down the hall, opens a door, peeks his head in
/ - Mike peers around
nobody
Alex
No answer
basketball sits in the middle of the floor
Mike enters, picks up the ball, begins dribbling
faster, between his legs, around his back, up to the 3 point line- (') 3, 2, 1- 9
Mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer, smiles
(') The kid's still got it
Mike dashes for the bouncing ball, scoops it up, goes for a reverse lay up, makes it but when he lands
he lands
hard
Mike grabs his lower back, groans- (') Ooooh
That was stupid
/ - Mike limps out of the gym, wanders over to a wall covered in Fitch basketball teams of the past
Mike searches the pictures until he finds it
the photo saw being taken earlier
the team of 1989
Ed mid howl from Dom's wedgy
Mike stares at the photograph
lost in time and thought
The smiling, confident image of his youth stares back at him
(o
s
) You know someone in that picture
Mike startles from his daydream, turns
kind-faced, old , stands behind him, mop in hand
do
Me
'm in the center there
The Janitor leans in, takes a closer look at Young Mike
Adolescence can be so cruel
What are you talking about
(lost in the picture ) had life by the balls in that picture
Everything was possible
Then a few minutes later, pffffft, all gone
`For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been
' 10
That'll be my epitaph
We all have regrets
Why's it have to be that way
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't
Can't hurt to ask
You never know who's listening, Michael
Michael wistfully eyes the old photo, looks back to the - How did you know
(
) What are you doing, Dad
, 15, messy hair and slight, and , 17 and awkwardly pretty, appear at the other end of the hall
Hey, Guys
was just talking to- Mike looks back to the Janitor
(') Never mind
Sorry 'm late
You ready to get some dinner then
They make their way towards the door
Mike limping
Why are you limping
Tweaked my back pumping iron
Really, really heavy iron
- Mike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner
Alex eats heartily
Maggie quietly pushes her food around
bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start
11
Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape
Maggie stifles a laugh
That's my boy
Remember, it's not how big you are- -it's how big you play
Father and Son touch fists
And what about you, Mags
What's new
Nothing
She got into Georgetown
You did
That's fantastic
It's no big deal
It's a huge deal
That's a great university
'm proud of you
(Maggie remains quiet) Am  missing something here
You wouldn't understand
Try me
have a lot of emotional stress right now
My friends are all going to different schools, 'm not even sure
12
That's not stress
Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski
Maggie rolls her eyes
Did you get the promotion, Dad
Still waiting to hear
Mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment
/'  - Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van
He, Alex and Maggie step out
Mike eyes the van with disdain
Is your mom home
She's probably out back
Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's
Sound good
'm counting down the minutes
Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside
What's with her
We see you once a week for a couple hours
What do you expect
Alex follows Maggie into the house
Mike makes his way around back
' / - As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom Johnson, 36
Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags
13
Hey, Mike
Good to see you
Tough break, you and Scarlet
Bite me, Dom
Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on
Mike scowls
Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it beneath a dying shrub and rips it out
(') little late for a delivery isn't it
Dom was in the neighborhood
He offered to make a dump run for me
Doesn't he live 30 miles from here
What's your point
Come on
He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now
At least someone's after me
Mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade- `In touch with the ground, 'm on the hunt 'm after you
' Scarlet shakes her head- Please, Mike
This isn't high school
That's not gonna work
`Smell like  sound, 'm lost in a crowd, and 'm hungry like the wolf
' Mike flirtatiously stalks her
Scarlet fights smiling
14
You can stop now
It's not working
`Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and 'm hungry like the wolf' Mike gets close to Scarlet's face
She smiles, stops herself and pushes him away
You no longer have the right to invoke the "wolf
" chastised Mike eyes the yard
it's a
holes and mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes and flowers strewn about
Why are you destroying the yard
Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face
'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients
Thanks for asking
Kind of a big undertaking isn't it
am a landscape designer
Then again you barely took an interest in my work so  guess that's a fair question
An awkward silence
Then- didn't get it
'm sorry
But maybe this is what you needed
Maybe it's time you looked for something else
That's a great idea, Scar
Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma
15
Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground
And it's all my fault, isn't it
didn't say that
No, but it's what you think, right
Mike's silence says it all
Scarlet fights back tears
(') never asked you to marry me
But  did
Scarlet shakes her head in frustration
'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really,  am, but you're not the victim here
Scarlet goes back to shoveling
Mike turns, steps, falls into a hole
'  - somber Mike drives alongside the Los Angeles River
An old song plays low on the radio
static
then roars scaring Mike and literally shaking the Audi
drops in buckets
Jesus
Mike turns the wipers on high
Not much help
He slows the car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield
flashes
We see the Janitor leaning over the railing looking into the raging river
Mike brakes, throws his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain
- Hey
Get away from there
16
Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing
The Janitor's
(') Oh no
Hello
Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down
The phosphorescent water swirls angrily
rising quickly
It's mesmerizing
Magical
Mike can't take his eyes off- Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares back up at him
(') What the- The railing
Mike
headlong into the river
: '  - Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway
The door swings open
muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but in no better shape
follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement, to the door
2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching- Damn it
(pushes doorbell) Ed
Ed
lost my key
'  - Ed, wrapped in a robe, tissue between his toes, wobbles to the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails
Coming
've been worried sick
- Ed opens the door
standing before him is Mike, covered in His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him because
' 17
Ed's eyes widen with
17
've had a really rough night
Ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away
The door opens, the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door
- Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an over-sized loofah
The door slowly swings open
Ed gasps- Don't come any closer
'll use it
What are you gonna do
Exfoliate me to death
(Ed shrieks) You got into my samples case again, didn't you
whimpering Ed points to the mirror
(') What's your problem, it's only mud
The muddy feet turn toward the mirror and- (') the mirror
Mike's 17
He turns on the water, splashes his face frantically
Mud gone
He's still 17
(') Mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off
hairless chest
He yanks off his pants, peeks down his boxers- (') 'm dreaming right
Is this some kind of hallucination
Mike pulls Ed up by his robe
18
(') Do something
Anything
Pinch me
Ed throws a knee into Mike's nuts, bolts out the door Mike crumbles
(') said pinch
' / - Ed reaches the door, fumbles with the locks
He just manages to open the door when Mike tackles him to the floor
The two buddies roll around, limbs intertwined
Calm down
We need to talk
We can work this out
(o
s
) Aye dios mio
They stop wrestling, look up
The   stands in the doorway genuflecting
Maria, we're just friends
Really
The Maid hurries off muttering prayers in Spanish
: ' / - My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements
've recreated the exact contents of the  River
The toxic pollutants, the contaminants
Mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub
Well, it obviously isn't working
19
That's because the cocktail's not complete
Ed picks up a  attached to an extension cord
(') Last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years
Is that true
It was pretty bad
Ed raises the toaster- Wait
Wait
Wait
Do you really think this'll work
It could
Ed tosses it in
Mike screams
Nothing happens
(') Oops
Came unplugged
Won't be a moment
Ed reaches down to plug it in
(') What were you doing by the river anyway
, Light bulb goes off
He leaps out, runs for the house
The janitor
: /  - The Audi screeches to a stop in front of the school
Mike bounds out, wearing a robe, races inside
20
/ - Mike rushes past baffled , asking no one in - Has anyone seen the janitor
Is the janitor here
Where's the janitor
Mike reaches the familiar wall of pictures
Kids point, laugh, stare
, steps from a room
(') Excuse me
Excuse me
Can you tell me where  can find the night janitor
'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here
There was an old guy, white hair
showed him this picture of me- Mike points to the 1989 team photo
-Of you
That picture's from 1989
Mike backs away from the picture and the Janitor
Right
Forget it
Confused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom
He's about to enter, three letter jacket wearing , ,  and , burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by
/ - Mike enters, moves to a sink, turns the water on- (o
s
) Can  get a little help in here
Mike turns, sees what appears to be  stretched over the corner of a closed stall door
21
Mike approaches the door, swings it open
there  Alex, sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground
The back of his underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door
Alex
What are you doing up there
wanted to see if  could get my nuts into my esophagus
What do you think 'm doing
Get me down
Okay
Okay
'll get you down
Mike pulls the underwear off the door
Alex drops, reaches down his pants, adjusts his underwear
How do you know my name
'm
Mark
Freedman
Your Uncle Ed's son
He told me to look out for you
Uncle Ed has a son
Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too
Did those guys do this to you
Goons from the basketball team
But why
Because they can and so they do on a daily basis
() But you're one of them
No, 'm not
Nice robe, guy
Gotta go
Alex walks out bowlegged
devastated Mike watches him go
22
- Mike drives off out of the parking lot
To his left he spies- : Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang
Mike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart
Drive's off
' / - Ed sits at the island, a laptop in front of him
On the screen  see he's perusing www
spellscursesincantations
com
The sound of the front door opening and closing
Mike enters
Did you find the janitor
He doesn't exist
Nothing makes sense
Did he ask you for your soul
No
That's a good sign
We can eliminate Satan
(clicks on a link) think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment
(peruses the page) "Spell affect"
"casting procedure"
yada, yada, yada
Basically it's a learning spell
There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid
My guess is that janitor was probably a war
'm going back to high school
lock
'm sorry
Could you repeat that
Because  thought you just said you were- 23
Going back to high school
Mike grabs a beer from the fridge, cracks it
As Mike is about to take a sip, Ed swipes the beer from his hand it down
Are you out of your freaking mind
My son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla
They need me
What about your job
Email and telephone
got it covered
Well, Scarlet, then
What are you gonna tell her
Nothing
You're just gonna disappear
To be honest,  think she'd rather have it that way
What's with the attitude
Because  know you're going to suck me into this and 'm not going back there, Mike
You'll never get me to go back to Fitch
Never
: / - hate you
24
Ed and Mike sit outside Principal's office
Mike is dressed in an overly exaggerated hip style, (a grown-ups concept of what's cool- he looks ridiculous)
Take a deep breath
All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible
Ed calms
Mike pulls a manila folder out of his book bag
(') Are you sure these look legit
(offended/cocky) Please
created software used to launch the space shuttle
think 'm capable of forging some report cards
What's up with the gear
This is hip teenage apparel
got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy
Ms
Goodwin will see you now
Mike and Ed stand, head for the door marked `Principal'
First sign this old hag is on to us '- Mike and Ed step through the door- '  - , 35, sits behind her desk
she's no hag
She's an attractive, buttoned-up professional
Ed's face lights up and without missing a beat- -so glad we chose this school
'm Ed Freedman
Ed steps in front of Mike, shakes Ms
Goodwin's hand
25
Nice to meet you
'm Julie Goodwin, principal here at Fitch Senior High
And you behind there
You are
Mike tries to peer around Ed
Mike finally physically moves Ed steps aside
Oh, right
Sorry
This little chicken pock here is Mark
Say hello, Mark
Ed smiles, rubs Mikes head vigorously
Mike slaps his hand
Nice to meet you, Julie
Around here you're going to have to use Ms
Goodwin
Please, sit
Mike and Ed sit
Before we get started  want you to know that Mark's a bastard
Excuse me
had him out of wedlock
So the answer is yes, 'm very single
and very rich
Dad met mom in Thailand
She's a very successful prostitute
Ed's smile fades
-Kay
Did you bring your transcripts
Mike hands Julie the folder
As Julie browses through it, Ed and Mike get into a pinching, elbowing fight
When she looks up, the friends stop
Both smiling
26
(') So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut
And you were a straight  student
Very impressive
help him with his homework
a lot
Oh, dad, the doctor called
You were right
It is herpes
Ed's jaw drops
Julie rises abruptly
think it's time we got Mark to class
Lisa
Lisa
The door opens, in steps , 18
(') Lisa, will you print out a schedule for Mark and show him to class
Sure
Come on, Mark
Mike stands
Ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how- Be a good boy now
And sit up straight
Mike glares at Ed, follows Lisa out
Ed turns to Julie
(') They grow up so fast
Mojito
beg your pardon
You strike me as a Mojito gal know this little Cuban place, great - -Yeah, no
don't date my students' parents
It's a rule of mine
27
'll enroll him somewhere else
really need to get back to work
Julie ushers Ed to the door
See you at the next bake sale then
Julie shuts the door, shakes her head in disbelief
/  - Mike steps in
Scattered giggles at his appearance
Mike takes a seat, eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing, ,  and , busy texting on their phones
Do their mothers know they dress like that
next to him leans over- Those are the Wonder Bras
Beware
The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in
Mike's eyes narrow
Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down- What did you did do
Mug the mannequin at the Ed Hardy store
Tool
Laughter from the class
Mike shies
The Jocks sit, Stan behind Mike
Just as the last bell rings, Maggie rushes in, sits with the Bras
Oh thank God he's not here
ran all the way from- Something catches Maggie's eye
It's Mike waving to her
(') Why's that freak waving at me
Maggie places a hand over her face, looks down
28
(o
s
) Take your seats
Stop the talking
, 45, prissy, strides in carrying a stack of papers
Here are yesterday's tests
Let's see how you all did
Moans from the class
Adams walks up and down the aisle slapping them down on the desks
(') -, , -, , -, Adams reaches Maggie, drops the test on her desk
(') for 'Donnell
Humiliated, Maggie lowers her head
(') Let me guess
Early acceptance
(Maggie nods) Where are we going
Georgetown
If you flunk senior calculus you'll be lucky to get into beauty school, missy
So, if you plan on slacking your way through my class, don't
Save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer
Mike angrily stands- Enough
Mr
Adams turns to Mike
Excuse me
Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it
29
And you are
Mark Freedman
It's my first day
Adams turns, walks back towards the front of the room
Well, Mr
Freedman- Stan signals his friends, takes out a , flicks it, leans forward and places the flame  Mike's legs
The flame   against Mike's jeans
The Jocks and Bras pull out their cells and begin
Adams scribbles on a pad- (') -you've earned yourself a trip to the principal's office
Welcome to Fitch
Adams rips the paper off, holds it out towards Mike
Mike sniffs at the air- Is someone barbecuing
() Mike  out of his shoes
runs up his crotch
Mike, , runs around the room fanning his package
Get out, Mr
Freedman
Mike snatches the slip from Adams and out the door
/ - packed lunchroom
The  sit amongst themselves notice all the  hunched over
Mike enters carrying a bag lunch
on the crotch of his pants
spots him, yells- Go Hot Pants
Do your dance, Girl
30
The entire cafeteria turns to Mike and erupts in laughter
As Mike passes each table,  see the kids are watching his `fire dance' on their phones
Mike approaches a table of the 3   in school, unkempt hair, fat, acne
Mike begins to sit when- Look, we feel your pain
We really do
But life's hard enough, Brother
Mike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras
: Wonder Bra Table
Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren pick around plates of cafeteria food
What's the big deal
He stuck up for me in class
It was a nice thing to do
He was totally sexing on you
He's coming
Pretend you're not here
Mike approaches, big smile
The Wonder Bras look off in every direction except Mike's
Hi, Maggie
Hi, girls
'm Mark- The Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike
(') Girls
Hello
Anyone home
Oh my God
Can't you see we're not here
Good
So there's plenty of room then
Mike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie
31
Oh, look
He brought a bag lunch
How sped
(special ed) Mike hides his lunch
Look, this table is
You're a
What's a
Not Important
Go away
Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls
Listen,  appreciate what you did in class but,  already have a boyfriend
You have a boyfriend
(his phone rings) Excuse me a second
Mike pulls out an  Blackberry phone, looks at the caller Scarlet
He sends it to voice mail
He still gets calls
How 2007
think my grandfather has that phone
Maggie, could we talk somewhere - The sound of a bouncing ball interrupts
(o
s
) Yo
Mike turns
Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over
32
Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table
Nothing
He was just leaving
Maggie nods for Mike to go
() We should do this again sometime
Mike stands
Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with her, hands all over her
can see Mike's blood  until- (') Get your hands off her, you little punk
Oops
Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot taller than him
You gotta problem with me, `bra
Mike looks around
the entire cafeteria watches
Defeated- No, no,  don't
Stan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back on Mike's head and  it down
Now make like Tom and Cruise
Flush with humiliation and ice cream dripping down his face, Mike turns and walks out
That was so not cool
What
'll buy you another ice cream
see Alex, seated by himself at a back table, shake his head in disgust
33
/ - beaten down Mike sits alongside Ed at the bar
It was terrible
The place is evil, Ed
That building needs to be exorcised
Come on
It couldn't have been that bad
My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body
Yeah,  caught it on youtube
Funny stuff
They mocked my clothes and phone
My daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and  have mint chip in my ears
High school's great, isn't it
The  approaches
What can  get you
Double scotch neat
Funny, kid
Get the boy a Shirley Temple
Extra cherries
The Bartender nods serves up the drinks
Mike miserably plucks a cherry off his pink drink
'm not going back there

Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience
You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out
An   takes a seat next to the boys
know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden
Because 'm a supportive dad
Because you want to nail my principal
Did she ask about me
She's not your type
She's smart
As far as  can tell that's her only flaw
need a reason to see her again
You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place
You'll figure it out
Then  can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son
What do you think
The Older Lady, having listened to it all, turns to Ed- think you should be reported to child services
Mind your business, Lady
This is a family matter
The Lady turns away in disgust
can't do it
don't have it in me
35
Hey, no sweat off my sack
Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together
He'll be fine
That's what  did
Mike eyes Ed, considers just how "well adjusted" Ed is determined look comes over Mike
He pounds the bar
You're right
My kids need me
At'a boy
Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in 2008

Ed slips a  Magazine into the pile

2 hip  pull clothes from racks
clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, - shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry
Ed nods with his approval or disapproval
At the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes
Ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it
The Girls frown and go back to work

Both wear headphones listening and moving to the music

The Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists

Mike looks up and

Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap
'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas
There must be a very hot girl downstairs
There is
What are you doing
forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her  was in Peru finding myself
Think she'll buy it
Probably not because when she called earlier  told her you were being detained at Guantanamo
Ready for tomorrow
37
am so ready
Ed flips Mike a set of keys
Mike's eyes light up
That ought'a put you over the top
And don't forget to hook me up son
Ed plods off
Off Mike's huge smile

Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang
Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing
horn blares
Stan and Maggie jump out of the way
An    stops next to the crew
The tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike
Mike winks then rolls on past
Oh my god
Was that- Did you see- told you he was cute
/ - It's the
Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip
Samantha, Lauren and Jamie text by their lockers
Mike struts up to them
The Bras smile
So 've been here a couple days now and  think  got it figured out
You girls are lesbians, right
The Bras' jaws hit the floor
Mike walks off, a huge grin on his face
Man, that felt good
38
/ - Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a , scans the crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table
It's a heartbreaking image
Mike approaches- Mind if  sit here
Mark
You look totally different
Mike sits across from Alex
got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead
Could you move to the left a little
Mike inches left, peeks behind him
2 girls eat lunch together
The one facing them is a cute Latino, , 16
Nicole smiles
Alex quickly shies away
Who's she
Nicole Lopez
She's in my Spanish class
Have you spoken to her
No
get all stupid so  just stare
'll tell you a funny story
The first time  met your mother  was so nervous- My mother
What
39
You said, `the first time  met your mother  was so nervous
' did
That's weird
Is your mom hot
Dude
What's going on tonight
You wanna hang out
Do something
Really
Yeah you could show me around
Cool
The Wonder Bras sway in, take seats at the  table
'll swing by your house around 7
Mike rises
wouldn't go over there
Stan and his Baboons have lunch this period
Don't worry
'll see you tonight
Mike strolls over to the Bras' table, plunks himself down
(') Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday
Rosie was on
Melissa Etheridge jammed- -You're so rude
We're not gay
We like boys
Yeah, Samantha's a total slu
Samantha's jaw drops

Last New Year's Samantha made it with my boyfriend
was on like 5 Red Bulls
can't believe you keep bringing that up
The Bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves
Mike pulls out his new iPhone, plugs the earphones in his ears
The Bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone
Rad phone
know
'll text you
Later

Mike rises from the table
Like we'd ever give you our numbers
Stan, carrying a basketball, his goons and Maggie come up behind Mike
Heads up
Stan whips the ball at Mike
Mike, cat-quick, spins around, catches the ball
The whole cafeteria turns their attention on Mike and Stan
Mike points to the name `Stan' on Stan's letter jacket, reads- Stan
Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name
Laughter from the Students
You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are
Cut it out, Stan
Let's eat
41
Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch
Mike ignores him and starts dribbling
You know, Stan,  feel sorry for you
You don't know me
Mike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria
Oh but  do
All too well
You're the man
Captain of the basketball team
Dates the pretty girls
High school is your kingdom
Stan and his Posse tap fists
Mike dribbles between his legs
(') But, People, Stan's a bully
Why
It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick
No, Stan's more complex than that
According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons
1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out
2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped
Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively
And the third reason- Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it
(') 'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3
The entire cafeteria
Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then gently rolls the ball back to Stan
(') () Don't hurt yourself big boy

Some students, including Alex,
The Wonder Bras eye Mike with new found lust
Mike's face as he walks away

Mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across the cafeteria landing on Miss Goodwin's tray, splattering her with food
She glares at Stan
Mike's iphone buzzes

My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know 'm not planning on going to college
lot of kids feel that way
Don't be intimidated
It doesn't hurt to take a look
Mrs
Mencer hands Mike a hefty book
(') good place to start is here
this book has information on every college and university in the country
Thanks
Mike sits, starts paging through the book and gets lost in the bright colored pictures
smiling ,  and - pumped-up Mike dials

On the seat beside him rests a stack of college applications
Ed answers

(o

) Hello
It was incredible
was incredible
You should'a seen me
humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom
Everyone was clapping
The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers
See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig
Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office
Man,  feel great
even shot some hoops after school
No aches
No pains
Gotta run, Buddy
Mike hangs up

Mike climbs out, walks to the door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell
(o

) Coming
The door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire
(') 've been dying to meet you

(gasps) Scarlet
visibly stunned by the resemblance
Is something wrong
() No
It's just
you look like
No
'm fine
Come in
Please
44
' /  - Scarlet and Mike sit across from one another
Scarlet stares at Mike as if examining every pore on his face
And you say Ed Freedman is your father
That's my dad
All 68 inches of him
You don't look anything like him
If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother
My mother

In New Jersey
They met while dad was at Princeton
She was on parole
&, fist fighting, shanking
Nothing major
But she's dead now
Oh
'm sorry
warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season
So how are things with you
Doing anything exciting
Dating
Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe
Why would you ask about Dom
Did Ed tell you to say that
mean do what you want
You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town
'll keep that in mind, Mark
45
Scarlet can't take her eyes off Mike
(') It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager
Mike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes- You doing some gardening
am
'm a landscape designer
'm actually redoing the backyard
'll show you
Scarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors
(') It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some
Scarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights
The yard's been cleaned up
Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone
of unplanted plants, flowers, trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions
' / - Mike and Scarlet step outside
almost don't even recognize it
er
if  had seen it before probably wouldn't recognize it
You wouldn't have
It was a disaster back here a few days ago
Obviously  have a lot to do still
'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here
Scarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining
(') Then 'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants
have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there
() 46
(') And 'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one
It'll be a real sanctuary back here
It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar
chill runs up Scarlet's spine
My husband's the only one that ever calls me that
Alex appears at the doors interrupting- Yo, Mark
Let's do this
Good luck with the project
Nice to meet you
And, Alex, be home by 10:30
Mike heads back inside
Scarlet stares after him
- Mike and Alex step in
How's your mom doing
You know, with your dad not being around and all
She doesn't like to show it but know she's bummed
think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while
Whatever
Mike pulls out his iPhone, text message from Samantha
It reads: ' Wat^

Mike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics

So over it but whatever
Be right back

Got to go
Talk to you later

Let's hit the beach, wingman
The two touch fists
- illuminates the night sky
plays
lay on blankets, play football
Others splash in the ocean
find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire
We were on his myspace page
There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella
heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him
Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib
in Africa
Oh my God
bet he knows Justin
: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand
This looks boring
Let's go back to my house and play video games
Alex turns
Mike grabs his arm, turns him back
48
What are you so nervous about
The beach is for the older, cool kids
don't belong here
What are you talking about
You're a basketball player
You're cool
don't play basketball
mean, can play,  just don't play on the team
Mike is stunned
But  thought you were getting ready for the season
never told you that
As a confused Mike and Alex approach the scene,  call out to Mike, tap his fist
fawn over him
Mike's become a celebrity
and he's eating it up
: Lauren spots Mike with Alex
Here he comes
The Bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy
Can he be any lamer
Using my little brother to get to me
If that boy was an apple he'd be delicious
Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike
Lauren and Jamie chase after her
Maggie shakes her head
As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up
Oh, man
It's her
She's here
49
Who
Alex nods towards the fire
Seated with  is Nicole
Alex  loudly
She's so pretty it makes me gassy
Calm down
Here's what you're gonna do
You're gonna go over there and introduce yourself- She won't like me, Mark
'm a loser
Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders
Why
Because Stan says so
You think Stan's a winner
He's going nowhere
You're a great kid
Any girl would be lucky to get your attention
Really
Really
And right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you
determined look comes over Alex
Okay
What do  say
Just introduce yourself
Then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on
Like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model
(Alex burps nervously) And don't burp on her
can do that
50
Alex takes a deep breath, marches off just as Samantha runs up and throws her arms around Mike
You came
Why don't we take a walk somewhere private and play
Jamie and Lauren rush over
don't think so, Sam
Mark promised me a walk on the beach
Walk with me
've got less miles on me
full blown  breaks out between the Bras
Mike sees Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out
: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses confidence
As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up- Hi
Alex stops, turns back around and blurts out- Hi, Alex
'm Nicole
Nicole and her Friends giggle
You don't look like a Nicole
You have big, meaty man hands
You should be a hand model
The Girls' jaws drop
Nicole hides her hands
Oh my God
Seriously
Alex rips a huge
The Girls duck for cover
1 think he got some on me
51
Wait
'm sorry
'm just real nervous and 've wanted to talk to you for so long
And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but couldn't find anything because everything's so
perfect
Nicole and her Friends
Do you want to sit down, Nicole
Nicole scoots over making room next to her
Alex smiles
: Mike sits down beside Maggie
What do you want
Stan
Why are you dating him
Get to the point why don't you
'm serious
He's not a nice guy
Matter of fact he's a jackass
Don't talk about him like that
You don't even know him
know he bullies your brother
Stan barely knows Alex exists
We're moving in together after graduation
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
thought you were going to Georgetown
'm going to Westwood Community College
Stan and  both are
Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting- 52
The hell you are, Young Lady
If you think 'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy
forbid you to see him anymore and that's final
Maggie jumps up
Kids all stare
Who do you think you are
My father
Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras
Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah 'Donnell
Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare
Maggie heads for the parking lot
Who's Margaret
He doesn't even know her name
He's so not into her
The Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie
Mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the faces of a group of

Ed floats on a raft
frozen drink next to him
Scarlet looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation- haven't heard from him in three weeks
Obviously he doesn't care
He cares
53
Then where is he
Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet- What's going on
Nothing, Mark
was just dropping something off
Scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table
(') Our court date is the 27th
If he has anything to say, he can say it then
Scarlet exits
What was that all about
That envelope contains divorce papers
Mike eyes the envelope, in stunned silence
(') But what do you care
You're going to college, right
Life's one big panty raid for you
Mike feigns innocence
don't know what you're talking about
saw the applications in your room
You went through my room
If you'd cleaned like  asked wouldn't have had to
You can't be serious about this can you
54
Mike starts to argue then gives in- have to face the possibility that might never turn back and if that's the case, 'm going to do it right this time around
Karmically speaking, in the next life you're coming back as a hemorrhoid
Mike scoffs, storms off
Ed calls after him- (') 'm not paying for college
/ - Mike shoves books in his locker
Stan approaches
You like her, don't you
Who
My girlfriend
She told me you were trashing me at the beach
Leave her alone, Stan
She's a good kid
don't know how good she is yet but after  find out, she's all yours
Stan walks off
Mike slams his locker shut

Mike sits just as the rest of the class files in
Stan kisses Maggie and takes his seat

Stan leans on his desk, placing a  and a  on the sticky desktop
He catches Mike looking back at him and gives him a cocky wink
Mike winks back knowingly
Mike's phone beeps
He checks it

wide-eyed Mike spins in his seat to find the Wonder Bras smiling at him
Mr
Adams enters
Settle, people
Adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard
(') This was your homework
Who can come up here and solve this for me
Anyone
Blank, uninterested faces
Scattered giggles
Adams tosses the chalk angrily on his desk
(') Not one person
Fine
Miss 'Donnell
Come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance
Maggie rises nervously from her seat, shuffles to the front of the class
As she passes Stan  see
Stan lifts his fingers from the desktop
it's
he places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells
When Stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose
they Stan tries to raise his other arm
Stuck
'm stuck
My fingers
Stan stands, hunched
the   to his butt
The to his forearm and his   to his nose
The Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk,
Sit down, Stan
Sit down
It's glue
'm glued to everything
56
Jazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist
'll get it off
No
No
Don't pull--
Jazz yanks
Stan's  echoes
/ - Mike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball, stands in the middle of the court
Alex enters
got your text
What's so important
This year you're making the team
We practice everyday `til try outs
That gives us a week and a half
Forget it
Yeah, you're right
You probably don't have any skills anyway
Mike begins to walk out
Hey
got skills
Mike turns back
So what's your problem
Is it Stan and his friends
Just leave it alone
You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex
'm too small anyway
57
That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot
Remember, it's not how big you are- -it's how big you play
() Where did you hear that
() don't know
Read it somewhere guess
Be a sport
Show me what you got
Mike tosses Alex the ball
Alex begins to dribble
Mike steps up to defend
Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs
(') Alright
You got a little game
The doors slam open
In walk Stan and his Posse speckled - covers the tip of Stan's nose
What are you 2 queers doing in my gym
Let's go, Alex
Alex stops dribbling
He and Mike move towards the door
Stan and his Posse block the way
don't think so
You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play
2 on 2
We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs
Stan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles
Come on, Ally
Embarrass me
While dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's midsection, forcing Alex back
58
Back off, Stan
Alex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid- It's okay
got him
Alex throws his hands up, tries to defend the much bigger Stan
Stan easily backs Alex down, faking left and right
You ready
Here it comes
Stan spins, elbows high
Alex catches one to the head and
Stan shoots and scores

And  was fouled

That's enough

Mike holds an ice pack to his eye
My mom's been in there a while
She's gonna be pissed
Act like you're hurt and she won't be able to stay mad at you
The door swings open
An elated Ed blows in
Way to go, slugger
Get any shots in
The Secretary's jaw drops
59
Mr
Freedman, your son has a black eye
Wuss
Ed sits between Mike and Alex
(') Hey, Alex
How you doin', buddy
'm okay  guess
Good
Good
(turns to Mike, nudges ) Nice goin'
How do  look
Anything in my teeth
How's my breath
Ed flashes his pearly whites then blows on Mike
The principal's door opens, an angry Scarlet steps out
Ed
Hey, Scarlet
Exciting, isn't it
My first parent/principal conference
Scarlet looks sternly to Alex- Fighting
What's gotten into you
(rubs his jaw) can't talk, Mom
My jaw
() My poor baby
And how about you, Mark
Scarlet bends down so she's eye to eye with Mike
She removes the ice pack
a purple shiner

(') Ouch
You poor thing
Does it hurt
Scarlet strokes Mike's face
Mike loses himself in her caring, gentle touch
Not anymore
You smell great
Scarlet, a bit weirded out by Mike, stands
Alex, 'll meet you at the car need to talk to Uncle Ed for a second
Alex shuffles out of the office
Scarlet turns to Ed, hushed- (') Did you give him the divorce papers
sent them to him
Is it another woman
can handle it
Tell me the truth
haven't heard from him, really
Scarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit
Okay
If you do, please have him call home
For the kids
'm running out of excuses- 'll tell him
promise
Scarlet forces a smile
Mike watches her go
For the first time he's seen
hurt, pain, frustration
Mike places his head sadly in his hands
Julie the Principal pokes her head out the door
Ed, come on in
Ed whispers to Mike
61
'll take it from here
As Ed passes Julie on the way in- (') 'm heartbroken
The boy's incorrigible
/'  - Ed takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled parent' look
Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much
Boys will be boys
But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair
Ed stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face
My son
Mark
Get in here
Now
Mike slouches in, takes a seat
(') Did you glue a boy to his chair
No
Ed throws his hands up in exasperation
See
The boy's out of control
He's acting up at home
He won't eat his vegetables- He shaves his back
He sucks his thumb
He wears girls underwear
He wets his bed
62
Enough
Mark,  know it's hard to be the new kid but if  have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse
You can go now
Mike nods, exits
Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness- He's crying out for help and don't know what to do
It hurts so bad
Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas
Let's give him time to figure it out on his own
If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step
You're the expert
'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind
Ed shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling

Scarlet peers over her shoulder

Scarlet stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans
Gloves are for sissies
Yeah, but  just had a manicure

You want to help
Are you kidding
love landscaping

(') It's right up there with watching "Sex and the City" and snuggling
Scarlet laughs, eyes him skeptically- Mark, 'm 36 years old- 'm just doing this to make a few bucks so  can buy Laker tickets
() Embarrassing
Sorry
'll give you 10 dollars a day
Wow
10 whole dollars
At that rate  should be able to buy tickets in
2011
Fine

Grab a roll
Mike and Scarlet, step over to the sod, lift a roll together, carry it over to the spot
What are the benefits like here
'll throw in a baloney sandwich
Deal
Mike and Scarlet share a laugh

He takes out a pen, places the tip to the paper where it says `name' when- hear the muffled sound of
Mike rises, follows the sobs through the maze of stacks until he finds- Maggie

Maggie looks up, sees Mike, quickly dries her eyes
64
What do you want
To rub it in my face
Say  told you so
You lost me
Maggie drops her head back between her knees
Stan dumped me
Maggie  loudly
Mike panics, fearing the worst- What happened
What did he do
You didn't
My mom was working last night
Stan came over with a box of- Mike slaps his palms over his ears
Your next word better be `cookies' or you're in big, big trouble
What am  going to do
can't live without him
Maggie takes Mike's shirt,  her nose on it
Maggie, did you two
you know
do
Do what
That thing
that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when she's married
Sex
No, that's why he dumped me
Maggie bawls again
Mike silently celebrates, sits beside her, awkwardly pats her on the back
65
There, there now
It's okay
Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me
Which is more than  can say for any other man in my life
Maggie sobs uncontrollably
Mike takes a deep breath, calms- When you're young everything seems like the end of the world
But it's not
It's just the beginning
And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated
like the sun rises and sets with you
You really think so
know so
Maggie throws her arms around Mike, hugs him tight
Mike hugs her back

You're so sweet

Adam's chagrin

the Wonder Bras text on their phones
He's confused until- -Mike turns a little more in his seat
smiles seductively at him, blows a kiss
Mike , spins back around

She turns, finds Mike  in the grass
Scarlet picks up the hose,

Mike and Alex school Stan and Jazz
Steals, picks, fancy passes and scoring
The Coach watches with awe
final 3 pointer by Mike in Stan's face seals the deal
That makes 11-3
Game over
Gather up
As Alex passes Harvey, Harvey stops him- (') You've gotta little bit of your old man in you, 'Donnell
The Team and the Hopefuls huddle around Coach Harvey
(') As you all know due to the amount of seniors coming back  only have 2 open spots on the roster
It's Freedman and 'Donnell
The rest of you hit the showers
The Hopefuls trudge out of the gym
Alex leaps into the air
Wooo
We did it, Mark
We did it
You killed it out there

As he passes a half open door, he pauses, peeks in
Scarlet, facing away, pulls a shirt over her nude back, shakes out her long hair
Mike watches
no, he  longingly, lovingly
lost in her beauty until
Scarlet turns, startles- Mark
didn't know you were there
'm sorry
You just look so beautiful
Scarlet blushes
it's been a while since she's heard that
Thank you
Can  zip you up
'm wearing a sweater
Your jeans
Scarlet walks towards him and
shuts the door on him
Mike wanders to the bathroom, shaking his head- (') Stupid, idiot, stupid
' / - Mike enters, steps over to the toilet
Maggie slips in behind him, shuts the door
He whirls around
Maggie, what
Maggie places a finger on his lips
70
Shhh
get it now
Why you didn't want me to be with Stan, the nice things you said in the library
It's because you wanted me
Maggie backs Mike against the wall
Maggie, listen to me
'm not the person you think
Shhh
Yes, you are
You're a good guy
You're not like the others
That's right
'm not like the others
'm very different than the others
So different that you and  can never be
Maggie stops, looks quizzically at Mike- What are you trying to say
Are you
"confused"
Yes
Yes
That's it
'm confused
Extremely confused
Ohmygod
It all makes sense now
Your hair
The highlights
Mike starts to speak
Stops
Finally gets it- What
No-no-no-no
'm not gay
'm
've been in love with the same girl since  was 17
Maggie switches back into predatory mode
Who is it
Does she go to our school
Do  know her
No, you don't
Now- (eyes the toilet) -if you don't mind
71
Tell your girlfriend she better keep a close eye on you
Maggie smiles seductively and struts out
' / - Alex types on his phone
Mike enters
Who you texting
My dad
have to tell him about today
Mike nods
then realizes
Alex and Maggie look to Mike
Mike checks his phone
(') Did you just get a text
() Me
No
Yes
It's Ed
mean dad
Not your dad
My dad
'll just call him back
Scarlet enters
She looks
So
What happened
Tell me
Tell me
'm dying to hear
did it
'm a Falcon
The first game's in 2 weeks
Oh my God, Alex
That's so incredible
Scarlet wraps Alex in a big hug
Mike watches
It's a bittersweet moment for him
(') 'm so happy for you
And now want to show you guys something
Scarlet, unable to contain her excitement, leads Mike and Alex to the french doors and flicks a light switch
72
(') Ta da
Thousands of tiny, white lights illuminate Scarlet's
You hung the lights
wanted you to be the first to see it
Mom, it's sick
' / - The 3 step outside
Mike, truly blown away, takes picture with his iPhone
It's amazing
'm speechless
'm sorry  never saw how talented you are
mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city
() Thank you
Mom, why are you all dressed up
Oh my God
almost forgot have a date
Off Mike's stunned reaction
: ' / - Mike marches in behind Scarlet
As they reach the door, he steps in front of her
Let's see who the lucky guy is
73
Mike swings the door open revealing
Dom Johnson
(') knew it
Mike shuts the door, blocks it
(') knew you had a thing for him
You can't do this
You took vows
What kind of example are you setting for the kids
Mark, 'm flattered
Really,  am
But 'm too old for you
Scarlet moves Mike aside, opens the door
Dom stands in the doorway holding a bouquet
Wow
You look absolutely ravishing
Keep it in your pants, Casanova
Don't mind him
You all set
Let's do it
Scarlet heads for the van
Dom looks to Mike- (') Hey, kid
if the vans'a rockin'
well you know the rest
Dom imitates humping, jogs after Scarlet
Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson
know where you live
Mike slams the door
' / - contemplative Alex scoops lasagna onto plates
An agitated Mike enters, pulls up a seat at the counter
74
It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad
It's adultery
If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats
You need to talk to her
My mom's been pretty sad the past few months
She deserves to be happy
My dad obviously is
wherever he is
Maybe he's not
Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be
No, my dad's not a family guy
This is dumb but  used to tell him was on the basketball team because knew he'd never make it to a game
Then why would you tell him that
guess  was hoping it would make him like me more
Mike is
- Mike paces in front of a dressing room
waits by the door
My wife's moving on
My son doesn't think  like him and my daughter's in love with me
need to change back, Ed
Ed steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip clothes that belong on a 20 year old
he looks ridiculous
75
What about college
'm not going
'll be a pharm rep til  die
just want my family back
() You're not gonna wear that, are you
Ed checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily
Baby's got back
Ed retreats into the changing room
(') (o
s
) Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight,  need you to start behaving
can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate
Fine
want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team
Is that cool
Ed, wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks, steps from the room, hands the clothes to the Salesman
Wrap it up
No, it's not cool remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool
Listen to you
You sound like an old man
Other  eye Ed oddly as they pass
No party
mean it
Don't make me take the car away
Don't treat me like a child, Ed
76
won't when you stop acting like one
Mike grabs Ed's bare tits and
Ed screams, grabs Mike's tits and
Both of them  in pain
Sir
Please
Mike and Ed, both still titty twisting, look up
Everyone in the store stares
They each let go, force smiles
This isn't over
son
Not even close
Dad
Ed stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs
Mike pulls out his iPhone, begins texting
: / - The Wonder Bras stand by their lockers when their phones beep
' Party at my house 2nite

Get the word out
The Bras type away, simultaneously hit hundreds of students
the beeps of hundreds of cell phones
'  - line the street
steady flow of  stream towards the front door
pounds from within
It's a
' / - Kids raid the refrigerator, throw food around
Another  sprays the room with the removable sink head
Mike rushes in, grabs the sink head from the Kid
77
Give me that
(
) Hey, Sexy
Mike turns without thinking  all 3 Wonder Bras in the face
The Bras scream
Mike replaces the nozzle
'm so sorry
Have you seen Alex
The Bras wipe themselves off, grab Mike's hands
Dance with us
The Bras drag a reluctant Mike out of the kitchen and into - ' /  - - dance everywhere and on top of everything
The Bras surround Mike, each girl grinding on him as if it were a competition
Lauren takes Mike by the face, turns him towards her- Nambib-bib-ib, that African country makes me horny
Jamie spins Mike towards her, places his hands on her boobs- Perfect, aren't they
Samantha pulls Mike roughly by the hair, twists him around- Which one of us is it gonna be
Mike tries to squeeze out
The Bras block him
The music changes
a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This' blares
thought you girls wanted to dance
Mike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine  saw from the first scene
78
The Bras back up
Party-Goers stop what they're doing and watch
not sure whether to laugh or join in
And then, the Bras fall in
Followed by others
The party just got hotter
Maggie runs through the party and out the back
Stan chases after her
Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside
' / - Stan corners Maggie against the back wall
was upset
'm sorry
But need you to show me you love me
Then we'll move in together
Whatever
'm with someone else now
Yeah, right
Who'd be stupid enough
Him
Stan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches
Party's over, Stan
You're out of here
Who's gonna make me leave
You
would but it smells like you've been drinking so 'll let the cops do it
Mike pulls out his phone
Stan looks to Maggie then back to Mike, laughs- You can have the nun
She doesn't put out anyway
79
On second thought- Mike
Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut
Mike's eyes roll back in his head and  cut to
/  - The  shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window
Ed wears his new Gucci outfit
Julie's under dressed
There you are, Mr
Freedman
Thanks
Put this towards your studies
Ed hands the Hostess a 50
Julie rolls her eyes
When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what envisioned
This isn't a date, Ed
Are you insinuating that 'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you
What kind of a father do you think  am
As long as we're on the same page
approaches
Good evening
Would you care to see the wine- Bring us the 1962 Petrus
The Waiter nods, leaves
(') You're going to love this wine
$2000 dollars a bottle
80
don't drink
So tell me what you think's going on with Mark
It's baffling really but  noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately
Maybe he's gay
You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you
Do you like caviar
Because if you do you have to try the Almas
100 year-old Beluga
$700 per ounce
Julie throws her napkin on the table
You're disgusting, Ed
What
You don't like Beluga
You can get something else
'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine
Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo
came here because 'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark
All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are
do care about Mike
Mark
Whatever his name is
You know what's too bad, Ed
'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet
() 81
(') But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems
Instead it made you just like them
have to go
Julie rises
Ed takes her wrist
Wait
You're right
'm acting like an idiot
'm sorry
Please stay
Julie begrudgingly sits back down
Act normal or 'm leaving
' /'  - Mike's face, eyes shut
hand gently strokes his head
Mike stirs awake, smiles, eyes still closed- had the craziest dream
was 17 again and back in high school
It was horrible, Scarlet- (o
s
) Scarlet
Mike's eyes pop open
reveals Mike and Maggie on the bed
Mike's head rests on Maggie's lap
Mike  off the bed, scrambles to the other side of the room and behind a chair
Maggie leaps off the bed
(') You wanna play
Okay, let's play
'm the hungry lioness and you're a baby gazelle
Maggie , chases Mike around the room
Wait
This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional
Listen to me, Maggie
'm your father
Maggie growls, stalks Mike around the bed
And 've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy
82
Maggie dives across the bed
Mike dodges, runs out the door
' / - Alex and Nicole sit closely by a fire pit, laughing
How about Mrs
Cruz
Every time she rolls her r's she spits all over me
Alex imitates Mrs
Cruz
Nicole laughs, places her hand on Alex's leg
Alex looks down at her hand, then up at her, both staring at one another
Nicole closes her eyes, moves in
Alex moves in then He bounds out of his chair, sprints inside leaving Nicole hanging
'  - distraught Alex pushes his way through the insanity
He finds Mike running down the stairs
Mike,  blew it
totally blew it
Blew what
What happened
She wanted me to kiss her but panicked
didn't know if should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue 'm supposed to use- Slow down
Have you ever kissed a girl before
Not a real one
used to practice on my dad's Playboys
How did you find
forget it
It's easy
All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like - 83
Mike places a hand gently on either side of Alex's face
(') -hold her still as you adjust your head, close your eyes and kiss her
The rest happens naturally
walks past, sees Mike romantically holding Alex's face
That is so wrong
Mike and Alex quickly separate
What if , you know, pitch a tent
If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back
Now go get that kiss
Alex takes a deep breath, steps outside
' / - determined Alex marches over to the seated Nicole
Nicole
Nicole stands- 'm sorry, Alex
didn't mean to- Before she can finish Alex's hands are on her face and his lips on hers
It's as if time stands still
'  - Mike watches his son's
And when Alex takes a step back, Mike laughs
Mike pulls out his phone
Text message

^stairs
mastr b-room
Mike rushes to the stairs
An angry Maggie storms down them
Mike ducks
Maggie passes
Mike races up
84
' / - Mike sprints down the hall, throws open the door to find- ' /  - Samantha, Jamie and Lauren in the bed, clothes on the floor
We decided not to make you choose
You can have all 3 of us
The chance of a lifetime
legend making moment
(looks sadly at the Bras) Girls, if  was 20 years younger 'd
probably only last 10 seconds anyway
Put your clothes back on
Mike turns, exits
On the way out  actually hear
Was he crying
- Julie laughs hysterically
God's honest truth
had the whole costume
used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard
No wonder  didn't get a date all through high school
Annnnd you think 'm the biggest nerd ever
No, no, really
don't
(catches her breath, suddenly serious) Hark
Who goes there
() Tis
The Wizard they call Marius
And who might you be fair maiden
85
Free to be herself, Julie lets her hair down, shakes it out
Tis
Elf Princess Ariala of Jamroar
Level 10
Mage
Level 15
Bitch
They stare at each other incredibly turned on
Ed screams- Check please
' / - a Heavy Kid leans over the pool
Wider
Mike beside him while Kids cheer the Heavy Kid on
'm so dead
Mike turns, finds  making her way through the crowd
(') Oh no
Mike rushes over to her
(') Scarlet, what are you doing here
'm looking for Alex
It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone
Is he here
Yeah, he's fine
He's with his girlfriend
Alex has a girlfriend
86
He does and she's really cute
Come on
Mike leads Scarlet away from the pool
- Ed and Julie drive through the upscale neighborhood
How did you get your hands on the 5th edition
That's not due out for another three years
have two words for you
Russian mafia
Drive faster
He steps on the gas
He fishtails around a corner
Cars pack Ed's street and driveway
Boys and girls trample the front lawn
One  urinates in a flower bed
(') Calm thyself, Marius
That little-
'll kill him
Ed double parks the car, jumps out
'  - Ed storms up the driveway
Julie hurries after him spies Julie, calls out- It's Ms
Goodwin
Run
All the Kids on the lawn  in different directions
' /  - Ed and Julie enter the crowded, loud room
Kids dance, stomp around on the furniture
furious Ed screams- 87
Everybody out
Get out
Get out
Nobody flinches
Julie  loudly
The Kids stop
This party is over
If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave
now
The Kids  for the door
Ed stops a
Do you know where Mark Freedman is
think  saw him go outside
slice of pizza falls from the ceiling onto Ed's head
The Girl laughs, exits
' / - Maggie enters, weeds through the crowd, bumps into the Bras
Have you seen Mark
We're looking for him too
Maggie scowls, heads for the back door
The Bras chase
' / - Mike and Scarlet hide behind the pool house, peek around the corner, spy on Alex and Nicole by the fire pit
Alex is animated, confident
He's like a totally different person
Scarlet and Mike step back by the pool, sit on a lounge
(') It's been so good for him to have you around
You have no idea
88
Believe me,  do
He's a great kid
And you're an amazing mother
'm not so sure
mean look at me
showed up at a party to drag my son home
Could  be any more embarrassing
And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off
Hey, you didn't run him off
Don't blame yourself for his stupidity
knew he was unhappy
knew he hated his job
should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through
He gave up a lot for me
That's bull shit
You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me
him
He was just too selfish to recognize it
At least, that's how  see it
Scarlet smiles thankfully at Mike
Maggie and the Bras roam the backyard searching for Mike
He's over there
By the pool
Who's the ho
Mom
Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards the house when Alex freezes- Whoa
What's my mom doing here
Scarlet places a hand over Mike's
89
You're sweet
have no idea why 'm telling you all this
There's just something so familiar
Scarlet looks into Mike's eyes
Mike stares back
She's vulnerable
He loves her
It's perfect
Mike leans in and Mike falls off the chair
Scarlet leaps up
(') What do you think you're doing
Mike scrambles to his feet
Scar, just calm down
have something to tell you but  need you to keep an open mind
Can you do that for me
This conversation is over, Mark
'm not Mark
'm not in the mood for games
It's no game
'm me
him
Mike
It's me
your husband
Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow- What
Why would you say that
It's the truth
'm the father of your children
You have to believe me
Don't ever come near me or my family again
If you do, 'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized
Scarlet marches towards the house
Mike on her heels pleading
90
Let me explain, Scar
As she passes Ed and Julie
Your son needs a shrink
Scarlet storms off
Before Mike can protest- Pervert
Mike turns
Maggie lights him up, runs for the house
, ,
The Bras add theirs on the way out
Alex and Nicole march past
Mike reaches for Alex's arm
Alex pulls it away
Alex, wait
Let me explain- How could you do this to me
Alex whisks Nicole into the house
Mike lowers his head
Ed stomps over, grabs Mike
This place is a disaster
kid pissed all over my English garden
What were you thinking
She hates me, Ed
've ruined everything
Mike runs for the house
Julie looks quizzically to Ed
Who hates him
What's going on
Ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath
Oh boy
don't quite know how to put this
Try being honest
91
He's not really my son
don't have a son
Ed looks like he's about to cry
Mark's obviously having a crisis and you
you insensitive bastard, you disown him
He'd be better off with his mother in Thailand
Julie strides for the house
Ed yells after her- Should  call you
'  - All is normal
No signs of a party
' / - Ed knocks and knocks on Mike's bedroom door
Come on
It's been 2 days
Open up
hear a dragging sound then
Ed turns the knob, opens the door, enters
' /'  - Dark
Mike climbs back into bed
Ed waves at the air
Jesus
It smells like Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen in here
Ed pulls up the blinds, opens the windows
disheveled, Mike groans, rolls away from the light
Ed sits on the bed
(') Are you alright
really messed up
've lost my family
92
That's not true
Nothing's ever truly lost
What about you and Julie
Oh, that
That's lost
Sorry about the party
'll pay for any damages
Don't worry about it
My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good
don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but- Ed holds up the manila envelope of divorce papers
(') -you're due in court in an hour
look of determination comes over Mike's face
'  - The  roars out of the garage, Ed driving, tears down the driveway, fishtailing onto the street,  , rips across a neighbor's lawn then back onto the road and off
/ - Crowded pews
Scarlet stands before the , her right hand raised as she's sworn in
-the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God
do
Scarlet sits beside her
The Judge eyes her papers
93
You've requested a divorce by the State of California citing irreconcilable differences
Is this correct
Yes, your Honor
Is Michael 'Donnell or his representative present
() No, your Honor
Then  take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce
Let's proceed
You're not asking for alimony or child support
No, your honor
- Ed's  skids to a stop in front of the building
Mike and Ed bound out, race up the court steps- What exactly are we doing
don't know
We just need to stop her from going through with it
well thought out plan
Good job
/ - The mother will have full custody of the children
The father will have visitation rights of one weekend a month- 94
The doors burst open
All turn to see Mike and Ed storm down the aisle
declare a mistrial on the grounds of insufficient evidence and Sacco and Vanzetti
Scarlet can only shake her head
Sacco and
what are you
who are you
am legal counsel for Mike 'Donnell and  demand a stay of execution for this marriage, your Majesty
He's my husband's best friend
Are you a lawyer, best friend
No but  have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so- Bailiff
Get these 2 out of my courtroom
The Bailiff grabs Mike and a yelling Ed, drags them toward the exit
Mike wiggles free, runs back to the front
Your Honor
have a letter from Mike 'Donnell
Just let me read it
Please
'm sorry, but- If it's okay, your Honor
'd like to hear it
Make it quick
Mike digs into his pocket, pulls out a piece of paper
95
Thank you, your Honor
() September 7th, 1988 was the first time  saw you
You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns  Roses -shirt
'd never seen anything so perfect remember thinking  had to have you or 'd die
not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have
You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and  felt so peaceful and safe because  knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because  had you
And then grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures
But  was never lost
'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older
And  never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me
And at that dance you said you loved me
And as  stand here
as  write this,  want you to know if  don't have you 'll die
not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have
oh and
'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'
Mike places the    , looks over to Scarlet
Scarlet just stares at him, tears streaming down her cheeks
sadness
recognition
Alright, son, you have to go now
Mike nods, walks down the aisle and out the door
(') Let's proceed
Your Honor, Sir
'm sorry
'm in no shape
need to postpone
'm sorry
96
tearful Scarlet starts to leave, stops, picks up Mike's `letter'
She looks back confused
- solemn Mike stares out the window
Ed turns the radio off
Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment
Mike looks to Ed
What are you talking about
According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back
That speech should've broken the spell
Enough with the magic crap, Ed
You know what this means
You need to let them go
You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours
Mike chokes back tears
because he knows Ed is right
' /'  - Mike works on his laptop, plugs his iPhone into it
downloads pictures
Mike moves to the bed, packs his Falcons uniform into a duffel bag
Mike unplugs the iPhone, types an email to Scarlet, " think this will help your business
Best of luck, Mark" Mike hits send, grabs his bag and exits
'  - Mike steps outside, throws his duffel into the Aston
Ed exits the house
97
Where you going
'm moving on
See you at the game
Mike climbs into the car, pulls out of the driveway
' / - Scarlet sits at the kitchen table working on her laptop
The noise of an incoming email
She clicks over
Scarlet reads Mike's email then clicks on the link
web site pops up
`Scarlet's Sanctuaries'
Scarlet smiles
/ - An empty gym
Mike stands feet beyond the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots
Automatic
Coach Harvey enters
Hey, Freedman, save some for the game
Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the coach
Just warming up, Coach
Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel
Son,  haven't seen anyone with your shooting ability in, well, in a long time
called a couple college scouts  know
They're coming to the game tonight
to watch you
If you have half the season  think you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want
That's the plan, Coach
The rest of the Falcons basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a
98
Round up, Jock Straps
Picture time
The Team assembles in the middle of the court
Alex moves away from Mike
kneeling in front holds a sign, ` , 2008
' 3, 2, 1- And with the flash  cut to: / - rocks the gymnasium
dance on the sidelines
and  cheer wildly from the packed stands
Julie gabs with a group of
On one end of the court, the Falcons run a pass and shoot drill
On the opposite end, a  in  shoots around
Mike sees Scarlet and Maggie enter
He smiles apologetically to them
Both turn away, climb the bleachers, join Nicole and the Wonder Bras
(to Scarlet) thought he was hanging out with Alex to get to me- not you
Coach Harvey claps loudly- Alright, Ladies, bring it in
The Falcons swarm the bench, take their seats
Mike takes a deep breath, sits next to Alex
Alex looks down

never meant to hurt you- Then why'd you kiss my mom

Alex, 'm your fa
don't know
'm sorry
Alex stands- You're lucky  don't punch you out
Alex moves down the line, takes another seat
Ed strides through the door spots Julie, makes his way over to her
Julie, can  talk to you
Julie excuses herself from the Teachers
What is it, Ed
've seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him
And maybe we'll never be there but
just really want to play  &  with you
Julie can't help but smile, sizes Ed up
You can raid my dungeon anytime
'll bring my long bow

Let's go
Remember, Boys, winners get the girls
Losers please themselves
Mike and the Falcons jog onto the court
Mike takes his place for the jump ball
The Crowd stomps, cheers
Mike looks around the gymnasium
it almost seems to the sound deafening
He finds Alex on the bench
his hopeful face
Mike looks into the stands
Maggie and Scarlet
Scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the bleachers and exits the gym

The Ref readies to toss the ball
Mike takes a deep breath
and walks off the court
Son
Come back here
You're gonna get a delay of game
This can't be happening again
Mike steps over to Alex- It's your turn now
Good luck
Mike rushes off the court
As Mike disappears into the tunnel,  see the   amongst the crowd
He smiles
Coach Harvey turns to Alex- Get off your butt, 'Donnell
Get in there
Alex leaps off the bench

The tunnel is
Crestfallen, Mike lowers his head
: Scarlet as she appears at the far end of the tunnel
What took you so long
: Mike and he's 36 years-old again, bursting out of his uniform
The best choice  ever made was you
Scarlet and Mike walk towards one another, picking up their pace the closer they get
How did this happ- 101
Mike wraps his arms around her
Don't ask
They lock lips
Mike takes Scarlet's hand and as they walk out of the tunnel- (') think it's best if we don't tell the kids about this
Especially Maggie
