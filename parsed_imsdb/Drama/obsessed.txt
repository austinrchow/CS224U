Written by David Loughery October 15, 2007 : - two-story California Craftsman with a  sign in the front yard
Yukon  pulls into the drive and stops
The driver's door opens and   steps out, a handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business and life
Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he does is cross the lawn to the  sign
With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the sign and pulls it out of the ground
' Derek
erek looks over to where his pretty wife  is standing beside the , holding their cute 2 year old son  in her arms
Beth shakes her head with amusement
What are you going to do with that
: - The  sign, now in pieces, burns brightly in the fireplace
The rest of the room is empty except for  who is nearby, asleep in his stroller
Derek and Beth's drift down from upstairs
' This is coming down
' Why
' Do you want people to think we put it up
' (soft chuckle) don't know
kind of like it
' Please tell me you're joking

- Derek and Beth stare up at their own reflections in a huge ceiling mirror
The rest of the room is vacant
All 'm saying, before we take it down
maybe we should try it out
() You know
Christen the new house
And what do you suggest we use for a bed
What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet
() Because 'm gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my -- Derek puts his arms around her waist and pulls her close
Beth resists -- but only slightly
(cont'd) Don't you have to go to work
(nuzzling her neck) Told `em 'd be late
What about
Kyle
That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off
Maybe not, but the movers
Won't be here for another hour
Beth smiles, giving in
They look up at themselves in the mirror like naughty teenagers
Derek, you are so bad
() 3
: Isn't  why you married me
As they begin to kiss passionately
: - Distorted images of Derek and Beth in the mirror's reflection, naked bodies intertwined, making love on the carpet
Kyle continues to snooze in his stroller
Outside the window, a moving van arrives and  its horn
Beth, drowsing in Derek's arms
They stir at the sound of the horn
Want me to stay
Crack the whip on these guys
No
Go to work and earn that promotion
Somebody's got to pay for all this
They share a quick kiss and then Beth swings over to find her clothes
As Beth dresses, Derek stares up at himself
He smiles with satisfaction
Life is good
: - bring in furniture, placing a big glass table in the dining room area below the stairs
Nearby, Beth opens a box and removes family pictures
She arranges them with loving care on the mantle above the fire place

: of Derek and Beth in their early dating days, at their wedding, celebrating holidays, Beth pregnant, the birth of Kyle; photos illustrating the history of this happy family
: - Picture of Beth and Kyle smiling at him from the dash, Derek drives the freeway toward the skyscrapers of downtown
He listens to the stock and financial report
Then, switches over to  and Gnarls Barkley's "Gone Daddy Gone" blares out
The two sides of Derek Charles : - from a towering glass and steel office building as Derek's Yukon enters the parking garage
: Derek and several others ride up from the parking garage
Derek scans the Business page of a folded newspaper
he elevator stops on the ground floor, the door slides open and   get on
The doors shut and the car ascends
t other floors, people get on and off until it's just Derek and one other passenger:  , balancing an arm load of thick files
She's in her mid-20's, white, beautiful, glasses and hair pulled back projecting an efficient, smart and sophisticated look; simple blouse and skirt, high heels, great legs
Lisa glances over at Derek, intrigued
Gage/Bendix
Derek looks up from his paper with a distracted smile
Excuse me
couldn't help but notice we're both going to Seven
() 5
: Right
Gage/Bendix
work there
thought you might
Do you have an appointment with us
Why
Do  look like a client
Actually, you do
(pleasant laugh) ell,  hate to shatter the illusion but 'm just a lowly temp
(genuinely surprised) You're a temp
Just here for the day
Well, you could have fooled me
Lisa shifts on her feet
'm beginning to think these heels were a big mistake
Derek glances down at her shapely legs
(cont'd) should have worn my track shoes
They've got me running all over town picking up these disclosure -- That's when the pile in her arms slides south
The files fall to the floor and spread out in a mess
Lisa  and drops to her knees
(cont'd) God, 'm such a klutz
Derek bends down to help
Their hands touch briefly
() 6
: (2) No problem
Happen to anybody
They straighten up, look at each other
he door slides open, revealing the sleek and vast offices of ,
Thanks
owe you one
Derek through a warren of cubicles where attend phones and computers
He becomes aware that Lisa is right behind him
(with humor) Are you following me
No
'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office
They said it was this way
Derek Charles
guess you probably know him
Oh, yeah,  know him
(lowers his voice) Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously
But don't tell him  said that could get you into trouble
Deep trouble
Approaching a desk where Derek's assistant, a mild-looking man in his late 30's named  looks up and smiles
Across from Patrick is another desk and another assistant, a middle-aged woman named
Morning, Derek
How's the new house
() 7
: (3) Total chaos
Lucky for me,  sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up
Beth must have loved that
If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her 'm in a meeting
Remember who used to sit at this desk
She'll know  am lying
(with a smile) Good point
Patrick  as Derek enters his office and vanishes inside
Patrick notices Lisa standing there with her arm load of files
(to Lisa) Can  help you
Lisa stares at Derek's office
That's Derek Charles
Yes
Lisa breaks into a smile; obviously charmed
Patrick takes amused notice of Lisa's interest in Derek
(cont'd) () Watch it, girl
He's married
The good ones are always married
(dramatic sigh) Or straight
: 8
- Derek sits at a long table with his silver-haired boss, and his best friend and co-worker
One wall of the room is glass, giving a view of the outer office activity (to Derek) Did you talk to our German friend, Herr Ganz
Matter of fact,  just got off the line to Berlin
And
Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest
You think he's right
Hell, no
think he's a hundred percent wrong
We haven't even gotten close to that point yet
Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance
You know Ganz
He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream
He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead
to the tune of 155 mil
() knew there was a reason  promoted you
No offense, Ben
None taken, Joe
'm just honored to be allowed to exist in Derek's world
Derek looks over at Ben who winks at him
They're friends and good-natured ribbing is part of their relationship
() 9
: Good
want you to throw Derek all your support on this one
hat's when Lisa walks by on the other side of the glass
Gage perks up
(cont'd) Whose legs are those
Never seen `em before
think she's one of the temps
You mean temptress
Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her
Doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys
Ben agrees
Derek merely nods
He's not comfortable with this tone of sexism
: - End of the day
Workers are leaving
Derek passes an open office door
Ben sticks his head out
scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow night
Think you can get free
'm moving into a new house
So
Do  look like a man who wants a divorce
could call and say it's a work emergency
() 10
: Thanks, but  think 'll stay married instead
() Coward
Ben ducks back into his office
Derek walks past a cubicle on their way to the elevator
Good night, Mister Charles
Derek stops, turns and sees Lisa sitting at a computer station
She smiles (cont'd) You punk'd me
() Sorry but you set me up
(with humor) Don't worry
'll get my revenge
And by the way, you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you
About what
About Derek Charles being an asshole
They all say he's the nicest guy in the firm
Well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled
And he's humble, too
'm Lisa, by the way
Lisa Sheridan
Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan
Good luck with your next job -- erek continues on to the elevator
Lisa calls after him: () 11
: (2) Actually, they're keeping me on a few more days, so 'll probably see you on Monday
Can't tell if he heard
Lisa watches him go out of sight, then, curious, she turns to her computer and pulls up Derek's bio and picture on the company web site: "Derek Charles graduated from  with a major in finance
Began his career with major Wall Street Brokerage firm before joining Gage/Bendix working with clients to help them accomplish their investment objectives
From asset allocation and investment planning, pension analysis, etc
" : - '  - Kyle is asleep in his crib
Derek and Beth look down on him, smiling, then move quietly toward the door
Before they can sneak out, Kyle lets out
They look at each other
Damn
Almost made it
Your turn
erek returns to the crib and picks up Kyle
Hey, little man
What's wrong
You should be
(feeling him) Uh oh
Poopy diaper
Beth
(in the doorway; with a laugh) 've been changing him all day
Beth leaves
Derek carries Kyle over to the changing table, opens Kyle's diaper and turns away
Whew
What's that woman been feeding you
: 12
- Derek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below
In the distance, the  basin sparkles like a diamond in the night
Derek and Beth are happy but exhausted
In front of them is an empty pizza box
Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and pours some for Beth and himself
They're both a little drunk
Well, we toasted the house -- Toasted Kyle -- Your promotion -- But 've saved the most important toast for last
(raising his glass) To my beautiful wife who  love and adore more than anything in the world
And to my handsome husband
asked for the moon and he gave me the stars
hey clink glasses and drink
(cont'd) Derek
() Uh huh
How would you feel about trying out that mirror again
This time in our own bed
(perks up) Yeah
Give the magic mirror another test drive
You know how  like looking at your sexy butt
() 13
: () Beth, you are so bad
Isn't that  you married
: - Derek arrives to find Lisa sitting at his outer desk in Patrick's place
She looks up and smiles
She's not wearing her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer, less severe look
Hi
Remember me
Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp
Where's Patrick
Out with the flu
did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk
hope that's okay
Uh
sure
Looking over at the assistant outside the other corner office
(cont'd) Hey Marge
Good morning, Derek
Back to the temp
Grab your pad and follow me
Derek goes into his office
Lisa collects her things and does as told
' Derek goes behind the desk as Lisa enters and sits down on the couch
She crosses her legs
Those great legs
() 14
: put a memo on your desk about the Christmas party this Friday
Is it that time already
Derek picks up the memo and scans it
Why don't they invite spouses
How's that
To the Christmas party
It says "for employees only
" It's like that in most companies
They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about
So, does this party get pretty wild
Just the opposite
Well that's no fun
Derek notices a container of Starbucks coffee
(cont'd) called Patrick
He said you like it black with two sugars
Derek is impressed
He opens the container
(cont'd) If it's cold,  can run down and nuke it in the Break Room
(takes a sip) No, it's perfect
Lisa is pleased
She raises her pad and pencil
() 15
: (2) Fire away
Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday
took care of that
Took care of what
On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen long-stemmed red roses
(off Derek's look of surprise) called to confirm they've been delivered
Thanks
think that's incredibly sweet
How long have you two been married
Three years in March
And you still send her flowers every Monday morning
Lucky girl
It's kind of a tradition
Patrick said you started sending them back when Beth worked here as your assistant
Is that how you won her heart
Well, it took a little more than roses
(getting down to business) We need to run some calls
() Ready when you are
() 16
: (3) ) Are you always this efficient
Does that surprise you
Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here
think you'll find 'm not your typical temp
No
Definitely not
() Okay not your typical temp
start with Phil Trendle at Emerson
set up a lunch for end of the week
Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill
Then Terry Mills at Imagio
Am  going too fast for you
No
Go faster
can handle it
: -  - Beth is feeding Kyle while talking on the phone to Derek
It's a beautiful little park with a duck pond and close enough to push Kyle
, while he listens and goes over reports
(cont'd) 've already met a dozen other women with kids the same age
One of them, Lauren something asked if we'd like to come over for a barbecue on Saturday
don't know
It's shaping up to be a work weekend
Outside, at her desk, Lisa eavesdrops on her headset, listening with interest
() 17
: You can work at home and then we'll go to the barbecue
s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling
Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door
He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in
Instead, she's not at her desk
She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet
She turns and smiles at him
Do you need me
Derek shakes his head no and steps back into his office
: -  - Derek finishes some work on his home computer
In the background, Beth sits in bed reading a book
Work at the office
This is home
Come to bed
In a sec
Derek finishes
He rises, walks over to the bed and climbs in beside Beth
She puts her book on the night table and switches off the light
They cuddle together
Beth The card that came today with the roses
Uh huh
was addressed "To Betty
" Betty
(with humor) Your other wife
Yeah
Who's Betty
() 18
: Blame it on the new girl
Patrick called in sick and  had a temp on my desk
thought we had a deal
No female assistants
Honey,  don't control the temp pool
She pretty
Derek gives Beth a look
(cont'd) Just asking
Yeah, she's pretty
plain
() don't care
want her fired immediately
Actually, she did a great job
aside from the card
They get comfortable
Beth puts her head on Derek's chest
Night, Derek
Night
Betty
Beth , gives him a playful punch
: - come out of the stairwell, struggling with an undecorated Christmas tree
Marge directs them to a spot to put it
' Beth and Kyle are visiting
Derek has Kyle on his desk, letting him play with his keys
() 19
: Hope you don't mind us dropping in unannounced
You kidding
This is a treat
Sheila's meeting us for lunch at Central Market
Then 'm taking Kyle to the Grove
(to Kyle) And who are we going to see at the Grove
() Santa
(to Derek) You want to come
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap
'd love to but 'm all jammed up
But say hi to your sister
That guy she was seeing, the one we met at Thanksgiving
Jack
The one she said was perfect
Apparently he's not so perfect
He told her he just wants to be
Friends With Benefits
What does that mean
You know
Sex but no commitments
And Sheila's got a problem with that
() 20
: (2) Beth laughs
Lisa appears at the door
Excuse me
They turn
Lisa smiles sweetly
Lisa, this is my wife Beth
Beth, Lisa
She's temping for Patrick
(friendly but checking her out) Hi
It's great to meet you, Mrs
Charles
eyes lighting up) And this must be Kyle
can already tell he's going to grow up to be a heartbreaker
Lisa comes over
Kyle presses shyly against Derek
(cont'd) Hi, Kyle
'm Lisa
When Kyle doesn't respond
Kyle, say hello
He can say hello
He's usually not this shy around strangers
What a handsome boy
(to Derek) He looks just like you
Actually, most people think he takes after Beth
Talk about the perfect family
The three of you should be on a magazine cover
hope my husband's not working you too hard
() 21
: (3) (cheery tone) He is
But  like it
'm learning a lot
(to Derek) Joe Gage needs to see you when you get a minute
Well, that's our cue to leave
We just dropped in to say hi
(taking Kyle from Derek) Come on, big boy
Lisa steps back, moves off to the door
It was great to meet you
Beth
You, too
Laura
She did it on purpose, winking at Derek
He smiles
Lisa
Excuse me
It's Lisa
You said Laura
did
If Lisa knows she's being fucked with, she doesn't show it
(cont'd) Sorry
Lisa
() Bye, Kyle
Say hi to Santa for me
Lisa exits
beat
(to Beth) That was intentional
() 22
: (4) Wasn't me
Blame "Betty
"    So what's the deal with her
What do you mean
She knew  was taking Kyle to Santa
So
So she was obviously listening at the door
Well, she probably didn't know when to come in
thought you said she was plain
Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain
How would  know
only have eyes for you () Oh, you are so slick
They put Kyle in his stroller
Come on
'll walk you to the elevator
You can say hi to the old gang
() Ever miss it
like to think  traded up
Derek beams
They share a kiss
Derek, Beth and Kyle are surrounded by office workers making a fuss over Beth and Kyle
Even Joe Gage comes out of his office to embrace Beth and chat
() 23
: Lisa watches from a distance
Her face betrays no emotion
After a moment, she turns and enters Derek's office
isa sits behind the desk in Derek's chair and look at a framed picture on Derek's desk -- Derek, Beth and Kyle, the perfect happy family
Nearby, Lisa sees a pile of 's
She looks through them and smiles with an idea
: - warm  morning with a hot sun coming up
Derek drives to work, listening to Gnarls' "Crazy
" - Workers hang bulbs and decorations on the Christmas tree festive holiday spirit is in the air
Derek exits the elevator, heads to his office
Patrick is back at his desk Hey, Patrick
Feeling better
Much
Thanks
() You know it's going to take more than the flu to keep me away from that Christmas party
(
) Not sure we can say the same for Marge
Derek turns to see Lisa, now sitting at Marge's desk
You get around don't you
(') Poor thing called in with a fever
Yeah
She's not speaking to me at the moment
he three share a laugh
() 24
: Alright
You two behave yourselves out here
erek goes into his office
We stay with Patrick and Lisa
(whispers to Lisa) So, how many times did you get busted listening in on Derek's calls
(light laugh) 'm way too devious to ever get caught
Besides,  thought all you assistants listened in
(with a smile) We do
beat
Lisa wonders if she might make a friend here
How long have you worked here
Ten years this Spring
'll bet you know more about what goes on behind these closed doors than anybody
Oh you got that right girl
know all the dirty little secrets
Well maybe we should grab a drink some night after work for a little girl talk
(lonely guy; flattered by her ) Listen, honey, if you think you can buy my silence with a couple of Cosmo's
you're right
They share a laugh, bonding
: 25
- Deserted at lunch hour
Derek, in shirtsleeves, emerges from his office and approaches the Break Room
Derek enters, opens the refrigerator and takes out a lunch bag
He hears a slight  , turns and is surprised to find Lisa seated a corner table, a little tearful
Lisa looks up, quickly wipes her eyes with her hand and puts on a smile
Sorry
thought everybody was at lunch
An awkward moment
Lisa starts to rise
(cont'd) should go
No
Stay
was just gonna take this back to my office
Lisa sits back down
Derek starts to leave; hesitates
(cont'd) Anything  can do to help
mean
if you want to talk about it
It's nothing
Most people  know don't cry over nothing
with humor) You think  was crying
This is just my allergies
Uh huh
What are you allergic to
Men, apparently
Actually it's more like they're allergic to me
() 26
: Boyfriend trouble
Lisa hesitates, wondering if she can confide
It's stupid really
(a beat) This guy 've been seeing just calls and dumps me
Middle of the day
No warning
No explanation
Just " don't think we should see each other anymore
" That's pretty cold
How long were you together
Two months
small laugh) Actually, it was one of my longer lasting relationships
don't know what it is but sooner or later  just seem to scare men off
() 'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
Derek sits down beside her
He puts a comforting hand on her shoulder
(like a big brother) Nothing wrong with you
Your boyfriend's a fool, that's all
wish  could believe that
Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet
'm beginning to think all the good ones are taken Look, 'm no expert but if it didn't work out, maybe it wasn't meant to be
When the right guy comes along
you'll know it
() 27
: (2) She looks up at him; smiles
Is that how it was with you and Beth
Actually, yeah
We both knew pretty quick
Love at first sight
It does happen
Great
Now 'm jealous
Why
She's got it all
Perfect husband, perfect child, perfect marriage
Nobody's perfect
There are problems in every relationship
The important thing is to keep moving forward
trying to buck her up) Don't get down on yourself
You're a bright, attractive girl
Any man would be lucky to have you
Oh, yeah
Right
No, really
If  was single
But you're not
just meant

You're just trying to make me feel better
(touches his hand) And you have
Lisa gets up
() 28
: (3) (cont'd) Thanks, Derek
() Hang in there
It'll happen
Lisa nods
She smiles and exits
ncident forgotten, Derek opens his lunch bag and takes out a sandwich
en appears in the doorway, grins at Derek
What was that all about
Poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend
Really
wouldn't mind taking up the slack
That is one hot piece of ass there
(off Derek's look) Like you haven't noticed
() Hey, 'm a happily married man
And so are you
Doesn't mean we can't look
Ben goes to the refrigerator, opens it and starts rooting around
(cont'd) Not like the old days, back when you could get away with a little office nookie on the side and not get nailed for it
(turns and gives him a grin) Don't give me that "'m appalled" look
That's how you got together with Beth, isn't it
Ben, if you're looking to start something with that girl
() 29
: (4) You saw her first
Fuck off
Besides,  don't think 'm her type
Now you on the other hand
Ben, do me a favor
All 'm just sayin' is a lot of these single gals see the work place as a hunting ground
cocking his finger like a gun) And this one's got you in the cross hairs
With a grin, Ben "pulls the trigger -- bang
" and exits
Derek looks a little annoyed : '  - Derek at his desk
He notices an envelope with his name on it
He opens the envelope
note and a home-made  slide out
"Thanks for the shoulder, Lisa

Kyle shakes his head "no" and points at the Christmas tree
Santa
Yeah, Santa
And he's coming soon
So eat
Don't you know Santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their food
Kyle considers; then furiously eats
Derek and Beth
: - Derek sits at the bar by himself, reading the paper
He looks up and sees Lisa come in
Lisa catches Derek's eye, surprised
Then she smiles, starts to make her way over
() 31
: (gesturing to the empty stool next to him) This seat taken
(always a good guy) No
Be my guest
- Lisa is sitting next to Derek at the bar
The food has come
(cont'd) () Still the best burger in town
Lisa chews and nods in agreement
(') (cont'd) () And the best Margarita

We used to cut loose here after a long day at work
Work hard, play hard
Right
() Back in the day
() How's that boyfriend trouble coming
Keep moving forward, right
Exactly
How about you, Derek
What's the grand plan

: gives    a back massage with a computer mouse
Joe Gage, in a Santa suit, is passing out gag presents
Lisa is in a group with Patrick and some other women, chatting
She glances over and sees Derek
He's off to the side with Ben, sipping drinks
esks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free- style dancing, crowding into the center of the room
arge grabs Derek by the arm and pulls him out
Derek makes some half-hearted dance moves, then gets into the spirit
It's crowded, people are close together and a moment later, Derek finds himself dancing face to face with Lisa
(with humor) Well, if it isn't the Office Asshole
That's Mister Office Asshole to you
'm impressed
You can dance
All those years watching Soul Train
() wasn't sure  was going to come tonight
Why not
Well, it's not like 've been here that long
'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up
Even you
What do you mean "even me
" 'm your number one supporter around here
() 34
: (2) This makes her smile happily
(looking up) Uh oh
Derek looks up, too
They're under the mistletoe
How did that get there
They look at each other, smile
An awkward moment
Derek laughs it off
() Maybe a quick one on the cheek
If we don't, people will really suspect there's something going on
But Derek steps away
Guess we'll just have to take that chance
(good natured laugh) Coward
The music changes, breaking the mood
Derek smiles at Lisa and slips away, rejoining Ben
erek looks at his watch
You're not thinking about bailing, are you
Fun's just getting started
Remember last year
Sally Sloane did a table dance
e indicates a pretty secretary  and accepting another drink
(cont'd) give her one more drink, then stand back
How about you, buddy
Need a re- fill
Come on, where's your holiday spirit
With Beth and Kyle
'm gonna take a piss and sneak out
() 35
: (3) You're no fun
Derek heads down the hall, a little unsteady
' Derek enters
No one else around
He goes to the urinal and begins to unzip
About 30 seconds later he hears the door open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large public Men's restroom in the workplace with 4 urinals and 2 stalls
But suddenly, a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his crotch
Derek whirls around, face to face with a brazen, smiling Lisa who dangles a sprig of Mistletoe in her free hand
Her eyes flash with desire
() What are you doing
Lisa tries to kiss him
Derek resists
He staggers away from the urinal with Lisa still holding him
(cont'd) Lisa -- They knock open a stall door and fall in
Derek goes back against the toilet and Lisa is now practically straddling him (cont'd) Lisa, stop -- Why
Are you out of your -- That's when someone comes in
Derek kicks the stall door shut with his foot just in time
He and Lisa freeze, pressed close together as     staggers to the urinal and unzips
Lisa hides a
Derek is horrified they'll be discovered
Then
The Drunk begins to piss
Loudly
And then begins to sing Santa Claus is coming to town
even more loud
() 36
: In the stall, Lisa and Derek are face to face
His hand grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch
He tries to remove it but her grip is like a vice
(cont'd) For god's -- Oh, come on
Hearing something, the Drunk hesitates in mid-piss, looks back over his shoulder
() Hey, who's there
Derek is trapped
Lisa gives him a naughty smile
She's in control and enjoying this, turned on by the thrill of getting caught
(cont'd) Somebody in there
Lisa is about to answer
Derek hushes her
When there's no reply, the Drunk resumes pissing
Lisa smears the Mistletoe sprig against Derek's face, then starts to go down on him
He clutches her head with both hands forcing her to stop
She looks up at him, eyes gleaming with passion
() Don't do this
The Drunk continues his piss
Endless
Finally
finished
He clumsily zips back up, lurches over to the sink
He looks at himself in the mirror, runs his fingers through his hair, smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door
The stall door bangs open as Derek pushes Lisa aside and staggers out, trying to zip up his fly
() Wait
Where are you going
() You've got the wrong idea
() 37
: (2) Lisa doesn't seem to understand but she's amused
Derek is already out the door
It's a wilder scene now
Sally Sloane is doing an uninhibited table dance to the delight of everyone gathered
atrick, standing off, sees Derek hurry down the hall and head for the elevator
moment later, he sees Lisa come down the hall and rejoin the party
little tipsy, he walks over to her
Living dangerously, aren't we
Oh, Patrick, you're such an old queen
() Come on
Dance with me
Lisa pulls Patrick out with the other dancers
(cont'd) (as they dance; teasing) 'll bet you've never been this close to an actual woman
Honey, 've never been this close to an actual man
: - Derek drives home
He's agitated, trying to calm down, trying to make sense of what happened
That's when he hears a
Derek's eyes go up to the rear view mirror in panic as a police car with flashing lights gains on him
Derek pulls over, heart pounding
This is all he needs right now
The police car flies by on its way to some emergency
Derek closes his eyes; lets out a deep breath
38
- Swept by headlights as Derek pulls into the drive
' Dark
Derek looks in on his sleeping son
Dark
Derek approaches the bed where Beth sleeps
He slips in beside her
() How was the party
only stayed for two drinks
That dull, huh
long beat
Derek considers telling her
Beth
Not tonight, honey, okay
'm really tired
And Beth is already back asleep
Derek lies there, in Hell
He looks up and sees his own dark reflection in the ceiling mirror : - Derek gets off the elevator and walks to his office, turns a corner and sees: Lisa coming the other way, carrying files
Derek tenses and stops, expecting the worst
Lisa merely gives him a pleasant smile and walks by
Good morning
Morning
() 39
: Like the other night never happened
Lisa continues on her way, delivering the files to a co-worker
erek stands there, observing Lisa, wondering
Ben appears beside Derek
You okay, bro
Derek turns, a little startled
He registers Ben
Yeah
'm fine
You should have stuck around
What
The Christmas party
Hank in Human Services tossed his cookies on the Christmas tree
(barely registering) Really
Sorry  missed that
Derek goes to his office
Ben goes to his
: '  - erek is at his desk, working
Lisa appears in the doorway
Derek looks up; tensing
Bad time
() No
Joe wants to know if you're done with the Ganz portfolio
Tell him he'll have it end of the day
() 40
: (starts to go) Thanks
You're working Joe's desk
Just for today
light laugh) He's a real screamer, isn't he
Don't let him fool you
His bark really is as bad as his bite
Lisa smiles and exits
Derek is thinking Great, maybe she doesn't remember
: '  - Derek is at his desk working
It's the end of the day and workers are leaving
Patrick appears at the door
Okay if  take off
Yeah, go home
See you tomorrow
Patrick leaves
Through the open door, Derek can see other workers leaving, getting on the elevator
Lisa is one of them
She doesn't even look his way
Derek relaxes, goes back to his work
: - Derek walks to his Yukon , the only car remaining
He it and the doors unlock
As Derek opens the driver's door and slides inside, the passenger door opens and Lisa slips in, wearing her overcoat and an intimate smile
() 41
: () What are you -- owe you an apology for the Christmas party
think  sort of took you by surprise
() We both had a few drinks
Just forget it What if  can't
Lisa
nothing happened
All right, have it your way
Nothing happened
Lisa lets the front of her overcoat fall open
She's naked underneath
(jolt of panic) You really need to get out of my car
Why
This is so not right
Relax
Nobody's around to see us now
God,  almost went insane today, didn't you
Having to go pretend like  was concentrating on work when all  could think about -- () Lisa, get out of my car
(startled; confused) Derek, what's wrong
What did  do
() 42
: (2) Derek suddenly reaches across her and throws open the passenger door
don't know if you're just dense or what's wrong with you but  want you to understand something
There's nothing going on between us
would never -- never -- jeopardize my job with a co- worker
Maybe you are an asshole
Wow
Get out
Derek physically forces her out
Derek quickly turns the key in the ignition,  the engine and peels out in reverse
The passenger door bangs shut
Lisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute disappointment as Derek speeds out of the parking garage
: - Derek lets himself in, determined to tell Beth everything
() Beth
Honey
' In here
Derek heads for the dining room
There's something  need to
He stops, seeing Beth at the table, looking upset with a bottle of wine and a glass
(cont'd) What's wrong
've been on the phone for the last hour with Rachel ) ( Hendricks
() 43
(cont'd) : She found out Tim's been having an affair with a neighbor and it's been going on for the last year and a half
(stops dead) Tim
Really
Derek sits down at the table
At first  couldn't even conceive of it
They've always seemed to be so much in love, totally devoted to each other
Tim
told her
Just blurted it out last night when he came home from work
Then he said he was moving out
You know they've got three kids
Poor Rachel's a wreck
Yeah
That's tough
Tough
It's a disaster
If it was me
Beth, you know 'd never cheat on you
Derek reaches across the table and takes her hand
know
e moves closer and puts an arm around her
Tim's an idiot
He's a son of a bitch
(beat; then) What did you want to tell me
There's no way he can tell her now
Forget it
Just a little problem at work
() () 44
(cont'd) : (2) () Nothing  can't take care of
: '  - Derek, agitated, has confided in Ben who's both concerned and a little turned on
Why didn't you tell me
There was nothing to tell
Nothing to tell
She grabbed your cock
Flashed her tits in your car
Come on, man
thought  was your best friend
You think this is funny
just
jeez
mean,  kinda got she was interested but  never figured she'd
What the hell did  do
was nice to her, that's all
Sure you didn't lead her on
Just a little
mean, a pretty girl
it would be normal
didn't do a damn thing
Maybe she thinks she can make the jump from assistant to wife, too
Thanks
You're a big help
Sorry
What are you going to do
Report it to Human Resources
() 45
: Get her fired
don't have a choice
'd be very careful if  were you
What if she makes trouble and says you came on to her
erek gives Ben a look
'mon man
(') (cont'd) Look
it's not like you don't have a history of behavior here
When's the last time you had a female assistant on your desk
People are going to wonder
Then  need to get my side on the record first
They look at each other
(a beat; making a joke) Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have her killed
Derek frowns at him
: - determined Derek arrives and enters the offices of ,
looks up from her desk
Morning, Mister Charles
Hi, Connie
Is Hank in
need to talk to him
(from the inner office) Derek
That you
Derek enters Hank's office and closes the door
() 46
: Hey, Hank
What's up
Well, it's sort of a personal matter need to talk to you about one of the temps, Lisa Sheridan
Right
She worked your desk for awhile
(about to confess) Listen, Hank, this going to be a little awkward
If you're here to file a complaint about her performance, save your breath
Her agency called this morning and said she wouldn't be coming in any more
They already sent over a replacement
(hiding is surprise) She quit
They give a reason
No
Did you have some kind of a problem with her
Well,  just thought she was unqualified, sort of in over her head
But if she already quit
Looks like she beat you to it
(absorbing this) Yeah
Anything else
No
guess not
() 47
: (2) How's the new house
New house is great
a smile) Couldn't be better
Tell Beth  said hi
will
Listen
We'll have you and Kathy over some night when we're more settled
Sounds like a plan
Derek opens the door and exits
Outside, down the hall, Ben is waiting
Well
She quit
Really
Yeah
Ben grins
He raises his hand for a high five
Come on, bro
That's good news
Problem solved
(as his good luck sinks     in) Looks that way, doesn't it
Not a bad little Christmas present
Derek, happier now, returns the high five
: 48
- Christmas morning
hrough the window we see Derek, Beth and Kyle under the tree unwrapping presents, having a great time
For Derek, all troubles are forgotten : '  - Derek, at his desk, in a good mood, on the phone
Hans
Derek
How was your Christmas
Well, you people invented it
You got the prospectus
Great
Look it over think it's gonna be a happy new year for all of us
Derek looks at the doorway where Ben is standing
Derek gives Ben the thumbs up
Ben beams and does a little victory dance
: -    - Derek and Beth come in, dressed in tux and gown, exhausted from a New Years party
God,   it's after three
That's the last time   'm going out on New Years Eve
Next   year we'll celebrate here at home
Just   you, me and Kyle
"You Have Mail"  comes from Derek's home computer on the other side of the room
'm just gonna check my e-mail and come to bed
Can't it wait
It's already tomorrow in Berlin
Ganz was supposed to send me his approval
That's probably him
() 49
: Beth goes into the adjoining bathroom
With a , Derek sits down at his computer and goes to e- mail
He scans it and is instantly confused
Dozens of e-mails, all from the same sender:
little fearful, Derek pulls up the first e-mail
It opens up to reveal a self-taken photo of Lisa looking sexy and inviting on a bed, smiling seductively and wearing skimpy lingerie that shows off her sexy body
nder her photo:
Derek feels a jolt of panic
He deletes it, brings up the others
t's the same photo, Lisa on the bed, over and over
Derek stares at Lisa on screen, feeling sick and invaded
He isn't aware of Beth coming out of the bathroom behind him
She approaches as he continues to delete
Ganz
She's about to peer over his shoulder
Derek hits the delete key and the last photo of Lisa disappears
(cont'd) What was that
(acting perturbed) Nothing
gotta get a new spam blocker
Beth gives him a kiss on the cheek
Forget it
He'll call you in the morning
Come to bed
Beth goes away
erek stares at the computer screen saver:  picture of Beth with Kyle sitting on Santa's knee at the Grove
: - Derek is at his desk, tensely typing on the computer, sending an e-mail to
() 50
: Derek types:
He sends it and sits back
Almost instantly there's a reply
erek stiffens
Then, tentatively, he opens the new e-mail
has replied with one of those annoying It winks at him
Derek is chilled
: - Mid-January
The withered Christmas tree waits at the curb for pick-up
- Beth helps Derek pack a bag
Remember the last time Joe had one of his weekend work retreats
How could  forget
had a hangover for a week after
Any women coming this year
No, just the usual suspects
Joe says it's going to be a male bonding experience
can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi, getting in touch with your innermost feelings
(zips up his bag) Hopefully, they'll all get drunk and crash early
Or if 'm really lucky
drown in the jacuzzi
Call me tonight
() 51
: will
erek gives her a kiss
Their image is reflected in the overhead mirror
: - delivers drinks to Derek, Joe Gage, Ben Talbot and    smoking cigars and relaxing after dinner
The mood is rowdy
They're all a little toasted
drink is put in front of Derek
didn't order this
The Cocktail Waitress leans down and  in his ear: It's from the lady at the bar
erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area
He catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool
But a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear, the woman is gone
Derek tenses
Derek, you okay
'm fine
Just thought  saw somebody
Somebody you know
Or somebody you'd like to know
The other guys chortle
No way
You can't tempt this guy
Who could blame him with a wife like Beth
() 52
: Speaking of Beth,  said 'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed
'll be right back
Derek picks up his drink and leaves
Hurry back
This party's just getting started
Low-lit
Empty
Derek comes out, flips open his cell to call home
He puts his drink down on a table
Hey, honey
It's me
in Kyle's bedroom, putting him to sleep
How's the male bonding
They're all getting wasted
Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi
Well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks
Derek
You there
Derek freezes
Across the patio, he sees   slowly approaching
It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette
But as she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale
have to go
Wait
Kyle wants to say good night
() They're yelling for me to come back
It'll just take a second
Beth picks up Kyle
() 53
: (cont'd) Say good night to Daddy
As Lisa comes closer
() Beth, 'll call you later
'll be in bed -- Derek
Derek clicks off and pockets his cell
On the other end, Beth looks perturbed
Now Lisa comes face to face with Derek, smiling
She boldly picks up his drink and takes a sip
can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to Beth
() How did you know 'd be here
've got my sources
slight frown) What's wrong
You don't look happy to see me
Why did you come here
You said you could never be with someone you work with
(when he doesn't seem to "get ") That's why  quit
So we could be together
Derek looks at her, astounded
(holding down panic) Lisa, you need to leave
(teasing smile) Or what
You'll make a scene
() () 54
(cont'd) : (2) Call security
What would Joe and Ben and the others think
'll tell you what they'd think
They'd think we arranged it
And in a way, we did
Lisa turns aside
Out of Derek's sight, she slips a capsule into his drink, then puts it back on the table
(cont'd) This hook-up was on the books from the day we met
What are you talking about
One of us   has to take control and  guess it's me
So you go back, say your good nights to   the boys and 'll be waiting in my room
610
'm not coming to your room
Would you rather  came to yours
You're crazy
sick
You need help
know
need help
(moves closer; seductive) Help me, Derek
She presses against him
Stay away from me
Lisa emits a musical little laugh and smooths her dress
She registers Derek's angry face and clenched fists
She smiles
All right, Derek
You play your games
(turning away) and 'll play mine
Lisa disappears into the darkness, high heels echoing
Derek feel his cell phone vibrate
He pulls it out
Beth, 'm sorry -- () 55
: (3) ' Beth
It's Ben
Where the hell are you, bro
'm right here
Coming back in
Agitated, Derek picks up his drink, downs it and re-enters the bar
: - After midnight
erek and Ben get off the elevator
Ben is slightly drunk but Derek is farther gone -- wobbly on his feet, bleary
Come on, it's early
We'll go to my room and plunder the mini-bar, charge it all to Joe Can't, man
That last drink totally kicked my ass
need to lie down
All right, be that way
But don't forget
Nine o'clock in the California Room
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops
Ben goes one way, Derek the other
Derek, feeling more and more disoriented, makes his way to his room
He fishes around in his pockets and finds his key card
He slides it and pushes open the door
Derek lets himself in, doesn't even click on the lights
There's enough moonlight coming through the window to lead him to the bed where he flops down on his back
He doesn't even bother to undress
Derek closes his eyes, then opens them
He feels sick
Sound and perception are playing games with his head
The room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise
Is it the shower in the bathroom
The bathroom door is shut but there's a crack of light around the edges
Is someone in there
() 56
: Derek is too out of it to care
He just wants to sleep, make it go away
He closes his eyes, begins to drift off
The bathroom door opens, letting in a cloud of steam and a shaft of light
woman's silhouette appears, naked
She moves to the bed
erek feels the bed move
feels a tug on his trousers
then, an amplified
Derek's eyes open in shock
He can't believe what he sees -- Lisa, naked, straddling him
Her hand caressing his face
It's like a dream
nightmare
Lisa smiles seductively and puts a finger to her lips
Shhhhh
(groggy; can barely get the word out) No
Hush, baby
Her voice seems distorted like it's coming from another world
(cont'd) 'm going to take real good care of you
Derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his body or mind
All he can see is a shifting, distorted image of Lisa's face
her smile
her teeth
her lips
the blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes
And somewhere in those eyes he can see
And that's the last thing Derek sees before he passes out and the entire world goes black and silent : - Dazzling sunlight
Derek wakes up, startled by a pounding on the door
' Housekeeping
() 57
: Derek blinks, blinded by the sun
His brain is fogged and he's disoriented
It takes him a moment to realize where he is
hotel room
Naked under the covers
How did he
'  (cont'd) Housekeeping
The door begins to open
() Later
Come back later
' Okay
come back
The door closes
erek glances over at the clock
10:15
Shit
He's overslept and now he's late for the seminar
Derek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops
There's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under the covers
She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy smile, stretching her body like a cat
Morning
Derek goes into panic mode, jumping out of the bed like it's on fire
You've got to get out of here
What are you talking about
Leave
You've got to go
Derek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting them into her arms
Derek, come on
want you out of here
() 58
: (2) Why
You worried somebody's gonna catch us
Just get the hell out
(-) We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn't we
Lisa barely manages to slip into her dress before Derek opens the door and pushes her out into the hall
(cont'd) Derek, what is wrong with you
Derek slams the door
On the other side, we hear Lisa's musical laugh
(cont'd) All right
Have it your way
Derek locks the door
Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands
(in hell) Fuck
fuck
fuck
: -   - Derek slips in and takes a seat next to Ben at the end of a big table
The other guys are there, also a little under the weather
They take notice of his late arrival
(interrupting his talk) Thank god
We were about to send out a search party
Sorry
Overslept
Derek glances over at Ben who frowns at him
Derek looks over at the wall clock as Joe resumes talking
10:35
() 59
: It's now 12:50
While Joe continues his talk, quietly slips into the room, goes over to Derek and whispers to him
Derek perks up with concern
He leans over to Ben, : (cont'd) It's Beth
What about her
She's here
) 'll be right back
Derek gets up and leaves
Derek follows the Clerk
As they turn a corner
Here's your wife, sir
Derek stops dead
It's not Beth waiting for him
It's Lisa, dressed sexy/casual, bright smile
The Clerk goes away
thought you might need an excuse to get out of there
How about some lunch
Lunch
It's gorgeous outside and  made a reservation at -- Derek grabs her by the elbow and hustles her out of sight, trying to keep his voice down
What do you think this is
The morning after
() We didn't do anything last night
Lisa gives him a sly smile
() 60
: But you can't remember, can you
It didn't happen
Derek, not so loud
You'll cause a scene
That's exactly what we Right
scene
need
Derek hauls her roughly back down the hall
What are you doing
What    should have done last night
Taking   you inside to tell Joe and the others   whatever you want
They'll know you're   out of your mind
e yanks her toward the door
(trying to pull away) Why are you trying to ruin this
Don't say that
Godammit
Derek throws her roughly against the wall
She hits her head, a little stunned
Derek steps back, surprised by his own violence
(cont'd) 'm sorry
What's wrong with you
You're acting like a stranger
() 61
: (2) Yeah
That's exactly what  am stranger, a person you don't know
Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here
(flaring; ugly tone) You think you can use me, then throw me away
'm not some piece of garbage, Derek
'm a human being
Lisa reaches out to him
Derek, in frustration, raises his hand as if to strike her
Her eyes flash with excitement
Derek stops himself, revolted by his own behavior
(cont'd) Do it
Hit me
You can do anything you want to me
Don't you know that
Anything
Derek stares at her like she's a thing, an object
He shakes his head
(cont'd) Don't look at me that way
How else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you
Derek, please
don't care what you do or what you say
What goes on in that twisted mind of yours
It doesn't matter because the truth is, there's never going to be anything between us
So go ahead, Lisa
do your worst
They stare at each other
Then, Derek turns and goes into the seminar room, closing the door behind him
() 62
: (3) With a heartbreaking expression of hurt, Lisa stares at the door for a long moment, wipes a tear from her face and walks away
: - Derek, Ben, Joe and the others eat dinner
lively atmosphere
Derek seems apart from the others, lost in thought
Derek, you drinking
Not tonight, man
'm sticking to ice tea
: /  - Derek gets off on his floor and heads to his room
Derek steps inside and freezes, confronted with his worst nightmare
High heels and a path of discarded clothing leads to the bed where Lisa lies in bed, naked under the covers, her eyes shut, seemingly asleep
(anger rising) No
No fucking way
Derek moves toward the bed and the sleeping girl
(cont'd) Goddamn it, Lisa
No response
Her head is cocked to one side and her skin is ghostly pale
Derek leans over and shakes Lisa's naked shoulder
(cont'd) Lisa, get up
It's like shaking a doll
() 63
: (cont'd) Get up or 'll drag you out and throw you in the hall
That's when Derek sees it
On the night stand: an empty bottle of prescription pills
Derek picks up the bottle and looks at the label: Ambien
Derek grabs the bedside phone and punches Desk
(cont'd) (fighting panic) This is 622
There's a woman in my room, she's taken an overdose of prescription pills -- Ambien
You need to get the paramedics and security up here right away
Please hurry
Derek hangs up
Now he puts one knee on the bed and takes Lisa's face in his hands, turning her head
He might as well be handling a marionette
(cont'd) () Lisa
No response
He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to detect a heartbeat
If there is one, he can't hear it
Derek gently slaps her cheeks
Rolls back her eye lids
Nothing
(cont'd) Oh god
Now Derek begins to perform
He tilts Lisa's jaw back, clears her mouth and begins to breathe into her, alternating chest compressions
(cont'd) Lisa
Wake up, goddamn it : - In a corner, Derek looks haggard, being interviewed by a veteran police detective,
Reyes looks more like a middle-aged suburban mom than a cop but she's very good at her job
All right, Mister Charles, let me get this straight
) ( () 64
(cont'd) : This girl you barely know, works in your office, fantasizes you're having an affair and when you reject her, she tries to commit suicide in your bed
know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it
This affair
There   affair
So she just
made it up in her head
With no help from you
Maybe  was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way,  don't know
All  know is  did not lead her on
And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel
None
don't even know how she got in my room
Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key
Doesn't that prove she did this on her own
All it proves is she lost her key
She never had a key
Look, Mister Charles,  don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl just need to get your version for my report
() () 65
(cont'd) : (2) Besides, if it's a question of innocence, 'm not the one you have to convince
What do you mean
Let's just say  wouldn't like to explain a situation like this to my husband
Before Derek can respond, Reyes sees    signalling
(cont'd) 'll be right back
Reyes goes to talk to the Doctor
Derek watches them talk
The Doctor hands Reyes a piece of paper
Derek can't stand the suspense
He walks over and interrupts
How is she
Reyes nods to the Doctor and takes Derek aside
They pumped her out in time
Doctor says she's groggy and disoriented
Probably tomorrow they'll move her out of  and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation
All suicides are put on 72 hour hold, it's standard
Did she say anything
As a matter of fact, she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency
He wrote it down
Here
Reyes hands Derek a piece of paper
Written on it is and his phone number
(cont'd) Still want to stick to your story
: - Dawn is breaking as Derek guides the Yukon into the drive
He steps out, hesitates
The front door of the house opens to reveal a very tense looking Beth in a robe
() 66
: They look at each other across the distance
Derek walks to her
(a little cold) Tell me everything
From the beginning
Derek nods
This is not going to be easy
: - erek has told it all
Beth, looking stunned, stares at him, uncomprehending
long beat, then
How could you let this happen
You think  encouraged it
Maybe you liked it
Beth
What man wouldn't
The attentions of a pretty young girl
can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress -- Stop it, Beth
You know  never said those things
You must have said something
Done something to give her the idea
If  did, it wasn't intentional
She was in your bed, Derek
You spent the night together and you want me to believe nothing happened
() 67
: was passed out
drunk
Nothing happened
Damn you, Derek
Damn you
Beth turns away, her face burning
love you, Beth love Kyle and the life we have together
would never do anything to screw that up
This girl is disturbed
She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me
Why
don't know
She's crazy
You should have told me
From the very beginning, you should have told me
know
Why didn't you
At first  thought it was no big deal
And then
was just embarrassed didn't know how to explain it to you without looking
Guilty
said  was wrong
beat
Did she know about us, Derek
What
() 68
: (2) How we met
Don't do this, Beth
You'll make yourself sick
'm already sick
Honey,  know  screwed up
Derek reaches out
(cont'd) But 've told you the truth
have to know you believe me
(weary sigh) don't know what to believe
All  know is,  need to be alone for awhile
Beth, don't -- need to be alone -- Beth moves quickly upstairs
Leaving Derek there
He sits back on the couch, head in his hands
At a loss
After a beat- - Derek makes a determined rush up after her
Only to find the bedroom door locked
Derek's upset
Resigned, he makes his way over to-- - He grabs a pillow
Punches it twice
Knows he's in the dog -- : - Lisa is propped up in a hospital bed, a dark brooding expression on her face, tangled hair hanging down
Just staring, eyes wide, a little dopey looking
() 69
: Monica Reyes appears in the doorway
Miss Reynolds
'm Monica Reyes
isa looks up
Her face transforms into a bright smile
Come in
'm sorry 'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair
(dismissive laugh) Apparently 'm still on suicide watch
'm a police officer assigned to your case
How are you feeling
Well, still a bit groggy from the medication
But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble 've caused
Do you feel like talking about the other night
Have you spoken to Derek
Yes
And he's all right
Relatively speaking
When can  see him
See him
Derek
'm afraid that's not possible
() 70
: (2) Why
Miss Sheridan,  don't think Mister Charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact
Lisa looks at her oddly
Then why did he send these
Really
Lisa indicates a bouquet of flowers in a vase nearby
(keeping the surprise out of her voice) He sent you flowers
Peonies
My favorite
Reyes inspects the attached card
"Lisa Darling, the other night was just a misunderstanding
Don't ever leave me
Love always, Derek
" When did these show up
few hours ago
They're lovely, aren't they
eyes decides not to push it, goes into her  & : Can you tell me what happened at the hotel, why you were there
Didn't Derek tell you
'd like to hear your version
There's not a lot to tell
We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did
Slept together
Had sex
() 71
: (3) Of course
Derek denies it
He's just being a gentleman, trying to protect me
see
Go on
The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again,  guess over reacted
) didn't realize he was just being noble
Noble
He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle
what the breakup might do to him
He's not even two, you know
My parents broke up when  was pretty young
It leaves a scar that never really heals
So you believe Mister Charles is in love with you Read the card
Derek and  belong together and nothing can change that
But  do feel bad about his wife
You do
'm not a home-wrecker
'm not stealing him away
Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial
It can't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman
just hope she doesn't do something foolish
strange smile) You know the old saying
() 72
: (4) What's that
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
" Lisa could almost be talking about herself
Reyes nods but she's chilled
You take it easy now
We'll talk again
She excuses herself
Lisa goes back to happily smiling at her flowers
: - Derek and Joe Gage
don't have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company
Even the slightest whiff of impropriety
There was no impropriety, Joe
This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl
Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit
There was no sexual harassment
If anything, 'm the one who was sexually harassed
() can't believe this is happening to me
It's like a nightmare
By now, you're probably wishing you had fucked her
erek gives him a shocked look
(cont'd) For all the trouble it's costing you
() Sorry
Bad joke
() 73
: Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me
Derek, calm down
believe you and you know 'll back you up all the way
But if  find out there was something going on,  won't have a choice
That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out
Good
Then you have nothing to worry about
Meantime 'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account
But Ganz is my client -- Look, maybe you should take some time off
Just til this blows over
Marge sticks her head in
Sorry to interrupt
Derek, there's a Detective Reyes here to see you
Joe and Derek exchange looks
: '  - Derek and Monica Reyes face each other across Derek's desk
She obviously ordered the flowers for herself
With your credit card
My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer
Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk
() 74
: Reyes gives him a blank look
(cont'd) You think  sent the flowers
'd have to be as crazy as she is
There's more
More
Reyes opens a bag
This is a print out of Lisa's blog
It's sort of a diary she was keeping
Reyes puts a large pile of papers on Derek's desk
(cont'd) It's a rather graphic and detailed account of your various sexual liaisons together What
You can read them for yourself but should warn you they're a little
- rated
Derek pages through, growing more alarmed
We see thing like " " () This is
none of this ever happened was never at her apartment
never even touched her, let alone did any of this
According to those entries, you're quite the accomplished lover, Mister Charles
And you made promises to her, promises to divorce your wife and marry her
You can't possibly believe this
() 75
: (2) Whether  believe it or not is irrelevant
The only thing that matters is that she believes it
There's got to be something  can do to protect myself
my family
You could file a restraining order
But that may not be necessary
Why not
Lisa's left town
She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday
Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back
Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there
(some relief) Well,  can't say 'm unhappy to hear she's gone
Maybe now she can get the help she needs
ith any luck, Mister Charles, you'll never hear from her again
: - Beth moves through the room, stopping to pick up one of Kyle's toys
She looks through the sliding glass window and sees Derek on the deck, holding Kyle in his arms
They're playing a game
Derek points to objects in the distance and Kyle identifies them
"Truck
doggie
bird
" and so on
tear in Beth's eye
She comes closer
They don't see her
(singing to Kyle) "Four little ducks went out one day
over the hill and far away
" : 76
- few days later
- 14 year old baby sitter  walks Beth and Derek to the front door
They're dressed for a night out
You've got our cell numbers so if there's any problem, don't hesitate to call us, okay
Come on, honey
Samantha knows what to do, don't you
've got four little brothers
Trust me

Maybe we should
No way
Do you know how hard it was to get these reservations
Come on, we agreed
This is an important night
And am not gonna waste you in that outfit
(to Samantha) She looks fantastic, doesn't she
Like a movie star
erek takes Beth by the arm
Everything's gonna be fine
(giving in; to Samantha) Okay, but you call us
Derek grins and leads her out the door, calls back to Samantha
Lock this
We'll be back by ten
() 77
: Have fun
Samantha closes the door behind them and locks it
: - Derek and Beth sit together in a romantic candle-lit booth, working on a bottle of wine
haven't seen you looking this relaxed and beautiful in weeks
'd forgotten what this was like
the two of us out together
Yeah
It's been awhile
He looks at her
It's been awhile since they've touched or had sex, too
Beth smiles a little shyly, drops her eyes
(cont'd) () So
there's hope
It's not that easy
need you to believe me
Derek pours the last of the bottle into Beth's glass and signals the Waiter
(cont'd) Could we get another bottle, please
Derek smiles at Beth
She looks at her wine glass
Derek, not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret
Derek looks like he's been punched in the face
keep telling you  didn't do any thing to regret
() 78
: Beth looks up and gives him a hard, cold look
() am telling you
you did
: - amantha is sprawled on the couch
The  is going, she's listening to music on her -pod while texting a friend on her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time, multi-tasking
She doesn't hear the door bell  the first time
Or the second
Then there's a
Samantha becomes aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the frosted window next to the door
With a  of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the door
She unlocks and opens it
Lisa is standing on the threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling
(super friendly) Hi, 'm Beth's friend Allie
She's expecting me
Lisa breezes right in
Mister and Mrs
Charles are out
Out
They went to dinner
What
Beth told me to drop by
That's strange
Oh well,  have something for Kyle
'll just run up and give it to him
You can't
He's sleeping
Oh,  won't wake him
() 79
: Maybe you should come back
But 'm here right now
Why should
oh,  see
Just doing your duty
Good girl
You know what, let me call Beth
Lisa takes out a cell phone, punches in a number
Samantha looks relieved
(cont'd) (into her cell) Beth
Hey, girlfriend
It's Allie
Where am
Where are you
'm at your place
You told me to come by
to Samantha) No it's okay
She forgot
(back into cell) No, Samantha was a little concerned so said 'd call you
(winks at Samantha) Yeah
Okay, honey
You two have a great night
(to Samantha; holding out the ) Oh, wait
Did you want to talk to her
Samantha shakes her head "no
" (cont'd) (into cell) Beth, 'll call you tomorrow
Lisa clicks off
(cont'd) (to Samantha) Great
This will only take me a minute
Lisa crosses to the stairs and goes up
Samantha returns to the couch and resumes texting
' yle is asleep in his crib
The door cracks open, emitting light from the hall, turning Lisa into a silhouette
She enters the room, silent as a ghost, and approaches Kyle's crib
She stands over him, smiling down at the vulnerable sleeping child
Then, Lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror
() 80
: She takes out a tube of red lipstick and applies it to her lips
: - Samantha is listening to i-pod music/texting/watching
In the background, out of focus, Lisa comes down the stairs
Thanks, Samantha
Nice meeting you
(preoccupied; doesn't even ) You, too
Lisa vanishes
Samantha sends a last message, then thinks she ought to check on the baby
She gets up, starts for the stairs when she gets another text message on her phone
She checks it, laughs and returns to the couch to text her friend back : - Derek and Beth drive home in tense silence
Finally, Beth speaks
It's his birthday tomorrow
know
told him we'd take him to Legoland
'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets
Unless you think you should take him alone
No
Whatever we're going through, he needs us to be together

: Derek turns the corner to their street
The house comes into sight
The garage door goes up
Derek pulls into the drive and guides the car into the garage
: - key in the lock
The door opens
Derek and Beth enter
On the couch, Samantha ends her texting and greets them with a bright smile
Hey
You guys got back so fast-- Any trouble with Kyle
No
He was a doll
) But you just missed your friend
Beth and Derek freeze, turn and look at each other
What friend
You know
Allie
She was just here
called you on the cell
() Nobody called me
Someone was here
Inside the house
(to Beth) You said it was okay
She said she had something for Kyle
(instant panic) Oh my god
Where's Kyle
In his crib
Beth streaks for the stairs
() 82
: How long since she was here
couple minutes
What's wrong
Derek runs for the stairs
(cont'd) (calling after them; now ) You said it was okay
' Beth runs to the crib
To her horror, it's empty
Lisa lets out a cry of anguish
Derek appears in the door
Lisa turns to him in desperate panic
She took him
She took my baby
Derek tears back down the stairs, shouting to Samantha
Call 911
He bursts out the front door
- Derek races into the garage, yanks open the driver's door and gets in
He starts the engine, turns to back out and -- Surprise
There's Kyle is in the backseat, strapped into his car seat, smiling at his Daddy
Kyle
Derek gets out, pulls open the back door and unstraps his son, then hesitates
What Derek sees makes his blood run cold
On the child's forehead
a perfect red lipstick kiss
: - Kyle is being examined by   while Derek and Beth comfort him
() 83
: We pumped his stomach
-ray and cat scan came back normal
We'll wait for the blood work but it appears he's completely fine
don't see any reason why you can't take Bhim home in a couple hours
(tearful relief) Thank you, Doctor
Monica Reyes appears in the doorway
: - erek and Beth confer with Reyes
Beth is very agitated
Apparently Lisa stole her sister's  to buy a ticket and board a plane to earlier today, then used her sister's credit card to rent a car
The sister didn't even know she was gone until a few hours ago
She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy
She didn't know she checked herself out this morning
() She was in our house -- alone with our son
he doctor says he's fine
Well, 'm not fine
to Reyes; demanding) want you to find her
We will
She violated the restraining order so we can arrest her
Look, Mrs
Charles,  know you're upset
'm a mother, too
How would you feel if it was your child
Exactly the same as you
() 84
: Find her
Beth goes back into the examining room to join Kyle
Now what
Am  supposed to go out and buy a gun or something
She didn't physically harm him
No, but she could have
Is that the message she's trying to send
Either that or
maybe she was trying to show you she could love him
off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa
their emotions can turn on a dime
What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage
don't know
But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch
If she does, you need to call me right away
Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security
erek nods
: - The  pulls up and parks
Derek and Beth get out
Derek removes the sleeping Kyle from his car seat and carries him to the front door where Beth waits
'  - Kyle is asleep as Derek tucks him in
Beth   from another part of the house
Derek
Derek races out of the room
The bedroom has been trashed
The bed has been stripped
The ceiling mirror is now a spider-webs of cracks
() 85
: The closet is open and clothes are strewn about
Derek discovers Beth on her knees, holding up a family photograph in which Beth's head has been torn off
She never left
She was here the whole time
Beth scrambles over and finds a wedding photo of herself and Derek
Again, her head has been removed
(cont'd) What kind of sick person
Derek crouches down and holds Beth who begins to cry, her body shaking
It's all right, it's all right
No Derek
It's not all right
We have to do something
We can't live like this
As he holds his wife, Derek looks up and sees their reflection in the mirror -- twisted and distorted, like Lisa's mind
: -   - Derek and Kyle watch Baby Einstein on
In the b
g
,    installs a new alarm system
Beth is on the phone, talking to someone
Derek keeps an eye on her
(into phone) Right
Thank you
Beth clicks off, starts dialing a new number
Who are you calling
Guess
You're not
() 86
: () got her home number from Patrick
She won't be there
She can still pick up her messages
Beth, why are you doing this
want her to know who she's dealing with now
On the other end, Lisa's cheerful voice: ' Hi, this is Lisa
'm not here right now so please leave a message after the beep and 'll get back to you
Have a good one
(into the phone) isten to me, you little bitch
This is Beth Charles and  just want you to know that if you ever
ever
come near my child or my house again

Beth clicks off, gives Derek a defiant look
Derek doesn't know what to say
The Security Man appears
You're all set, folks
You want me to show you how the system works
Definitely
: - Derek lies in bed, wide awake, on guard
He hears a car engine outside, gets up and goes to the window
Derek looks out and sees a police patrol car in front of the house
moment later, it drives off
() 87
: Derek goes to Kyle's room
He's sleeping safely
He goes to the master bedroom and observes Beth from the door way
She's asleep
Derek returns to the guest room
sudden
Derek tenses
He hops up and goes to the window
It's just the sprinklers going on in the front yard
: - Derek is leaving for work
He points to the security pad
Make sure you set this
You don't have to tell me
It can't go on much longer
They're bound to pick her up soon
) Look, if you want me to stay, 'll call in
No
Go to work
If anything happens, the security patrol can be here in two minutes
(off his look) Go

Derek opens the door and exits
Beth closes it behind him, then touches the keypad
Beth watches from the window as Derek drives off to work
Kyle is nearby playing
The phone rings
Beth goes over and picks it up, a little wary
Hello
Oh hi, Dad
() What's wrong
() 88
: As she listens with mounting concern, we
: - Patrick is at his desk
The phone buzzes and he picks up
Derek Charles' office
Oh, hi, Beth
Patrick perks up at the tone in Beth's voice
' Derek is concentrating at his desk when his phone
He answers quickly
Yeah
Beth's on 2
Thanks
Hi, honey
Everything okay
: ' Kyle is playing on the floor
Beth is on the phone
We're fine but  had some not so great news from my Dad
What's wrong
Mom went back in for more tests
They wanted to do another biopsy and she's pretty scared

'm sure it'll be fine but  thought 'd drive down to San Diego to hold her hand, take Kyle with me
() 89
: 'm gonna be stuck here pretty late but could drive down after
don't think that's a good idea
Friday night traffic's gonna be a nightmare and they won't know the results til tomorrow
Why don't you do what you need to do and drive down in the morning
Are you sure
Yes
here's still that frostiness between them
All right
Say hi to your dad and tell your mom everything's going to be fine, love her
And call me when you're leaving the house

Beth clicks off and turns to Kyle
(cont'd) Come on, sweetie
We're gonna take a little trip

Beth almost laughs
She holds him close
Much more fun than Legoland
We're going down to Nana and Poppa's
Daddy, too
No
We'll see Daddy tomorrow
Now
what toys do you want to take
() 90
: (2) Kyle toddles over to his toy box
: At his desk, Patrick answers the phone
Derek Charles' office

Everything okay around the office
(hushed/secretive) Well, actually
' What

' () Oh, that
That was Beth's doing
She's not handling this very well
Derek's just waiting for the right time to tell her he's leaving

Patrick, don't be such a drama queen thought we were friends
We are, we are
Well

The line goes dead
() 92
: (2) Poor Patrick looks like he's been hit in the face with a bag of shit
She puts her cell phone in her pocket
that she's standing in a grove of trees, looking down at the Charles house
- Beth goes out the front door, arms full with Kyle and overnight bags
She sets the alarm and shuts the door behind her
only to realize she forgot her purse
Beth punches back in, grabs the purse from inside and closes the front door again behind her
Forgets to re-set the alarm
Beth secures Kyle in his kiddie seat, then walks around to the driver's side, gets in and drives away
Lisa watching
: - Lisa approaches the back of the house, carrying a paper bag
She steps up on the deck and goes to the kitchen door
She doesn't even check to see if it's locked
She takes the bag which contains a bottle of champagne and uses the bottle to break a pane in the kitchen door window
Then she reaches inside and unlocks the door
Lisa steps inside and looks around at the cheerful room, Kyle's high chair, the places set for three at the table
isa puts the champagne bottle on the counter, then humming happily, she begins to open shelves until she finds two crystal champagne flutes
She takes them down
Now she looks for an ice bucket and finds it
' Beth drives down the hill, calling Derek on her cell
() 93
: (answering his cell) Hey
We just left the house
Good
Did you set the alarm
The
think  did
had to run back in and  can't remember if  re-set it
Look, don't worry about it
No, 'm barely down the hill
'll do it and call you back
Beth clicks off
She slows down and pulls into a driveway
She backs out and returns up the hill
Lisa enters, carrying the ice bucket with the champagne bottle in it and the two flutes
She smiles excitedly, like a woman preparing for her lover's return
Lisa places the champagne on the night table
She removes her coat to reveal a sexy white nightgown, then reaches into the coat pocket and takes out a paper bag
he upends the bag and with a giggle, begins to sprinkle red rose petals on the floor, making a trail to the bed
' Beth drives up the winding road to the house
The ice bucket and champagne sit on the night table
Lisa stretches out on the bed, amid the rose petals, leaving a space for her lover beside her
She gazes up at the cracked ceiling mirror
She smiles at herself and, thanks to the cracked mirror, her smile is distorted, scary and insane- looking
94
Beth pulls into the drive
On the bed, Lisa hears the car
She rolls off the bed and crosses to the window, parting the curtains to look out
Beth stepping out of the car
' (barely audible; to Kyle) Mommy will just be a minute
Lisa tenses, suddenly fearful
' He can't work, glancing at his cell for Beth's call
Beth lets herself in
She's about to set the alarm when she hears the floor creak above her
Beth freezes
She waits, listens
No further sound
But Beth knows
Beth goes to the front door as if to leave
She opens the door and closes it as if she left the house
Lisa, standing very still near the window, hears the sound of the door opening downstairs, then closing
Relieved, she moves to the window and peers out, expecting to see Beth getting into the car
But there's no sight of her
Beth pulls off her shoes and lays them by the door
She begins to quietly tip toe up the stairs, certain to be as quiet as she can
95
Beth enters to see Lisa peering out the window
Girl, you're even dumber than my husband said you were
() Or did you just forget to take your meds
Lisa whirls around
Beth is standing in the doorway, giving Lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse
Beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor
Lisa is wide-eyed, terrified, caught
Lisa begins to edge her way around the room
(cont'd) You really fucked up this time
coming back to my house
Didn't you get my message
Lisa's eyes dart around for escape
Beth seems remarkably calm
(cont'd) You can look all you want but you're not getting out of here
ot until 've given you the beating of your life
bitch
And she means it, too
Lisa tries to dart around her
But Beth cuts her off, grabbing Lisa by the throat and forcing her back, slamming her hard against the bed post
isa bounces off the post, stunned
Beth is on her, slapping her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa's hair, ripping it out by the roots as Lisa tries to get free
Lisa lets out a subhuman shriek of pain
Beth tosses the hank of hair aside, keeps on coming
She's beyond pissed
(cont'd) Think you can walk into my house
my bedroom
Beth slaps and punches Lisa
() 96
: (cont'd) My child
my husband
Lisa tries to fight back but Beth is a tiger, beating the hell out of her, knocking her around the room
(in pain; terrified, ) Please
Please
Please what
Please don't hurt you
As Beth pummels her, Lisa stumbles/retreats into the adjoining bathroom
She slams the door shut and throws the lock, face bleeding, looking around for a weapon, something to protect herself with
The bathroom door comes off its hinges as Beth barges in
No
Beth grabs Lisa by the head and slams her face into the bathroom mirror
It cracks
Lisa is wobbly, unable to stand
Her face is a bloody mess
But before she can collapse, Beth props her up
("") You're bleeding
We need to wash that off
Beth forces Lisa down, shoves her head into the toilet and flushes it, holding her there as Lisa flops and chokes
(cont'd) Don't worry
'm not going to drown you
jerking Lisa's head up) No, no
'm just getting started
() Please
'm sorry
Too late, bitch
Sorry won't cut it
Beth kicks Lisa out of the bathroom
() 97
: (2) Lisa lands on the floor and gets up, rose petals sticking to her gown
As Beth comes out of the bathroom, Lisa lunges for the night table and grabs the bottle of champagne
She swings it and hits Beth is the side of the head
Whack
The cork pops and champagne goes spewing everywhere
Stunned, Beth goes down on her knees
Lisa wipes blood from her face, circling Beth, lips drawn back and teeth showing like an animal
He doesn't love you
'm the one he wants
(crazed; screaming) Why can't you get that through your head
Lisa raises the bottle to hit her again
Beth lunges forward and tackles her
The bottle goes flying as the two women thrash around on the floor
Derek dials Beth's cell
Kyle snoozes in his car seat
Inside Beth's hand bag on the front seat, her cell phone
Beth and Lisa fight on the floor like two she-demons
Lisa breaks free from Beth
She crawls to the head of the stairs and grabs the post, pulling herself to her feet, eager to escape
(suddenly behind her) Careful
You don't want to fall down the stairs
Beth gives Lisa a shove
Lisa goes crashing down the stairs and lands at the bottom in a heap
Beth descends
(cont'd) Did that hurt
Because it looked real painful
() 98
: (managing to sit up; defensive) Please
Beth
Oh, it's Beth now
What happened to Betty
Lisa rises to her feet, wobbly
She raises bloody hands in surrender
Please
'll go
'll leave
swear 'll never bother you again
You got that right
Lisa turns and desperately hobbles for the front door
But Beth easily beats her to it, knocking Lisa aside and throwing the chain
eth turns and faces Lisa with a murderous look
Hugging the wall for support Lisa back away, leaving a bloody smear
Beth advances
In the kitchen, the phone
Both women freeze
hone  again
Then
' Hi, you've reached the Charles residence
We're not here right now but if you have a message for Derek
' or Beth
or Kyle
Kyle, say hello
' () Hello
' Please wait for the beep

Are you there

: (2) Derek
Lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone
Beth grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back
The sleeve tears loose in Beth's hand
' Beth
Lisa stumbles back toward the stairs
She scrambles upward, thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom
Lisa reaches the top step just as Beth snags her ankle, stopping her
Lisa rolls around and viciously kicks Beth in the shoulder with her other leg
Beth falls back, tumbles halfway down the stairs
'  (cont'd) Beth, pick up
Lisa makes it to the bedroom
She sees the phone on the night stand
'  (cont'd) Beth
Are you there
Lisa desperately grabs the phone
Derek
Oh, Derek, thank god
Reacting in surprise and panic
Lisa
Before she can answer, Beth is suddenly there
She rips the phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it
As Lisa stumbles back into the hall landing, Beth speaks calmly, even sweetly, into the receiver
Derek, 'm right in the middle of something
let me call you back
Beth -- Beth hangs up the phone
() 100
: (3) Alarmed, Derek hurries out of the office, punching a number into his cell as he runs to the elevator
nervous Patrick watches Derek exit
(cont'd) need to speak to Lt
Reyes
It's an emergency
Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her
he two women fight, going up against the bannister
They claw and punch at each other
With renewed strength, Lisa forces Beth up against the bannister
Beth looks over the side and down
Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table
Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister
few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain
he bannister rail begins to crack
Lisa tries to force Beth over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing positions -- The bannister cracks, breaks apart and Lisa topples over the side
As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the chandelier with both hands
By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to pull loose from it's ceiling mount
Plaster cracks and rips away
Lisa swings back and forth, dangling
Beth stands on the landing
She looks at terrified Lisa, then up at the ceiling mount
It won't take Lisa's weight much longer
And both women know it
Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to Beth who could pull her to safety
Please
Beth considers
Then, as if coming out of dream, she slowly reaches out to Lisa
Their hands lock together
Beth slowly pulls Lisa toward her, toward safety
() 101
: (4) (quiet voice) Let go of the chandelier
() No
Let go, Lisa
he chandelier is about to break loose
(cont'd) (motherly concern) Listen to me
You have to let go right now
And, trusting, Lisa lets go
But so does Beth
With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space
The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion
Down, down, down Lisa falls
Her arms and legs flop around like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air
The fall seems endless
Then
Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back
Her whole body buckles
The surface of the table ripples
In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa, framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head
Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's deafening
The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor, her skull cracking
Her back is probably broken but she's still conscious
ying there, Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass bounces and  around her
The two enemies lock eyes
Beth's face is impassive
Lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak
And that's when the chandelier breaks loose
() 102
: (5) Beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges downward and hits Lisa in the chest with a radiantly beautiful shower of crystals
It kills her on impact
e come out of slow motion
Real time resumes
On the landing, Beth stares down at Lisa's body, splayed under the chandelier like a broken doll
Lisa's eyes are open but they're dead
Beth, stoic, just stands there, looking down
' As Derek speeds through traffic, desperate to get home
Beth comes down the stairs, taking no notice of Lisa's lifeless body
She goes to the foyer, unhooks the chain and opens the front door
Outside, a car pulls up and Monica Reyes jumps out
Reyes hurries up the walk and meets Beth standing in the open door
Beth
Is everything alright here
(very calm) 'm fine
Lisa had an accident
(moving past Reyes) have to go
My mother needs me
Reyes looks into the house and sees Lisa's body, then turns back as Beth goes to her car and opens the driver's door
Beth,  need to speak with you
Beth turns back to Reyes
Call me on my cell
What happened here
think you know what happened
(a beat) ) ( () 103
(cont'd) : Now my child has been waiting too long
am sure my husband will be home soon
Beth and Reyes lock eyes
Reyes nods her understanding
Beth nods back, gets in the car, starts the engine and backs out of the drive
Reyes watches her exit
' In traffic
He dials his cell
She picks up her ringing cell phone, looks at the caller and glances at Kyle in the rearview mirror
(tears start to well) It's Daddy
() Beth,  spoke to Reyes
Are you okay
It's over, Derek-- Beth
(a pause) Tell me baby-- are you hurt
should have believed you
It's gonna be okay, honey
We're gonna be okay-- (long beat) love you, Derek
And  love you-- Derek continues on against the traffic
The dashboard picture of Beth and Kyle still smiling back at him
, As Beth's car drives away, passing police cars on their way to the house
