"" Screenplay by Randy Feldman : He's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's into it
(
) at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on
Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing
Come on
Stay up there, Cozy Girl
The   pulls back to reveal that Roper is driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline
(
) At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by half a length
Backtrack closing
- Roper's police radio
(
) One-one-four to Roper
He picks up the radio
Dig in, Cozy Girl
(into the radio) Roper go
(
) One-four, Roper
Code 2
4th and Grand
(
) It's Cozy Girl holding on
Cozy Girl and Backtrack
'm en route
in five
He tosses the radio down
Punches the accelerator
Stay up there, Girl
(
) Cozy Girl in front by a neck
Now a head
- Weaving through traffic on the bridge
(
) Where's the damn wire
(
) Here comes the wire
and
Backtrack gets up in the last jump
Cozy girl a very game second
(
) The Trans Am streak off toward the city
-  - hostage situation
Police barricades
Dozens of squad cars, ambulances, spectators,  team
It's a stalemate
Roper's Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades
He hops out, weaves through the spectators and past the barriers
,  , rushes up to him
Hi, Roper
Hi, Kimura
Where's the command post
Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block
Roper heads toward it
As they walk Kimura briefs him
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened
Botched robbery teller hit the silent alarm
He took seven hostages
Shot one -- the guard
He's still alive
So far he's asked for
a car
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport
If he doesn't
get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes
That's right
What's the suspect's name
Earl
- Across from the bank
This is where the "command post" is setup
About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here
Lieutenant   is in charge
Roper saunters in
Hello, guys
Hello, Roper
Glad you could join us
Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing
Do we have a profile on Mr
Earl
Baffert hands him a folder
Roper opens it
This guy is no genius
Roper scans the profile
They're not usually graduate students
wants to go in
What's the rush
They haven't killed anybody yet this week
Roper refers to the folder
We got a guy who's probably on drugs
He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession
But he's never been busted on a major felony
What's his demeanor
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out
have to go face to face
No -- you can't do that
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out --  said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage
If makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2
gotta go in
Maybe  can see what's going on in there
don't know
He's never offed anybody
His rap doesn't show any violence
Not that we know of
We don't know how much time we have
If  can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there
says it's broken -- The perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable
What do you mean
He urinated on it and shorted out the circuits
We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death
(beat
beat) Give me a dozen donuts
Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter
- Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank
- team of two   , , is the one we're interested in
He's 25 years old, handsome, all American
He's the best the  team has
He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank
What do you think he's got in the bag
Donuts
You can't take a guy down with a donut
- tense situation
wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a , , is holding a pretty, young  around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple
The other bank employees are cowering on the floor
few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious and oozing blood from his side
Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward Earl, very sociable
Hi, Earl, 'm Scott Roper
Wanna donut
ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a -- Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking Roper for weapons with his free hand
The other hand still has the gun poised at the young teller's head
'm a negotiator, Earl
don't carry a weapon
Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller
It seems to help
Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up and puts his hand around the teller's neck
Where's the car
need to get something straight first
Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor
Who's the manager
balding, middle-aged  sheepishly raises his hand
am
Roper takes a step toward him
When did you start keeping longer hours
Last spring
Really
Because 've been thinking of moving to this branch
It would be really convenient for me -- ,
Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear
Do you want me to start killing people
Roper holds his hand up defensively
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl
Including you
Then where's my  car
Earl is pouring sweat
His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably
'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way
Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl
His voice is calm
First  need you to point that gun away from -- (to the teller) What's your name
(voice trembling) Debbie
Point the gun away from Debbie
Debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if don't see a car in five minutes
Roper takes a long look at Earl
The guy is a hair trigger
Alright
But let's be clear about one thing
If you kill someone, can't help you
The  guys will take you out
Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside
Reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation
What are my chances of getting out of here
Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying
Not bad
Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City
Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard
How ya doin'
The guard groans
He's not doing very well
Roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look
Winces
(to Earl) Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway
Earl is encouraged by that
Really
Absolutely
Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals
Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes
He didn't kill anybody, though
Roper bends over the guard
This is gonna hurt
He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor
The guard  piteously
Hey, leave him alone
What are you doing
Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door
It's part of my negotiator's oath
If there's an injured party and can help them, 'm duty bound by my oath to do that
You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing
Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath
He lets Roper drag the guard to the door
'll be right back, Earl
Point that gun away from Debbie
Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple
- Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk
Two   rush up to give aid
One of them is Jennings
(whispering to Jennings) Give me your gun
(: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him
Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest
haven't had to shoot anyone in three years
Why not keep the streak alive
Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody
- Earl watches Roper through the window
He can only see Roper's back
He's getting very agitated
(yelling) , The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank
Stops about five paces from Earl
As a rule,  need one hostage released as show of good faith
Roper glances at Debbie
Gun pressed against her head
Tears start rolling down her cheeks
She's being tremendously brave
Give me Debbie
Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head
Take the old guy
The other hostages watch this exchange tensely
The Old Guy
What kind of show of faith is that
want Debbie
Am  gettin' the car
You're gettin' the car
Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching
He points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter
Take them
Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get
You two, leave
The two women don't need any extra encouragement
They jump up and rush out the front door
- McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops
This guy is good
That's what they say
- That was fine, Earl
Now 'm going to get your car
Roper turns around and walks toward the front door
He stops and looks over his shoulder
Oh, there's one last thing
Earl looks like he's right on the edge
What
You want a convertible or hardtop
Earl thinks about that for a beat
Hardtop
Roper turns around, starts walking again
He keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the bank
(without turning around) Manual or automatic
Automatic
You got it
In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and
One
It tears into Earl's shoulder
One inch from Debbie's neck
Earl is blown back against the counter
Debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs
guys pour in from every entrance
for everybody to " "
Pointing guns
They pounce on Earl
give up
give up
Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank
- McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the bank door
Their police radio squawks
The situation is secured
Suspect in custody
Repeat
Situation secured
McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the wave of cops rushing into the bank
- Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a
He turns to see ()  holding the camera
She snaps one of Roper with Earl in the b
g
being placed in a squad car
There's one for the front page
Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love
which he in fact is
Ronnie, why are you torturing me can't live without you
Ronnie rolls her eyes
She doesn't take Roper all that seriously
Don't start
She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk off
Roper dogs her
This baseball player you're going out with
(shaking his head) He's no good for you
Really
He's a wonderful guy
He makes two million a year, and he worships me
worship you
You worship yourself
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name
Greg
Did you know he's already got a bad knee
In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair
Ronnie stops
Looks him in the eye
You know what  think
think you only want me now, because 'm with somebody else
Who cares what you think
want you back and that's all that matters
Ronnie smiles, but offers no response
Let me take you out tomorrow night
Pleeease
'm going out with Greg tomorrow
(frowning) This Greg is really getting in my way
Roper gets down on his knees
Please
'm begging you
Oh, 've got to get a shot of this
She takes the lense cap off her camera
Roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture
Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed
He rushes over to his car
Hey, that's my car
stands off to the side watching dispassionately
Not anymore
Now it belongs to Silver Hills Financial
Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved Trans Am
-  - Lots of activity
Officers in cubicles; talking on phones; typing reports on computers
Most are plain-clothed
Roper weaves through the room
Passes by Baffert's desk
Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight
Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his pocket
Floor seats
You're my hero
Dinner's on you
Deal
-  - quiet contrast to the squadroom
This is the executive branch of Metro
All the big-wigs are officed here
Roper walks down the carpeted hall
No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office
Roper and McCall make brief eye contact
Roper thinks nothing of it
He goes into the Captain's office
'  - is on the phone
There's a file on the desk in front of him
He motions Roper to sit down
He just walked into my office
(looks over at Roper) The Chief says, "Good work this morning
Congratulations
" Roper smiles as he sits down
Tell him to give me a raise
(into the phone) He says, "Thank you very much
" (a beat) 'll discuss it with him right now
Good-bye, Chief
Solis hangs up
Looks across the desk at Roper
long pause
He knows he's got leverage
Roper
What
Are you going to make this hard for me
Depends
What's up
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up
Define concern
Solis dumps his cards on the table
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it
Your concern is heartwarming
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside
His name's Kevin McCall
Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed
Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk
Let me see that
Roper scans it
Tested high on his intellectual aptitude
Not as high as me but
National marksman finalist
Attended Went to college
Very impressive
sniper school
Mayorial commendation
-  - McCall turns around in his chair
He can see Roper and Solis through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear their voices
'  -  - "Additional Skills": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish
Roper throws the folder back on the desk
Great, send him to the Marines
This guy's not a negotiator
He'll quit in two weeks
You let us worry about that
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation
(gloomily) What kind of appreciation are we talking about
The financial kind
figure 'm going to be working extra hours
All sorts of overtime
training sessions
Not to mention the extra stress
What do you think would be in order
Like ahh
don't know
(boldly) Five thousand dollars
(calmly) Okay,  think  could swing that
Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short
(quickly) And a car
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise
Get a car of your own
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company
(firmly) The car is part of the deal
What happened to your Trans Am
Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come in
Repoed this morning
(relenting) 'll provide you with transportation
And even if this doesn't work, want all the money
These  guys don't have the temperament
They don't have the background
McCall enters the office
(instant character change) Hey, glad to meet you
've heard nothing but good things about you
Roper reaches out
They shake hands
Same here
've watched you in action
Very impressive
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator
'm ready to do it
(a beat) And 'm going to be here more than two weeks
Roper's face darkens
Don't go reading my lips, man
That's an intrusion
Save that shit for the sniper school
Comprende
Sorry
Habit
(intervening) Let's move past this, gentlemen
Roper smiles
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin
If you say so
Then you'll have to excuse me have other work to do
Roper and McCall head out the door
Roper
Roper turns back around
About the transportation issue
You check with the impound sergeant
Roper smiles
Total victory
-  - with Roper and McCall
You ever been in a hostage situation
Only at the very end
How do you feel after a shooting
(self-assured) Like it had to be done
They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles
It rarely has to be done
've rarely shot anyone
is a lifesaving unit, you know
(flatly) know
Try to remember that
They arrive at Roper's desk
Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one
Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk
He takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the empty bottle
He places the bottle on his desk
Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle
McCall looks at the bottle quizzically
What's the point of this
little exercise in lateral thinking
The obvious solution isn't always the only solution
See you tomorrow
Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder the problem
McCall looks over at another cop who has been observing
The cop shrugs his shoulders
He hasn't got a clue
McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle
Sequence omitted from original script
- Roper and Baffert walking past the row of cars, including Solis' cadillac, searching for Roper's "new" transportation
Roper is holding the keys in his hand
Mind if we make a stop on the way
We busted Frank Antonucci on possession
He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist
"Phoney Frank"
Don't waste your time
He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar
still gotta do it
Wasting time is half my job
Yeah, okay
Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces
This  guy might be a good idea
He may be able to take a little pressure off you
worry about you
You worried about me, too
The chief's worried about me
Solis is worried about me
Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization
Speaking of which
saw you talking to Ronnie this morning
Why can't you get it back together with her
You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one
It's not me
It's her
She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett
(impressed) No shit
He's good
Fuck him
He swings at anything in the dirt
could strike him out
Don't give up on her
You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things
Roper bends over like an old man
Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up
They arrive at their destination
parking space with a 1957
This is it
Space 742
Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief
Then he didn't say 742
He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right
Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who is crossing to the truck
Oh man
What am , Red Foxx
'm not riding in this shit
can't roll in no shit like this
He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the passengers side
He opens the door
Where's the stereo
Fuck the stereo
What's that smell
Come on
Just get in
We gotta go
- The pickup in traffic
Sequence omitted from original script
'  - It's a four story twenties style walk-up
It's evening now
The pickup pulls to a stop out front
- Baffert pulls out a slip of paper
Apartment 306
You want me to go up with you
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything
'm just gonna talk to him
Good
don't want to be late
Baffert gets out
Roper grabs his cell phone
You want anything on the game
Baffert turns back around
What's the line
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning
'll take half of your action
Baffert goes into the building
Roper dials his cellular phone
Beep
Beep
message on the display reads:
Roper looks around
There's a payphone across the street
He gets out of the truck and crosses to it
- Third floor hallway
Nice, middle class place
Well kept up
Baffert walks over to room 306
Knocks
'
- Jazz is playing
sits motionless in a chair listening to the music
There's a
Korda responds as if pulled from a trance
He rises and moves to the door
Who is it
(
) It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department
slight hesitation from Korda
He glances around the apartment
For what reason, we don't know
Maybe to make sure there's nothing incriminating around
He opens the door
What happened
Is there a problem
May  come in
would just like to ask you a couple of questions
Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter
Korda closes the door
Baffert scans the place
Not bad
He listens to the music
smile grows on his face
Count Basie
Korda smiles back
Another jazz aficionada
Duke Ellington
"Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945
Yeah
Yeah
Now  can hear it
Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down
Duke Ellington plays low
Where did you find an old recording like that
Used record shop down on Turk Street
was in there looking for some Robert Johnson
(searching for the name) Memories
Memory Lane or something
've got to stop in there
Mr
Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street
Baffert smiles
No, this is a different Frank
This is a man who deals in jewelry
Stolen jewelry usually
You wouldn't know anybody like that
Korda drifts to the other side of the room
Takes a look out his front window
Nobody there
Just the truck
certainly wouldn't
He says it as if the very idea disturbs him
He turns away from the window
Baffert feigns a coughing spell
Could  please have a little water
(the perfect host) Of course
Korda heads toward the kitchen area
Baffert uses this as an opportunity to drift around the room
Do a little snooping
The reason 'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry
It was traced to the robbery of a store down on Polk Street
He said he was fencing it for you
Baffert notices something in the trash can
Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels
They have jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade
Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but his face betrays nothing
(calmly) There's obviously some mistake have a cousin who has had run-ins with the law
Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this
situation
This cousin of yours
What's his name
(forthrightly) Clarence Teal
They look at each other a beat
Korda is still holding the water
Your cough seems to be better
real repressed tension here
Someone's about to get hurt
Baffert takes the glass of water
Thank you
He takes a sip
Korda watches him like a cobra
Baffert puts the glass down on the table
Well, 'm on my way to the game appreciate your cooperation, Mr
Korda
Korda smiles
Baffert walks to the door
Opens it to leave
Lieutenant
Baffert turns back around
Do you believe that story about Robert Johnson
That he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads
Baffert muses along with Korda
Could be
Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door
- Baffert gets into the elevator
- Baffert takes out his cell phone
Dials
(as the elevator descends) Hello, Judge Stone
This is Lieutenant Samuel Baffert
'm at a suspect's residence
'm requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store
There's visible evidence on the premises
Glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings were seen in the trash can
The elevator hits the first floor
believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen property
The elevator opens
Korda is standing there with a knife
Baffert has no time to react
The knife hand slashes forward
Stabbing the chest and slashing across the throat
- Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, returning from the payphone
Neither of the men take any particular notices of each other
carrying her groceries enters the building
Roper gets to the truck
from inside the building
- Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his neck and chest
Roper rushes over to him
It doesn't look good
The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first flight of stairs
Frozen
Roper pulls out his gun and rushes by her up the stairs
(to the woman) Get an ambulance
- Roper arrives at the top of the stairs
Korda's door is ajar
Duke Ellington can be heard faintly
'
- Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready
No one there
Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door
Roper races out
- Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall,  it open
Gun aimed
302 - five year old stares up at him
Scared stiff
Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves
- Roper burst out the front
Down the stairs to the sidewalk
Looks both ways down the street
Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone
approaches
-  - Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain
Solis is in the b
g
on the phone
(on the phone) Yes sir
Every resource will be brought to bear
We will find this guy
Yeah, he's here now
'll tell him
Solis hangs up the phone
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is
He knew Sam Baffert was a good man
(still looking out window) He said he was just going up to talk to him
He said
(beat; turning to Solis) want to be put on this case
can't do that
(emphatic) want to be put on this case
You know  can't assign you to this
You're much too close to it
You were much too close to Sam
The department will take care of it
Who's running it
Roper
Who's running it
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation
Roper turns to leave
Scott
Go home
Get some sleep
Roper pauses at the door
Then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office
He exits
: - Two detectives
female named  and a tall guy named , try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming
Hey, hey, hey
Roper intercepts them
Anything on Korda so far
Solis said to keep you clear of this
Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward Solis' hallway
don't give a damn what Solis said
(to the detectives) If you get a lead,  want to know
Sequence omitted from original script
-  - Roper's pickup drives by
Thru the windshield
We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth
His face seems dazed and lost
'  - Roper knocks
Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard
(
) Just a minute
Roper makes no effort to pull himself together
The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise
She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings
Hey
Hey yourself
Came by to see Troy
(like hell) little late for that, Scottie
He's asleep
(smells his breath) Jack Daniels
'm not drunk
Yet
Maybe you should be
You heard
She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway
Yeah
'm sorry
Can  come in
Ronnie opens the door reluctantly
'  - Roper enters
Instantly we see he's at home here
He hangs his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices a photograph on the wall
Quite imposing
Very unique style
That a new picture
About 4 months old
'm working in a new style
Roper gazes at it indifferently
He falls silent
Thoughts turned inward
Suddenly, , (the dog), bounds in
He's ecstatic to see Roper
He puts his front paws on the couch and his head in Roper's lap
Hey, Troy
How ya doin' boy
(to Ronnie) He heard my voice
Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence
His words are light
His tone isn't
How's the good dog
miss you buddy
You miss me
Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried
He misses me
She nods
moment's silence
won't stay long
had to talk to someone
(a bit surprised at his openness) You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting
It was my fault
was right downstairs
should have gone up with him
Scott, You can't save everyone
've proved that, didn't
She's not coming closer
She wants to, but she won't do it
She seems uneasy, glances towards the door
Roper rises
Oh, hell, forget it
This won't work
(gentle) What do you want from me
Something  guess  can't have anymore
Don't try to make me feel guilty
The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me
Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again
can't do it
can't be more than your friend
Because  know what will happen
In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again
(surprised, hurt) You think  didn't need you
If you did, you never showed it
Ronnie
He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a
Ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty
You expecting someone
Her silence is the answer
flash of pain from Roper
This day just keeps getting better
Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets
(soft) They're on the table where you always leave them
He grabs the keys as she opens the door
stands outside waiting
He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face
Hey, baby,  thought maybe you were
Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper
was just leaving
Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway
Ronnie makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him to follow Roper
She calls after him
Scottie
take care of yourself
Roper doesn't look back
He just goes
26 - huge warehouse
Sun coming up over the East Bay, rides up on a  , carrying a large cup of coffee to go
He enters the warehouse
- Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high
Clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse
'  - Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay
Korda is waiting behind the door as Clarence enters
He seizes Clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around
Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt
If you weren't family 'd kill you
Clarence is scared
He offers no defense
You told Antonucci that shit came from me
So that we could get the best price
He's got respect for you
He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike
Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot
You fucking idiot
Why do you think use you
To be a walking advertisement
'm sorry, Mike
never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before
He said he had the cops paid off
Antonucci never flipped on anyone before
He had the cops paid off
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door
What happened, Mike
You don't want to know
Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes
'm sorry, Mike
Clarence sincerely feels bad
It's kind of touching in a twisted way
Korda moves over to the window to keep from striking Clarence again
He looks off across the bay
God damn it
still needed to case that fucking store
It's too risky to show my face now
got a couple thousand bucks
You could leave town
Leave town
They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now
(a beat) They got over ten million in jewels in that place
That's freedom, man
could go anywhere  want
Clarence watches Korda warily
Things are beginning to add up in his head
Did you kill him, Mike
Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question
Clarence is shaken by that
He starts to whimper again
'm sorry, Mike
'm really sorry
We're talking major fear here
Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against his chest
It's not your fault you're stupid
Tears of relief from Clarence
- Roper enters the squadroom
His mood is contained
He walks to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling
couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in Hostage Situations"
On the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it
(to Kimura and Glass) What do you got on Korda
We ran a search on relatives
He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal
Smalltime thief
Last known address was on Pine Street
He moved out a month ago
We've got a couple leads on him to check out
(rapid fire) Did you check out  for any vehicles registration
Being faxed over now
How about the record room for any incident reports
He might be a victim
We can get medical records
Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits
Roper
And what about bars
We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents
Roper, we're into it
Suddenly Solis appears at their side
We've had this conversation once, Roper
You're not active on this case
Roper looks at him icily
It's in everyone's best interest
McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely
After a beat, Roper gives in
Indicates his compliance
Solis heads back to this office
(softened) You guys are doing good work
He moves toward the desk
McCall gets up when he sees him coming
'm sorry about your friend
had a friend in  killed
know how it can be
appreciate your concern
Let's leave it at that
McCall respectfully drops it
Roper looks down at the soda bottle
don't see much progress here
McCall holds up a finger
Not so fast
He picks up a pot from a nearby "Mr
Coffee" machine
It's filled with water
He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle
The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle
Very nice
You get an ""
Notice
No force required
No damage
Just then a  calls to Roper across the squadroom
Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street
Possible hostage situation
McCall grabs his duffel bag
Roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies"
He looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can
He and McCall head out
- The pickup is weaving through traffic
- Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging from the rear view mirror
to show a police bubble flashing on the dashboard
Roper weaving through traffic
McCall is sitting calmly as ever
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco
They recruited me
Promised me fast advancement
Recruited you from where
National Marksman Competition
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers
Why here
Furthest point  could find from New York
You don't like New York
Spent my whole life there
just wanted to get out for a while
You'd never been out of New York
Been to Toronto
My mother was born there
How did you like Toronto
It was okay
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you
You caught me on an "up" day
(a beat) How about you
How did you end up in San Francisco
grew up in Oakland
Crossed the Bay Bridge and here  was
(a beat) So you're looking for "fast advancement"
Is there something wrong with that
'm not sure
6TH  - Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing apartment building
crowd has begun to gather hold them back
are questioning a man wearing only green slacks
No shirt
No shoes
Just the slacks
He is very agitated
The pickup screeches up
Roper and McCall hop out
Roper flashes his badge to the  in charge
( #1) Roper
Metro Division
Hostage Negotiator
Give me the short version
#1 Husband came home
Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante"
Now he's holding her at knife point
Which apartment
The Officer points up to the third floor
#1 That one with the bars on the windows
Roper nods
Walks back over to the pickup
Looks up
Eyeballs the building
How are we gonna get him out of there
We could fill it with water
Roper throws him a look
McCall walks to the back of the pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel bag
(to Officer #1) Have you evacuated anyone
#1 Only that floor
Is the hostage injured
#1 Don't know
She keeps screaming to stay out
He keeps screaming to stay out
We decided to stay out
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that
McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand
'll take "highground" until gets here
(surveying the area) can get a good sight-line from that roof across the street
McCall marches off across the street
Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here
McCall calls back over his shoulder
know my job
At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor window
Roper heads for the front door of the building
/ - (  ) McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop
6TH
- The screams are getting more panicky
Roper comes down the hall quickly
The door to the apartment is open
It's been that way since the guy in the green slacks fled
Roper hurries toward the door
- The  is in bra and panties and the  is 6'4"
He's giving her a good beating
It's a studio apartment
Unmade bed
Belongings strewn all over
Window open with sun streaming in, and a good view of the building across the street
We hear '  from out in the hall
(
) 'm coming in
'm not armed
The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife to her throat
(shrieking) No, Raymond
(to Roper) Stay the fuck out of here
But Roper steps into the apartment
Sees the wife
Face swollen
Knife to her neck
The enraged husband, contemplating murder
One inch from committing the act
Roper doesn't bat an eye
know how you feel, Ray
You don't know shit, and  suggest you leave
He presses the knife against the wife's throat
She winces
Her chest heaves
can't leave, Ray
It's part of my negotiator's oath
Once 'm in the room with the hostage,  have to stay
You don't want to see what 'm going to do to her
Let me show you something, Ray
Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet
He extracts a photo
Wife
Two kids
little dog-eared
Nice touch
holds it up so Raymond can see it
Same thing happened to me, man
She cheated on me, but  forgave her
You know why
ain't interested in your life story
Because  was partially to blame wasn't around as much as  should have been
forgot how to love her
She's the one to blame
Not me
- In prone position
Rifle in hand
Eye to scope
of Raymond's open window
' Everyone where we left them
Roper looks at Ray with utter sincerity
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her
Think about how happy you were
Don't lose that, man
Don't give up everything
What am  giving up
'm laid off last year
'm down to my last unemployment check
'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed
And now Ray is crying
Blubbering actually
And he's not that coherent
'm down at Consolidated and 'm begging
'm saying 'll take half my pay
Eight years, man
don't even have to work the loading docks anymore
'll do maintenance
"We're cutting back
We're streamlining, Ray
West Central's running things now
It's out of our hands" Fuck them
Fuck them
(deep sigh) 'm gonna kill her and then 'm gonna kill myself, 'cause  don't wanna live anymore
Roper reaches out to him
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, 'll get you a job
Doing what
Cleaning toilets
can't guarantee you what it will be
But  swear on my life, 'll find you work
And why the fuck would you do that for me
Not for you, Ray
For me
close friend of mine was killed this week
The way  figure it,  stop you from doin' what you said, 'm one up on body count
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa
My name's Scott Roper
Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife clutched tightly in his fist
The wife squeezes her eyes closed
Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat
Then
need my coat
It's on a coat rack in the corner
But to get there he has to pass by the window
Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns and goes to get his coat
He crosses in front of the window
Reaches for the coat
bullet slams into his skull
Ray falls to the floor
The wife runs out of the room, screaming
He rushes over to Ray
Circle of blood soaking into the carpet
Ray's empty eyes
His hand still wrapped in his coat
He was dead instantly
Roper slams his fist into the wall couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway
Roper bolts out of the room
Pounds down the hallway
Pounds down the stairs
down another flight
McCall comes across the street
Roper sees McCall, cool as ever
Rifle slung over his shoulder
Roper steps into his path
McCall gives no answer
He pushes past Roper and continues into the building
-  - Roper follows, screaming his head off
Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God
What the fuck goes on in your head
McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment
Yellow "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway
Cops are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence
McCall ducks under the tape
Roper follows
- McCall goes over to Ray's body
Crouches down
Roper comes up behind him
McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms
Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" variety
McCall looks up at Roper
is a lifesaving unit, remember
just saved a life
Yours
Roper doesn't miss a beat
(still angry) You think 've never had a gun pulled on me
You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it
McCall gets to his feet
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide
(fiercely) Not the ones 'm at
McCall and Roper glare at each other
Toe to toe
beat
McCall's face softens just perceptibly
Sorry
My mistake
He walks out of the room
Roper whips the sheet off the bed, contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand
Then tosses the sheet over Ray's dead body
- Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked "Internal Affairs"
Things are quiet
Roper stares at the floor
Waiting
The door opens
McCall comes out, escorted by two internal affairs
One of the investigators pats him on the back
Looks like a clean shoot
Go home and get some rest
McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office
Roper approaches McCall
He's cooled off considerably
Even a tad friendly
Come on
Let's go for a drink
don't really like to drink
You have to
It's a tradition
Well, if  have to,  have to
- neighborhood bar
Roper and McCall are playing pool
Half- finished beers are on a nearby table
McCall is bent over the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot
Roper studies him
You got a girlfriend
Why
You like my ass
McCall misses the shot
Better than your pool game
Roper lines up his shot
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you
don't gamble
Roper smiles
Sinks his shot
Moves around the table
Yeah, 've got a girlfriend
You living together
She's back in Jersey
going to graduate school
Explain how that works
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married
She grow up in Livingtston, too
(as if that were unthinkable) No, no, no
(a beat) She's from Hoboken
Oh, "city girl"
Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey
We see each other every couple of months
Every couple of months, huh
couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper
That's a lot of commitment
admire that
Do you really
No
Actually  think it's fucking crazy,  don't know if  could do it
Thanks for clearing that up
(a beat) hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett
Where did you hear that
Around
Barnett's tough competition
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage
beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper
Roper misses his shot
Picks up his beer glass
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"
should have been lesson one
Never exchange yourself for a hostage
think  can handle that one
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up
Roper takes a drink of beer
Nears the bottom of his glass
Calls to the
Zack, another round
Roper turns back to McCall
My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl
He got caught in the crossfire
Two dead
My partner and the bad guy
(takes the last sip) Weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again
(a beat) Some people never learn
Roper puts down his glass
You think you can learn, McCall
think so
Roper nods
Maybe he can
- We're looking at a door
It's not clear where we are
McCall enters
We only see his face
Determined
'm Officer McCall, what's going on
It's a training room
It's built to approximate a convenience store
Several mannequins are placed around the room to represent a hostage situation
The " " has a walkie- talkie strapped around his neck
Roper's voice  out of it
What the fuck do you think is going on, turdhead
'm about to waste everyone in this place
McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response
He seems stiff and awkward
how can  help you
Tell me what
(looks off to his right) feel stupid talking to a dummy
Roper enters the training room from a side door
He's holding the other walkie-talkie
What did you think
'm going to let you practice on real people
Roper comes up beside him
First things is, don't say, "What's going on
" Everybody knows what's going on
come into this situation, say, (addressing the mannequin) "'m glad to see nobody's hurt
That's good
'm here to help you
" (turns back to McCall) Second: You hesitated
Don't hesitate
If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting
Which you are
If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous
You don't want him nervous
Got that
No
It'll come
Try again
- McCall comes in
The room has the same set-up
McCall takes a look around
Launches immediately into
My name's McCall
'm a hostage negotiator
'm here to help you
Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely
(
) How are you going to help me
McCall's confidence is growing
Tell me what you need
(
) need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so  can cut off his nuts
Now he's stumped
(hesitantly) can't do that
(
) Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit
McCall looks up to his right
Is all the name calling necessary
Roper re-enters the training area
Nah,  just throw that in because enjoy it
(exasperated) So what do  say to this guy
You could say something like, (addressing the dummy) "Tell me what the scumbag's name is
Maybe we can work something out
" What
Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off
Roper turns to McCall
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie
'm not good at lying
Get good at it
It's against my nature
Roper gives him an amused smile
You know the ten commandments
Yes
What's the first commandment
Thou shall have no other God before me
That's not the answer Roper wanted
Okay, forget that
What's the main one
McCall is tired of guessing
You tell me
Thou shall not kill
You've killed, right
Yes
Why
To save lives
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives
McCall can't argue with that one
Roper turns and heads back to the side door
Let's try it again
- McCall comes through the door
Hands in the air
The setup in the room has been changed a bit
The bad guy is behind the counter
Several hostages in various positions on the floor
My name's McCall
'm unarmed
(
) Okay, stop
Roper comes through the side door
Close your eyes
McCall is surprised by the command but closes them
Roper turns him away from the hostage scene
What did you see
(rapid-fire) dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off
Berretta nine millimeter in his belt
female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display
Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right
Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack
female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine
McCall opens his eyes
Roper's impressed
Very good
You've got good eyes
That's important
- Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video tape
It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting goods store
negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a ten year old girl hostage
The negotiator holds his hands out imploringly
Carefully moves toward the gunman
The negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl
The gunman grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his head
The little girl runs out of the picture to safety
Roper remains dead silent during all this
McCall looks over at him
The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face
Was that your partner
Roper nods
Why did he do it
(quietly) Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better
We had a plan, but  opened up too early
He got caught in the crossfire
(a sad beat) Let's move on
Notice this
Always use the eyes to keep the connection
It almost like hypnosis
That's the most important thing
Create a connection
You're always on their side
McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back on the screen
- Beautiful day
Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at the walking ring
The horses are being paraded and saddled
Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye
McCall seems totally disinterested
You know why  like the track
You're a compulsive gambler
Roper ignores that
Because there are a multitude of possibility's
Everything is there to see if you know what to look for
You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation
Roper points across the ring to a particular horse
See the four horse
Dropping in class
No works
Front wraps
Looks like he's broken down
But notice the woman in the sun hat
She's the owner
She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down
He's live
We use him
McCall listens indifferently
See the favorite
Tail up
Washy
He doesn't want to run today
Cross him off
Now the Six looks good
On his toes
Coat shiny
This trainer/jockey combo does well
We can't leave him out
(turns to McCall) What do you think
have two words for you
Seek help
have three words for you
Ex-ac- ta
- Roper is buying tickets
McCall is with him, watching the other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors
Strange place
Roper finishes and turns away from the window
Hands McCall a ticket
bought you a four-six exacta box
You owe me twenty bucks
(puzzled) do
- Roper and McCall pass by a gambler
Hey, Roper
How you doin', Marv
They sit down in a box right up front
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second
(no enthusiasm) Fine
Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the backstretch
'm told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend
Roper looks over at him
What's this about
Ronnie
Yeah, so
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett
So what do you want
An autograph
don't know why she'd pick him over you
Roper throws McCall a skeptical look
(straight-faced) 'm just practicing my lying
Still needs work
(downcast) You're right
'll never be as good a liar as you
(
) And they're racing
The horses spring from the gate
(The track announcer's call plays through race) Roper watches intently through the binoculars
McCall sits impassively
Okay, we're in good shape
We're in good shape
McCall looks across the track
The 6 horse is last
That's okay
That's his style
To run last
To run late
Roper follows the horses into the turn
The favorite's fading
told you he wasn't going to run today
The four horse has got the lead
McCall sits like a wax figure
(cynically) The 6 horse is still last
He'll be running at the quarter pole
The horses head into the stretch
The  is on the lead and the  is starting to unleash a big run
Passing horses with every stride
(
) There he goes
McCall sits forward slightly
They need to run first and second
Yeah, first and second
Roper gets to his feet
The horses thunder down the stretch
The  horse is in front and the  is coming on from behind
Roper is on his feet screaming
Come on, Russell
Come on, Russell
McCall jumps to this feet and joins him
(to Roper) Who the fuck's Russell
The jockey
,
Roper and McCall cheer together
The  horse crosses the finish line in front
The horse is flying
Needs to beat one horse to be second
He's running out of room
With one last surge he hits the wire and
It's too close to call
McCall, really excited, turns to Roper
We won
(disheartened) We lost
(confidently) We won
How much you wanna bet
You want to bet on whether you won your bet
This is getting sick
As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on
4-6-8
They won
Yes
High fives
That's eight hundred bucks
/  - Roper and McCall collect their money
Four hundred a piece, not bad
McCall pockets his money
How long you been coming here
About six years
My partner took me
Is it always like this
Occasionally you lose
Suddenly Roper's  goes off
He checks it, takes out a cellular phone and dials
(into the phone) Roper here
(he listens) 'm on my way
He hangs up and turns to McCall
We gotta go
-   - Marble facade
Tastefully reinforced windows and door
Choppers circle overhead
Both ends of the street are sealed off
Barricades are up
Spectators and news crews crowd behind those
Numerous police circulate
This is a major operation in full swing
-   - It's across the street from the jewelry store
Second story
The walls are plastered with travel posters
poster of Tahiti is the most prominent
Members of police and  are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table
Right behind them is a  monitoring the front of the store
Solis is at another desk, on the phone
He's talking to the suspect
We're working on that, Joe
These things aren't quite that simple
- Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street
McCall takes a look at the jewelry store
Well fortified, foreboding
This does not look good
Roper looks over there, gives no reaction
They reach Solis' convertible Cadillac
It's parked out front of the travel agency building
See this
Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand
Probably worth thirty
Police corruption
It's everywhere
- Roper and McCall enter
McCall joins the men who are studying the blueprint
Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note of the poster of Tahiti
Looks inviting
This will take time to setup
'll have to get authorizations
(he listens) Okay, you relax, and 'll -- Solis pulls the phone away from his ear
Joe has obviously hung up
What do we got
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm
unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside
Any verification on numbers
We've only seen and talked to one suspect
He calls himself "Joe"
There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman
This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair
They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in
They knew what they were coming for
What have you promised them
Just that 'd talk to my superiors
McCall returns from checking out the blueprints
Any good points of entry
McCall shakes his head
The place is designed to be a vault
Roper picks up the cellular phone
It dials automatically
(into the phone) My name's Roper
How are you people doing in there
(he listens) Solis is off the job now, Joe
'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want
(listens) That's right, but first  need to come down there to talk to you
- We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of the phone
He's wearing a ski mask and gloves
Totally unrecognizable to the audience
We will find out soon that he is, in fact, Korda
He appears very cool and collected
You don't have to come here
- Yes,  do
That way there's no misunderstandings
need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business
long pause
Then a bit sinister
(
) Alright, Roper
You want to come
come
Good
won't be armed
We gotta operate on trust here
We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible
Roper clicks off the phone
He already doesn't like the sound of this guy
- Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store
It's quiet now
The choppers have been pulled back
Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store
Korda cracks the door open
(warningly) Stay there
Roper stops in his tracks
'm going to put my hands down, okay
Roper slowly lowers his hands
Everybody watching through the window
- Korda takes a half step out the doorway
The gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon
The other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway
He wears jeans, a black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes
He stares fiercely from behind the ski mask
There's no sign of fear in him
Are you in charge, Roper
Yep
want a car
Like a four wheel drive
want it in perfect condition want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here
want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street
Then we'll come out
don't want any remote control devices in it
know all the tricks
If it's not in perfect condition, and  mean if its even low on wiper fluid, 'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again
Korda lets that sink in
want a plane waiting at the airport
'll tell them where  want to go when  get there
Is that all
For now that's all
You'll get it
But, Joe,  want you to do something for me
Let me take a look around inside
Make sure everybody's okay
No
You just do shit for me right now
Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask
He's an ominous figure
Joe, 'm doing a lot for you
think you could give me something to cement the deal
One hostage
'll give you something
Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to Roper
Roper unwraps the handkerchief
It's a human ear
In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece
assume there are no "misunderstanding"
Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him
understand you completely
Korda disappears back behind the door
- Roper trudges back in
Things are more active now
Logistical officers are making flow charts
Photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board
Roper approaches Solis, McCall and the   who are anxiously waiting for his report
(flatly) We're going to have to take this guy out
That draws a long silence
That's something Roper rarely says
Can't we wear him down
Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it
Solis eyes it with dismay
believe there's at least one fatality in there already
The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire
believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway
He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me
His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me
The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques
(a beat) So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out
McCall calmly offers his opinion
Let him come out
Too many unknowns in there
Solis nods
That'll be the plan
When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb
(to  Captain) Put our best man "highground", Twenty degree down angle
The  Captain motions and turns to one of his
Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line
The underling hurries off to take care of it
Solis looks at Roper dejectedly
feel this thing going sideways on us
Roper tries to buck him up
There is some good news
He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages
(big pause) Yet
- The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda
His face is sweaty
Hair matted
to show five very scared hostages:  , middle-aged, balding
The male , good-looking, thirties, three piece suit , nicely dressed, late twenties
, gray-haired Hillsborough matron
They are all seated against the wall
There are two fatalities lying on the floor
The guard and one of the jewelers
Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies
Drag them behind the counter
The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task
The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully
The older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality
Her eyes are a bit far away
Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted
With the barrel of his gun, He  the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry
He dumps it in an open satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains
Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet
She seems fairly out-of-it
Maybe in shock
She starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction
'm not staying here another minute
#1 (panicky) No, Mrs
Dotson
Korda rushes around the display case
Come here, hag
He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door
She shrieks
The manager takes a step toward Korda
Leave her alone
Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager
You're a brave one, aren't you
The manager glares at him
He's about Korda's size
He thinks about making a run at him
#2 (pleading) Sit down, Doug
long beat
The manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages
Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman
Korda looks down at her
If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, 'll have to kill her
Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems
- Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green through the barricade and heads down the deserted street
- Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store
The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store
Parks at a slight angle
The uniformed police officer gets out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the barricade
Okay
Time to give this fucker a call
Roper picks up the phone, waits
Everybody tensely watching the store
Sequence omitted from original script
- sniper team watching the store from a third floor window
- Roper holding the phone
It's still ringing
-   - Another sharpshooting team
Poised
Waiting
- And still another sharpshooter team
- The phone is still ringing
This fucker's not answering
Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open
spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway
Korda is discharging a fire extinguisher
There's your answer
He's smart
He's cutting down the visibility
And doing a very good job of it
thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the front of the jewelry store
Roper puts down the phone
Come on
Give us one clean shot
(into his radio) All positions, you have the green light
They're out
Roper grabs a pair of binoculars
Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled around the figure in the ski mask
They slowly shuffle toward the Explorer
McCall watches intently
- sniper watches through his scope
Finger poised on the trigger
Low visibility through the haze
The figure in the ski mask wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs
The sniper tries to lock him in
- '  -  - The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches a glimpse of the hostage right behind him
Roper recognizes him instantly
It's Korda
McCall sees him now, too
They switched clothes
Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio
(urgently) Hold your fire
Hold your fire
Too late
rings out
The figure in the ski mask goes down, hit by the bullet
Shit
Where'd that shot come from
Hold your fire
More  ring out
The white vapor cloud swirls
The hostages, spattered with blood, scream and scatter
The figure in the ski mask lies dead on the sidewalk
Korda, dressed in the manager's three piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and his gun in the other  back at the snipers
He grabs salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer
Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages
He's got the girl
Damnit
As Roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on Solis' desk
(grabbing the keys; to Solis) Are these yours
Yeah, they are but
(to McCall) Come on
As Roper and McCall move toward the door
Roper, what are you going to do
Don't take my
And Roper and McCall are gone
car
Police come rushing onto the street
Guns drawn
The Explorer off down the block
Roper and McCall burst out of the command center building, leap into Solis' Cadillac and tear off after the van
McCall is behind the wheel
Sequence omitted from original script
- The Explorer comes barreling toward it
Spectators scatter
Two squad cars  up behind the barricades, trying to block Korda's escape
The Explorer  through the metal barricades
the squad cars out of the way
And screams off around the corner
Sequence omitted from original script

No one on his tail
At first
Then the Cadillac comes speeding up behind
- Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead
Roper picks up the radio
Suspect heading west on Sutter now passing Jones
Can we get an intercept
voice comes back
(
) -32-David
We are proceeding south on Hyde
Will intercept
- Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view mirror
The Cadillac is making up ground
a squad car  into the intersection and smokes to a stop
Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a  right turn and heads up the hill
- The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van
Brakes , it swerves around the corner in pursuit
hits the top of the hill and goes airborne
back down to the pavement
- Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill
The salesgirl is beyond petrified
reaches the top of the hill
Going fast
As it rocks forward violently
Front bumper slamming against the pavement
McCall sees the van ahead
Hammers the accelerator
No fear
Korda sees traffic ahead
Intersection jammed
He pulls a hard left
cuts straight across the corner
up on the sidewalk
shears a mailbox
a row of newspaper machines fly through the air
The van speeds off down a one-way street
arrives at the intersection a few seconds later
Intersection still jammed
People now standing on the corner gawking at the damage
The Caddy  to a stop
McCall The people scatter
The Cadillac drives through the corner
Wrong way down a one-way street
Cars coming right at us in every angle
Frantic
Salesgirl
Tires No way to avoid collision
Except Korda pulls a left an instant before impact
The van speeds back up the hill
Down the same one way street
Comes up on the head-on traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near collision with Korda
- The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill
Korda, checking the rear view mirror
The Caddy is a short distance behind
Attention still focused behind, Korda enters an intersection, running a red light
-
Korda stiffens
Pulls on the wheel The van swerves
But not quick enough
metal
glass
The van rolls over another car
- Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a dizzying roll
and  back down to the street upside down
After a beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of jewels
The salesgirl does not emerge
He spots a cable car reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend
He heads toward it
As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the passengers view him uneasily
hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to see Korda leap onto the moving cable car
other passengers give Korda room
They can sense that he is not here merely for the ride
Korda looks out the back
Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him
The Cadillac is making up ground on the cable car
Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and  off a couple of shots at the Caddy
bullet fractures the windshield
McCall swerves
That makes up the minds of many of the passenger
They leap off the cable car
Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and
The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off the cable car
Almost works
but Korda is able to hang on by one hand
He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him
Korda shoots him in the back
The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the brake lever, releasing it more
The brakes are stressed
Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed
Broadsides a car
Pushing it into parked cars
Korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around
towards us
Filling the
Shows the cable car leaving the wreckage in its wake
It passes the smashed car
McCall looks at the speedometer as he paces the cable car
It's going at 45 mph
What the fuck is going on
don't know, but 've got to get on there
You're crazy
Pull up alongside
The cable car barrels through
Plows into two cross-traffic cars
Knocks them aside
Keeps picking up speed
Weaves through the wreckage
Makes up ground on the cable car, trying to pull alongside
For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy
His attention is now focused downhill as
' The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off to the side
dodges the spinning car
Jumps up onto the sidewalk
Mows down parking meters
Jumps back onto the street
Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy
Another jammed intersection up ahead
He sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror
He bails out
into the back of the car
Major impact
Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor
- Tumbles down the hill
Hits a car coming uphill and rolls into a parked car
Speeds up alongside the cable car
Roper climbs over the windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car
Korda sees him coming
Roper dives out the other side of the cable car
Roper hanging off the side
He gets his gun out of his holster
Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb
Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of the cable car
As he does his gun is raked out of his hand by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter
Korda aims as Roper re-enters
As it  into the back of a car turning left
Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car
Korda's gun goes flying
Roper dives on top of him
They trade punches
McCall is in b
g
with the Caddy pacing the cable car
Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks through
Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness
Outside McCall is honking and yelling like crazy
Roper looks over
McCall points ahead
' The cable car
Leaps to the brake lever
Pulls on it
The clamp tries to slow the descent
It whine and smokes
Then disintegrates before our eyes
Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands
The cable car is speeding toward the end of the line
No way to stop it
Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy
He lands in the passenger seat
Roper pounds his foot down on the accelerator
The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car
McCall can't figure out what he's doing
Roper yanks the steering wheel hard right
The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car
Tires The steel wheels
cloud of burning rubber forms
The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac
But it's working
The cable car is slowing
The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on them
General hysteria as they flee
Korda regains consciousness
Sees what's going on
He grabs the satchel and bails out of the cable car
Onto the hood of a passing taxi
The taxi slams on its brakes
Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs into an underground garage
Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line
Roper grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy to pursue Korda
People approach to ogle the two vehicles in astonishment
- Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position
He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure
He glides up the stairway to the third level
Checks back over the rail
No one around
Then a sound from inside the garage
Footsteps maybe
Roper carefully opens the door
Swings in with his gun
- Lots of cars, but no one in sight
Roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars
He crouches down
Scans beneath the cars
No sign of Korda
Roper searches between two rows
Comes up beside a van
Thinks he hears something stirring inside
Whirls a gun toward the window
dog lunges at the
Snarling
baring teeth
Roper moves on
As a  crawls through the parking structure
Roper steps into the , right into its path, gun visible
The rolls to a stop
Roper approaches with caution
Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 year old blonde
Roper takes a check out of the backseat
Sorry, go
The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas
She drives off
Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan
He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might have escaped
He heads toward the exit
Suddenly a  of tires
Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him
He drives and
Bullets shatter the windshield
The car continues toward Roper
He has to roll out of the path of the car
The car swerves past Roper
Tries to make it down the ramp
Roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire
The car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level
Roper runs after it
- 2ND As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and piles into a parked car
Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels
Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck
Roper moves to him with a face grim as death
He strips the satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car door
Korda goes to his knees
Roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between Korda's eyes
Give me one reason why  shouldn't kill you right here
Korda stares back at Roper defiantly
He knows a cop won't kill him in cold blood
What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about those rules at this moment
You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine
He had a wife
and he had a daughter
Korda stares past the barrel of the gun
don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends
And that makes Roper even angrier
But he keeps it all inside
His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night
He yanks back hard on Korda's hair
Pushes the gun tighter against Korda's forehead
He's on the verge of executing this guy
You can't kill me like this
What if you and me got into a struggle
and my gun went off
In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a
Could  kill you then
(beat, beat) Could  kill you then
Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin
pull of the trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull
And now Korda is fully convinced
He squeezes his eyes closed
Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst out of his skin
- moving across garage into position
Roper
Put it down
Put it down man, we got him
(beat) Come on
Put it down
Long, long beat
Roper eases up and Korda smiles
Just when we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls his head back and shoves the gun in his face
We do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling
Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood
Roper walks away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda
Sequence omitted from original script
- Roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork
group of reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining the squadroom
One of them is Ronnie
Through the glass walls, she notices Roper sitting alone at the computer
She bids good-night to the reporters and comes into the squadroom
You weren't at the press conference
Roper keeps tapping away at the computer
wanted to get this out of the way
You got a bet on the game tonight
As a matter of fact,  do
She nods knowingly
It's already started
was going to catch the last half on
Ronnie watches him for a moment
He stops typing, looks at her and smiles
She suddenly becomes self-conscious
Guess it was something she was thinking
Good-night
She turns abruptly to leave
Roper finds himself rising from his chair
You having dinner with Mr
Baseball
She turns back around
Greg is on a road trip
was just going to make some pasta
He takes a few steps toward
That kind with the garlic and the oil that  like so much
No
The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese
've been craving that stuff all week
And it's hard to get
He looks at her innocently
Just dinner
Sequence omitted from original script
- Ronnie is making macaroni
Roper helps to prepare a dressing to go with the salad
He is mixing oil, vinegar, sugar and spices
He lets her have a taste
What do you think
Mmm, needs a little something
What are you talking about
This is it
This is the stuff right here
(beat; he tastes) Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar
Yeah that's it
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up
(laughing) Scottie
There is a long pause as he looks at her
What would you say if  quit gambling
Ronnie stirs the macaroni
'd say you'd be miserable
It's not the gambling
It's what the gambling got in the way of
The track is where you'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me
Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni
There is a beat before she continues
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square
You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love
But  didn't even know what happened
'til  heard it on the news the next morning
It's because  wanted to keep you away from that world
It's not that world
It's your world
It's part of who you are
(beat) Veronica, it's not easy for me don't know if  can change overnight
But what 'm telling you is that want to share everything with you, because  don't ever want to be without you again
The dog yawns
They laugh
Roper moves closer to her
He kisses her and she responds
'  - The lovemaking is over
Roper is gazing at the ceiling, thinking
Ronnie is cuddled around him
comfortable moment
What about Greg
What are you gonna tell him
It's okay
We broke up
(surprised) When
Just now
- Clarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass wall
He's edgy, fidgety
Clarence doesn't like to make visits to jail
Korda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard
Korda takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and picks up the receiver
Clarence picks up his receiver
How ya doin', man
Korda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the wall
You gotta do something for me
this fucker, Roper, he's gotta girlfriend
She works at the newspaper
want you to take care of her
Clarence is totally unnerved by this request
Hey, Michael, that's not my thing
Korda glares at him murderously
You gotta do this for me
'm in here because of you
Man, what's this about
Ya know, you were robbing a store
It wasn't personal
It was his job
(exploding) Fuck you
You know what he did to me
Korda starts to draw the attention of the guard
He controls himself, lowers his voice
But the viciousness is still there
He held a gun to my head and said he should kill me right then
He made me
He doesn't finish that thought
You do this for me Clarence
Clarence is getting very upset
Don't make do it, Mike
Are you going to turn on me too
Who helped you when you were strung out
Who gave you money
Who bailed you out of jail
won't get away with it
Nobody knows who you are
Make it look like a robbery
Clarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to have to do this
'  - gray San Francisco evening
It starts to rain
'  - She's cooking some kind of sauce
She has a taste
'  - subjective  watching through the window as she moves around the kitchen
- Ronnie pours some oil in a pan
The phone
She crosses the kitchen to answer it
- Roper on his cell phone
Paco is on the seat beside him
Hi, 'm going to stop at the corner for some wine
Roper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper switch
'  - How's Paco doing
- He was going nuts at the park
He met this very attractive poodle
They made plans to meet again next weekend
Paco sits there panting
Roper pulls the pickup over in front of the store
- Okay, dinner will be ready when you get here
She hangs up
'  - Through the window we watch her cross back to the stove
- Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce
Stirs
It spatters on her blouse
She regards the stain with dismay
Puts the lid back on and leaves the kitchen
- Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the
- She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door
throws it open
She looks around
Something's not right
She takes a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner
She puts the soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a hanger
She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to
- Dark
She turns on the light
She goes to the mirrored medicine cabinet
Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so slightly
She opens the medicine cabinet
Takes out some perfume
Dabs some on her neck
She puts back the bottle and closes the cabinet
We fully expect someone to be standing right behind her in the reflection
There's no one there
She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom
- Ronnie walks back to the kitchen
Notices something on the floor further down the hallway
What is it
She moves closer
And now we get to the  that tells us someone is in the house
Watching her through a cracked doorway
hand opening a buck knife
Water drips from the fingers
Ronnie bends down
It's a wet spot
Like half a shoeprint
She reaches down to touch it
The oven timer
She hurries back to the kitchen
'  - She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the oven
She puts it down on the counter and cross to the refrigerator
She opens the door and looks inside
The refrigerator door obscures half the
She digs around for something
We're sure that when she closes the door, he's going to be behind it
She takes out a head of lettuce and
Closes the door
Still no one there
She turns
Clarence is standing there
Dripping wet
Ronnie shrieks
The knife flashes forward
She grabs the lid from the sauce pan and
Fends off the blade
She bolts for the hallway
Clarence grabs her by the blouse
She pulls away
She races down the hall
Clarence lunges into
She goes down
He goes down
the knife goes skidding down the hallway
Ronnie scrambles to get it
Clarence has her by the ankle
She claws for the knife
Just out of reach
'  - Roper's pickup pulls up in front
He gets out
Paco jumps out behind him
It's raining harder
They hurry up the walkway toward the house
Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine
He goes back to the truck
Paco pads after him
Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the wine
He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check himself in the window
Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front bay windows
It  and
Still plugged in, it bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house
and
Roper rushes toward the house
Crashes through the front door
Up the stairway
Paco bounds after him
Roper hits her front door running
Wham
He bounces off
He shoulders it again
The door doesn't give
He pulls out his gun
Shoots off the lock

- of Clarence's hand grabbing the knife
- Roper kicks open the door
Charges in
'   - Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air
Choke marks around her throat
Roper rushes to her side
Paco is on his heels
You okay
She nods
Points out the back way
(to Paco) Stay
The dog obediently stays with Ronnie
Roper dashes out the back
' - Raining more heavily now
Roper bursts out onto the back porch
Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire escape to the alley
Roper flies down the fire escape
Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence
- Clarence sprints down the block
Through the intersection
car barely misses him
It does a one-eighty on the rain-slick pavement
Clarence disappears into the shadows
Roper arrives a beat later
Streaks through the intersection
Into the shadows
- This one is steep
Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors
He shoots into a doorway
Tries the door
Locked
He looks back
Roper is coming
Relentless
He rushes across the steep street
Almost slips on the reflective asphalt
Roper spots him crossing and picks up the pace
He can see that Clarence is faltering
Clarence staggers into an alleyway
- Narrow, dark and dripping with rain
Roper arrives at the mouth of the alley
Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes adjusting to the darkness
The  of rain off the rooftops
His
No other sound
He reaches the end of the alley
brick wall
No way out
Or so it would seem
However, Clarence is nowhere in sight
Roper turns back
Brick walls tower on both sides, rising into darkness
Roper checks a steel door
Locked
He checks another one on the opposite side of the alley
Also locked
Where did Clarence go
He moves back toward the misting light of the street
Slowly
The   of a fire escape
And Clarence leaps down out of the shadow
Slashing with the knife
He catches Roper across the arm
Rips through his clothes right down to the skin
Roper's gun under a parked car and into the street
Clarence has first jump
He scrambles into the street, around the car and grabs the gun
Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence down before he can aim
They roll into the middle of the street
Both have a death grip on the weapon
Clarence fights like a trapped animal
Thrashing desperately
Roper pins him on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers
Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill
Coming quickly
Roper sees this
He rolls out of the way, abandoning the battle for the gun
Clarence struggles to his knees
Turns the weapon on Roper
speeding cab lunges over the top of the hill
Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights
Tires squeal
Brakes lock
Clarence is transfixed
He's launched through the air like a ragdoll
His body lands limply 30 feet down the street
The  gets out of his vehicle
Jesus Christ
What was he doing
Roper walks down the hill to the body
The cabby follows
There was no way  could miss him
Roper ignores the cabby
He looks down at Clarence's body, contemplating something
This isn't my fault
Shut the fuck up
The cabby immediately clams up
Get on your radio and get the police here
Roper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed
- Korda is led in again
An expression of surprise registers on his face when he sees who's waiting for him
' Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall
Dons a smug expression and takes a seat
He picks up his receiver as Roper picks up his
If you try again to hurt me or anyone know, 'm going to have you killed
Korda feigns total innocence
What in the world are you talking about, Mr
Roper
Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the glass
Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence
That gentleman standing over him is the coroner
Korda's face tightens
He drops the innocent act
His countenance is now a study in hate
used to have an apartment, a car, jewelry
had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch
Now look what have
He motions around
You're threatening me
You think give a fuck
You think you can scare me off
(a laugh) Why don't you come in here and kick my ass
Get some of your guard friends in here to help
'd like that
Roper glares at him mounting rage
(smirking) He really shook you up, didn't he
've got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you
Who knows
Maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality
Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless
You came here to threaten me
That's a laugh
Maybe you should  me
Go ahead
Get down on your knees
Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against the plexiglass wall
You motherfucker,  swear 'll kill you
The guard rushes over and restrains Roper
Wrestles him away from the glass wall
Roper pushes him off and gathers himself
He gives Korda one last stare
Korda sits there smirking back at him
Roper turns his back and walks out
'  - McCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror
'm here to help you
Not quite right
He adjusts his stance
This time puts a little hand movement into it
'm here to help you
Talk to me
He's still not satisfied
Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Captain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking for McCall
We got a situation at the
Hospital
The responding officer has requested a negotiator
Where's Roper
He's on his way
Get over there
'   - wearing green fatigue is dangling another over the edge
Fourteen floors up
The two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space
#1 (rambling incoherently) can't fight this technology
They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments
've seen those places
Everyone is dressed in white
It's like paper clothing, man
They're not even human
Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped into the street 150 feet below
He is, needless to say, very panicky
#2 Dave, don't do this, bro
Pull me in
We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way
But he's not getting through to his friend
#1 can't help this, man
Do you have any idea what those microchips look like
How small they are when they put them in your brain
- Leading to the roof
and peek out at the vet as he continues to rant and rave
McCall arrives at the top of the stairs #4 sure looks happy to see him
McCall takes a peek out onto the roof
He isn't happy about what he sees
#4 When we got here, he was already doing his balancing act
was talking to him, but it made him more agitated so  backed off
Why is he up there
#4 Something about a microchip in his brain
Who is he
answers him
David Adler
He likes to be called Dave
The other guy is Walter Sinclair
We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair
(
) Somebody help me out here
Somebody stop him
The nurse turns to McCall
What are you waiting for
Another negotiator is on his way
We can't wait for another negotiator
You have to do something
What about the doctors
He hates all the doctors
He says they're in on the conspiracy
#1 (
) Where is everybody
He's going to kill me
McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof
- McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof
Clouds overhead threaten rain
Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the wheelchair
Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over
McCall's heart jumps into his mouth
Get the fuck out of here
McCall is tense and stiff
He stammers
'm Kevin
'm here to help you,
Dave
You can't help me, man
So much for McCall's opener
Now what
He's high on something, man
Give him some thorazine or something
Dave ignores Walter
No one can help me
They're controlling my mind
McCall moves a couple steps closer
Who's controlling your mind
Whoa
The government
They control everybody's mind
You're too fucking stupid to know that
McCall fumbles for the right response
This has nothing to do with Walter
They want Walter dead
- Cops keep spectators back from the building
Fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene
Everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building
- Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, eyes closed, praying
Dave, look at me
Dave obliges
He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity
McCall is momentarily frozen by those eyes
Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead
Tell me what's wrong
Particles, man
feel them all the time
feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me
How can  help you with the particles
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate
It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis
Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear
White knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then: (blurting out) They have less power over you if you look into my eyes
Huh
McCall even surprises himself with that one
It was a sheer act of desperation
He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is
Dave turns back around
Huh
- Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a halt
He leaps out and speaks to a
Whata ya got
Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair
Can you get a net out here
Negative
It's 14 floors up
No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up
- McCall nods slowly
Sweat pouring off him
We've been onto them for a long time
glimmer from Dave
Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit
Let me show you something
Now he's got Dave's interest
McCall slowly takes out his beeper
See this
'm jamming them, Dave
'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore
Don't you feel that
You don't have to do what they say
Dave listens to his head
He's jamming them, Dave
Pull me back in
You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore
Dave tries to feel for particles
Tears form in Dave's eyes
Tell my dad
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him
Tell my dad 'm sorry about the watch
'll tell him
Where does he live
We'll get him on the phone right now
Dave is suddenly lost in thought again
His expression turns to a frown: hate fucking Springfield
Is that where you're family lives
Then with sudden swiftness
still hear them, man
You can't jam them
They've got the technology, man
They've got the satellites, Jack
They keep shooting beams off those satellites
What power do have
Dave pushes the wheelchair forward
McCall  for the wheelchair but doesn't make it
Walter  as he falls
freefall down toward earth in
The wheelchair turns end over end
People  as Walter  with the pavement
The wheelchair  down nearby
Sequence omitted from original script
- McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below
Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands behind his back
The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out to restrain
- The crowd is dispersing
Roper is talking with some of the other cops
McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down the stairs
Roper moves toward him
McCall
No response
McCall gets into his  Sedan car and fires it up
McCall
Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car screeches away from the curb
- McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in the car with him
He drives
Stone-faced
Roper studies him for a beat
Where are we going
- Moving  thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign that says "Golden Gate Racetrack
" Establish grand stands
Sequence omitted from original script
- McCall pounds over to the betting window
Roper leans up against the window beside him
Watches
Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta
The six is scratched
This throws McCall for a beat
Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta
The teller punches out the ticket
McCall takes the ticket and pounds over to box seat area
Roper follows a couple of steps behind, giving him some space
- McCall sits down in the same box as the last time
Roper sits down next to him
- The horses go into the gate
- McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate
(The track announcer's call plays over the scene
) Come on four horse
Come on Seven horse
Roper isn't watching the horse
He's watching McCall
Watching him redirect all his pent up emotion
Understanding exactly how he feels
McCall is screaming his head off
Come on four-seven
Come on
Come on
Come on
The horses cross the wire
The four and seven finish mid- pack
McCall hangs his head in despair
He didn't give a shit about the race
He looks inconsolable
It might have happened no matter who was up there
Bullshit
Would it have happened to you
Maybe
There's one thing you have to remember
You don't create the situations
You can only try to save people from them
thought  could do it
was so damn sure of myself
But  didn't know what to say
The words wouldn't come
My mouth turned to mush
You make it look so easy, Roper
But it is not
It's not easy
(beat) It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope
That it is
long silent beat
How many have you lost
look at it as how many 've saved
That's the way you've got to look at it
And what about the ones you don't save
You live with it
and they haunt you
It doesn't leave
And what if you can't live with it
You've got to decide that for yourself
McCall squeezes his eyes closed
He can still see that vet falling to his death
Roper can see McCall's pain
've lost three
One of them was my partner
think about them every time  go into a situation
(a beat) There's a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads, and the bitch of this job is that we expect to go out every day and do the impossible -- to somehow control all this craziness
and we can't
(a beat) Nobody's faulting you for this, McCall
My advice is you let yourself off the hook
McCall hears him but is still undecided
don't know
don't know
Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his shoulder
Let's get out of here
McCall slowly gets up and they walk out
- It's a small interview room
Korda sits opposite bail bondsman (white, grizzled, forty)
What the fuck
You bring me all the way over here to tell me you've got no collateral
What do  look like to you -- Santa Claus
'm a bail bondsman
No, no, see what 'm sayin' is, 've got the -- Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake
You think  got time for this crap
Hey, hey,  got shit on the outside
got somebody cashing it in for me and -- Hawkins gets up and goes to the door
Gimme a fuckin' break
Alright, alright, look, man, look, just leave me your card
can get it to you by tomorrow night
Hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat
Then pulls out his   and hands it to him
He walks out the door as we  on Korda -- pocketing the card
- Establishing shot
- - of a glass of wine being poured
to reveal Roper and Ronnie all dressed up for a special evening
The waiter hovers as Roper tastes the wine
(snootily) It has a nice "nose"
The special this evening is braised sweetbreads with a white truffle sauce on cracked bulgar
Roper looks at him a long beat
That's my favorite
(smiles) Why don't you give us a minute
The waiter retreats
Roper looks across the table at Ronnie as she sips her wine
You like this place
It's very nice
guess you realize that there's something special that  want to talk to you about
She didn't realize that
Now she's getting nervous
There is
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us
think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff
Now she's really worried
Yeah
Let me just show you
Roper reaches into his coat pocket
Scottie, we should think this over before we
He pulls out two airline tickets
Tahiti
Ronnie is immensely relieved
Ohhh
vacation
Yeah that sounds like a great idea
Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes what she was thinking
Oh you thought  was going to ask you
Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed
Oh, no-no-no-no-no
Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out
Roper picks up his menu and peruses it

He's on the phone
Got another load
#3 Rack 'em up
(into the phone) Look, man, if it doesn't make it down here by five it's not my problem
As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, zipped and tagged, onto an   -- similar to the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing
All done
Korda pushes a button and the trolley

The metal ridges of the trolley  into his fingers, drawing blood
Then he drops down, and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing
He tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles
He looks like he's about to go wading
As he rips them off and reaches for another pair

- The door closes behind him and locks with the loud  of metal
Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end, past the first  (guard #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass
- ' step by step
The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick glass
' trying to stay cool, his heart pounding
Then
(
) Hey
Korda , then slowly turns to
prison (#1) moving toward him
- Yeah
The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand
#1 You dropped your card
Korda takes   given to him by the bail bondsman
#1 You guys are the scum of the earth
Just tryin' to make a living
Korda turns and walks out the door into
- It's the final step before getting out of the building small room with another  (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, and several  monitors

#2 don't know what to tell you, mam, your brother ain't here
Try San Bruno
just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here
#2 'm sorry
Then  don't know where he is
Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his card
Listen, can  just sign outta here
What do you mean, you don't know where he is
You can't just lose somebody
#2 (to Korda) Who are you again
Johnny Hawkins
Bail Bonds
gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright
#2 Johnny who
(to Korda) Can you believe these people
It's the criminal justice system
What can  tell ya
It's a mess
The guard shoves the sheet under the glass
#2 Alright, alright, just sign
Korda signs the sheet
The guard pushes a button
The metal lock , and the door  open
Korda takes his card and sticks it in the woman's coat pocket
If you find him, gimme a call
And Korda walks out
- It's a small parking area, with security gates on either end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky
There are three or four  parked against the wall
Korda checks inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none
Then the second, and the third until
(
) Hey
Korda turns sharply to find the   (guard #2), holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him
#2 Hold on a second here
Is there a problem
The guard walks up to him
They're standing between the cars
#2 You signed out twice
what
#2 Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second
Wait a minute, lemme see that
As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the from his own clipboard
Well, that's funny,  wonder how that happened
In a flash, Korda  the pen  into the guard's throat
The  jumps out of his throat, onto the window of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps to ground
He then falls backward between the two cars, drowning in his own blood

How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy
In Europe women find older men very sexy
Roper closes the door

He's probably starving

Her voice trails off
He can see she's worried now, too
Hey, 'm on edge a little
Let's relax

Anyway we leave tomorrow
He puts his arms around her waist
Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff
She puts her arms around his shoulders

Use your imagination

The light goes out

McCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck
You sure you packed everything
Maybe you forgot your bowling ball
Ronnie stands on the doorstep

Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree
Roper calls to Ronnie from the stairway
(
) Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie

It's better if you stay inside
She climbs up the stairs toward him
You've got to calm down -- Sequence omitted from original script

Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go
Time to get movin'

There's no response

She doesn't answer
He calls out again, moving through the living room
(continuing) Ronnie, where are you
Time to go
No answer, the room is very quiet
Roper eases his out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking out the bathroom, bedroom

If  take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her
So what do you want to do
That's a chance  gotta take
Then we better get moving
But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence

On the other side is , the property sergeant on duty
The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones
Scott, we go back a long way but you can't expect me to do this
Frank, this guy is a psychopath and he's got Ronnie
It's the only way 'm going to get close to him
Then go to the Lieutenant or the with it, for Christsakes

Good question
Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of the pickup, in the bed a loose
He and McCall study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other

At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup approaches the gate

Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is his voice coming from

McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, lowering himself to the ground
Quickly he moves the he was wearing, burned by contact with the hot exhaust pipe
Reaches the the chained area,  an empty  , easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long
At the bottom of the dry dock is a  , the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice

To his far right is a building, a  reading: 36
He clutches the satchel, heading towards it
-  - McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between buildings
He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof tops and buildings for the sniper's position
He sees it, across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper is now walking
He heads out
- Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the roof tops of the buildings around him
(to himself) Where the hell are you, McCall
As Roper passes a set of partially open   to the glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's  from within: (
) Right there, Roper
Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away
Shit
Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors
(
) Come on in, there's someone just dying to see you
Roper hesitates
He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching
(loudly) Where are you
- : Focusing on Roper, his lips moving
McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the glass fronted building
Right here, Scott
He touches the   attachment to his scope, a red beam activated
- From inside the building Korda's : (
) Get your ass in here, Roper
Just as Roper starts to move he  the red laser  on the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind him
Roper moves inside
- Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his , looking through the scope
: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the room cast in
He  to the windows, all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside
He   to the opening, Roper now just inside
Stay cool, real easy
- Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge ,  and once used in the design of nuclear submarines
Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's position
Where is she, Korda

From the darkness beyond
Walk to the table
Roper walks to a steel

) (continuing) Open your shirt
'm not wearing a wire
This is just between you and me

) Shut the fuck up and do what  say
Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding it open
Satisfied
(
) Open the bag, dump everything on the table
Roper opens the bag, the  and the dozens of spill out onto the table
He lays the satchel on its side, the bottom facing Roper
Taped to the bottom is a short barreled

It's all there

) Spread it out
Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table
Only the jewels, Korda, you've got my word

(
) Show me something
Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of ' Palmed in his hand, the  containing Ronnie's diamond
Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the between his fingers, still holding the palmed envelope
He starts to toss the envelope in his fingers
(
) (continuing) Not that one
Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving over the pile
(continuing) Right there, the one in front
yeah, that one
Toss it
Roper reaches for the envelope
' As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda indicated
He tosses it across the room
From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up long beat
(
) (continuing) 'm impressed
didn't think you could do it
What did you have to do, steal them
Yeah
(
) (wry) That's not going to look too good on your service record
'll worry about that
Let's get on with it
Korda  as he slowly emerges from the darkness
My sentiments exactly
'   - On the floor he  a shadow cast - Korda
He moves to the windows
inside the vague, blurred  of a man
His scope goes back to the satchel and the
45 taped to the bottom
Wait for the right moment, Scott

Fill it up
Just in case there's a homing device in the other one
Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the
45 on the bottom of the satchel
(continuing) Now bring it over here
Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for time, he moves forward
'  - Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the gun
Oh, shit
He moves the  ahead of Roper,  Korda's shadow cast on the floor, still unable to see him
(continuing) All right, Scott, bring him out
- Roper growing closer to Korda's position
That's far enough
Bag on the floor
Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' in there -- all he has to bargain with

Oh, shit, in all the excitement almost forgot
She right here

Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle
Some distance from her body a   is positioned over the lathe bed

Be cool, Ronnie, 'm gonna get you out of this

No shit, this  gotta see
Korda swings into position a  , the buttons held down with
Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to , very slowly, the cutting device activated
if the table keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade
( : Lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie
Korda presses the  , the lathe stopping
He releases his finger again, the lathe turning
He stops it
We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point
(continuing) Fuckin' cool, huh
rewired the switch
You see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut
He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting device
He stops it again, holding the button
(continuing; grins) Right in half
He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control box, holding the button down
'  - Through the , he can see Korda as he steps into view
The  settle on Korda's upper forehead
Hold it right there
His finger tightens on the trigger
- Korda holds the control box towards Roper
But then, that's not my problem
He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda grinning at Roper

) Light's out, fucker
And then Roper's  fills the scope, the red dot on the back of his head
In shock, McCall releases his finger
Jesus
- Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button, stopping the lathe
You see, it's out of my hands
Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his hands
Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Through the , Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda
Roper, move
- But Korda bends down, picking up the , stepping back away from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire
Well, hate to run but 've got a plane to catch
You take good care of the little lady, hear
As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, we now  a  parked near the end facing us
Korda suddenly stops, turning, gesturing to the car
(continuing) How careless of me
You see, there's only one way out of here, and you're standing right in the way
(grins) You could move, but then
He shakes his head at Roper
(continuing) Sure hate to be in your shoes
He turns, walking quickly towards his car, , , to himself
Roper looks to the car, then back at the  where the 45 is still taped to the bottom
But Roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two
He looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button
'  - He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else
What the hell's going on
- Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside,  it up
In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns, calling out
McCall, stop him, stop the car
Korda  the engine
'  - McCall reading Roper's lips
What car
He swings the  up but the back of the machine shop is blocked by his vantage point
Then he  the faint  of tires
He lowers his scope, holding, waiting
- Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to accelerate
Turns toward McCall's position
McCall
The  now screaming down the long corridor
'  - McCall still can't see the car
- The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground
McCall, shoot the son of a bitch
'  - Korda bearing down on Roper
Bye, bye, cop
Holding his position, eyes widening in fear
'   - The  comes into view, the  on the windshield
but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda
McCall takes aim and
'  - The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left shoulder,  flying
Korda whips the wheel in shock
-  ' Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with , sending them flying
But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards Roper, who can't move
; who won't move
The car flies past him, the   catching Roper's shirt, tearing it, a flash of  from his arm
The car then collides with a series of  crossing the floor,  erupting in every direction as the car then slams into several   stacked near the benches, a series of  ripping through the building
Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button, as
Hits the -
'  - The  explodes from the building,  , the car rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, driver's side away from McCall's position
- On the floor, recovering
He catches a quick glimpse of the bottom section of the lathe, a , the gears turning
Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie
Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the button
nothing happens, the lathe still turning, coming out of the box, it's
Only a few more seconds
Desperately his eyes search the floor,  a
He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the  in the gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush the wrench
Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her
Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat longer
Pulls the last of the restraints away
Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table turning
The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper hauls her away, holding her in his arms
-  ' Korda is slumped over the wheel
He looks dead
McCall slings his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a attached to the side of the building
- Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning lathe
Scottie, Scottie
It's all over, babe, it's all over
- McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but
' Korda is not quite dead
The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one hand,  in the other
He looks up,  McCall
He  , McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as hit the wall around him
McCall whips out his ,  , a ensuing
- the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, keeping her low to the ground
Stay here, don't move
Scottie
Do it
He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then crouching low to the floor, recovers the
45 from the bottom of the satchel
He heads out towards the other side of the cavernous, machine-choked building
- a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, runs from his cover into the opening
Leaps up and , McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking him to the ground
The  to Korda's  has kicked open, out of bullets
He drops the gun, picks up the  and runs alongside the machine shop
Exits the machine shop,  McCall on the ground, Korda nowhere in sight
Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping to his side
McCall, you all right
(in pain) 'm okay
Korda
went down the side of the building
Stay put
Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the other end
Roper charges on
-  - Korda runs past the building, still clutching the
He runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock area and Roper's pickup
moment later Roper emerges from the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner of the next building
Clearing the building sees Roper's
He runs to it, jumping inside, finding the  in the ignition
He starts the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view
With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and , two bullet holes in the front , missing Korda, the truck still speeding towards him
Roper's gun jams
Roper leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper blades for support, his  flying from his hand
Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging on for dear life
(shouting) Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing
Nothing but a bag of shit
It's all fake
Korda can't help but look at the   beside him
(continuing) Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it
It's all shit
hundred dollars worth of glass
Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the
He can't believe it, it's all fake
You fuck
Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on
Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, flying, then smashes into , , anything he can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles
Then Korda  ahead a huge pile of ,  , , , stacked at the side of a building
He hammers the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the pile
, , ,  flying everywhere, through the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with his arm as  fly around in a mad flurry inside the cab
In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck along with , , and
Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone
He hysterically
he knocked him off
Leaning out the passenger's side  they are approaching the dry dock area
In the bed of the truck, along with the ,  and other objects, he sees several long 2x4's
Grabbing a he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, past the dash and catching the tip of the  , pinning it to the floor
As Roper releases the board it  inside the door frame, locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine wide open
Korda reacts in panic
Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the looming towards them
He prepares to jump
Suddenly  the approaching dry dock
He jams on the brakes, but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge
Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes airborne
The truck plummets towards the bottom
Lands in a huge pile of   and  , piled near the edge of the dry dock
in wide-eyed terror as
Hits the bottom of the dock,  into flames
: - Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking from coconuts with umbrellas in them
've never seen sea so blue
Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie
Yeah,  could get used to this Paradise shit
Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests
(to waitress) 'll have another Pena Colada
And this time could you shave the ice, please
Oui, Monsieur
Right away
Roper stretches back into his chaise lounge, adjusting his Ray Bans
purring cat without a care in the world
Scottie
Hmm

Hmm
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they
(sensing something's up) Yeah
You've changed you know

Uh-oh
He removes his shades to get a better look at the curve ball

(here it comes) There's something special  want to talk to you about
(he's listening) think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship
(pointedly) deeper level
(no longer relaxed, sitting up) deeper level
That's right
We've got to bare it all
Here and now
'Cause  think 'm finally ready to go for it
(cutting her off at the pass) Whoa
Wait a minute, Ronnie
Hold on

The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you
But we've got to keep our perspective here
This place isn't real

You're a prude, Roper

No way
Over her laughter we
