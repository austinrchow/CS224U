Jason York has been relieved of duty for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John Curtis
Key testimony against York came from Det

Green, but eager to prove himself
After a long beat
Do you have a warrant

need to speak to you, Quentin
There's where your shit out of luck because  don't need to speak to you
It's important
Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares
Conners finally relents
Jenkins and Dekker enter
Dekker notices - Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker
Huh
You don't look like much of a Detective
Funny
was going to say the same about you
Charming
Shane just transferred in from Tacoma
His father
Save your breath
really don't care
Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a , , 20s, emerges,
The men  as the Woman,    , retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to the bedroom
No words spoken at all
After the moment has passed
Why don't we can the chit-chat
Get to what's on your mind
We've got a hostage situation, American National Bank
The sonsabitches said they wouldn't talk to anyone but you
No shit
15, 2004            11
No shit
need you to do this
Why should
Because people's lives are at stake
That takes priority over your ego
(to Jenkins; re: Dekker) You may want to put a leash on him
(beat; thinks) Saying  did want to help
'm still suspended or did that slip your mind
The commissioner's office has ordered me to reinstate you
As of now, you're back on the force
Just like that
Just like that
(beat) won't, however, unleash you alone
Always a catch
Shane, here, is your new partner
Consider him a younger version of me, looking over your shoulder, watching every move you make
The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners
Don't think  endorse this
If it were my call, you'd be with your partner
You mean ex-partner
On the unemployment line with him
For a moment there,  thought you cared

Callo looks on, the  boiling inside of him
Teddy, Vincent
(completely ignores Callo) Nice to see you both
Conners has been reinstated to full active duty
It's his scene
This info comes as a surprise
Especially to Callo
The last hostage situation this guy headed, an innocent civilian died
was not responsible
You never are
That girl would be alive today if it weren't for your cowboy antics
You destroy lives
Fuck you
Look who's talking about destroying lives
Decision's been made, Bernie

Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away
He motions for Dekker to walk with him
Anything questionable happens today, you let me know
Yes, Captain
Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins
Looks like you got yourself a baby- sitter

And their only demand has been to speak with you

Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation
Who am  speaking with
For now
You can call me Lorenz
Dekker writes, "Lorenz
" Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there
Can we get you anything
Food, medical supplies
We heard an explosion
Everyone who matters is fine
Of course, would've preferred not having the authorities involved at all
We weren't planning to be here this long
But, since Seattle's finest needs a presence on the scene, 'm glad it's you

My fame proceeds me
Don't be flattered

Hopefully this time it will go better for all involved

was, but 'm back
You're information's old
You never get what you pay for
(back to business) You want to know about the hostages
How many and are they okay
Dekker scribbles, "Pro"
Yes
Approximately forty, they're fine, considering
All except one
We had a situation
Someone's dead
Theory
put to practice isn't always perfect
Can't expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may
randomly decide to revolt
Chaos
has some order to it
(Conners drifts in thought) Detective
Are you still with me
Teddy  her fingers
That gets Conners attention
There's a new intensity to his demeanor
What else will  be looking for
15, 2004          17
Demands
Probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home
Safe to say
Stay by the phone
'll contact you shortly
Lorenz
Don't worry,  have no plans until sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down
It's going to be a long one
Wait, we're talking here
Patience, Detective
We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we
Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge
Lorenz abruptly
He's off

We've been told Detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank
Whether any specific demands have been made, we cannot confirm
As soon as we know something, we'll pass it on to you

He's not picking up
(stern) Try again
Dax, humbled, does as ordered
(glances about) Where's our fearless Captain
Went uptown to brief the Commissioner
So you're here in his place
Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth
Teddy notices
Nicotine gum
(shock) You quit smoking
Caffeine, too, if you must know
(Another shock) What
man's capable of change
man, yes
You
'm not so sure

Don't worry,  still have a vice or two
Fifteen rings
No answer
Try again in five
What are they doing in there
Wasting our time
Time
The word rings in Conners's head
He starts to put it together
Precisely
He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct
He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before
He's heavily armed and well-connected
He knows he's surrounded
He hasn't asked for a damned thing
He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait
He's buying time
Why
(brainstorming) To figure out his next move
He wasn't expecting us
No, he wasn't expecting you
He said, he thought you were still suspended
Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me
Giving him the time he needs
He's stalling
He almost has what he came for
Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time
15, 2004       20
Or
he's got what he came for and he's waiting for his ticket out of here
(the decision) We're going in
What
The bank has three points of entry
Teddy and Vincent, take a  Team, head to the West side
We'll have the Commander take the East
Dekker, you're with me
Where is the Commander
'll find him
Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy
(to Conners; concern) That's a big call, Quentin
Thought about what you're doing
You questioning me, Teddy
Unfortunately
yeah
question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror
'm not going to get into this now
And you're one to talk
hear
(interrupting) The hostages are in imminent danger
They've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge - that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them
So why keep witnesses around to testify
Longer we wait, the greater the risk
We need to go in
Now
15, 2004             21
(beat; then relents) Okay
Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory
Vincent arrives with the  , 40's, a former Navy  with a "Don't  with me" attitude
got snipers up top and ten soldiers on the ground
What's the best way in
Tear gas, blow the doors
Hold on
No explosives
got forty civilians in there, too great a chance
Any other way
There's no pussy way in
The doors are locked electronically from the inside
We ain't getting in without force
(beat; thinks) What if we cut the power
That will disable the system and we can open the locks manually, come in that way
(thinks; concedes) That'll work
So we'll take the pussy way, Commander
We cut the power and go in at 11:15 sharp

It will be over before that
Commander, your men in position
Standing by
will call for the power to be cut

Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the wealthiest and least popular Arabs in the Middle East
There's been countless threats on his life and fortune in the past
But for better of worse
he is an ally to the United States
The Prince keeps a safe deposit box in twenty institutions () 15, 2004     32
(cont'd) across the country
Along with this bank, he also had a box at Eastern Federal Savings in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was hit last month
Same
What was in the box
We don't keep records
The boxes are private
Since 9/11, we screen for live tissue, viruses or explosives, but if it passes those tests, we don't ask
This is all real fascinating shit, but what about the money
Bank robbers still like cash, don't they
The cash drawers don't appear touched
Neither does the cash vault
So they broke into a bank and didn't steal any money
Odd glances all about
We believe the Prince's box was the target
We're trying to reach him now
Thank you
Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave
Helluva come back, Conners
Are you familiar with the term franchise-sized fuck-up
Depends, are we talking about your sex life
Because 've heard shortcomings
You got played, Quentin
Congratulations, you just topped Pearl Street Bridge

Conners finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie
Dekker, all about work, goes over his notes
15, 2004             34
Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory in the 1960's
It's the study of phenomena that appear random, but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically
(confused) Try that again
Pretty much
initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together
The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check
Anything else, officers

Not much to be enthusiastic about
Conners reaches his limit
Time to put him in place
Listen, my reputation often proceeds me
You, however, have no reputation; a fact need to deal with
After you've been through the shit  have, then you can judge me

Those guys have been in lock up since and their trial's still pending
Which leads us to point number two
Do you smell that

When evidence is taken in, any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints, so, to mark it, we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill

Wave of the future
Gotta keep up with the times, Conners

Yeah
Fine
Then it's two phone calls 'll make

The second to children's services

It's simple

No one takes anything out of here, unless they sign for it
So what
He showed you a warrant
What
He must've
You don't remember
You know how many times someone signs shit in and out
see the same guys all the time
can't remember one instance two weeks ago

The money from Richards's place traced back to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago, a case Callo headed up
Callo signed the money out of evidence two weeks ago
How much
$433,000
If it's Callo, it would explain how they knew police protocol and how our department operates
Also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by Conners
He wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan
He doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me
What about motive
Do we have one
Pressure might've been getting to him
He's been getting the cold shoulder from cops since he testified about Pearl Street Bridge
No
Don't buy that
(beat) He was also getting divorced
This is news to everyone
15, 2004           53
About a month ago, he told me he and his wife might be splitting
Asked if knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him out
didn't think it was this bad
(conflicted) Bernie Callo is a first rate cop boy scout
This doesn't make any sense
They never do, Captain
Don't act like you're not enjoying this, Conners
know what you think of him
Doesn't matter what  think
Facts here speak for themselves
No they don't
We haven't asked the question
Why, if Callo's involved, don't they ask for him at the bank

What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things
Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with
You'd think a cop would be smarter
As cops we come across every temptation in the book
Money, drugs, power
We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but
We're not saints
So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it
Why
Man said he wanted vengeance

Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent have heard before, but don't care
Dekker watches the Detectives, admires in their closeness
Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about "returning to the beginning path" or something
It's a Buddhist story
We're all ears
One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil
So he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, 'm paraphrasing, but
this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged
He can talk to an elephant
He's the Buddha
He's attained the 6th level of consciousness
He's capable of communicating with plants, trees
even rocks
Rocks
You asked
15, 2004         61
Continue
The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer
So when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way
Or something like that
We have a genuine philosopher in our midst
You're a Buddhist
No
Just something  picked up along the way
But you're religious
Not particularly
Conners stares curiously at his new partner
Then excuses himself to go to the men's room
You're all pretty tight
We've been through a lot together
guess  just thought
don't know
With all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently
You can't believe what you read or see on
If anything, our tie to Conners is stronger
He's one of the best
Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control
That doesn't just happen
He's just that good
Excuse me

They didn't want the publicity so they didn't press charges
Couple years later, he was busted for looting the pension plans of retired cops
For a genius
he's a fucking moron
This was your case
You and York
You made the bust
Why didn't it stick
His lawyer put us on trial
Said we were crooked, abusive, that we planted evidence
We were in the midst of the Pearl Street Bridge fallout

He was scum

These are today's transaction records from the bank
An average day produces about 400 pages, give or take
Today, there were over 3,000 pages
Meaning
We've just witnessed the largest heist in history
Somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars
Come again
It's a computer virus
"The Computer Virus
" It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account
If you check the transactions, no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $100
Most security systems work on the size of the money, not number of transactions
Wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up
Wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts, no flags
Where's the money now
tried following one of the transactions
It took me an hour and when  finally had it
It went away
How is that possible
The virus created a host of phantom accounts where the money goes () 15, 2004             82
(cont'd) temporarily, then transfers to another account, then to another
It's never in one place long enough to get an accurate fix
It's still moving the money around
Yeah
Any deposit or withdrawal from any bank doesn't usually go into affect until the next business day
So it's going to keep jumping around until it clears at 9  tomorrow
(realizes) Or 6  Pacific time
Sunrise
So why break in
If they're just wiring money
Couldn't they do that from anywhere
That's the regional manager's computer terminal
There's no outside/remote access to it
There you have unlimited entry to the bank's mainframe
No passwords to work around, no "hacking" in
It's all nice and clean
billion dollars is missing and we're only discovering this now
Ironically, when the power went out, it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work
So they weren't trying to make   it look like they were robbing a bank,   to rip off a Saudi Prince
They were    making it look like they ripped off a   Saudi Prince to rob a bank
