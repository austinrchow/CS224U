href <b>// --> </b> The Deer Hunter -   - The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon across the winter sky
Fires can be seen flickering through the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of guyed metal flues
Steam rises in clouds from vents and chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted by the falling snow
In the foreground is a street --   -- which inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly down the hillside, straight at the mill
Columbine is a sad looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by the skin of its teeth
Dilapidated stores hug the narrow sidewalks
Battered signs squeak in the wind
Sandwiched between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the hillside are narrow Victorian houses
These houses, which run to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional aid from a leaning pole
-- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as we watch a car come charging up through the slush on Columbine Street
As it nears  the car falters on the slippery grade and slides out of sight
figure appears, huddled against the driving snow
The figure disappears : - white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and comes ripping down a track
Another ingot follows it, and another and another and another
The ingots are huge, trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying rumble
we see  catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs
The wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist
Warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet
Since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who are young, who seem to work with particular grace
These are ,  and
,
The noise is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed
Taking advantage of a slight pause jabs  and they both make cuckold's horns at
blushes and waves them off with his hand
and make the horns again and now  puts both hands on his hips, gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed and  begin laughing
can't hold out and he starts laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs
-  - very old  is making preparations for a wedding ceremony
'  hovers around him as he unlocks a cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which will be used in the service
The  moves with agonizing slowness and 's  is in the midst of a bad case of nerves
' It's all ready
Everything's ready
Yes
' Are you sure everything's ready
Are you positive
Everything
Yes
' It would snow
Everything's going to slip
Everything's going to slide
All the cars are going to crash
'  puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into tears
'  (') can't believe this
My own little boy
with a stranger
The  smiles
He takes '  in his arms and comforts her
- Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides back
As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses bursts open and a group of giggling  begin scampering across the street
They have all been working on their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material
As they make their way to the other side of the street they all wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support
One of the  loses her dress entirely and with everyone laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip
When the garment is repossessed a door comes open and the disappear inside
The snow slants across the little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little houses
Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides back
Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group of   emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a miniature bride and groom standing on the top
The  are all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats
They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow, with the great white cake held firmly between them
-   - The time clocks are lined against both walls
As a whistle screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin checking out
,  and  are right up in the front ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather together along the wall
Where's Vince
There's Albert
(calls) Hey, Albert
-- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox -- changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound How you feelin', Sal

Feeling hot
(arm around ) Humper's ready
Old humper's hotter'n damn hell
There's Vince
(calling) Vince
Over here
Vince
Get him, Albert
Get Vince

wades back into the stream of , grabs and they all push out together
-   - The snow is still falling
It covers the ground
It covers the acres of parked cars
It swirls and tosses and blows
As the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all stop dead in their tracks
Snow
Holy shit, snow

Something is going on is so excited he begins hopping around
(') Do you know what this means
Do you guys realize exactly what this means
They all know
They all know damn well
and exchange looks
chortles
What are you guys
Are you guys going hunting
The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet
They are all a little embarrassed

First we get you hitched

You know that

Damn right
What do you think, Sal
Jesus, you think we'd miss this
Now  is embarrassed
He makes a gesture with his hand
(with a laugh) 'mon
'mon you guys
They all start into the swirling snow
with an arm around
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need-- Yeah, Sal-- Willing fingers-- Extra feet
- The place is large and drafty and rundown
huge American flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling
Under it  are laying white table cloths on trestle tables
Off to one side a half dozen   wearing  hats are Scotch-taping paper ribbons to the brick wall
Two   are on stepladders, two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under the direction of a pair of World War   standing side by side
Their hands tremble
Their four eyes loom huge behind corrective lenses
1 Up  would say
What would you say
2 Up
1 (signals) Up ribbon
One end of the ribbon is moved up
The two  study it
2 Down  would say
What would you say
1 Down
2 (signals) Down ribbon
Suddenly there is a commotion
The  who are setting up the tables all rush to the door as the   come in with the wedding cake
The   look half-frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of Uhh's and Ahh's
Suddenly one of the collapses
Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and give her wine
The  takes the glass, tosses it off in one swallow and grins
laughs
-    - big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches, coming fast
- , , ,  and  are all laughing
is at the wheel
Hit it, Nick
Go Nick
Hit it, baby
- The car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade
We watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three quarter mark
- bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the slapping wipers
(chanting) Do it, Nick
Do it
Go Nick, Go
Do it
Do it, Nick
Go
The car fishtails, loses speed
to a creep
Back
All hands to the rear
and , who are sitting in front, immediately throw themselves into the back seat on top of  and
Easy
'At's it, easy
Easy, Nick
Easy
-    - The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground and skids to a stop
From inside comes a
'  -  - is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil
She is plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes
leans forward into a mirror
(sincerely) do
pause
scowls and tries it again
(') (heartfelt) do
tries it a few more times
It sounds worse and worse
(') do,  do,  do
stares at herself
Now she looks desperate and unrelievedly forlorn
Bursting into tears she throws herself on the bed
Someone has slipped a photograph under the pillow
The photograph is face down and as  pulls it out she sees that something is written on the back: (') (reading, slow) "This is it -- more or less
Love, Mom
" frowns, turns the photograph over
It is a picture of Michaelangelo's "David"
stares at the figure for a long, long moment
(') Oh, wow
'  - The place is packed with boisterous  drinking boilermakers
Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls
The murals depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret from the hunters, some power beyond their own
bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer
At the same moment  comes in with , ,  and , who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his tray, wraps his arms around  and begins jumping him around the floor, grinning ear to ear
The  turn, desert their places and swarm around , joking and shouting congratulations
'  -  - is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly lovely face
Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling
Thumping noises are coming from the room above
The thumping gets louder
There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were being thrown around
'  begins cursing and there is more thumping and crashing
Suddenly there is a thud
and then silence
bites her lip
She crosses to the stove, ladles stew into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it all on a tray
'  - '  - The room is a wreck of broken furniture
Chairs are turned over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the wall
In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is '
His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he holds a half-empty bottle in his hand
Behind him, through the open window, snow is blowing in
comes in with the tray
She stands for a moment expressionless, looking down at her father
Then she sets the tray on the bureau and kneels beside him
Daddy
(mumbles) Go
fucking hell
reaches down, takes her  by the shoulder and rolls him over
It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter
Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as  looks at him he begins cursing again
(') Fucking shit
all around, like a sea
Like an ocean
gets up and closes the window
She comes back, gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed
Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet
The effort is almost too much for her
Tears begin to burn in her eyes, but when he slips back she tries again
The father groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in the face and pushes her violently across the room
crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall
As she gets to her feet her father advances on her
(') Fucking bitch
All bitches
He swings, catches her in the face again, hard
Daddy
Daddy, it's me
Hate 'em
Fucking bitches
'  swings at her again, loses his balance and falls on the floor
stands looking at him, holding her jaw
She is crying
Tears are streaming down her face
-    - Seven , carrying their instruments, file silently through the falling snow
'  - The  are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging from grandmothers to young wives
About half of them wield rolling pins or heavy pans
As the last reinforcements arrive --      -- a roar of laughter comes from inside
'  - , , , ,  and  are dancing
The is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut with a knife
Suddenly, from the back, comes a The door to the alley bursts open and the     appear
The take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their heads in their hands and rush for the front door
'  -   - The  stream into the snow with the  close behind
Several blows are delivered and the howls of complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get dressed for Sal's wedding
, who emerges with  and
The snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop
Boy, this is it
This is really it
mean

'  hurries out of the alley
She is crying
' My beautiful boy
My angel
who is leaving his own mother
She throws herself in 's arms, sobbing
Momma
' So cold is your heart to leave your own mother
Momma, 'll be right upstairs
throws a look to  and
They gesture with sympathy and study the snow flakes
' So cruel is your heart
Is your heart so uncaring
(a litany now) One flight, Momma
It's one flight
: '  - The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a construction site
It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot which has been cut out of the side of the hill
wrecked school bus decorates it to the right
On the left is a bare branched tree
's black Cadillac is parked in front and a light shows from inside the trailer
who is strolling toward the trailer whistling through his teeth
He is wearing his tuxedo and carries a knapsack and a deer rifle
He mounts the cinder block steps and pounds on the trailer door
opens the door and waves him in
'  - The place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia deer head is mounted above the sink and , who is half into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy boots

You know that, Merle
You're a fucking maniac

(he grins) When it comes to hunting, that's true
Cursing and banging from outside
opens the door and , both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open
and  go out

Hey, guys
Shhh
Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville
looks around at his friends
He surveys the back end of the Cadillac with simian pride
Then he expands his chest, thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent, mile-carrying Tarzan call
As the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited  come, hurrying up
1 Albert, what are you doing
2 Hurry up, you guys
3 Who's got their carnations
4 Here
They're right here
1 Look at you
You're all a mess
3 Put on their carnations

As the  begin straightening ties and putting on carnations,  hears someone call his name
He turns to find  standing beside the trailer where she can't be seen
She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand
(crosses) Linda
Hi
(forces a smile) Nick, your shoes are soaking
Linda, what's the matter
(tries to toss it off) Oh
You know
She fights against it but the tears begin to come
looks around, pulls her inside the trailer

Nick
You're going hunting
If  could use this place to stay, because
Sure
Are you kidding
Sure

Hey, Linda

Will you marry me

Tears stand in her eyes and she gives a little toss of her head
Who else, dummy

He can still hardly believe it
This is terrific
This is really terrific

She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly happy
She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself in 's arms

The  lights the tapers -- first 's, then 's -- and looks out across the assembled congregation
"For everyone that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds will be reproved

We see  and ,  and , ,  and The only one of the group not dancing is is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps
We sense immediately that he feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the spirit of the party

As he picks up the second can he notices that a -  is sitting against the wall behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance

-   - The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom are still standing in the middle
Unnoticed by each other '  and '  eye the little figures
Both women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward the cake
Suddenly, as the  shifts, they encounter each other face to face
Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles, which get stretched and stretched and stretched
Then, in unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective offspring from the cake
'  looks down at her sugar coated groom and '  looks down at her sugar coated bride
Then they eye each other, burst into tears and throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing

He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something
The - gives a blush, gets out of her chair and  takes her in his arms and begins to dance
The -  looks transformed

He is very drunk
Sorry

Fuckin' Nick gives
-  - The rack is still jammed with  but the laughing and giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing and low moans
What light there is comes from the colored glass ball revolving above the dance floor, where the  is now playing sweet and low
The front door comes open and a
Army  steps into the darkened hallway
The man wears his dress green uniform
On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are brightly polished

The  gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance floor

Everyone is pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags of rice
As  and  appear from out of a back room there is a great rowdy
The  strike up a Followed by the , showered with streamers, rice, advice and encouragement,  and  walk the gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a series of ear-splitting crescendos

Their tuxedos are stained and torn
Their carnations are squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts

He is leaping and bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space
, ,  and  pound down the street behind the Pontiac,  carrying 's clothes
Look at that
Fuckin' guy
Fuckin' Merle
Unbelievable
- The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the other descending to the valley below
swerves up the incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill
,  and  stagger to a stop, panting helplessly
grabs 's clothes from  and takes off up the hill
- stands motionless, looking out across the valley as approaches
The night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow

Merle

His face has a strange, distant look, and he gives  an almost feral grin
You think we'll ever come back

There is a long pause
They both struggle to keep their eyes open
She fucked us both
Yeah
Fucking women, man

' head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering wheel
One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close to death
Suddenly his head snaps up
He slams his foot down on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to a jolting stop
in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out through the windshield
There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them standing in the headlights

As they pass along the embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound, like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish
, who has been watching, stares at the place where his three friends disappeared
He takes a few steps forward, realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of the road, helpless with laughter
(') (getting out of the car) Man, let's go hunting
Where are they

- The slope is a good 45 plus
At the bottom, barely visible, three tiny figures flop in the snow

He looks at  -- flat on his back, pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer
The deer are still watching
If anything they have edged closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws into a blind rage
Get out of here, damn you
Go home
Scat
Shoo

Assholes
Get lost
- The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven clouds
and we see 's Cadillac coming up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested ridges on both sides
- The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive, black slopes looming up from the road
- Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and stuffing them down
Hot dog juice has dripped over everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both beer and milk are being passed around
Fuel up
Need fuel
Those are mine
You want 'em
Damn right
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle
Here's a Hershey

That's mustard

That's what they did
This is it but they changed it

cold wind is blowing, moaning in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open roadway
The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos
This is it
Definitely
This is it, but they changed it
You're full of shit
Who's full of shit
You're full of shit

looks at , who is right behind him, and they both back away

His mouth comes open, closes and comes open again
Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his pants leg, staining the snow
Suddenly,  steps forward
He looks at , crosses to the knapsack, takes out the boots, walks over to  and throws them on the road
(gently, to Merle) Let's hunt
-    - The place is about nine-by-twelve
The floor is rotted out, boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is canted to the right
Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing Coleman lantern which sways in the wind
,  and  are sacked out, sound asleep
Beer cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor
Wet clothes, most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails
Strung up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out
Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright
It swirls over everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor
They are both in sleeping bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken door
The wind gusts and moans
The cabin shudders and then there is a sudden lull
Hey, Nick
Huh
Tomorrow  go with Vince
Hunt with Vince
Yeah
mean so he knows
He doesn't even know
- - Traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems to float in thin air
Behind is the mill, belching steam and ablaze with fire
's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the traffic
The car sits low
Trussed to the hood, to the roof, to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer
Rope-ends flutter and bang in the wind
The car shudders and thuds
Inside, grinning maniacally, , , ,  and are all shouting and guzzling beer
- The Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires screaming and  still leaning on the horn
The guys are all hanging out the windows, shouting to , whistling at  and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors
Maxie
Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say
Hey Geraldine, let's eat
Nothin' to it, asshole
Piece o' fuckin' cake
As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it, seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky
The headlights blaze white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer on the fenders glitter gold and green and red

After each bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly thoughtful expression, and chews
,   , -   - There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the tops of the trees
Sunlight gleams on their paint and murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat clusters, like eggs
Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets
-   - As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot upward, lost to sight
There is an eerie silence and then the hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two miles wide
- platoon of  have been ambushed on the road
The bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts spilled in the dirt
No one moves and there is absolute silence except for the low buzz of flies

He gives a brusque command and
step out of the jungle
The bayonets a few of the fallen
-- idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the Americans' blood
The laugh, spear a few  themselves and repeat the joke
There is a slight sound
The
spins and gives a low command
Fifty feet away there are three grass huts
He signals his  to spread out and then he starts toward them
- South Vietnamese  -- women, children, and a few old men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness
The  hold their hands over their ' mouths
Flies buzz and there is a look of stark terror in their faces
- One of the fallen  moves His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a gash in his temple
The face is unshaven, frighteningly gaunt, but we recognize that it is

One of the  emerges from a hut carrying two small  upside-down by their feet
One of the  cries out
The  gives her a kick, swings one of her  in the air and lets it go
The turns over and over against the blue sky
As the comes down   catches it through the neck on the end of his bayonet
- strips a
from one of his dead companions, slams a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts for the grass huts
His movements are slow, almost dreamlike, and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the dead
The  -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in a line
As the  look on the
walks up and down trying to extract information
The   lies in the dust between the two groups
The   tries to play with it
The  who threw the dead baby in the air squats nearby and yawns

He takes a quick look around the corner, finds the

They are cold, dreaming things, glittering blankly

'
- There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of nearby trees
-   - The  stand motionless, staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror
They turn
They start to run
And then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm
- stands alone with his
surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke
There is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames
' clothes are burning
Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet
In front of  the  and the  lie in two charred heaps
The  lie between them
Both are motionless now, like two roasted stones
An   steps out from behind one of the burning huts
and the  spin on each other and then the  lowers his carbine
What the hell are you doing here
(numb) Saving lives
appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line
Among them are  and
Move it out, girls
Move it out

Jesus, Merle

There is no recognition
He seems to be looking right through him
comes up behind
Hey
Hey, Merle
shot rings out
The  goes down and suddenly the whole line of  is caught in a murderous cross-fire
Grenades rain out of the trees
,  and  dive for cover
Out of the smoke
begin to appear, more and more of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores
-   - We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by stones
The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo gratings
In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men -- and
Their hands grip the gratings and their eyes are hollow
Other than an occasional groan there is only the sound of the falling rain
trudges out of the jungle
As he reaches the pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and down on the bamboo gratings
The hands disappear
As soon as one comes back, the  stomps on it, shrieking with laughter
Then, almost as an afterthought, the  pulls down his pants and squats above the center grating
We see the clearing in its totality
It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and contains only two structures
One is a large bamboo "tiger cage" with a few leaves tied to its top
The other is a small hut with a thatched roof
The walls of the hut are open and we can see
moving about inside
cry comes from the hut
There is the  of a rifle butt on flesh and the cry abruptly stops
- In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a rose-patterned plastic top
At opposite ends of the table are two chairs

In the other chair, facing him, is
The   has a welt on his head and one of the half-dozen
in the hut is screaming at him
In the middle of the table, between the   and , is a single-action
45 caliber revolver with an American eagle carved on its ivory grip
sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking in every detail of the scene
The
gives the a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber
Immediately the   begin placing bets
The are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser, and it takes some time to straighten things out
looks off to his right: -   - We see more   and  prisoners standing against the wall
Most of them have been badly beaten and all have their elbows tied behind their backs
In among them, standing beside one another, are  and
looks grey, like a skinny ghost
is out of control, sobbing quietly
-   - The betting is now completed
The
in charge waves the 45 around and calls for silence
Then, closing the cylinder containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the revolver goes off with a
Bits of thatch flutter down from the ceiling
The
shout enthusiastically and grin
sits motionless
The   across the table from him begins shaking uncontrollably
The
in charge now reloads the revolver with one cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table between  and the   and gives it a good spin
The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at stares at it for a long beat
Then he picks it up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger
The hammer falls on an empty chamber with a loud
places the revolver back on the table and pushes it toward the
The   begins to tremble again
Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get the gun in his hand
He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer and puts the gun to his temple
The gun weaves around
The   closes his eyes and pulls the trigger
There is a loud
takes the revolver again
He spins it, cocks it -- all in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger
There is another
pushes the gun back across the table
This time the takes it up with sudden confidence
He spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on the trigger
' , -, doesn't even blink
The  begin hooting and laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and watches them, watches every gesture, every movement
like a cat
- pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain
The bodies are both   and
Their heads are all variously blown to pieces and    are already feeding on them

He holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder
His face is twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for a long time
raises the pistol to his temple,
The murmur
pushes the pistol across the table
-   - There are no Americans left to play except
The sobbing has stopped but  is shaking and trembling and his eyes wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose
, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to As he does so we hear the  coming from across the room and the excited  of the  as their betting choice survives another round
You can do it, Sal

The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the
The stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes
The  begin yelling at him, urging him on and then gives him a      that the picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around, cocks it and puts it to his temple
For a moment  and the look at each other ' The    squeezes the trigger sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed in an expression of terrible puzzlement
Then his face begins to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to discover a frown
looks around
He looks back again at the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry
-   - half-dozen   sit huddled together in the muck on the uphill side
seventh lies sprawled on his back, The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the floor
On the downhill side are ,  and
is in a fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back and forth
His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at the table blow himself away
Beside  is

One knee is raised and he is picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn at the knee
, ""
- '  -   - The pits are about twenty feet away
Running mud and water gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the downhill side
There are fewer hands than the day before, far fewer
The nearest pit only has one pair and as  watches he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip
,
-   - turns away from the "pits"
He looks down at , then he looks at
His expression is one of exasperation, as if he had been having a long argument
'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come
What are you, God
Listen, asshole, it's up to us

His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had mentally transported himself to some distant place
There are great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly like a very small child who has experienced some terrible confusion
Suddenly the  standing beside  wrenches him around

pushes the revolver across the table
His face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if throwing back a challenge
stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an expression of utter gloom
Then he reaches out, takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up

Slowly, he pushes himself to his feet
The gun is still on the table, still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body sag over it

As  approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the side of a steep hill, we suddenly see , stumbling along behind and attached to  by a short rope
comes to a stop, unshoulders  and lays him on the ground
As  stands looking at , gasping for breath, hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo with an expression of pure terror
Where are we going, Merle
Are we going home
There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible
throws himself on , slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence
For a moment there is nothing -- silence
The rain drones on and we can hear ' breath, which comes in short, shallow rasps
The sound comes again and suddenly a appear, coming down through the trees

His gums are bleeding and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in his skull
His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad

Where are we going, Merle
Are we going home
(barely moving his lips) Right here
Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer
In the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the middle of the road
There is another explosion and another flash
The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it appears miraculously unharmed

No answer

Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the automobile
When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches out and touches it

Sure, Sal
We're going home
- are streaming down the road in a desperate, frightened human torrent
There is every imaginable means of conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing on foot
The burned-out car is still in the middle of the road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it were an island
In the distance comes the sound of machine gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby
helicopters clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the skids
Now and then an   comes through, blasting the  into the ditch

and  are gone and the area is littered with fresh bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies
Suddenly a jeep pulls up with a two-star  in it

He wears ill fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the pallor of his skin
Around his neck is a piece of plastic on which is stapled a colored paper marker
Departing aircraft thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby hydraulic mechanism

How's that
Does that feel better

The  slams back out the door
Another jet thunders overhead
The hydraulic  on the loading ramp shriek and whine

It seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet

He looks anxious
He takes out his wallet again, peers intently at ' , then puts it back

He is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting along for hours
As he comes to a stop, staring at a who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the gutter
Suddenly, across the street, something catches his eye
(calling) Sal
Sal
throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even looking
Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop

She has one hand around his waist and the other down the front of his pants
You like to call me Linda now
Linda, yeah
You call me Linda, just like home

He tears himself loose from the and pushes up against the glass

Hey, hey, the snow does snow -- There is the sharp report of a pistol  and then, as spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the unmistakable sound of

Lying on the around are three , all of them Asian, all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off
As  stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building,and    bring out another corpse

His duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled along the wall by his feet
His head is thrown back and he is draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw swallows

Hey, Angela, Sal and  go back a long way
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick
begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands up
She stares at  for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl comes up behind her
finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall
tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket
Angela
laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding 's eyes
Did you ever think life would turn out like this
No
You know what Sal's got now
Sal's got
one arm, Nick, and
that's it
The door to the kitchen bangs open and '  comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver
' Here
This is it
What you do, you stick this in here
Pushes the toaster in 's arms

Jab it good
Something's in it

Something's in it

What's there

It is snowing and from inside the church we hear the
The sound is massive, deep and dark, like a great river rolling through the night
He is staring at something, tears glistening in his eyes

The door is half open and snow is blowing in

'  -  - steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself
It just seems sort of strange coming to a motel
Like a honeymoon
Or some kind of parlez vous
Not parlez-vous
(she giggles) What am  saying
That's those cocktails
Parlez-vous
What mean is rendezvous
Some kind of rendezvous
pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at herself in the mirror
She is very excited, very nervous
She strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and poking a finger in her mouth
(') Do you know what  mean
Nick
doesn't answer
pulls the door full open, takes one last look at herself and goes out
- '  -  - As  comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she stops dead in her tracks
is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe off and sound asleep
Nick
doesn't stir, doesn't budge
crosses and looks at him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a wistful shake
(') Nick
Nick, it's me
But  is out, gone
lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed
Then, almost immediately, she stands and begins taking off his clothes
She takes off his shoes, then both socks
As she goes to undo his belt, his shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a fresh scar
stares at the scar for a moment, then she slowly exposes the whole of 's chest

At the other end of the rod  and  are attaching metallic strips
When  and  have secured the strips they signal to  and all three of them lower their goggles

and  give a signal and the   raises the door at the bottom of the furnace
is now alone, standing like Don Quixote with his lance
As  advances toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have stuck to it burst into flame
Within reach of the furnace now,  pauses
Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it through the open doorway at the base of the furnace
There is a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the doorway, passing  at the level of his shoulders and showering him in a great cascade of white sparks
'  - sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in thought
All around him  are shouting, yelling, cracking jokes
After a moment  pushes in, claps him on the back
How's it feel, huh
How's it feel to be back
(forced enthusiasm) Great
Feels great
Fuckin'
mean,  guess you still think about Nam
Right

(shakes his head) Uh-huh
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants

No
Never one

Six or eight

They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths

His respiration is up, his mouth is bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers
For a moment his belief is total, then a frown crosses his face
You're full of shit

His hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on the corner
There is a sound outside, then the lights come on as  enters with groceries
Nick
Right here
crosses to the doorway
What are you doing
Oh
Nothing
Sitting
You're going hunting

Yeah

That's wonderful

fresh air
gets to his feet, suddenly
His face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion
You know how sometimes you're going along
You're going along
And that's all
One thing is right after another, like steps
And you step along

It is as if he were choking

Couple of days

-    - Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice covered trees
There is no horizon
Sky and earth are bound in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the whispering, fitful, spinning flakes
appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting snow
is moving easily, heading slightly uphill, following the contour of the slope
As he draws closer we see that he is following a

appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow
The  watches  for a moment, then turns unhurriedly and vanishes into the trees
- is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on all fours
and , who have reached a level area above , unsling their rifles
are going off in every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that it sounds like a full scale war
What are you, kiddin'
Are you kiddin' me, Albert
Twenty times coulda had her
She
One time she begged me, practically begged me
Listen,  had her tit, which was out, in one hand, and my other hand

The  is rattled by the gunfire and peers at  uncertainly
spins and grabs his gun, which immediately goes off
He slams another shell in the chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is hooked on the antlers of the   and another shot ricochets off a nearby rock
and  dive for cover
As they look up, they see the  trot down the slope and then , firing wildly, running after it
-   - The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees appears, moving fast, at a near trot
Suddenly he stops, listening
At the same moment there is a snort
wheels
The  is behind him, bounding away
-   - The  appears, trotting out of the swirling snow
Reaching a deadfall the  pauses, looking back, and then turns sharp left and disappears
comes out of the snow
He is winded but still going hard
-  - reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs over
As he touches down on the other side there is a growling sound
grabs for the deadfall
The wind shifts and we see that he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the top of a steep scree slope
As  watches, the boulder begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking
and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to unknown depths below
-    - and  have dragged their    to a log beside the shack
They sit side by side, drenched in sweat, guzzling beer out of both hands
Sweet
Oh, that is sweet
Hey
Fuckin'
Just
just like a hot shit
except cold

gives him a blank expression, then cracks up
explode nearby
At first the shots are scattered but they quickly open into a and  stand up

This one's mine

He raises his rifle, fires, and the
begin coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks
The wheels out on the highway

He takes aim at the  and there is a

Gun
Gimme gun

stumbles over to it, rams a cartridge in the chamber
(') (looks around, bewildered) Where's it gone
Inside, Vince
staggers to the cabin door
The  is lying on the floor, motionless,
got it
Hey, you guys,  got it
-   - The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way and then the other
appears in the distance, a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white
As  draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion
His clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg
As There are no tracks
There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow
The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in again from another way
Suddenly it stops entirely
In the silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock
turns
The  is standing on the shoreline, not thirty feet away, looking down at him
pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights down the barrel
'
'
, ,   ,  - (grins) Damn
God damn
-  - sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock face
As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it might be something from a dream
(shouts) Hey
Hey
okay
-    - The Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the wind
is propped against the wall, dozing
is out cold
and  are both drunk and arguing bitterly
You're full of shit, Vince
You're so full of shit you're going to float away

He grabs up the pistol and cocks it
(shrieking) Say that one more time
Say it
Go on, say it
is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at the pistol in disbelief
Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun with one hand and slams  to the floor
gets up
slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall
lurches over, pulls  away
Nick
Nick, you'll kill him
Easy
Nick, easy
Hey, hey
Vince goes back a long way
(grimly) Yeah
gets to his feet
Blood is streaming down his face
What the hell was that

Did you think it was loaded
You loaded it, Vince

The fuck  did
The fuck you didn't
Gimme that
takes the pistol
What do you think
You think don't know
looks at him, then he
For a moment there is absolute silence
The wind moans in the trees, snow curls through the open door and , who is still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore
looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands
'm going to throw this fuckin' thing away
goes out
-    - For a moment  stands in the light from the door, listening to the wind
He looks down at the pistol again, then he heaves it into the trees
The wind gusts
The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through the woods in great streaming wraiths
watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in
'  - The trailer is lonely looking,  and cold
pulls into the yard beside 's car and skips to a stop gets out, says a few words to  and everyone laughs goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and pounds on the car
takes off, thudding over the curb with his load of
crosses to the trailer and goes inside
-   - in wheelchairs are watching a western
-     - In the foreground a  holds a telephone
Beyond the we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down the polished corridor
As the figure draws closer we realize it is
is dressed in a white hospital gown, the bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and trails limply on the floor
Both 's legs have been amputated and he has lost one arm
His face is terribly scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his eyes
takes the telephone Hello
'  - sits in a little chair by the window, still in his hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver
Sal
Sal, it's me, Nick
Nick
Hey
How's things
Oh
You know

Sal
Hold it
John Wayne's making so much noise  can hardly -- gotta get back, Nick

There is the , ,
Sal
Sal
-     - is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor
At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back at the
Then he turns and disappears into the flickering darkness, where  are sounding a cavalry charge
'  - listens to the     for a moment, then puts the receiver back on the telephone
He stands, walks around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset
His eye falls on the clock
It is nearly eight o'clock
He turns, hurries out the door
- The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping carts which a  is banging together
gets out of his car and goes in
- Two or three  are closing out the registers up front
She's in back
Thanks
How was huntin'
Oh
Fine
Get anything
No
Too bad
goes down a long aisle of bright packages
Coming out at the back he finds  sitting in a green plastic chair, crying
Linda
Honey, what's wrong
(helpless shrug) don't know
Hey
Look
There must be something
looks at him, tears streaming down her face
'm just so lonely
'mon

Just leave me
'll be out

Really
'm fine
walks back down the aisle between the bright packages
'  -    - The  is still collecting abandoned shopping carts
The carts crash and clank as the  rams them together
sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk
His hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car
- '  - watches the lights go out in the market
comes out of the door and crosses towards him
You okay
nods
fumbles for the door
Let's make love, Nick
takes him in her arms and holds him tight
(') Let's make love forever
'  - is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping
stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her
After a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window
'  (' ) - The wind is blowing
Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by,
Suddenly a appears walking slowly down the street
The  is elegantly dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a Stetson hat
As the  draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at 's trailer
, ,    , '  - backs away from the window
For a moment he stands motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes
He looks over at , he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to the window again
(' ) - The street is empty
The  is gone
'  - hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants, shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of slices
'  - comes out into the street
There is no one in sight
crosses to the intersection of Columbine
- No one
Nothing
beer can rolling in the wind
jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket
He is irked with himself, a little frightened
Suddenly he hears a car door close and en engine start up
black limousine pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly is at the wheel
The  in back appears to be the  he saw, but the is looking out the window on the other side and his face is not visible
As  watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed
The tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and disappears
-   - Sunlight streams through a window
The television is going
In a far corner  sits in his wheelchair, sleeping
His head has fallen to one side and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning
On a tray in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice, milk and a little box of Wheaties
-   - Someone is descending the stairs
After a moment the feet appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots
We see expensive, tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six shooter
and then, suddenly, '
slows in his descent, stops, looking at something
(' ) - is getting out of a cab
He pays the driver and starts toward the building
-   - watches  for a moment, his face utterly without expression, then  continues down the stairs
- is pushing  down a walkway
Sal, we need you
We need you
Hey, Nick
How can you need me
We do, Sal
We do
You're the heart
Turns  and sits on a bench
(') Sal, you're gonna die
You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die
'm not saying it's gonna be the same
It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal
God damn it we are
We are gonna do it
Nick
'm so scared

It's like coming from the moon
Or Mars

No
You didn't get a deer

God, he was such a beauty--
What's this suitcase here
Where
Here
Behind you
pulls a suitcase off the rack behind 's chair
don't know
sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the clasps
Maybe Angela brought you stuff know she said -- The suitcase slips over the back of the wall
(') Shit
swings up on the wall and then he freezes
The lid of the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment
Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick mean, if it's socks or something just let 'em go
-    - looks down at the money scattered at his feet
The bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere
(
) Maybe you could use socks, Nick
Jesus,  mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now
It's not socks, Sal
bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification
There is nothing
As he straightens up he notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills
The paper is about an inch square
The corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket for a long time
picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it
"" -   - leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by
sits with the suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying
Who is it, Nick
Who is it
don't understand
looks at
His head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort
It's Merle, Sal
Merle
Merle's alive
( nods) How do you know
saw him last night
thought was dreaming
thought  was out of my mind
Merle gave me this
Yeah
But, Nick
Hey,  mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this
is standing slightly behind , looking down at the money
The reality of what  is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone
Oh cards, maybe
Poker
It's getting cold, Sal
'm going to take you in
(starts off) We'll call Angela
The guys can help her bring you home
Did tell you  was going on a trip

Hey, it's okay
Just a week
Just to see Phantom Mary
Phantom Mary
Didn't  ever tell you about Phantom Mary

Phantom Mary's on my mother's side
Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird
You want to hear the whole story
(enthusiastically) Yeah
Like  say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird
Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred
Well, last week  got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange

Both vehicles screech to a stop and an  jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer

He steps back, hurls himself against it
The door gives way with a crash and he staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs
Out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of broken cafe tables, a    stare at him in terror from the other side of a small fire

- An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights
The house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have been set up
Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns which bob and sway in the wind

More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust
-    - dozen  helicopters have put down between the trees
One has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor
There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another helicopter comes out of the sky
As it sets down a dashingly handsome    hops out and extends a hand to his When his  has descended the  opens a back compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their He hands the  to his  and they stroll off toward the house
-  - Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms
The betting is heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an hour
-   - Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle facing a small stage
The stage is lit with a single, blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and two velvet-covered chairs
Two , both of them , sit opposite one another
Between them, lying on the table, is a revolver
Both  are dressed in tuxedos
Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm
Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager  jam the first three rows

The tables have been laid with white cloth and the are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a funeral breakfast
They work in silence, fussing over the placement of each knife and fork

Gradually, one by one, the   stop fussing with the table
They stand motionless, listening
