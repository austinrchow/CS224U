"The Insider", shooting draft, by Eric Roth & Michael Mann written by & 11/5/99 : "" : All we can see is black filling the screen
Black on black
,  - And we're in a speeding
Two men in front, shouldering assault rifles
And there are three  in the back
middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on
And on either side of him, two Men, blindfolded
The man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled black-leather jacket
stocky man, with the edge of a Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once
But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music that disappears behind him
He's
On the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a voltmeter around his neck,
' , ,  - The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese village
It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with 's and a few 's
And in the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening Lebanese soldiers
And as the speeding convoy passes a captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah
And, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop
And blindfolded Lowell and Norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight
The lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside
- round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table
It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls
Gunman cradling an -47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner
torn poster of the Seychelles is on one wall
Another Gunman stands by a window
Lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table
Coffee
Yeah
Thank you
How have you liked your stay
(droll) What 've seen 've liked
The Sheikh smiles
And the smile passes as quickly as it came
steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse is put down
Please to explain, why  should agree to interview
with pro-Zionist American media
Because  think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now
So you care about what you're thought of in America
And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face
(confident) That's why
And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and  see the questions first
Then decide if  grant the interview
(blunt) No
We don't do that
(beat) You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace
So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity
You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, -magazine news show in America
The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him
And Lowell "closes": (cont'd) So
Mr
Wallace
Should he get on a plane or not
The Sheikh thinks it over and then
Tell him  will see him day after tomorrow
That's good
That works
(after a beat) Uh, you know,  want to ask you something
know it sounds odd
but
It's quiet
too quiet
(') Hello, Sheikh
(no answer) Hello, Sheikh
Silence
He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold
He lifts it
And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone
The house empty
Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold
(') Norman
What
What
Take your blindfold off
The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian- American
(') (sarcastic) Welcome to the world
Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet
Fluctuating all over the place
Anywhere we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable gennies and we'll run cable
Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height
Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed mosques
moment of triumph
He dials his cell phone
'  () Hello
(into phone) Mike, it's me
We're on
"
" ,  & , , - We're in a , in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black woman's birthday
Half her presents are opened
Balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab
And there's a sense that somebody is watching
And from the waist up, a disembodied figure comes into  behind a glass partition, as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless  in his late forties, watching them
'  - The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving
His hair not yet settled on grey, his face is changing, always interesting
Born in the Bronx, educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent and much of the directness
He's
He turns to resume gathering things from his desk
some technical books, a medical text on asthma
putting them in his briefcase
And as he leaves the office, the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him
,  &   - Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from , from  and in , his eyes, frozen pools
And like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel microphone after Jeffrey's passed
' ,  - Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window
Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow
down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns
He pulls into driveway behind a 3 series
It's a grey French provincial replica
' ,  - Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching television in the den
Hi, honey
Hi, Daddy
What's new
Ms
Laufer gave me a star today
Yeah
What for
For reading
He pours himself a drink at a wet bar
That's great
Little early for cartoons, isn't it
Okay
Dutiful, she shuts off the , going upstairs
(cont'd) Deborah
Debbie
He looks outside
Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine
There's something like a Hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns
Right now the Woman comes in
She's pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm
She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech
Oh,  didn't know you were home
It's early
Isn't it
He doesn't say anything
(') Gotta take Debbie to ballet
And it all feels suburban, familiar
Suddenly there's a shout
'  () Mommy
Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into
'  - '  - And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation
is having a severe asthmatic attack
Sweetheart, c'mon
'mon
She was playing with my Pooh doll again
Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece
The compressor whirs
Deborah breathes in the medication
Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Breathe deep
Breathe deep
Slow down, honey
Slow down
Slow down
Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water
We don't know why yet
Deborah's chest heaves
She's scared
Jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention
(cont'd) Here we go
Deep breaths, deep breaths
She was playing with the Pooh doll
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart
he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay
So what's - what's happening to you now is
cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in
" (beat) and the airways in your lungs are like branches
And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack
And, we give you medicine, and you get better
Huh
Okay
You're better already, aren't you
And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer
Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah
Now she takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey
Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver
(cont'd) Okay, baby
' ,  - Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner, Deborah in a bathrobe
Can  go to dance tomorrow 'm better
if you are, then 'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after
can take her
Don't you have to be at the office
(instead, getting up) Is there any more rice
(nods) Yes, it's on the stove
He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing
(cont'd) Do you want more rice
Maybe later
How about you
'll take some
Instant rice
Can  go over to Janeane's house
'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug
Try the car
And Liane going outside
'  - She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup holders
She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take
Uh, what are those boxes
'm going to the store
You need anything
What do you need at the store
Soy sauce
Right now
(meaning in the car) That's my stuff from the office
Why did you take your stuff from the office
(simply) didn't want to leave it there
(confused) don't understand
(matter of fact) got fired this morning
Where else am  gonna take it
Why
Who said
(specifically) Thomas Sandefur
(stunned, fearful) What are we supposed to do
What about our medical coverage; what about our health
What about our car payments
The payments on this house
He looks at her
There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling
But she doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes
(a beat, specific) There's a severance agreement
It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage
(beat) Sure you don't need anything
No, thank you
She's stunned
He leaves
And as Liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns into  towards him to do that
But he's driven off down the street
(cont'd) Jeffrey
- The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes into the room
am very pleased to receive you as my guest, Mr
Wallace
Thank you for having us
:  Norman's camera crew is setting up is there
dangerous combination of intelligence, arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about him
Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a French formal garden
Sound Technician wires the Sheikh and Mike with microphones
Norman says something to Lowell and then goes out
think 've got a problem with the gennie
have to go outside
(going outside) Norman
Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the Sheikh's chair
The Head Bodyguard barks something in Arabic
The Interpreter says something back in Arabic
The Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview, ignores all of this
He says you must not sit so close
What
(re:  Bodyguard) can't conduct an interview from back there
The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more confrontational Arabic
You must move back your chair
Will you tell him that when  conduct an interview,  sit anywhere  damn please
There is no interview
As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches
You
'm talking to you
More armed men start to enter
(cont'd) What the hell do you think  am
78- year-old assassin
You think 'm gonna karate him to death with this notepad
(to Interpreter) Are you interpreting what 'm saying
Yes
We're there
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language
(to Interpreter) Don't interpret that
(to both) Hold it
Hold it
Hold it
Slow, slow (to the Sheikh) Sheikh, do you mind
if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr
Wallace
The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair, goes back to his notes
(cont'd) Is that okay
Okay
(Bodyguard assents; to Mike) Are you ready
Or you want to keep fucking around and warm up some more
No
(wry) that's got my heart started
They know each other well
Lowell smiles
Wallace sits down
Alright, Todd, give me the three-button on Mike, please
Okay
We are rolling
Okay, Mike
They roll camera
"60 Minutes"
"Hezbollah"
(charming) Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so much for seeing us
(changes) Are you a terrorist
The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot between the eyes
He recovers
Mr
Wallace,
am a servant of God
That expression of incredulity
servant of God
Really
Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen, cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway
(') Americans believe that you , as an Islamic fundamentalist, that you are a leader who contributed to the bombing of the
Embassy
The ballsiness of Wallace, asking these questions in this place, is impressive
- It's still
is stopped at an odd angle in the street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big Sur-like fence on a hillside
Beyond the truck is a forever view of the Bay
handle turns
Mail truck door opens
Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate
Doorstep
Box is deposited there
It's quiet again
The  sitting nakedly by the front door
' , ,  - Lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the telephone, still in bed
Newspapers, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle , are spread all over
home as refuge
tray with large cups of coffee is on a side table
everyone thinks Canadian Mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids, Mike
They backed locals in Oka in a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site
They beat up protesters at Kanasake
(pause) Where'd you hear that
The other phone on a nightstand rings
Woman in her forties,  , enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her teeth
She answers it
(cont'd) (droll) Oh, someone took a poll
"Are all things Canadian boring
" (to Lowell) It's Stuart
he's in Mexico City
Let me call you back
He takes up the line
listening
(') Yeah, Stuart
What New York bank
young Man in his early twenties wanders in
Hey Dad
Sharon
Lowell waves at , his son
(to Jake) No classes this morning
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch
don't have to be there until ten- thirty
Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper
And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair comes strolling in, Sharon's son,
Hi Mom, Lowell
Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him
Hi, sweetheart
Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports section Jake is reading
Another line rings, Sharon getting it
The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave
(into phone) Will independent sources corroborate that
Hello
Yeah
- The Boys coming out of the house together
And seeing the by the door
' (shouts back inside) Dad, you got a box out here
And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the Berkeley street
The box left waiting by the door
(looking at her itinerary) Let me see this
No, 'cause  gotta know where you're going at all times
' , ,  - (into phone) can't
've got to fly to Boston tomorrow
Lowell comes with the box back to bed
He's already unwrapped it
Inside are stacks of papers
He looks at the box cover
No return address
An anonymous sender; not unusual for him
He casually looks through the papers
(') Two p
m
Great
Bye-bye
(hangs up) (reading) "ignition propensity
" (to Sharon) you understand any of this
He gives her some papers
We see formulas
scientific data in tables
no
this looks like a table of temperatures
Who's this from
(shrugs) it's anonymous
References to "
" (motions) It's got to be Philip Morris, huh
have to take a shower
As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom
, , - We see a  in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting paged in a crowded cafeteria
An old 1930's  mural on the wall
His pager goes off
Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay phones and dials
' ,  -  - The phone rings
Lowell picks it up
Yeah
(into phone) Hi, this is Doug Oliver
Oh, hi, Doug
it's Lowell
'm doing this story on fire safety
People burning up from falling asleep smoking
received a shitload of scientific papers from inside Philip Morris
Anonymous
You or anybody in  know someone who can translate this stuff into English for me
(beat) uh, yeah
- : There's the sound of a phone ringing
to reveal Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one shoulder
'   (Deborah's) answers
"Hello
" Mr
Wigand, please
There's a whisper
"Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom
" Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street
He gestures familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out cappuccinos
Lowell nods his thanks, pays
(cont'd) Thank you, Bob
'  () Who's calling
My name's Lowell Bergman
'm -- '  () Did you say Berman
No, Bergman
'm a producer with "60 Minutes"
'  () "60 Minutes"
Yeah
'  () "60 Minutes," the television show
Yes
Lowell waits for some moments, and
' ,  - (on phone) He doesn't want to talk to you
/
- How does he know he doesn't want to talk to me
He doesn't know what 'm calling him about
'  () He doesn't care to know
And she hangs up
Lowell's motionless
And his interest piqued, he sets down his cleaning
He calls back
The phone rings and rings
picks it up
Jeffrey Wigand's Voice:  "This is the Wigands'
If you'd like to leave a message or send a fax, start now
" , ' ,  - And we see Jeffrey Wigand, sitting at his desk in his office, working on his computer, hearing Lowell
'  () (on the machine) This is Lowell Bergman with "60 Minutes"
'm doing a story on fire safety and cigarettes
have scientific documents from a tobacco company, and  could use your help as a consultant explaining these documents to me
My number is area code 510-555- 0199
'll be there, at this number, in 10 minutes
He hangs up
Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his computer
' ,  - Lowell's restless, waiting
And not getting a call back, he tries another tact
He writes a , "Please call me at
"  He writes his number down
He sends the Fax
He's still
It's quiet
And not getting an answer he gets up, starting to leave the room
And suddenly the fax machine He turns
He reads a message emerging from the machine
" can't talk to you
"  He's quiet
He writes on a piece of paper
"Can't talk to me
"  "Won't talk to me
" "Don't want to talk to me
"  As he faxes it back
' , ,  - Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell
' ,  - Lowell, waiting
The fax machine rings again
He reads Jeffrey's answer
"Can't
"  "Won't
"  "Don't want to
" He's quiet, more than just interested, now
There's something beyond intriguing here
He turns
He looks through a stack of phone books for something
a nationwide 800 directory
He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone number again
If you're curious to meet me
' , ,  - Wigand working on his computer
Lowell's  on his answering machine
'  () (on machine) 'm gonna be in the lobby of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading The New York Times , tomorrow, at five o'clock
Lowell clicks off
And as Wigand sits at his computer, giving no indication what he might do
, ,  - An old hotel with faded carpets
Lowell in the lobby reading New York Times , waiting
And instead of looking up every time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes pair of black wing tips walking by
woman's high heels
pair of men's tasseled loafers
lace-up brown
pair of tennis shoes
cordovan wing tip
The pair of tasseled loafers walking by again
And Lowell looks up
And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away
It's Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500, corporate-executive bearing
Lowell crosses to the elevators
Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell in, and as the doors close
,  - () Have you always lived in Louisville
Brilliant late afternoon sunlight
We   to see Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to the left
Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in the middle of the large room
Mr
Bergman
What did you want me to consult about
sudden  on the door
(') (turns, suspicious) Who's that
(wry) That's room service
They usually knock first
(calls) Come on in
Over here, please
Room Service brings in a tray with coffee
As Lowell signs the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand
Their eyes meet
The Waiter looks away
(cont'd) Thank you
And the Waiter leaves
(') (pouring) How do you like your coffee
Black
Black, black
Lowell gives him his cup of coffee
(') Look,  really don't have that much time
(nods) Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr
Wigand
Like what
Your sign
Lowell smiles
(') know what  have to know
Just so  know you know, when  talk to people in confidence, it stays that way
(abruptly) How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at
Lowell looks at him, he does his homework
still do the tough stories
"60 Minutes" reaches a lot of people
Wigand's quiet, measuring him
(after a beat) Let me see the documents
Lowell gives him the box of papers
Wigand sits down, the box on his lap, quietly looking through them
flips to a different heading, consults a chart
(') this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for Philip Morris
Burn rates
ignition propensity
things of this nature
(after a beat) could very easily explain this to you in layman's terms, because it's from another company
He puts the papers down
(cont'd) but that's as far as  go
Far as you go where
(a beat) This issue is a drop in the bucket can talk to you about what's in here
But  can't talk to you about anything else
And Lowell knows something else is going on here
(') (meaning Philip Morris documents) signed a confidentiality agreement honor agreements
lot more is going on here
Lowell nods, a good reporter
(') Doesn't  have confidentiality agreements, Mr
Bergman
Between journalists and management, yes, believe they do
but  don't take that seriously
(after a beat) Where do you work
Did work
(fast) Did work
(the bottom line) How much would  get paid
That, you have to discuss with Business Affairs
But, for something like this,  would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand
Wigand nods "Okay
" Should  just take the documents now
If you want to do it
He turns to leave
Lowell gets the door for him
Wigand momentarily slows
worked as the head of Research and Development for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
was a Corporate Vice President
Mr
Bergman
And he goes out the door
Lowell's still
Wigand's job title resonates
Lowell turns to the window, casually looking into the early evening
and he comes face to face with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across the street
,    - (on screen) "President Assad of Syria said that difficult obstacles remain but that his country, quote, 'looks forward to a great, long peace with Israel
'" Suddenly lights come on
Executive Producer   is suddenly on his feet veritable dervish, in constant motion
(kissing Mike) It's a Peabody, Mike
When you're dead and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're gonna remember you for
Mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave, Hewitt on his tail
while
(to his Editor) come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi
You eating with us
Yeah
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door
And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late thirties, Lowell's assistant,  , to join them
The eye contact on the way out says there's something important he needs to tell her
- There's a blast of
The City
Lowell, Wallace, Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the  lobby, moving through the reflections
Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but , Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the other way
Debbie
Hey, Lowell
Midstream, fast: Oh, Bill
Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank
Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch
You want it for the Evening News
What about you, you got a crew already
'm gonna do a follow-up
Okay
(leaves) Catch ya' later
53RD ,   - Lowell, crossing
Debbie
And, now, as they cross Madison
(') (to Debbie; finally) want you to get legal onto Boundaries of their constraint
Kentucky state law about
want you to drop everything
(cuts in) Okay
Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper
He doesn't have change, Debbie does
55TH  (),   - And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant
We them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as
&  ,  , - Meanwhile, it's static
Still, frozen
Jeffrey sits in the of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company headquarters
Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on tables
dark quiet
The hush of big business
Standing in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators, is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and lapel microphone
(to Wigand) Mr
Wigand, you can go up now
He gets up, crossing to an elevator
' ,  &  - (re:  his distraction) Sorry
'm accepting an award from the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation
It's going to kill the rest of my day
is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales figures
Dark pouches are under his eyes
He doesn't look up
He doesn't look healthy
We're in a luxurious office with a view of Louisville
Jeffrey is waiting in a chair
Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's
Two , their briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch
Their jackets are off
They wear expensive shirts
(cont'd) (finishing; looking up at Jeffrey) So
You had a chance to play golf
Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his salesman's sunny manners
He has a mellifluous Georgia accent
(') (to the Lawyers) Jeff's a premiere golfer
What are you, a two handicap
(precise) Seven
(to lawyer) And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us
He has more concentration than anybody 've ever met
It's spooky how he can concentrate
'd rather play than talk about it
(beat) What did you want to see me about don't like being back here
Sandefur smiles, used to him
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind
Most people consider what they're saying
social skills
Jeffrey just charges right ahead
(smiles, after a beat) Now,  know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff
Chapter and verse
(nods) Yeah,  know you do
(beat) You know,  came up through sales
One of the reasons  was a great salesman, was  never made a promise  couldn't keep
(beat) knew that if  ever broke my promise 'd suffer the consequence
And there's a warning behind it
(contained) Is that a threat
we worked together for, what was it, three years
Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny
any more than are one's family matters
(quietly) You threatening my family, now, too
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff
(a beat) About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion
"Research
" (smile + scorn) You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil
That's why we hire scientists
(interrupts, direct) Okay
(a beat, honest) don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements
was paid well for my work
The health and welfare benefits are good
The severance package is fair
have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which  said wouldn't
appreciate all that, Jeff
But, upon reflection
we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you
And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room
(') So we've drafted a supplement to your agreement
it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is "confidential
"  Nobody will be able to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, didn't know that was a secret
" (beat) We're very serious about protecting our interests
(a beat) We'd like you to sign it
And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it
(a beat) And if  don't
(speaking for Sandefur) If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're acting in bad faith
We would terminate, right now, payouts under your severance package
You and your family's medical benefits
And initiate litigation against you, Mr
Wigand
Dr Wigand
(a beat) Dr Wigand
after you've examined the document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you'll sign it
Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney
And we see on his face the true nature of this man
So, what you are saying is:  it isn't enough that you fired me
For no good reason
Now you question my integrity
On top of the humiliation of being fired
You threaten me
You threaten my family
(beat) It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement
(turning, to Sandefur) But  will tell you, Mr
Sandefur, and Brown & Williamson, too
Fuck me
(a beat) Well, fuck you
And with that he gets up, and leaves
And it's quiet
'm not sure he got the message
(with total confidence) Oh,  think he did
,  - Wigand picks up the phone and dials
- They've finished lunch
Wallace and Hewitt are turned to talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's cell phone rings
(answering) Yeah
'  () you fucked me
Who is this
,  - (crazed) protect your sources
You screwed me
You sold me out
- What are you talking about
Where are you
,  - Fuck you, too
And he slams down the phone
,   - Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand
,  - We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green
caged cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf balls
And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one after another, after another
His swing is powerful, angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out
He pauses, spent
Settling down, he exhales
Then, he looks down the way
And he slows
He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and tie, watching him
And the Man in the suit right then, with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball
The ball slamming into the steel net
And the lights  go out
The range closing for the night
The "insect" comes to a stop
And it's quiet, dark
Jeffrey gathers up his clubs
He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the
And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind him
He turns
And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him
Jeffrey comes to the parking lot
It's empty
Just Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car, purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his
He crosses to his car, getting in
'  - He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind the wheel
He turns
And he sees the Man in the suit has gotten in the car next to his
They look at each other
The Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes
It's malevolent as hell
And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf club, jumps out of his car
,  ,  - Golf club in hand at the driver side window
(motioning with the club, threatening) Stay away from me
You stay away from me
The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed
It's still
And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something real, something imaginary
,  -  : ' - violent rain's falling
And we see Jeffrey coming out of the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls
They start towards the car
There's the sound of a car door shutting
Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them
Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches -- She slows, seeing someone
Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell
He's surprised
Mrs
Wigand, how do you do
(to the girls, protectively) Jump in, quick, c'mon
'm Lowell Bergman
We spoke on the phone, remember
The Girls climb in the car
Lowell crosses behind the Audi around the far side
(') 'mere
want to talk to you
Good
want to talk to you
Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around the far side of the car
(') (confronting him) What do
(running over) did not burn you
did not give you up to anyone
(continuing) This is my house
In front of my wife, my kids
What business do we have
To straighten something out with you
Right here
Right now
So, you didn't mention my name
You haven't talked to anybody about me
Why am  gonna mention your name
How did Brown & Williamson know  spoke to you
How the hell do  know about Brown & Williamson
It happened after  talked to you
do not like coincidences
And  don't like paranoid accusations
'm a journalist
Think
Use your head
How do  operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it
(skeptical) You came all the way down here to tell me that
No
did not
Big Tobacco is a big story
And you got something important to say
can tell
(a beat, personal) But, yes
did
came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story,  don't burn people
It starts to rain harder
They look at each other
Jeffrey, without saying a word, gets in the Car
He backs out
Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain
Liane goes back into the house
And Lowell starts back across the street to his car
There's a sound
He turns
Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back and stopped in the street
(after a beat) Ride with me while  take the girls to school
Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat
'  - They drive away
Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back seat with Barbara
Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat
And it's quiet, just the sound of the wipers on the window
And as Lowell rides with them
- - We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot
Rain, pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond
'  () and my little girl has acute asthma
Deborah
My eldest daughter
' ,  -    - The Girls are gone
We enter mid-scene
Lowell's still in the back seat
(') And, 'm unemployed
So  have to protect my medical coverage
(the bottom line; turning to look at Lowell in the rear seat) so  left them a message this morning
Their expanded confidentiality agreement
will sign it
They're afraid of you, aren't they
They should be
The sound of the rain
(after a beat, trying to make it easier for him) Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement
(guarded) Like what
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson
(a beat) Johnson & Johnson
Union Carbide in Japan
was general manager and director of new products
speak Japanese
was a director of corporate development at Pfizer
All health- related
(wry) What else
Outside the "zone"
don't know
you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi-finals
Wigand smiles
as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror
subtle connection
It passes
: '  -   - Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock behind
The rain stopped
Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot
Lowell's in the front seat
And we get the feeling they've been talking for hours
'  () Just give me an example
For example
James Burke, the  of Johnson & Johnson
when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the He didn't even wait for the to tell him
He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America
Instantly
And then he developed the safety cap
Because, look, as a , sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right
But he's also a man of science
He's not going to allow his company
to put on the shelf
a product that might hurt people
(sarcastic) Not like the Seven Dwarfs
Seven dwarfs
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco
they got up in front of Congress that time
it was on television
and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease
It was on -
Yeah
Okay, so, here you are
you go to work for tobacco
(after beat) You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values
You go to tobacco
Tobacco is a sales culture
Market and sell enormous volume
Go to a lot of golf tournaments
The hell with everything else
(beat) What are you doing
Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place
(deadly honest) can't talk about it
The work  was supposed to do
might have had some positive effect
don't know
it could have been beneficial
(bitterness there) Mostly,  got paid a lot
took the money
My wife was happy
My kids had good medical
Good schools
Got a great house
(simply) mean, what the hell is wrong with that
He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation
Nothing's wrong with that
That's it; you're making money
you're providing for your family
What could be wrong with that
It's quiet
After some moments
've always thought of myself
as a man of science
That's what's wrong with it
Then
you're in a state of conflict, Jeff
Jeffrey doesn't say anything
(') Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really do need to know
and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing
On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple
You do so
You say nothing
You do nothing
There's only one guy who can figure that out for you
And that's you
All by yourself
Lowell's evenhanded
is it too evenhanded
As Wigand contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet
Then Wigand sees the time
've got to go pick up the girls
They only had half a day
Lowell nods
Jeffrey starts the car
The windshield wipers screech on a dry window
Their eyes meet
As they drive off
we  on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock
,  ,   - We've entered mid-scene
monitor on a cart plays a 1/2- inch  of a - broadcast
Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco
in front of a bas relief of the American eagle
Each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not, etc
() He referred to this
the Seven Dwarfs
() What "Seven Dwarfs
" () The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco
Referred to this
Said they should be afraid of him
assume, afraid of what he could reveal
(to Staff Lawyers) Now, you tell me
What does this guy have to say that threatens these people
And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with two staff Lawyers,   and  , sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area
Beyond them are the "60 " offices, workstations, piles of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling, all tuned to  programming
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"
Hardly new news
No shit
What's this
(re:  video) What that is is tobacco's standard defense
It's the "we don't know" litany:  "Addiction
We believe not
Disease
We don't know
We take a bunch of leaves, roll 'em together
You smoke 'em
After that
You're on your own
We don't know
" (beat) So
tells me nothing
(beat) Besides, you'll never get what he's got
Why not
Because of this guy's confidentiality agreement, he is never gonna be able to talk to you
That's not good enough
This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America
He's a corporate officer
You never get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies
This guy is the ultimate insider
He's got something to say; he wants to say it;  want it on "60 Minutes
" Doesn't matter what he wants Am  missing something here
What do you mean, Mike
He's got a corporate secrecy agreement
Give me a break
This is a public-health issue, like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or
some company dumping cyanide into the East River
Issues like that
He can talk, we can air it
They've got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement
(re:  his coffee) Pass the milk
(does) They don't need the right
They've got the money
The unlimited checkbook
That's how Big Tobacco wins every time
On everything
They spend you to death
$600 million a year in outside legal
Chadbourne-Parke
Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis
Listen
and Ford, they get nailed after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up
Right
These clowns have never
mean ever
Not even once
not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product
have ever lost a personal-injury lawsuit
On this case, they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach, anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian
Tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years
'm telling you, they bat a thousand
Every time
He knows that
That's why he's not gonna talk to you
Lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else
Now
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way
What do you mean
We got a guy
who wants to talk but he's constrained
(beat) What if he were "compelled"
(eating) Oh, torture
Great ratings
What do you mean compelled
(seriously) mean compelled by a Justice Department, state courts, be a witness
That would cut through any confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it
Yeah
What does that do
What do you mean, what's it do
What  mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law
It's on record, it's out
It's no secret anymore
So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate
It's out in the world
(nods) If you could engineer it into the court record, you might have something
They would have a helluva time trying to restrain his speech then, wouldn't they
Pause
(still skeptical) Yeah, but what venue
And where does he get - does he have killer attorneys
don't think he's got any attorneys
He's gonna need attorneys who aren't afraid of risking years of litigation
And millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs
What do you say, Mike
What do you think
(pause) Even if he gets the defense team, will he go for it
,  - you're awfully overqualified, Dr
Wigand
The aftermath of a high school lunch
Tables, covered with litter, as far as the eye can see
And we see Jeffrey sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the High School Principal,  , drinking cups of coffee
(after a beat, awkward) 'm trying to
start a new career believe  could be a good teacher
She's quiet
She senses this applicant has a lot on his mind
Let me give it some thought
(selling) and not a lot of companies in the health-care field hire ex-tobacco scientists
She nods, studying him
They get up
' ,  - The house is nearly empty
Liane, arms folded across her chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room
Jeffrey comes down the stairs
That's it
And it's quiet
And Liane holds herself, overcome
(beat) That's where our babies were born
Debbie took her first steps, right there
in the grass
And they're quiet
(') didn't plan on this
Liane looks at him, afraid
And as he moves to hold her
Hey, hey, hey, c'mon
'mon
We can make this work for us
Okay
It's just
it's a smaller scale
Simpler
easier
more time
More time together
More time with the kids
More time for us, okay
It's just
Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day
This is gonna be better
This is gonna be better
And instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together
And as they stand in the empty house
'   - We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen
Country- western music is playing on a radio
And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet
And, then, stops and looks out the window
She tightens a knob on a cabinet
There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees
'  ,   - Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises
We see the house, now
It's a small, one story
Deborah sees her mom and waves
It's an image from the 1950's post-war boom
Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass
'  #2,  - Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him
His arm is draped over her, protectively
There's a sound
He turns
And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in the doorway
Hey, baby
What's wrong
(terrified, whispers) What's that outside, Daddy
Did you see somebody or did you hear them
heard them
Where
In the backyard
Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and trousers
' ,  - Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his "office" is now
Unpacked boxes are on the floor
He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun
Barbara followed him
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay
Why don't you just sit up at the desk
Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay
What are you gonna draw me, baby
An animal, something like that
You stay down here until Daddy gets back
alright, Barbara
You stay down here
He keeps it hidden from Barbara
He goes up the stairs
'  #2,  - It's still
He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner
'  #2,  - Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her
She goes up the stairs to follow after her father
'  #2,  - Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners
Sudden rustling
He spins, gun ready
And the yellow eyes of a  stare at him
(to himself) You almost got your damn head blown off
The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth
Jeffrey starts to go
but he sees something and stops
Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door
Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped on
and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct, fresh, deep
'  () Daddy
Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it
, as he covers, trying to keep from his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions
(reassuring her) It's just a raccoon, baby
nothing
He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her back inside
(') They're nocturnal
You know what that means
That means that they only come out at nighttime
He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside
'    - The Phone suddenly
Lowell asleep, alone
He gets it
(sleepy) Yeah
'  ,  - It's dark, save a light from the living room
Liane, in bed, seemingly sleeping
And we see Jeffrey, just outside their door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved wall, a drink at his side on the telephone
man with no one to talk to
(after a beat) Lowell
Jeffrey Wigand
' ,  - Lowell sits up
'  () Is it too late
No
No, it's okay
How's - how's the new place
'   - The new place
New
' ,  - (intuiting) You okay
'  () Sure
Lowell knows he isn't
You know,  was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway
(beat) How are your kids handling the new house
'  ,  - Good
(beat) You have kids
'  () We have a couple
One's hers, one's mine
Everybody uses a different name
(wry) Modern marriage
(beat) How's Liane
She's okay
He looks at Liane for beat
We  his  in medium shot
Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room
(') Hold on a minute, Lowell
(after a beat) somebody
may be following me don't know
They came on the property
'  () What do you mean followed you
Did you call the police
don't want to be paranoid
mean, maybe it's a game
Some kind of mind game
'  () Well, what do you really think, though
don't know what the fuck really think
Are they doing it
Is some crank doing it
Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid
Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what  think
don't know
don't fucking know
And it's quiet again
' ,  - Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears
Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what happened
' ,  - And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as
Well, no, look
mean, there was a footprint
Forget it
It's probably not important at all
(beat) You know,  got a job now
'm teaching high school
Japanese and Chemistry
(beat) So, what were you calling about
'  () You called me
He takes another drink
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow
So, what about
(after a beat) Oh, yes, yes, yes,  did
wanted to talk to you
wanted to hook up and talk to you
About what we were talking about in your car
okay
(after a beat) Makes you feel good
Putting what you know to use
Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity
How'd you know that, Lowell
It's obvious, isn't it
He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep
(') Hello
You there Yeah
Look, thanks for talking
'm sorry  woke you up
It's okay
Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up
but the phone  right away
Lowell
But there's thick silence
(') Who is this
Do not call here
Do not
They hang up
And he realizes he's talking to a
He hangs up
And as he sits in the patch of light from a street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all night guarding his family
- And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the trapezoid of light
And as we  along her side, we come upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears
her reaction to his raging on the phone
She's far from "
" ,
- And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room
traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take their order
Wigand conversing with her in Japanese
The Waitress formally nods, and leaves
What did you get us
Tempura
And Wigand drinks some more saki
(cont'd) The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to  La Jolla with Professor
Marcus
Marcuse
Yeah
He was my mentor
He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s
and on me, personally
Next to your father
My father
What the hell's that got to do with my father
Is that why you became a journalist
Then you get to ask all the questions
You charge by the hour
My father was a mechanical engineer
most ingenious man  ever knew
Well, my father left us when  was five- years old
He was not the most ingenious man  ever knew
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson
If you decide to go on "60 Minutes,"  got to know everything about why you got fired
Why
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you got to know what they're gonna throw
You understand
(concedes) drink
couple of occasions more than should have
(thinks) was cited for shoplifting once
But it was a mistake
(hesitant, after a beat) pushed Liane one time
We were both stressed out because of the pressure
She went to her mother's
(out of the blue) got fired because when  get angry have difficulty censoring myself
And don't like to be pushed around
'm not pushing you around
(after a beat) 'm asking you questions
'm just a commodity to you, aren't could be anything
Right
Anything worth putting on between commercials
(honest) to a network, probably, we're all commodities
(beat) To me
You are not a commodity
What you are is important
And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"
(cont'd) You go public and thirty-million people hear what you got to say, nothing,  mean nothing, will ever be the same again
Wigand doesn't react
(cont'd) You believe that
(skeptical) No
You should
Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend
And that's the power you have
You believe that believe that
Yes,  believe that
You believe that because you get information out to people
something happens
Yes
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job
Having status
And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism
Something to do on a Sunday night
And maybe it won't change a fucking thing
And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry
Used up
Broke, alone
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here
never abandoned a source
don't think you really understand -- (running over) No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism
have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend
And what are you puttin' up
You're puttin' up words
Words
While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, been out in the world , giving my word and backing it up with action
Lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of Wigand, to telling Jeff to take his story and stick it up his ass
(cont'd) Now, are you going to go do this thing, or not
Wigand abruptly rises
(surprisingly mild) said 'd call the kids before they went to bed
Onisa
And turning, he crosses the restaurant
And that's where it hangs
,   - And we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay from what we will learn is Lowell's "
Blue" on police corruption in New Orleans
Lowell,   (his editor), Debbie and an intense wearing glasses, an Intern, looking at the cut
All the police are on horseback lots of cops on horses Lowell is waiting for a call to go through
The stringer was supposed to be shooting -roll on street cops in New Orleans
What's with all the horses
Camera guy's got a thing about mounted police
(re:  horses) Don't any of these guys ride in cars or walk
How long did he stay on this
What was he seeing
(into phone) Yes, hello
'm trying to reach Mr
Richard Scruggs
- And we see the , a fit-looking, unassuming man, wearing aviator glasses, in his late forties
heavyset Man in his forties, riding up in the co-pilot's seat we'll come to know as
The Pilot's on a headset
He has a distinctive Southern accent
This is Richard Scruggs
Could you hold on one second, please
(to Lowell) Lowell,  got him on the phone
'  () Hello, 'm Lowell Bergman
Hold on
Mobile approach
this is Lear November 643
Over
'  () Go ahead 643
(after a beat) Request a flight level 220, on a heading of 284 degrees
Over
(after a beat) Mr
Bergman
Yes, 'm right here
Could you call me back on a hard line
Alright
Area code 212-555-0199
'll call you then
,    - Through the window, we see Scruggs' plane being refueled while Scruggs and Motley in a run-down lounge are talking on a   with Lowell
They've taken over the Secretary's office for privacy
(re:  footage) What do we do with that
The phone rings
don't know
'  () Richard Scruggs
you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not
(nods) That's right
(after a beat) Well, 'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there
What's your interest in this, Mr
Bergman
Well, he may tape an interview with us
And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection
It could work
If it's public record, it's public record
Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation
He sure as hell will
(a beat) Has he decided to go public
Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know
Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him
So, is your man truly committed
Well, actually, no
Well, he's on the fence
That's the point
Scruggs and Motley exchange a look
Motley shrugs
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do
Well, would you want him to call you
Or, you want to call him
How do you want to do it
(no nonsense) It would be better if he called us
Yeah
Alright
Okay
Thank you
At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of Jeffrey Wigand
Scruggs disconnects
(cont'd) Shit
,   - (contemplating phone; to Debbie re:  show) Oh, we need cops on the street
We don't need them on horses
don't know what he was thinking
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish
Alright, alright
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon
'll shoot the fucking thing myself
on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding crowd
'  ,  - Liane cooking dinner, making pasta
Ingredients, diced tomato, basil, are neatly ordered
She's waiting for water to boil
The kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette
It's an idle moment
She's dazed-out watching them
What are you cooking
'm cooking pasta primavera
Oh,  love that stuff
And now she hears from the basement the   on Jeffrey's computer
It's a tiny bell, incessant
She crosses to the basement stairs
'm going to have to go downstairs
'  ,   - Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer
And she  an incoming -mail icon - a large letter with wings - flying repetitively across the screen
The bell  is louder
She calls-up the -mail
On the screen in large  letters: And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and
Debbie, Barbara
Debbie
' ,  - Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something
And he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a monument of threat, a single hollow point
38
He freezes
And simultaneously
Liane and the Girls are running toward him
like in a bad fucking dream
He's looking at them
Liane is saying something about -mail, but his slow-motion attention is still arrested by the statuesque bullet
As they close on him
,    - And we see Lowell lit by
We're at a crime scene
Uniformed cops on horseback
Just arrived, the Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot -roll
What happened
Dispatch received a call of shots fired in the area
Uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject shot to death
Was it gang related
There's no indication as far as a tag or an advertisement
Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone
(answering) Excuse me
Yeah
' ,  - They're terrorizing us
Death threats
To my family My kids
'  () What are you talking about
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox
Jeff, call the  right away
They do this with impunity
Jeff
They get to go home at night
What does it cost these people to do this to us
Nothing
My girls are crying, so fuck them
want to tape
'm done thinking about it
'  () (frustrated) heard you
But  got to arrange a legal defense first
got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record
(cuts in) Then hold it off the air until you got that
But  want to go to New York
And  want to go on the record
Right now
Good
But Jeff
'll call them, Lowell
' ,  - And two older, local   #1 and #2 are sitting with Jeffrey in his living room
#2 Did you handle the round, Mr
Wigand
Yes, 'm afraid  did
#1 We won't be able to lift usable prints
#2 Do you own a gun, Mr
Wigand
gun
Yes
#2 What caliber is your gun
What caliber is my gun
#2 Yes, sir
What caliber is your gun
(a dawning realization) What does that have to do with the price of tea in China
Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her, takes her out of the room
(') (a beat, realizing) You think  put that bullet in the mailbox myself
#2 If we could take a look, Mr
Wigand
And he gets up
They follow him into the bedroom
He unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun, giving it to one of the Agents
#1 Why do you keep this gun
don't think it's unconstitutional yet to own a gun
'm a target shooter
#2 That bullet was for a
38 caliber
Do you own a
38
Yes,  do
38 Target Master
In my gun safe downstairs
45 Gold Cup 22 target pistol
So what
#2 (after a beat) Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr
Wigand
Yes
Yes,  do
(beat) Yes,  get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox
And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs
'  () (upset) didn't tell you that so you could just pick it up and take it away
Jeffrey
And we see Liane following  Agent #3, coming up the stairs from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's computer
What's going on
told him that you had an -mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "" up, they were going to kill you
Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed by #2
Jeffrey runs out after them
'  - (outraged) You can't take that
It's personal property
#2 ( #3) We have a search warrant, Mr
Wigand
There's been a death threat
(after him) my files
Personal correspondence
Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of their car
And  Agent #1, the
38 bullet in a baggie, comes out of the house
(') letters to my brother
my will
His shoes slip on the grass and he falls
And the  are getting into their car
And  have come out, watching them
Liane and the girls, standing halfway down the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them
She and Jeffrey look at each other
Will she go to him or not
She goes to him as he rises
(cont'd) That computer has everything
#2 You alright, Mr
Wigand
#1 We need to take a look at your gun safe, Mr
Wigand
,    - (interrupts) 'm telling you, your agents in that office are acting improperly
Now, who are they trying to protect
And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the Bureau ()
He's completely distracted, focused on agent travel orders
'  () Let me tell you something, Lowell
Look, look, look
You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville
got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up
gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into Alright
When  get a chance, 'll give it a look
(heated) You better take a good look
Because 'm getting two things:  pissed off and curious
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire
Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak
' ,  - (beat) 'll give it a look
You're getting my drift
'll give it a look
He hangs up
,    ,   - And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining room, having ordered dinner
So, is everything okay
How are the rooms
Comfortable
(to Mike) Yes, very
You know,  enjoy your work so much
when you're talking to somebody,  always feel like 'm right there
And she laughs
Thank you got saying that
Do you think we could talk about the taping
Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired
And others will deal
(not sure she quite heard) taping
(beat) What are you taping
'm doing an interview
(whispers) An interview
Do you know what they will do to us
thought
Sorry
But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room
And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move
(trying to intervene) Liane, this is a preliminary
(after a beat) You didn't tell her we were taping
What did she think she was coming to New York for
to talk about it
To think about it
had a plan to ease her into it
But, really -  didn't know how to do that
Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar
Oh, man
Who are these people
(frustrated) Ordinary people
Under extraordinary pressure, Mike
What the hell do you expect
Grace and consistency
And Lowell leaves the table
And as Mike Wallace sits at the table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing there
,    - Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest
,  - And we see a small   separated by flats and black curtains from other  News sets
Cameras are set up
,  - And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor, sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him, under the lights, taping an interview
Lowell, off camera
You heard Mr
Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive
(nods) believe Mr
Sandefur perjured himself because  watched those testimonies very carefully
Lowell's reaction
Jeffrey's statements are stunning and powerful revelations
and dangerous ones to make
All of us did
There was this whole line of people
whole line of CEOs up there all swearing
Part of the reason 'm here is  felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated what is common language within the company
we are in the nicotine delivery business
And that's what cigarettes are for
delivery device for nicotine
delivery device for nicotine
Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix
You're gonna get your fix
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia
(nods) The process is known as "impact boosting
"  While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it
There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry
"  It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system
,  - The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin
"  When  came on board at &, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful
wanted it out immediately
was told that it would affect sales, so should mind my own business constructed a memo to Mr
Sandefur indicating  could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur
sent the document forward to Sandefur
was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously Most certainly
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur,  of Brown & Williamson had you fired
And the reason he gave you
Poor communication skills
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward
You wish you hadn't blown the whistle
Yeah, there are times  wish  hadn't done it
There are times  feel compelled to do it
If you asked me would  do it again
Do  think it's worth it
Yeah,  think it's worth it
,  - Not too many kids paying attention
Meanwhile, Jeffrey has written his name on the blackboard
Hi
(in unison) Hi
My name is Jeff Wigand
You can call me Mr
Wigand; you can call me Dr
Wigand-- have a Ph
in biochemistry and endocrinology; you can call me Jeff
(beat) Anything else you want to call me
you'll have to do so in private
(a few kids smile) Okay
find chemistry to be magical
find it an adventure
An exploration into the building blocks of our physical universe
(beat) So, how many of you have taken chemistry before
Nobody raises their hands
(') (easy smile) Okay
've never taught it before, so we're gonna be fine
couple of laughs
And we feel Jeffrey, for the first time is in a milieu that suits him
(cont'd) Our first experiment is
(holds up cigarette lighter) going to be measuring the molecular weight of butane
' Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets and -6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses
He's on line three
Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with students
Hello
Mr
Scruggs, Jeff Wigand
Lowell Bergman said  should give you a call
' My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and  have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness
(beat) If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you
When should we do this
'  #2,  - Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway
Seeing a in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car
But the front door's open
So instead of chasing after, he runs inside
' ,   - / And he sees another Man is in the living room
Who the hell are you
What are you doing in my house
And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room
It's okay, Jeff
Mr
Wigand, you need to speak to
(wry) It's okay
You got your own security now
Wigand catches his breath
Lowell,  can't afford -- they "volunteered
"   friend owns a large security company
How are you doing, Mr
Wigand
'm Jon Talifaro
There'll be three of us on detail
(crossing through) 'm going to the store
Please explain our new "houseguests" to your children
And Wigand looks at Lowell
Barbara comes into the living room and holds onto her father's leg
called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi
heard
'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation
So 'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition
know
'm going to go there tonight
Did you have a good day
Yes,  did
had a great day
Coffee, Lowell
Yeah
(to kids) Want to play that game we were playing before
You know,  think you got it up to five
was ahead of you
She goes over and holds his hand
And as he holds her hand, seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance connects with Lowell
,  '  - We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking by
And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink
There's a pall you could cut with a knife
moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden
He stops to wash his hands in the sink
Please don't wash your hands in the sink
Where should  wash them
Use the bathroom
What's the difference
That's for food
But he ignores her, washing his hands
And she turns the water off
He turns it back on
He thinks, then turns it off
Then she turns it on (cont'd) Leave it on
Just leave it on, okay
And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger repressed
For Jeffrey, everything else and now this
The running faucet
' ,  - The house on the quiet suburban street
Security Guard, incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front porch in a metal porch chair
,  '  - And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk, alone in the basement, listening to classical music
He instinctively turns
And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has come down to sit on the basement stairs
He looks over at her
And he thinks she's come down to make up
And all she really wants him to do is say, " need you
"  But he can't
And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's said
It's quiet
She puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets
And she starts to cry
don't think  can do this
want to stand by my husband
really do, Jeffrey
But  don't think  can do this anymore
am so sorry
Can we talk about this when  get back
Yes
Jeffrey
She goes back up the stairs
And as Jeffrey sits in the basement, and the music plays
- We see Jeffrey and his Security Man
He passes a small Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for donations
And, now, he passes through the metal detector
He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind every so often to see if anybody is following him
As he passes Gate 3, he  over his shoulder
(friendly) Jeff
Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of  at his chest
(') (nasty) You've been served
And he turns and walks off
And as Jeffrey looks down at the subpoenas
'  - 7:00
Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs' kitchen around a semi-circular counter
Coffee and sweet rolls
It's casual
No one's dressed for court
Scruggs has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas
About Motley, we sense power held in reserve
Now, what this one is, is a temporary restraining order, a gag order, issued by a Kentucky court
Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair
(') (introducing) Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore
Good to meet you, Dr
Wigand
Mike's our Attorney General down here
(to Moore) was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today
Right
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out
(to Jeffrey) However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order
(after a beat) Dr
Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you
'm not free to testify
here
That's right
If you violate the Kentucky order, when you step foot back in Kentucky, they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you
And you ought to know that
And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he might go to jail
Jail
Possibly, yes
That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today
That's right
How does one
"go
to
jail
"  What does my family do
Go on welfare
If my wife has to work
Who's going to look after the kids
Put food on the table
My children need me
If 'm not teaching
there's no medical
no medical
even on co-pay, that's like
Tuition
Dr
Wigand, listen, you may not be able to do this thing
As  understand from Dick, you're our key witness
And, hope you don't withdraw
guess we'd all understand if you did
(at watch) Guys, 've got to go
'm gonna be late for court
'll see y'all a little later
Dr
Wigand, good luck
He leaves
And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened
Having shaken the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs and Motley, thinking about consequences
know what you're facing, Jeff
And, think  know how you're feeling
Jeffrey's skeptical anybody could know "how it is"
(') (low, personal) In the Navy  flew -6's off carriers
In combat, events have a duration of seconds, sometimes minutes
But what you're going through goes on day in and day out
Whether you're ready for it or not, week in, week out
Month after month after month
Whether you're up or whether you're down
You're assaulted psychologically
You're assaulted financially, which is its own special kind of violence
Because it's directed at your kids
what school can you afford
How will that affect their lives
You're asking yourself:  Will that limit what they may become
You feel your whole family's future's compromised
held hostage
(after a beat) do know how it is
' , ,  - white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and gables
a large front lawn with weeping willows
And we see Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider, waiting alone on the expansive lawn
The front door opens
Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat comes out and crosses the driveway
Then Jeffrey coming out with Motley
Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment and then heads towards his car
Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes down over to Lowell on the lawn
And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at the Gulf
And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi State Police cars
An armed camp
Other men in suits, Lawyers and state officials, wait
Ron Motley gets in his car and drives away
You attract a crowd
(smiles, wry) Yeah, great
heard about the Kentucky gag order
don't know what to do
And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their coats
He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by
He watches its slow progress
And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking
And Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside Lowell
,  , ,  - Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him
And we  the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers
Some hang out by their cars, killing time
It's a tailgate party
Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus
They're all here for Jeff's deposition
The scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"
into which Motley enters
' , ,  - Jeffrey contemplating
, ,  - One  , an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is on his cell phone
(into phone) Hold on a second
(seeing Motley enter; to Jr
Lawyer) Would you please ask Mr
Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not
crosses to Motley
' ,  - Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea
Trying to decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence moment
He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs
Then
it's the three men, standing on the lawn
Time seems to slow
all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically
(severely conflicted) can't seem to find
the criteria to decide
It's too big a decision to make without being resolved
in my own mind
They're quiet
Jeffrey, getting nowhere
Lowell offers
Maybe things have changed
Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future
And something just got resolved
He asks Lowell, rhetorically
What's changed
(unsure) You mean
since this morning
No
mean since whenever
Nothing's changed
Wigand looks at them
He found his own answer
(') Fuck it
Let's go to court
And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat flawed, very courageous man
(to unseen staff) Dr
Wigand would like to leave now
And there's a sudden flurry of activity
Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car
Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately
Police, State Officials, run to their cars
Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position
'  -  - in the back seat with Scruggs
The driver's a State Policeman
Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by
It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow
And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus
, ,  - Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars
And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse
The caravan stops
First, Scruggs gets out
moment, then Jeffrey appears
And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing
Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd
Moore appears at courtroom door (already there)
And as he's whisked away into the courtroom
, ,  - The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet
Cell phones are hung up
Newspapers are put away
Jackets are donned
This is now very serious business
Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on him
Okay, Jeff, 'm going to sit you down at that table over there
'm going to start as fast as possible
don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay
Let's go
Good luck, Doc
Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair
He settles in
Please stand
Raise your right hand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God
do
You may be seated
You understand, Dr
Wigand, you are under oath
This is a sworn deposition
There's no judge
It's not a trial
(understatement of the century) Will you state your name for the record
(after a beat) Jeffrey
Wigand
He spells it for them
, ,  - Lowell, waiting with the other journalists
Got any idea what's going on in there
No,  don't have a clue
, ,  - Motley still conducting the inquiry
And the tobacco lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce
That is correct
In other words, it acts as a drug
Object to the form of the question
It acts as a drug on the body
Object to the form
It acts as a
Object
There an echo in here
Your objection's been recorded
She typed it into her little machine over there
It's on the record
So now 'll proceed with my deposition of my witness
Does it act as a drug
(shouts) Dr
Wigand
am instructing you (to Wigand) not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky
That means you don't talk
(beat) Mr
Motley, we have rights, here
(explodes) Oh, you got rights and lefts
Ups and downs and middles
So what
You don't get to instruct anything around here
This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky This is the sovereign State of Mississippi 's proceeding
Wipe that smirk off your face
Dr
Wigand's deposition will be part of this record
And 'm going to take my witness' testimony
Whether the hell you like it or not
(to Wigand) Answer the question, Dr
(slams it home) Yes
It produces a physiological response, which meets the definition of a drug
Nicotine is associated with impact, with satisfaction
It has a pharmacological effect that crosses the blood-brain barrier intact
Thank you, Doctor
Thank you
' , ,  - Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain
There's a slight sound
He turns
And Jeffrey's come outside
He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees
They're quiet
They share a look
They nod to each other
The smallest nod of accomplishment
And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in Pascagoula, Mississippi
,   - We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as yesterday
He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the show, the net result of his architecture of events, his combination of persuasion and integrity
We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey
(on monitor) "Part of the reason 'm here is  felt that their representation clearly, at least within
" Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive
"  Run that on-camera
Then cut right to Wigand with " believe they perjured
"  Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath
Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the -side
Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other Editors, Felling
They have gathered behind Lowell in the doorway
This is a hot show and it's generated excitement among Lowell's co-workers
And while Baldo cuts, we see
,     - the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's story come together
Beyond them, approaching, is Mike Wallace, coming to work
(leaving) helluva show, Mike
Explosive material
People separate as Mike pushes in
Lowell sees Mike
While Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid
(to Mike) It went great in Mississippi, Mike
Good
Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket
heard Wigand's deposition got sealed
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world
(seriously) "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story,  believe we're sitting on an exclusive
like that Corporate has some questions
We've got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning
When's the air date
(to Lowell) Excuse me, Lowell
Sharon's on line 3
Tell her 'll call her back in ten
Here we go
Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence
And we Sandefur in - states " believe that nicotine is not addictive
"  Wigand in matching - states " believe he perjured himself
"  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "
the whole line of people, the whole line of 's up there, all swearing that
"  And Wigand says off-screen with great emphasis "Part of the reason 'm here is  "
and it cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "" resound and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew
We're a nicotine delivery business
"  We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful
- We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown Louisville
- It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security men
He's coming home under the cover of darkness
They pass a   on the freeway shoulder
Jeffrey turns to stare at it
They turn off onto city streets and stop at a light
Jeffrey's nervous
Jeffrey instinctively turns Police Car stops alongside
The Policeman looks at him
Eyes meet
Jeffrey looks away
The signal takes forever
It changes
And as the Police Car moves off
'  - The car's stopped at the curb
Jeffrey gets out
He starts up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home
'  - The house is quiet, dark
Too quiet
Too dark
Something isn't right
He crosses to one of the children's rooms
the master bedroom
The lights are on
Both rooms are empty
He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for him
He opens it
He sits heavily in a chair, reading the note
The Security Guard peers
And as Jeffrey sits in the silent house, the hero come home
,  - We're at a table
Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while ,   , enters with the President of  News,
Shall  send for coffee
Sorry 'm late
No, no, we're fine
Are you sure
Also there is Don Hewitt
Caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished
They nod
They don't need coffee
(') Alright,  thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently, "tortious interference
" (beat) If two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be sued for damages for interfering
hence, "tortious interference
" Interfering
That's what we do
think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time
This is a news organization
People are always telling us things they shouldn't
We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest
And if it is, we air it
After we corroborate it
That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show
(impatient, now) Anything else
And "60 Minutes'" verification is exact
And precise
And don't think it would hurt to make sure you're right
on this one
Why
You think we have liability
What's the  News' position, Eric
There's a possibility, it's rather remote
But one we have to check on, Mike
've retained outside counsel to do exactly that
On a segment,  might add, that's already rife with problems
What does that mean
"Rife with --
" 'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him
(cuts in) And, 'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity
(trying to control his anger) His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi
(historic) Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard
for everyone else
Whatever that means
(wry) Well, as a "standard"
'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth
" Well, with tortious interference, 'm afraid
the greater the truth, the greater the damage
Come again
They own the information he's disclosing
The truer it is, the greater the damage to them
If he lied, he didn't disclose their information
And the damages are smaller
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"
You said "on this one
"  What about "this one"
And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice
After a beat
(familiar, seductive) If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike
but, if it did
And we aired this segment
And  was sued by Brown & Williamson
think we could be at grave risk
(a beat) How grace
(and she's been waiting for this) Well, at the end of the day
because of your segment
the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
could own As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps
She glances at it
(') You know,  am sorry
But 'm due upstairs
She gets up, gathering her things
Is  corporate telling  News do not go to air with this story
You're getting ahead of yourself
We're all in this together
We're all We'll find out soon
Thank you, gentlemen
And taking up her briefcase, she leaves
Don and Mike rise
"Tortious interference"
Sounds like a disease caught by a radio
(to Mike) Lunch
Sure
(to Lowell) Don't worry, we call the shots around here
Lowell finds himself angry and alone
He crosses to the window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work
'  () Hello
(into phone) Debbie, it's me
want you to check some filings and give me John Wilson's number at Bear-Stern
, '  - What now
Kluster's coming over
Hewitt's on an unrelated call
Lowell crosses to look out the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these people
The door opens, and Eric Kluster, the President of News enters
Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don
Hewitt hangs up the phone
(') There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, 've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview
So, what happened to Ms
Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap
That's happening
And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can
'm not touching my film
'm afraid you are
No, 'm not
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell
If you like,  can assign another producer to edit your show
Lowell's stunned
He looks like he's been hit with a hammer
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"
It's an alternate version
So what if we have an alternate version
And  don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable
(wry) So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr
Rather's been complaining about his chair again
(laughter) As they start to leave
(mild) Before you go
And Lowell takes out
(') discovered this
filing
(he gets their attention) For the sale of the  Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation
What
Yeah,  heard rumors
It's not a rumor
It's a sale
(rhetorical answer) If Tisch can unload  for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not
(serene) And what are you implying
(to Kluster) 'm not implying
'm quoting
More vested interests
(reading from  filing) "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger
(beat) Ms
Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of News, 3
9 million
Mr
Eric Kluster, President of  News, 1
4 million
" Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money
They work for free
And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer
does not do that
And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity
No, 'm questioning your hearing
You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference
"   hear
"Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of  to Westinghouse
" hear
"Shut the segment down
Cut Wigand loose
Obey orders
And fuck off
"  That's what  hear
You're exaggerating
am
You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out
To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television
do
deliver him
He sits
He talks
He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement
And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in
history
And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth
Yes
Is it newsworthy
Yes
Are we gonna air it
Of course not
Why
Because he's not telling the truth
No
Because he is telling the truth
That's why we're not going to air it
And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets
You are a fanatic
An anarchist
You know that
If we can't have a whole show, then  want half a show rather than no show
But oh, no, not you
You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk
'mon, what are you
And are you a businessman
Or are you a newsman
Because that happens to be what Mike and do for a living
Lowell
(runs on) "Put the corporation at risk"
Give me a fucking break
Lowell
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do on the line
Lowell
What
'm with Don on this
And there it is
' ,  - We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard
She turns, seeing him standing behind her
After a moment
She knows
What's wrong
They're killing the Wigand interview
What
They're pretending it's process
Bullshit, it's foregone
(beat) What are you and Mike going to do
'm alone on this
(beat) Oh, baby
And the phone
Sharon goes in the house to get it
She comes back out
(') (after a beat) Jeffrey Wigand
' ,  - Jeffrey
,  - And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch in a hotel room
And we see his belongings, clothing, some boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his world, are around the room
'  () Jeffrey, how are you
How's the family, okay
There is - there is no family
'  () What do you mean there is no family
Liane has filed for divorce
' ,  - And Lowell's dead quiet
,  - And, so,  moved out
see the girls a couple of days a week
'  () (concerned) Where you staying now
(sarcastic) Our favorite hotel, honey
checked into Room 930
Odd choice
Huh
And we don't know what he means by that
' ,  - The last of the daylight shadows his office
(after a beat) don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so 'll say it
They do not want to air it
(stops) What
&  may have threatened litigation
is on the block
(a beat) But you,  mean,  know how
No
No
No, what
do not think that you "know" for me
what it is to walk in my shoes
(beat) for my kids to have seen it
for them to know why 've put them through what did
the public airing of that
the testament to why  did what did
you're telling me is not going to see the light of day
Lowell's quiet
And Jeffrey starts to hang up
Jeff
And Jeffrey hangs up
'  ,  - () - Jeffrey silently sitting in the chair
We   and see why he's been purposely sitting there
Why he's chosen this room
Directly across the street is the Brown & Williamson Building
The lights are on
The building lit up
And in an upstairs office Brown & Williamson lawyers, moving around a conference room, talking
And as Jeffrey looks out the window
,    - peaceful, suburban street
Small houses (
) from , in a raincoat, getting out of a car, going up the walk
He knocks on the door
Some moments
Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an electric cart answers the door
Mrs
Wigand
It hasn't been Mrs
Wigand for some time
Well, 'm an investigator and  was - was wondering if  could ask you a couple of questions about that
Alright
'   ,   , - And on a  ,  , the woman in the electric cart, giving a taped interview to the
seven months after we were married we found out that  had multiple sclerosis
We   to see John Scanlon and his Staff watching the tape
His firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some of his high-profile clients are on the walls
Scanlon's on the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs
'  () (on television) And, you had a daughter, Diane, with him, is that correct
(on television) Yes, in 1973
(on the phone, whispering) come on, Tommy Sandefur told me himself, he's not gonna allow Brown & Williamson to be demonized to the American public, so  told Peter Jennings and
hold on
He stops, listening to the videotape
'  () (on television) Would it be fair to say when he divorced you he left you in a precarious situation
You had multiple sclerosis; you had a small child to raise
(ignoring that part; to staff) Mention that part in the executive summary and in the chapters "First Wife" and "Estrangement of Daughter
" (beat; into phone) So,  was telling Pete,  said, "You've been taken in by this guy
(on television) Yes
(beat) But you have to understand, the divorce was something that we both wanted
He's a total bullshit artist
He's a shoplifter
He's a convicted shoplifter
And as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court records, all from Louisville, all about Jeffrey
We understand the war has only been begun
, "60 ," , '  - Lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him, an immovable force, sitting behind his desk
Hewitt appears in his doorway
(after a beat, cold) So, what are you going to do
Well, what do you think 'm going to do
Quit in protest
'm not going to do that
(surprised) You're taking "no" for an answer
No
'm not going to take "no" for an answer
No
Then what are you going to do
Hewitt looks at him
'm staying right here
Doing my job
Fighting to get my show on the air
You don't like it
Hey, 'll tell you what
fire my ass
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr don't think so
(laughs) Take a look at this
This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared
And he gives him a copy of it
(') He would lie about his whole life
Who's going to believe him about anything he says
(a beat, and the coup de grace) The Wall Street Journal 's doing a major story and  think the Post You backed the wrong horse
He turns and starts off along the hall
As he goes
(cont'd) (his parting shot) The version without his interview is going to air the week after next
Lowell watches him walk away
Debbie enters
What was that about
Get me Wigand
Sure
fuck is this
Fuck
,  ,  - '  () (on the phone, upset) You never told me you were married before
that you had a daughter
And Wigand is in the phone booth at the High School
students walking by
(outraged) Well, how is that any of your business
That is not something that you people need to know
His voice carries, a student looks over
'  - (frustrated) Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know
Since when have you become a media expert
,    - (upset) What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too
And he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing students stop, looking at him
' ,  - Oh, my God
'  () (after a beat, lowering his voice, but contentious) You're not even on this anymore
What do you care
Jeff
Wake the fuck up
Everybody is on the line here
If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush
Do you understand
Everything you say
told the truth
Everything you
say And  can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back
Because you keep from me
what they can discover
And they will discover everything
Believe me
,    - Wigand's quiet
He looks out the phone booth
After some moments
(meaning his first wife and their child, upset) was young
was young
confused
We didn't handle it the right way
' ,   - (after a beat) She sued you for back payments of child support
,    - She did not sue me
We had a dispute over money
settled it, she dropped the complaint
(angry) Any other questions
And we'll go back and forth
Yes
Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics
What
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics
(explosive) What kind of shit is this
was not on the team, sparred with the Olympic Team
okay
And we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the
in the raincoat, who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration office, walking towards us along the hallways
Alright
the  Telemarketing Company
Telemarketing Company
(the absurdity) can opener
$39
95 can opener cancelled payment
It was junk
(sarcastic) You ever bounce a check, Lowell
You ever look at another woman's tits
You ever cheat a little on your taxes
(a beat, angry) Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws
The
in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't even glance at him
That's the whole point, Jeffrey
That's the whole point
Anyone's
Everyone's
They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made
They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man
Don't you understand
(shouts) What does this have to do with my testimony
That's not the point
What does this have to do with my testimony
told the truth
It's valid and true and provable
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not
Hello
told the truth
told the truth
And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression
The school bell snaps him out of it
(after a beat) 've got to teach class
've got to go
've got to teach class
(undaunted) And 've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs
(a beat) am trying to protect you, man
Wigand's quiet
(after a beat, the killer) Well,  hope you improve your batting average
And he  the phone down
And as he stands in the phone booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone
,  - the door to the roof
It  open
An enraged Lowell enters and walks out into the cold rain
Like a prize- fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his hands in his jacket pockets
He crosses to the edge of the roof high above the city
He's pissed off
He takes out his cell phone
He dials
Lowell hears background
-   - Twenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear area
One of them, a large man, is   on a cell phone
Hello
'  () (cautious) It's Lowell
Are you guys planning to do a piece on a former top executive in Big Tobacco
You caught me in a news meeting
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie
You bet we are
And  can't talk to you now
We gotta hook up
Sure
Where
's
'll be there
,   - busy New York street
Light mist
And we see Lowell is on the phone in a phone booth
Yeah,  got it
500 pages of it
They looked in every corner of this guy's life
from a spousal abuse charge, to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
Jack, listen to me
Their strategy:  discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal , and then nobody will ever listen to what he's got to say about tobacco
He's dead
Unless  can get this thing knocked down
- townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay
And we see a broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on the phone
His wife,  , sitting across from him on another phone
They're Private Investigators
To make it even a little more attractive, don't know if you're ever gonna get paid
Is there any truth to any of it
That's a good question
"Is there any truth to any of it
"   doubt it
What's their deadline
Soon
Palladinos exchange looks; she nods
Fax me the summary
That's great, Jack
Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter
- on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc
He comes upon a rugged-featured man,   from The New York Times sitting next to Charlie
Hey, Lowell
How are you, Jim
Hey, listen,  hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there
Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically
Really
Hi, Joan
Just then Jim's wife enters
They exchange greetings
Hi, baby
Catch you later
Cooper and his wife leave
Charlie and Lowell are alone in the crowded bar
(') When's your deadline
Monday
Push it
What
Forget it
It's a smear campaign, Charlie
It's drawn from a selectively circulated
(cuts in) Oh, it's real selective
about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented
And it's bullshit
And if 'm right, are you going to put the Journal 's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face
'll take a look at what you got
But 'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so
That's the way it lays
In a different, personal tone
(cont'd) Are you all right
Yeah
Catch you later
,  - And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee
Officer Murabchick
He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him
(cont'd) Officer Muravchick
How are you
'm Sandra Sutherland
How do you do
Fine, thank you
'm doing a background check
Mind if  sit down
,  - An older Man is on the bench
He's just recessed his court
As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack Palladino
He approaches the judge, crossing to a side door
Your honor, could  have a word with you
You presided in a dispute over support payments
,  - Jeffrey Wigand
Yeah,  cited him
,  - (on monitor) is under criticism, because the News program "60 Minutes" will not be presenting an interview
Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful
Tony gets a call as Hewitt enters
What the hell are you doing
What does it look like 'm doing
'm editing
No, not that
'm talking about the Associated Press
They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and
Did you tell them that we were lying
No should have
told them disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original
'm not lying for you
'm not gonna shut up for you
Not on any of it
Hey
'm not going to fire you, okay
Take a vacation
Now
'  - suitcase is on the floor
Lowell, finishing packing up his things from his office
'  () Lowell
decided to preface Sunday's show
did three minutes on the "Evening News
"  You'll want to see it
(beat) Where you going
And he sees Wallace has stopped at his door
've been banished
In lieu of being fired
(disinterested) took off on Tisch
took off on corporate
They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night
don't know
How does that get Wigand on the air
(goes up) Do me a favor, will you
Spare me, for God's sake
Get in the real world
What do you think
'm going to resign in protest
To force it on the air
The answer is "no
"   don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio
(beat) That decision 've already made
(from corridor; to Mike) It just started, Mike
Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits
We dwell on Lowell until he exits
- into the hall
Dan Rather introduced Mike
As Lowell exits, we  Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of Hewitt's office watching
Lowell, disgusted, takes a cursory look and moves towards the elevator But he hears
'  () Where's the rest
Where the hell's the rest
Lowell turns to see Wallace shouting up at the monitors in disbelief
(') You cut it
You cut the guts out of what said Wallace moves in on Kluster
It was a time consideration, Mike
Time
Bullshit
You corporate lackey
Who told you your incompetent little fingers had the requisite skills to edit me
'm trying to Band-Aid a situation, here, and you're too dim to
(interrupts, familiar) Mike
Mike
Mike
"Mike
" It was a big mistake
Now, he turns on her
Zeroing in, getting closer
(') "Mike
"  Try "Mr
Wallace
"  We work in the same corporation doesn't mean we work in the same profession
What are you gonna do now
You gonna finesse me
Lawyer me some more
've been in this profession fifty fucking years
You and the people you work for are destroying the most-respected, the highest-rated, the most-profitable show on this network
- Range Rover pulls up
Charlie Phillips gets out
He crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi
Here
He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work product
(') These are their leads, their sources want you to have your reporters
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin
Have them make their own calls
They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier
(demands) Push the deadline, Charlie
Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/ Sutherland/Lowell work product
Meanwhile
'll push it for a week
Let Milo and Suein go through it
'  #2,  - What do you want to buy him for a gift
He's into kind of little cars, that
That remote control thing
Yeah
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow
Mom
Yes, baby
There's Dad, on
,  - And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar
The television's on, the sound low, the midday news
As Jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on
In his   the impact is: And in local news,  Louisville has gained access to a five-hundred-page dossier on former Brown & Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting
And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of him
' "60 ,"
,  - And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show
(on "60 Minutes") "
thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year, documents that appear to confirm what a former
" And as we look at Jeffrey's face, set in stone
- / (on "60 Minutes") "
Surgeon General and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying
We learned of
" ' ,   - And Don Hewitt in his house in the Hamptons, alone in his bedroom, watching the show
(on "60 Minutes") "
a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public
" ' ,   - (on "60 Minutes") "
that insider was formerly a highly- placed executive with a tobacco company
" ,  - (on "60 Minutes") "
but we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health he might be able to offer
Why
Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for
" ' ,   - Mike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone
As we slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television
(on "60 Minutes") "The management of  has told us that knowing he had that agreement
" And the look on his face says:
- / Lowell silently watching the broadcast
(on "60 Minutes") "
if were to broadcast an interview with him,  could be faced with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit
" ,  - Jeffrey, watching the show
(on "60 Minutes," from the interview with Wigand
) "The fact is, we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and, of course, we cannot show you his face
'
and your confidentiality agreement with

Sue you for making this appearance
" " would bet on it
" (on "60 Minutes") "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers
" Jeffrey, motionless
man, no longer with a face or a voice And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the television
' ,   - , Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair
He stares, ignoring the  programming, on the phone, making a call
- Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings
Yeah
You disappeared on me
How long you staying
(absurd) disappeared on you
(meaning the show) Alright
What did you think
(after a beat) think it was a disgrace
The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too
It's obvious
He hangs up the phone
' ,   - Lowell is on the phone, now
The moon lights the water, the empty beach
He listens as a phone, through , and  and
'  ,  - And we hear the phone
We slowly  across the hotel room
We see on the floor a pair of men's tasseled loafers
discarded sport jacket
And we see Jeffrey, barefoot, sitting in a chair in the center of the room
He's looking out the window at &
The curtains are blowing
And he's still
The sound of the phone  and ,   - '  () Sir, there's still no answer in that room
Alright
Get me the manager's office
' ,  - David
David, you've got a call on line 4
think you better take it
thin Man answers the phone
This is David MacDougal
How can  help you
'  () Mr
MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman
'm a producer for "60 Minutes"
'm concerned with a friend of mine who's staying at your hotel right now
,  - And we see the Hotel Manager, walking along with a Security Guard, and now on Jeffrey's door
And when there is no response, the Manager nods to the Security Guard, the Guard using a pass key, unlocking the door
But the door stops, the chain-lock drawn
The Manager looks in through the chain
and he can see Jeffrey sitting in the chair
Mr
Wigand
Mr
Wigand
Jeffrey's still
The Manager quickly takes a cell phone from the Security Guard
- Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting
'  () (upset) think  need to call the police
He won't respond
No, no
Don't call the police
(urgent) Just tell him 'm on the phone with you
My name is Lowell Bergman
Just tell him that
,  - (through the door, frightened) Mr
Wigand
Mr
Bergman is on the telephone
Jeffrey's quiet
- Did he hear you
'  () You're breaking up
can't hear you
Lowell goes deeper into the water
What about now
'  () What
Hello, can you hear me now
'  ,  - And now the walls behind  into a green daytime garden, the garden behind his house
And as we   Wigand, more walls  into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass
They stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father
And he looks at his children, at an idyll lost
The chair, the man are the only real objects left in the view from inside his head
- Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard, the phone chattering with static
(alarmed) What's happening
'  () (afraid) He doesn't seem to be listening
(on the cell phone, shouts, urgent) Alright, now listen to me
want you - want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone
'  () can't say that
No, you can
Tell him to get on the fucking phone
- (at the door, to Jeffrey, loud) He told me to tell you, to get on
the fucking phone
And even he's surprised by his language
And suddenly Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the Hotel Manager
Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing knee-deep in the water
(on the phone, angry) You manipulated me into this
That's bullshit, Jeff
You greased the rails
greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes
helped him to say yes
Alright
You're not a robot, Jeff
That's all
You got a mind of your own, don't you
(running on) "Up to you, Jeffrey
That's the power you have, Jeffrey
Vital insider information the American public need to know
"  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around
(running on) fought for you
and  still fight for you
You fought for me
(running on) you manipulated me
into where  am now
staring at the Brown & Williamson Building
It's all dark
Except the 10th floor
That's the legal department
That's where they fuck with my life
(beat) Jeffrey, where you going with this
So where you goin'
(quiet) You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey
You think about that
You think about them
:  standing in the room with the blowing curtains
(') 'm running out of heroes, man
(after a beat) Guys like you are in short supply
And for the first time, Wigand smiles
(a beat, wry) Yeah, guys like you, too
And the grave situation passes
(') (after a beat) Where are you, anyway
'm on a leave of absence
Forced vacation
(a rare laugh, his sarcasm) You try and have a good time
(droll) Yeah
Yeah,  will
- / Sharon's cooking across the room
And there's just the sound of the ceiling fan turning
"'m Lowell Bergman, 'm from '60 Minutes
'"  You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call
Maybe Wigand's right
Maybe 'm hooked
What am hooked on
The rush
"60 Minutes"
What the hell for
Infotainment
It's so fucking useless, all of it
(a beat) So, it's a big country with a free press
You can go work somewhere else
Free press
Press is free
for anyone who owns one
Larry Tisch has a free press
Get some perspective, Lowell
got perspective
No, you do not
From my perspective, what's been going on and what 've been doing is ridiculous
It's half-measures
You're not listening
(beat) Really know what you're going to do before you do it
And as the fan squeaks, turning
Lowell stares at Sharon
,  - Between two curved colonnades of -covered trees drives a rental car
, it's Lowell
His  spots a dirty and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out- of-context mountain town
His pager beeps
He looks at it
He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the Moose Lodge
'  () 've got Richard Scruggs on the phone
Patch him through
'  () Well, Lowell, you are not going to believe this
+ ,  - And we see the back of a crowded courtroom
Richard Scruggs is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses, talking on his own cell phone
The Governor of Mississippi is suing his own Attorney General
to abandon litigation against Big Tobacco
Oh, good
Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell
(after a beat) But, now that the version without Jeff ran
what's the chance of getting his interview on the air
(beat) Hello
Sudden
Scruggs now exits the building, past the metal detector, seeking better reception
Yeah, 'm here
,  - What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air
'  () (droll) Less than great
And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore and his attorneys coming out
Scruggs comes further down the steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins answering questions from the Press
(after a beat) 'd be lying to you if  did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion
, ,  - (a beat) and 'd be lying to you if  didn't tell you, 'm about out of moves, Dick
All right
See you
, ,  - Lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a  in hiking pants and hiking boots
They look up at him
Hi
So, what are you folks doing here in Lincoln
And we sense something is all wrong here
(affable) Geology survey
(nods) Geology
Yeah
Really
How about you
(direct) work for  News
(after a beat) Oh, yeah
Lowell nods
They look at each other and they both know there's a lot more than meets the eye
And as Lowell gets up and leaves
, ,  - And we see Lowell on the   again
Just ran into two of your "geologists
" Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up
'  () Lowell
,  ' ,  - And we see Bill Robertson's on the phone
Do not screw this up
We are a week away from an arrest
, ,  - So, 'll hold it
And
'  () (on the phone) We'll give you a heads up before we launch
How long
'  () Three hours
You got a deal
(hangs up) ' , ,  - Lowell is in a -shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re- upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big enough for a chair, a bed and the / combo on the cheap dresser
It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand interview
He watches the show that will never see the light of day
'  () "
like the testimony before Congress of Dr
Wigand's former boss, Brown & Williamson's Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Sandefur
" (in -) " believe that nicotine is not addictive
" (in matching -) " believe Mr
Sandefur perjured himself
Because  watched those testimonies very carefully
" Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while
'  () "All of us did
there was this whole like of people, the whole line of CEOs up there, all swearing that
" '  () "Part of the reason 'm here is " And the  after the word makes "" resound, and as it Jeffrey   saying
(') "
that their representation
" And Lowell  after the image
He gets up, looking out the window through the curtain with the spill from the neon motel sign
Outside are horse trailers
He goes back to watching the show
standing there
in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him
Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with
'  () Hello
Jim, it's Lowell
- Hey
Where are you
'  () (doesn't answer) Remember that night at
's
You asked me if we were sitting on something "explosive"
(beat) Well, we're not "sitting on" it
(beat) corporate leaned on  News which yanked an interview we did with a top- ranking tobacco scientist
corporate officer
They are trying to close down the story
(sarcastic) You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting corporate decide what is or is not news
(beat) What's Wallace think about this, or Hewitt, or
How prominent
What kind of placement
Oh, c'mon, Lowell
This is The New York Times don't know
Well, until you do, all  can tell you is what you already know
they will not air an interview
Call me back in ten
Lowell hangs up
Re-dials
'  -   - Debbie answers, intercutting with above
'  () Debbie
It's me
Hi
What time is it
'  () Oh, it's late
That know
When are you coming back
can't get out of here til mid-morning
'll be in tomorrow night
(beat) Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi
Okay
Hold on a second
What is it
- Jim Cooper's workstation
His phone rings
He grabs it
Hello
(beat) '  () Lowell
Alright, Lowell
Page one
Editorial's interested
Let's talk
, ,  - Here's how it works
You ask me questions
tell you if you're wrong '  () Okay
(pause) Lowell
Yeah
'  () You're sure you want to do this
Why
'  () Hey, it doesn't work
You've burned your bridges, man
You ready
'  () Okay
About this whistle-blower
Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision
No answer
'  ()(cont'd) Lowell
Did  tell you you were wrong
'  () No
(beat) 'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco
Are we talking
are we talking Brown & Williamson, here
into the face of Lowell
His gaze falters
His eyes go back to the motel  mutely frozen on the show
Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast
,   - 5:30
Newspaper box is loaded with The New York Times ,   - 5:30
Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges
We  he carries a copy of this morning's New York Times ,   - suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor
a sleeping figure
There's a knock
Irritated, a sleeping Lowell gets up to answer it
He looks through the security peep hole
He opens it
And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his arm, is standing in the doorway
Did  get you up
No,  usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face
There's an awkward quiet
Mike enters
He slows, looks around
How many shows have we done
Huh
'mon, how many
Oh, lots
Yeah, that's right
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind
Lost his heart
Walked out on us
Not one fucking time
You want to know why
see a rhetorical question on the horizon
'm going to tell you why
Because when tell someone 'm going to do something, deliver
Oh, how fortunate  am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path
To show me the way
Oh, please, Mike
(beat) Give me a break
No, you give me a break
never left a source hung out to dry, ever
Abandoned
Not 'til right fucking now
When  came on this job,  came with my word intact
'm gonna leave with my word intact
Fuck the rules of the game
Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike
What the hell did you expect
You expect me to lie down
Back off
What, get over it
In the real world, when you get to where am, there are other considerations
Like what
Corporate responsibility
What, are we talking celebrity here
'm not talking celebrity, vanity,
'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning
Now, what do you think you think about then
The future
"In the future 'm going to do this
Become that
"  What "future"
No
What you think is:  how will  be regarded in the end
After 'm gone
He trails off
They look at each other
(cont'd) Now, along the way  suppose  made some minor impact
(beat) did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah, Malcolm , Martin Luther King, Saddam, Sadat, etcetera, etcetera
showed them thieves in suits
(beat) 've spent a lifetime building all that
But history only remembers most what you did last
And should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network
(beat) Does it give someone at my time of life pause
(simply) Yeah
And the look on Wallace's face is "It did
Whether it should or should not
what difference does that make
It did
" And we realize only now that he has not come to argue
Mike
in my
(low) You and  have been doing this together for fourteen years And he gives Lowell a copy of The New York Times (cont'd) This is today's New York Times (beat) In it is the whole sordid story of what went on inside our shop
Lowell looks down at the page
The headline is "'60 ' " (cont'd) And in the editorial
It accuses us
of betraying the legacy of Edward
Murrow
Turning, he walks out and down the hallway
Lowell looks at the newspaper
- The helicopter approaching Manhattan
John Scanlon sitting with Hewitt, both of them reading The Wall Street Journal Wigand article
(troubled) They conclude most of it seems pretty unsubstantiated
(looking at him, sickened) You're full of shit, John
,   - Lowell at a table littered with New York Times, New York Daily News , etc
His phone rings
Yeah
,   - Broadway backgrounds streak past Debbie DeLuca's head as she rides, talking on a cell phone, The Wall Street Journal in her hand
front page
There's a picture of Wigand
Article's entitled, "Getting Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin
Wait, hold on a second, Lowell
Debbie hits "call waiting
" (cont'd) Yeah
Yeah, sure
'll see if  can find him
Hold on
(beat; to Lowell) Yeah, Don's looking for you
Good
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic
" It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower
" ,   - Lowell
'  () "
a close look at the file, and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims, indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr
Wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence
" ,   - As Lowell hails a cab in a   and runs towards us, jumping into the cab
'  - The news division has been vilified in The New York Times , in print, on television, for caving to corporate interests
We   and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's office
(') The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors
You fucked us
(shouting) No, you fucked you Don't invert stuff
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it
The Wall Street Journal here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination
And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating
Don, what the hell else
do you need
And Hewitt, looking around
Mike, you tell him
(simply) You fucked up, Don
And Don's taken off stride
(recovers fast) Hey, it's old news
Stick with me
Like always, we'll be okay
These things have a half-life of fifteen minutes
No, that's fame
Fame has a fifteen- minute half-life
(droll) Infamy
lasts a little longer
Lowell looks at Wallace
(') We caved
It's foolish
It's simply dead wrong
(in his face, so there's no doubt) Now, this is what we're going to do
We're going over to Black Rock
,  - Jeff is in front of his class, teaching
Okay, so let's get back to it
Alright, now, what we saw there was
- :   - Tired, his suitcase at his feet
We don't know if he's coming or going
He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted- than-not airport
(into phone) They cancelled the six o'clock
(beat) don't know why
'm on the 8:10 should be home
9:30
'll see you then
Love ya'
Bye
He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it
" Management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against us for tortious interference
But now things have changed
" ' ,  - small apartment
Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara
And now we    the small television on the table playing "60 Minutes" and
(on television) "
in my opinion, is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in history
" Deborah looks proudly at her father
Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette
He has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway
His kids can't see him
We can
And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear
And as he stands there, watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about most
And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60 Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane
An airport cleaner stops to watch, too
Lowell glances at him
Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually among them, watching his work
' , ,  - Sharon sits at the kitchen table
She watches in a far corner a small countertop television
It's "60 Minutes," the full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph
" and on the top right, "
"  As Sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed
'  -    - watching the show
He sees himself
(to Wigand) "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle
" (on television, hesitating) "There are times
wish  hadn't done it
But there are times that  feel compelled to do it
" "'ve - if you asked me if  would do it again or if it's - do  think it's worth it
Yeah
think it's worth it
" Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as
Lowell watching show in airport
, ,  - And we see the  Agent,   on the phone
promised you a three-hour heads- up
well, here it is
Have a camera crew standing by in Helena, Montana on Tuesday and 'll give you a three-hour head start
Alright
By the way, that was a hell of a good show tonight
' ,  - (nods, trustworthy) Thank you, Bill
And he quietly hangs up
And it's still
Sharon's laid down, closing her eyes
They lie close together
After some moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been thinking
(understated) You won
This time he isn't droll
Yeah
(a beat) What did  win
There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor
He shuts off the light
And as they lie close together in the dark in each other's arms
'
:  "
" ,  - Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the- art Master Control Room
On a wall are fifty or more monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of operations
And it's jammed with people, witnessing a fast-breaking, major news event
Mike Wallace stands near Felling
Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike Wallace
And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot Man
, the , being taken in by the
director counts down
Dan Rather launches
"Reporting from  World News headquarters in New York, good afternoon
There has been a major break in the case of the so-called 'Unabomber
'   News has learned that a remote homesite outside Lincoln, Montana has been under surveillance
" Thanks for this
You know, we beat everybody
, ,
Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be alone
,  - The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall
After some moments: That Canada story
Still interest you
(nods) Everything interests me
Mike nods
Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets
After some moments
(') quit, Mike
Mike's startled
Bullshit
Lowell shakes his head "no
" (') 'mon, it all worked out
You came out okay in the end
did
What do  tell a source on the next tough story
Hang in with us
You'll be fine
maybe
They look at each other
Lowell says to Mike, intimately, what he knows Mike knows
(cont'd) What got broken here
doesn't go back together again
Lowell's heartfelt regret
He starts to leave
They look at each other
(cont'd) So, uh
And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all showing  programming
He doesn't even look back
