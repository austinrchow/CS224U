Written by Eric Roth Based on the short story by
Scott Fitzgerald 10/30/07 As all things do, it begins in the dark
blink open
Blue eyes
The first thing they see is a near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind blowing, rattling a window
' (
) What are you looking at
The wind, Mother
They say a hurricane is on its way
You've been asleep
was waiting to see you
1
,   - ,           1 Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years
An old , past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed
She's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip
Her name, is
She speaks with a Southern lilt
If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season
've forgotten what the weather can be like here
've lived with four seasons so many years now
We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver,"  , in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window
saw on the news they're predicting trouble
1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee
But Daisy has other things on her mind
murmuring

like a fingerpainting
feel like 'm on a boat, drifting
(tenderly) Can  do anything for you, Mother
Make anything easier
Hmmm
There is nothing to do, Caroline
This is what it is
'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open
my mouth all filled with cotton
And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her
she starts to take it off
Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her
There, there, Miss Daisy
you'll scratch yourself to ribbons
(to Caroline) It's their way of letting go
(the finality) prob'ly today
Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present
Do you want more medication, Mother
The doctor said you can have all you want
Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance
Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry
Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her
(') friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother
(grateful to have the chance) wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world
For raising me so well

'm going to miss you so much
They hold each other for some time
They separate
And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about
nothing left to say to each other
a hole in their relationship
Caroline fills it with the eternal question
(') Are you afraid
Curious
What comes next
She winces at some physical pain
The pain's coming more steadily
Her breathing will falter soon
No need for her to suffer
She raises the morphine level
Daisy closes her eyes
drifting with the morphine
and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind
and she says
They built that train station in 1918
Your father was there the day it opened
He said a tuba band was playing
Oom-pah-pah
2
,   - , 1918         2 And we see a   is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah
The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock

' ,   - , 1917           3 We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches

) His name was Mr
Gateau

Cake

saying to herself again
"Mr
Cake

Cake," working in his downstairs workshop
More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop

) And when their son came of age, like boys will do, he joined the army
They saw him off at the old train station

Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away
Mr
Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son
' (
) Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station
8
'  - , 1918        8 The sound of clocks constant ticking
Mr
Gateau at work
' (
) One day a letter came
Blanche comes into the workshop
a letter in her hand
She reads to her blind husband
" am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne

we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together
Alas this was not to be

) Mr
Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed
Mr
Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs
' (
) And their son came home

,   - , 1918                9 We see "Mr
Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding his arm, standing among the rows of coffins

) They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years

) Mr
Cake went back to work on his clock
laboring to finish

Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up the clock back
finished at last
' (
) It was a morning to remember
Papa said there were people everywhere

Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets alike

) Even Teddy Roosevelt had come
And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt, in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders
We watch Mr
Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape
He stands for a moment
and with a simple tug, releases the purple swath
People gasp at the magnificent clock
"Mr
Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a glorious chime
Pushed by an angel, the second-hand begins its eternal journey
going around
Everyone cheers
until they realize the clock is going the wrong way
traveling backwards in time
man shouts, "It's running backwards
" made it this way
so that perhaps, the boys who were lost in the war might stand and go home again
13
- , 1918                                13 And we see just that
bullets leaving mens' wounds sailing back into the rifles from whence they came
limbs, whole again
cannon balls rocketing backwards into the cannons' breech
Fallen come to their feet, to live and breathe again
(
) home to farm, to work, have children, to live long, full lives

,   - , 1918         14 Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat
Perhaps, my own son might come home again

back in the arms of his loving parents

And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the terminal and exits
The crowd is motionless
They look to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance
but he simply puts his hat on, and with his guardians, is gone
' (
) Mr Cake was never seen again
Some say he died of a broken heart
Some say he went to sea

Gateau, blindly rowing
away

The wind loudly rattles the window
they turn to look
Do you mind if  make myself a call
've got somebody watching my little boy
No, please go call
It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying mother
with the wind knocking at the window
After some moments: (') hope  haven't disappointed you, Mother
Oh honey, you could never disappoint me

She opens it

with no particular interest, like reading to someone a selection from a menu's choices
It's dated "April 4, 1985

And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman
and the maids, bringing bedsheets, futilely start to change her bloody linens
That's enough
All of you
They move out of the way
and Thomas kneels beside his wife
She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes
He takes her hand

'm sorry  took so long, the streets are filled with people
As if to underscore it, fireworks go off

And she is interrupted by the sudden
But Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife

She looks up at him

The Doctor listening for her pulse
He covers her

And for that  am forever grateful
Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go
When we hear again the
The '  is not quite right
It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs
It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul
They all turn, and the room stills
listening as The continues its mournful
Only Thomas goes to answer
The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth
Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face
Mr
Button
He lifts the cloth anyway
He recoils
for he has seen some kind of horror
He makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh
" And then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of the room
downstairs

He is just at the apex of this throw when, despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it
Instead, cradles the newborn

and The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops its mournful cry
Thomas stops, catching his breath
He looks in through the back porch
the sounds of coming
Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps
He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket
We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside
Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door
And his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind
' (
) could've sworn  heard somebody knockin'
When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch
thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as She's followed by a handsome Black man,
-- that everyone calls
She looks out the door, and not seeing anything
guess not
She stands for a moment taking in the night air
(') The air smells sweet
And she sings to herself
a song from the time
You look very handsome tonight, Ms
Queenie, handsome as  ever seen you

Sweeter than  shoulda been
Lost his legs you say
"You never know what's comin' for you

She got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her

Jameson
The woman disappears inside
Queenie, not anxious to go
(') It sure is nice out here, Mr
Weathers
Awful nice, Ms
Queenie
Come out back for a moment
take your mind away from things
He pushes open the porch screen door
(smiles) Just a moment's time
He offers her his hand
She takes it
He backs out of the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right on top of the Baby
The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles, nearly falls

She moves to it
pushes aside the blanket, and freezes

What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn
but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian
Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man

There's a myriad of old dark rooms
heavy furniture and carpets
an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years
and we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to ninety-five, in various stages of health
various contraptions to keep them "afloat"
An Old Age Home
We see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen
Tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her
' (
) Where are you, Queenie
Hold your water

He does what she asks
She hurries the baby into a small room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs

She whispers to The Baby, soothing it
And looking for a place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer

) Queenie, Apple

Mercy, 'll be right there
And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser drawer
with her unmentionables
and shuts it
leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe
Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost, looking in the room
My sister gave those pearls to me
can't find them anywhere
People are stealing my jewelry
They're right here, Mrs
Hollister, right 'round your pretty white neck
(moving her) Come on now
There's a sound of a door chime
' (
) Dr
Rose has arrived for his visit
Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and closes the door
And we stay behind for a moment
inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a lilac sachet
is the Baby with the face of an old man
looking up at the sliver of light coming into the dresser drawer
27

He puts his things into his doctor's bag
Queenie comes beside him, saying something

'  -  , 1918                       28 The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed
Dr
Rose, stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink
He's nearly blind from cataracts
'm not sure he can hear
His bones indicate severe arthritis
His skin has lost all elasticity
His hands and feet are ossified
He has all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his eighties on the way to his grave
You mean to say he's dying
Of old age
His body is failing him before his life's begun
They're still, looking at the strange baby
(') Where did he come from
(after a beat) It's my sister's child
From Lafayette
She had an unfortunate adventure
(whispers) The poor child got the worse of it
came out white
There are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie
There's no room for another mouth to feed here
The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is

She looks at the Baby, determined
He is a miracle, that's for certain
just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see

(') We have a visitor that will be staying with us for a little while
My sister had a child but couldn't see right by it
He's known as

He's not a well child
so we need to take very good care of him
We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an air of strong disapproval
And an   says
had ten children
there's not a baby  can't care for
let me see him
Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her
The Old Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face
(startled) God in heaven, he looks just like my ex-husband
And there's laughter

Doctor Rose said he don't have much time on this earth
Join the club

Their laughter makes the baby seem to smile
the lonely smile of an old, dying man

The baby cries out
and then it's quiet

Weathers
Stay with me tonight
He slows
She's quiet
And she whispers: (') "You never know what's comin' for you

He's sitting in a wheelchair now
small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis
Eyeglasses are just one addition
a hearing aid
a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear
But if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair
wisps of white
what would be the last hair for some
seem to be growing in
As we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise

Benjamin, like any six- year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between them
until one of the oldsters, who has had enough, sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making him come to an abrupt stop
Benjamin, sitting with the other oldsters on the porch
the old people rocking
Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall
children playing
people talking
What's there
Nobody says anything, rocking
Benjamin, eternally curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street
children running on the street, playing
carriages dropping people off for a party
He leans forward to get an even better view
When Queenie suddenly grabs him
Benjamin
That's dangerous
Come back here
Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people
out of sight of the street

She was my mother
And he reaches to hold her hand
She generously takes his hand

Somedays  feel like 'm different from the day before
Everybody feels different about themselves one way or another
We're all goin' the same way, just taking different roads to get there
You're on your own road, Benjamin
How much longer do  have to live, Mother
Just be thankful you got what you're given
You already here longer than you supposed to be
We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in

There's the sound of (

My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor
He'd bring home every play for me to read

So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor-like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer

What can  do for you, Sister
And Queenie whispers something to him
(') Her parts are all twisted up inside so she can't have little children
He puts his hand on her stomach
Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb
(and shouts) Out damnable affliction
He presses on her stomach
making Queenie nearly fall over
held up by a "" in a crisp white uniform
And once she's regained her balance
(at Benjamin) And what's this old man's irrediction
He's got the devil on his back
trying to ride him into the grave before his time

'm seven, but  look a lot older
(laughs) God bless you
He's seven
The congregation laughs
This is a man who has optimism in his heart
Belief in his soul
We are all children in the eyes of God
Now we are going to get you out of that chair
we're gonna have you walk
(his hands on Ben's shoulders) In the name of God's glory, rise up
And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his legs akimbo, stands
The people all applaud
(') Now God is going to see you the rest of the way
He's going to see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane
He's going walk by himself on faith and divine inspiration alone
We'll show that Devil where to go
Walk on
And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor arthritic legs give out
and he sprawls to the floor
The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but: (') Don't touch him

But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor
The Preacher comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him

(') Yes, and say hallelujah
(Hallelujah
) Now walk, my old friend
Walk on
And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across the stage
The people urging him on
a string of "Hallelujahs
" Queenie comes to join him
urging him
Let the Lord carry you
The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord

He stares at the cake, unhappily gets up, mutters something

And Daisy, in her nightgown, has come inside
she slightly touches Benjamin

He shakes "no

She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up, and with the aid of his cane, follows her

Daisy, moving quietly down the stairs
Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps, following her
(whispers) Where are we going
She doesn't say anything
She leads him into the where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and a smaller side table, and a buffet
to dry
Under here
And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table
Benjamin follows her into the "fort

The little girl, and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret lair
She takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown
She tries to light it, but doesn't really know how to use matches
(') Will you light it
'm not supposed to use matches
Don't be chicken
Despite his caution, he lights the candle
the candlelight making it feel more secret
(') 'll tell you a secret then you tell me one

Her face was red from it
Benjamin doesn't know what to say
(') Your turn to tell
'm younger than  look
(whispers) You don't seem like an old person
like my grandma
Are you sick
(whispers) heard Tizzy and my mother whisper
They said  was going to die soon

When suddenly a sheet is pulled back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there
What are you doing under there
Who's idea was this candle
She angrily blows it out
and
to Daisy
taking her by the arm
(') It's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed
(and for Benjamin, but saying it to Daisy) You are not to be playing together
Play with people your own age
(moving her along) Now, you come back to bed, young lady
You're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself
(and a last word to Benjamin) You should be ashamed of yourself
And they're gone
Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets
There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway
You are a different child
a man child
People aren't going to understand how different you are
(forlorn) What's wrong with me, Mother
God hasn't said yet
Now, back to bed and behave yourself
He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr
Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask
He looks at Benjamin as he goes by

Turning his back to the old man

Daws, unable to sleep

Once, when  was fixing a leak on the roof
And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting blasted

And he slows, seeing Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant
as Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after him

cluttered with years of accumulated things

What about your friend
The tall lady
We're not friends anymore
That's what happens with tall people
He starts to go
Goodbye
And he's gone
Benjamin gets up going to the window
He looks outside
He can see Mr
Oti come onto the porch
There's a full moon
And as he walks off, his arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night

Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old dog

Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the stairs
the old dog dutifully following them

The woman starts to tell him her name
but we don't hear it because

Daws, along with a cow of his, being hit by lightning

Benjamin turns
And he sees a man in his late 40s with his three man crew, standing on the deck of a , and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron
The man, its Captain
Has a thick Irish accent
For some reason none of the able-bodied men needing work respond
What's wrong, nobody wants to get their hands dirty
Nobody wants to do an honest days work for an honest day's pay

He always says he'll have to owe it to you

She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as if going to dinner
They sit at a table
which she has set for them
Caviar and Vodka
(') Don't bother with the cheese or the wine here, they're quite common
but the caviar and the vodka are plentiful and sublime
She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar
Unaccustomed to it, he swallows it too quickly

If you eat it all at once there will be nothing left to enjoy
savor it
She gives him another spoonful
and takes one herself
He takes his time
They both do
savoring it

Which they do
She laughs
Looking at him

No
Not many

She's not far off
And it's a lovely thought

Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats across the English Channel

was pushed two strokes back

The elevator doors open
Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've seen him steps out

It's his church suit
You take my breath away

They stop to share a drink from the champagne bottle
They laugh
feel so much younger when 'm with you
And it seems he's about to go on
But Elizabeth, flattered, takes it metaphorically
That's such a nice thing to say
You make me feel years younger, too
wish  was
would change so many things
would undo all of my mistakes
What mistakes
kept waiting, thinking  would do something to change my circumstance
Do something
But  never did
It's an awful waste, you can never get it back
wasted time

Those are the rules
They stand in the cold
His answer is
Are you as cold as  am
(laughs) My god, colder
They stop to finish what's left of the champagne, Elizabeth hurling the bottle
The bottle falling silently into some fresh snow
(') You can't even break a bottle here
They look at each other and they kiss
And without anything else needing to be said, they start back

Benjamin and Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them

And he slows
Elizabeth isn't there
He looks into the bar

He goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting for her
mouse runs across the marble floor, stops, looks at him and runs off
And he sits and waits

We see Benjamin has fallen asleep on the sofa
There's the distinctive  of Captain Mike's
Benjamin wakes
He follows the bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat  in the bar
Roosevelt says we all got to do our part
After them Japs attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's got to
The Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy, to repair, tow, salvage and rescue
Anybody don't want to go to war, now's the time to say so
Once you set foot on that boat again, you're in the Navy friend

Easy old timer

(always dour) Who do you intend to have cook then
One of the leading causes of death at sea is food poisoning, right after inadequate safety equipment

You a real Johnny on the Spot, Benjamin

The Chief Gunner loved the Navy, and most of all, he loved America

His family had been in America for over five hundred years

Where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience

He goes back inside
And as they settle into their tasks

The Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty, helping him with the preparation
while they work
(trying to make conversation) You're from the Kentucky mountains aren't you
It must be pretty there
Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word
Benjamin shrugging, puts the pie in an oven

Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves
There's something not normal about him
As they silently eat, mostly bored
(looking outside) Whoever said "War is hell," doesn't know shit from shinola

Benjamin looking out at the black sea
and out of the silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks
've been watching you
You seem trustworthy
If something happens to me
could you see this gets to my wife
He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief
' (
) He had given me all of his pay
he hadn't spent a dime of it
If anything happens  want my family to know  was thinking about them, and if  could have, 'd have come back home

Going outside

One and two at first
then three and four
and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies

Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the rails

Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's engines, there   isn't
just the silence of death
Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a spectre
the   - that had reeked this havoc
looking to see   the results
Captain Mike sees the sub
(mad as hell) We can't run from the fucker and we can't hide
There's only one thing we can do

50 caliber machine gun on the tugboat
Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead cut open, bleeding
Despite the strafing the tug is relentless
The submarine, seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive
but it's too late
the tugboat ramming the submarine
severing the -Boat in half
The concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process, blasting away under the stern of the tugboat
the men on the stern blown to pieces
Benjamin's literally thrown against the wheel house
He manages to get to his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink

Benjamin bends to him
Captain Mike trembling as he lays dying
Look at what they did
They shot holes in me
They shots the hell out my paintin'
His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is riddled
(') You've seen a lot of things
Tell me it's going to be alright
You're going to heaven Captain Mike
You're going to heaven
Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying
And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes
an understanding
You can be mad as a mad dawg at the way things wents
You can swear, curse the fates, regret every'ting you ever dids
but when it comes to the end
You have to lets go
He looks in Benjamin's old eyes

We're struck by the difference
the old man who had left to see the world has returned a strikingly handsome man in his fifties
The old blind dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him
Nothing seems to have changed
An old woman we don't know is rocking on the porch

He can just see part of a  coming to stop at the gate
He moves to the next landing
where he can see a figure is getting out of the cab
The figure of a young woman, wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots
She strides through the gate
It takes us a moment to recognize her
the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone
replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties
with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but
Benjamin follows her progress, moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened windows
She moves gracefully past the porch with its swings
The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her, comes to greet her
Daisy going around to the back of the house
Benjamin moving to the back door, and just as Daisy starts to knock
Benjamin opening it
Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him

Daisy
it's me, Benjamin
She hardly can believe her eyes
Benjamin
Oh my God it's you
Of course it's you

and they both, in that moment recognize that things will never be the same
Daisy, over-hugging him
the way young people do

What do you think, Benjamin
don't know how it works, but 'm sure glad it happened
They inadvertently touch
the electricity of friction
both aware of the closeness

This is my friend, Benjamin

just a baby
Hi
Hello

needing to touch her

Does she dance
Not very well

But who isn't a little lost at 12
There's a lot of her that reminds me of you

He's a doctor

Benjamin smiles

and a great partner and friend
And she shuts off the record player and another set of lights
and for a moment they stand in the dark studio
and they look at their reflections in the mirror
seeing who they are now

She comes inside

It echoes how she's feeling being there

Nothing lasts

The taxi drives off
Daisy stops for a moment before she opens the gate
The house has fallen into disrepair

She goes up the walk and out of habit goes around the back porch
to the kitchen

Some old people are still in residence -- predominantly African Americans now
Queenie's daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the living room
Along with a plain Man in a plain suit

And just then we hear a  playing
as if it were being played by a child
with no skill
banging as much as anything
And Daisy follows the sound of the piano into the parlor

just a boy of 12 now
hunched over
trying to play the piano
trying to play the tune the woman had taught to him
Benjamin
He turns at the sound of her voice
There is no indication he recognizes her at all
Do you know this song
And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is nothing more than a child playing random notes
You play really beautifully
She comes and touches his back
He shrinks from her touch
He doesn't seem to like to be touched
And while he tries to play

Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she loved
who she still loves
She looks into his eyes
Do you remember me

He looks at her
No sense of recognition
Daisy is a very pretty name

It's good to meet you Benjamin
Do you mind if  sit with you would love to hear you play

She sits down beside him on the piano bench
He stops to look at her
