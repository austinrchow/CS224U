From within the train: Lynn
Lynn

He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her

Hello, is Mr

Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but
Hey, hey
He reacts to the   who swoop past , one on each side, too close for a father's comfort

Bye, now
He hangs up
Keeping one eye on the circling
(to ) Ready
Nods
Let' s do it
He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray, just as the  approach
The ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path
When they hit it, their skates stop, they don't
They sprawl, doing nasty things to knees and wrists
Whoops
He stands over them with
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads
You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom

Watson
Yes
Where's that
Near Lompoc, north
What's
Come with us, sir
'd like to know what
" Don't cause a ruckus, sir
He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not- so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all
Come with me, honey
swoops  up and heads for the station entrance
Hey

The  is looking the other way
Without breaking stride,
reaches out, snatches a child's coloring book and crayons
You stole that
No,  didn't

There's a difference
And they're out the door,  hurrying after
The big hand on the big clock moves

That's right
The policeman is your friend
Isn't that right, Daddy

He points it casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general direction of the little girl
Daddy
Yes
It's , Lynn
These are our friends
Hey, would you look at this crazy car
Everybody has their own radio
What do you think of that
Everybody does
Yep
And you can listen to it without anybody else listening
Let's try it out
She puts some ear phones on her
She holds up the plug-in end
This is what they call the jack
Hi, Jack
Laughs
It goes in that little hole
Let me do it
She plugs the jack in
turns on the radio gets a big smile on her face
(loudly) It's loud
She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, etc
, oblivious to all else
Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat
She begins to type in several characters
Let's get down to business
Who are you
You're not the police
Brilliant
presses  on the Labeller
strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag
He looks back to her
whacks him on the knee with the gun
It hurts
Pay attention, Mr
Watson
Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt
You wouldn't
Try us
He looks back
She is caressing 's hair
Get your hands off her
He makes a move
whacks his knee again, harder
Mr
Watson, you're not paying attention
Your daughter's life depends on you
Do you understand that
looks from
to
and back
He's having a hard time focussing
She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her
Do you understand
Yes, yes,  understand
Good
He takes the manila envelope from  , tosses it in ' lap
This is for you
In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary
It is her itinerary
She is presently - are you listening, Mr
Watson
Yes, 'm listening
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel
That's right near here
He gestures
looks
The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises
When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel
Then you will take this
holds up his hand, snaps his fingers
From the back,
hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle
He puts it in 's hand, shows him what it is: a gun
and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there
Not just shoot her, mind,
kill her
'd recommend you empty the gun into her
Close up
Got all that
It takes a moment for it all to sink into ' brain
You're out of your mind
What's your point
will do no such thing
Yes, you will, Mr
Watson
"snap
" from the back seat
looks

She breaks another
Don't worry
We'll take good care of the kid
She gives half the carrot stick to , pops the other half in her mouth and grinds it to pulp
is checking his watch
It is now 12:16
If the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30
(holds up a walkie- talkie) call my partner, your daughter is dead
He looks in the rear-view mirror to
And what happens if  don't call you

Did you hear that, Mr
Watson
Do you understand
He taps the manila envelope
The woman in the picture
He indicates the back seat with his head
or your daughter
looks at his daughter
Oh, my God
reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope into ' pockets
God can't help her, Mr
Watson
Only you can help her
Only you
You're wasting time
He reaches across , opens the door and pushes him out, then follows him
takes off the ear-phones, tries to undo her seatbelt
Where is my daddy going
wraps a big arm around her
He's going to help the police
Your daddy is going to be a hero
My daddy is going to be a hero
Like Power Rangers
Just like Power Rangers
' -  - 12:18PM activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it
Let's test this thing
You on
He holds it up for  to hear
(
) (filtered) Reading you
still has ' wallet
He opens it, pulls out some cash, puts it in 's breast pocket
You'11 need some cash
(re: the wallet) 'll hang onto this for the time being
Oh, and
He grabs one of 's hands
You'll need these
He dumps six bullet's into 's palm from a cloth Chivas Regal bag
Get moving, Mr
Watson
Time's a wastin'
just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his hand
reaches out, turns him around and gives him a shove away from the van and into the midst of
-   -   -  - 12:19PM a    , that have just exited an arriving mini-bus
is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream
Amid the chattering ,  is pushed along as if in a trance
He touches the pocket with the gun
He looks at the Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him
It's like a splash of cold water
He quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists
They resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see
The van is gone
-- 12:19PM He stands there, a lost man
Fear sweeps over him
He looks desperately around
He is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions
He is a man alone in a crowd
He takes a step
, chased by  , runs into ' legs
He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms
His heart plunges - she isn't Lynn
His intensity scares her
Mama
She pulls away, flees to  , who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish
stays crouched, watching the   staring at him over  ' shoulder
Until a  crosses his line of sight , foot-patrolling the station
It's like a gift from above
Relief floods 's face
He is saved
He stands, hurries toward the , each step more confident
Then, just beyond the ,
casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie
walks right past the  heading towards a cab stand
falls in behind him speaking in his ear
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead
(into walkie-talkie) Do it
(
) (filtered) Go ahead, sugar Die
(
) (filtered) Lynn calling Daddy
Lynn calling Daddy
Come in, Daddy
grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man
Lynn
(
) (filtered) can hear you good
Can you hear me
Yes
Yes,  can hear you
That's enough
(
) (filtered) 'Daddy has to go now
(filtered) He has to say "over and out"
Daddy, you have to say "over and out"
Over and out
clicks off the walkie-talkie
Look at your watch
Look at it
At one-thirty your little girl is dead
Say it with me
At one-thirty my little girl is dead
Say it
Say it
(softly) At one thirty my little girl is dead
Unless you do what you're told
Go do it
He pushes  on, toward a cab
And don't forget 'll be watching you
looks back at him, full of impotent rage raises the walkie-talkie
reaches the first cab at the stand
-   -  - 12:21PM The , talking to  , throws away his cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab
Where to, sir

The  is disappointed, but he nods and  gets into the cab

stares at the manila envelope in his hand
He starts to open it, is stopped by: Amtrack
What
You just come in on Amtrack
Uh, yes
Business or pleasure
Business

San Diego
Oh, San Diego

Somebody close

She was thinking about a divorce
notices the dashboard clock - 12:22 leans forward
Look

Oh, yeah
He hits the horn and swerves to the left
Jesus
Watch it, buddy
-  - 12:22PM looks out his window and finds himself staring at
, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him
He throws himself back in the seat
-  - 12:22PM The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel and stops
'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over
Three-fifty
looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to the curb on the other side of the street
Three-fifty

looks back at the , waiting for his fare
Right

digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his business cards
He hurriedly writes on it: " " He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the ' hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab

What do  want with an accountant

You free
You bet
The  plants a  in the cab
As he pulls away, the  again glances at the business card, crumples it up
-  - 12:23PM watches the cab leave
As it exits, the 's arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash
knows what it is
He looks around
, ,  and , cars coming and going
No one pays particular attention to him
looks at the van across the street
gets out and walks across the street towards him
The van drives away
watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it
takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket goes into the hotel
-  -  - 12:24PM enters
It's like another world
busy, humming, air- conditioned planet
hustle around the restaurants, waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance
-  -  - 12:24PM Suddenly we have cut to a   of Gene looking around this Hotel, complete with scrolling
Shot by someone high above
-  -  - 12:24PM is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd
He breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes
Then he starts tracking all around him, seeing
something
Oh, my God
Oh, no
He desperately fumbles in his pocket
Facing and above him, some    are securing a huge, rolled up banner
finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope
He rips it open
As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, the  let their banner unfurl
We do a simultaneous reveal
The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner
Written across the bottom of it in your best red, white, and blue: "-    " And an addendum: "
" Oh, shit
It dawns on him
He looks around him again
This time we see what he sees
Campaign posters and banners everywhere
On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several years her junior
These have the caption, "Governor Grant and husband Brendan"
Oh, sweet Jesus
His eyes fall on
, standing inside the entrance, walkie-talkie in hand, watching him
looks at a poster, at
, who smiles, nods and gives  a move of the head - "Get to it
" shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him, then slides out the itinerary
The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant"
checks his watch
12:26
He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, , who's cleaning out ashtrays
Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is
points up
Third floor
Yellow stairwell
Follow the signs
turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns back
Oh, thanks
Thanks a lot
smiles
No problem
- " " -  - 12:26PM mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor
follows him as he climbs
" " -  - 12:2 6PM The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene ascends
forces himself not to look at
behind him
His nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination
-  - 12:26PM sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room
He walks that way
follows
-    -  - 12:27PM and
pass gift shops, snack bars
The walkway is crowded and  is going against the tide of , , , and just a lot of plows on through
and runs smack into
(laughs) Whoops
The two men reel back from each other
, earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them
is a charmingly smooth man
Nice body check
He continues on, talking to an
What the Governor really admires, Mrs
Wentzel, and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it into a positive force
He slides a familiar hand around her waist
You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers
They are felons and they should be treated as such
drivers license is a privilege, not a right
And he is hustled away
Right past an election poster featuring him and Governor Grant
Still stunned by the encounter,  turns back and watches the Governor's husband, but keeps walking
-  - 12:28PM It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from
comes in
is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's just copped
Excuse me, is the
thing over
Yes
You didn't miss much
The food

Eleanor Grant is gone
Yes
Nice speech
But it's the same at all these
But  has turned away
The  gives him a face, grabs another centerpiece and exits

is suddenly next to him
Check your itinerary
Move along

"12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant -   - Bona Vista Lounge"
This says "invitation only"
Of course you're invited
You're a big donor to the campaign
They love you
digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a handful of security badges, name tags, invites
He plucks the name tag that   printed earlier
It has a red ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign
He fastens it to Gene's lapel
This'11 get you in anywhere
Red Elevator
Thirty-fifth floor
Where did you get these
Who are you
'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving
""  -  - 12:28PM approaches
He notices a flurry of movement, a small moving determinedly through the lobby
It is with a small entourage
She is a handsome woman in her fifties
The entourage consists of , Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few assorted   and a couple of is not sure what to do
The group reaches the elevator
pushes the button
They-didn't hear a word  said
The mike was too low on the podium
How much did we pay for that room
We didn't
Somebody did
turns to an Aide
Have Nolin pre-check the  systems
The elevator doors open
They crowd in
The doors start to close
Gene looks around, where did Mr
Smith go
springs forward, thrusts his hand between them
The doors stop, then bounce open
is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard
Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor
You can take the next one
Don't you dare, Franco
This is one of our biggest supporters
She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to
Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent
That's a mouthful isn't- it
love saying that
steps aboard, shakes her hand
" " -  - 12:29PM The elevator begins to rise
Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch
'm about to bust as it is
We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con
We are on the third floor
The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise
Governor
It comes out a little louder then he intended
He has turned, his back to the door
Everyone looks at him
He's committed

What can  do for you Mr
Watson
Its'

The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above
We are on the fourth floor
Behind , the doors open

She offers her hand to
as he steps on board
Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent

The car begins to rise again

Your daughter
Yes
Yes
What to do now
She
ahh

be sure to get your autograph
Of course
wish everything were that easy
've got the pen if you've got the paper
looks at her
She smiles back
How about that
He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, the one
gave him
Is that something precious
No, that's,
that's fine He gives it to
hands over the pen
's eyes flick over to
who is staring at the envelope
What's her name
looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to
, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt - do it
pulls his eyes away
Her name
Her name is Lynn
writes the autograph
' eyes drill into him
looks over
raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch
His other hand taps his wristwatch
's hand slides toward his jacket pocket
Sweat beads on his forehead
He's barely aware of talking to him
It's funny
don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic
He gives her a quick, weak smile
His free hand wipes the sweat from his face
If it wasn't for double  batteries 'd be in big trouble
He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices
' hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is
He looks at the other
, earphone, crewcut-Security
There is the hint of a gun on his hip
's eyes widen, dart to
' face, his hand sliding into his coat
His hand hovers over his gun, trembling
Is the   staring at him
hands over the autograph
Are you all right
Elevators make me queasy, too
gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away
He takes his hand out of his pocket
It's shaking
He clenches it to stop the shakes
The doors open, startling him
-  -  - 12:2 9PM and her entourage exit to greetings and applause
stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with
The doors close and the elevator descends
" " -  - 12:29PM is fuming, his face red
He explodes
She was right in front of you
What's wrong with you
His fists clench
He seems about to lose control
He backs into a corner, physically terrified
Are you 'fucking with me
The gun
What about the gun
It wasn't loaded
didn't put the bullets in it
You
He raises a fist
Struggles with the impulse to smash , controls it
Angrily, he takes the gun from 's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket
You won't get many chances like that, Mr
Watson
That's the way life works
Don't blow the next one
He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes
looks out and down
' The van
It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street

You have, huh
Oh, yes

-  - 12:29PM The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view
strains to see it again, but it's impossible
jams the loaded gun into 's pocket
There, all loaded
Ready for the hunt
The elevator, doors open into the lobby

, suddenly becomes self-conscious, walks away from
The object of his shyness:     nearby
The man is taping his wife with a video camera
- 12:31PM We see what the camera is seeing, the , smiling
Behind her, we see , looking confusedly after Mr
Smith
He turns, walks out of frame
In the corner of the picture, a read-out of the : 12:31:00
-   -  - 12:31PM Back in real life,  walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the Men's Room
"Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand- lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where  himself, a fiftyish black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine
He sees  and perks up - a customer
Having a rough day
Down at the heels as they
But  goes right past  and into the Men's Room
(calling after him) You don't see your face, you don't pay
gives up, goes back to his magazine
'
-  - 12:31PM Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes
He tries to find an answer, a way out
pay phone, on the wall behind him, comes into focus
Then a hand reaches in, grabs the receiver
and yanks it, snapping the wire
Gene spins around
It is
, of course
smiles
doesn't
leaves
-   - exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came
-   -  - 12:32PM sets down his magazine again
Having a rough day
Down at the heels as they say
What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today
It's 's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times
looks around
is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and  in view
Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off
Put the world in perspective
lets  usher him into a chair
The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair
grim reminder
He pulls out the itinerary
- 12:45  -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant  -  Pacific Rim Multi-Cultural Conference  -  Pool Deck  -  Fourth Floor looks at his watch
12:32
The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches
- 12:33PM He works away at 's shoes
So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels
It's more of 's patter, no real substance to the inquiry
'm
'm visiting
watches
frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand
What do you do, if  may be so bold
(looking at
) 'm just an accountant
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend
Where would the government be without accountants
They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right
- 12:33PM He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair
- 12:33PM Now you take tips
Time was a tip was between a man and his customer
Not any more
They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies
They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean"
Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure
Doesn't seem quite right
, does it
No
No, it doesn't
The Bellboy  walks by, calls out to
Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'
It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it
laughs, waves
have to do something
What's that
You have to speak up
(taps his ear) 'm a little deaf in this ear
Between that and my wooden leg 'm a mess
Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps
said  have to do something
'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail
Is within himself
keep wondering what she would do if she was here
She'd figure it out
She'd run it down like a column of numbers
Pro's and cons
That's the way she was: Lists all over the house
's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his chair
Drove me crazy
There must have been one on me
didn't add up so she left
That's what attracted me to her In the first place
She made up her mind and she did it
She wouldn't sit around waiting for
whatever
She'd do something
She'd do something
keeps his eyes on his work
He's afraid he's got a live one
Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip
Wears like iron
You're a wise man
There ya' go
Two bucks
gestures for  to get down
steps to the floor
He pays  with a twenty
You got anything smaller
Keep it
It's a twenty
Keep it
is thinking about something
Well
thanks muchly
looks around the lobby, at
, the Flower Street entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket
Can  get out to Flower Street from here
Sure
Go down past the bar
Take you right out there
nods toward the bar
Thanks
walks toward the bar
shakes his head: time for the boys in white
-  -  - 12:35PM looks towards the Flower Street entrance
The van is still there
bus pulls up
walks past
You get another chance in ten minutes
Then  have time for a drink
He heads up to the bar
All right, Mr
Watson, but make it just one
don't want you
But  is long gone
-  - 12:3 6PM walks into the area of the bar
The  is just returning to chat with a customer, a  who is getting sloshed
moves slowly along the bar, into an area where ' view of him is blocked
So where was
don't know
Something about the Governor's new regime
hears this and glances towards them
Oh yeah
She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers
sees that
can no longer see him
He scans the lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street
The white boys are in for it
When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations
The  laughs
quickly cuts across the lobby and out the smaller door onto Flower Street
We're talking Custer's Last Stand here
The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest
-  - 12:3 6PM comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving through the traffic
Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping low, sneaking up behind it
He crouches by the front door, one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on the door handle
He raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab
No
up front at least
He takes a breath, braces himself
With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks out the gun
-  - 12:37PM The first thing he sees, fixates on, is
She is stretched out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open
She appears dead
(a gasp) Lynn
(
) Shhh
You'll wake the baby up
is sitting on the seat behind the one  is on
points the gun at her face
She smiles
(softly) What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff
The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat
"  Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target
Maybe a thirty-eight thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces
They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit
How's about a three-fifty-seven
It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away
What do you think
What's my poison
look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand
He lowers the gun, defeated
Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out
Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see
- climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there
The gall of his defeat is hard to swallow
He realizes he's holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away
-  - 12:38PM puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie
(into the walkie-talkie) He's coming back in
(filtered) 've got him in the crosshairs
-  - 12:38PM near the entrance, eating some food
He watches walk past him
Their eyes meet
-  -  - 12:39PM looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more
- 12:45 -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi- Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor -   - 12:39PM addresses another Bellboy,  who is moving luggage out to the street
Pool Deck
Fourth Floor
Take that escalator
thanks him and moves across the lobby
follows -   -  - 12:39PM heads toward the escalators
Ahead of him, he sees and   surrounded by  and facing a crowd of
The Governor and her husband have an arm around each other
They are smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple
They give each other a warm kiss
Camera flashes, recording the moment
, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a large   - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns
When he clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference
- 12:3 9PM He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding questions from a few remaining
Farther on,   and her entourage can be seen taking the escalator up
heads that way, passing
My wife is not interested in negative campaigning
She wants to accentuate the positive
don't know about you but  find that refreshing
Have you ever thought of running for office yourself
(smiles, charmingly) Me
walks by
The Governor's husband's eyes follow her appreciatively as he says: 'm just a business man
- 12:40PM He nears the escalator
It's crowded and  is pulled into the midst of  , , ,
He joins the flow and lets it pull him along
rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the crowd up two flights of the circular stairs
Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck
- ,  -   - 12:41PM About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor
Skyways connect the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and Figueroa
platform has been set up with chairs and microphones in front of a podium
-     - 12:41PM blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine
When his eyes adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching with a hand-held metal detector
He panics, turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, trapped
The line shuffles forward
He turns, determined to make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 2ND  , who waves him to one side
2ND   Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait can take you over here
is dragged forward
He looks around; no way out
He stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of his body, is lifted over to the other
Down it slides, toward the pocket concealing the gun
waits for the alarm - which doesn't come
The   operating the gizmo deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon
is pushed on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among: by the dozens
Eleanor Samara Grant  by the hundreds
and
moves through them, trying to figure out what just happened
He glances back to the 2ND  , and bumps into one particular , plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts with a quick laugh
Easy, sir
Got to watch where you're going in a crowd like this
He is a handsome, solid-looking guy
You'd trust him
Call him
seems to be in charge
He moves off through the crowd, giving   orders in an easy way
looks around
He can't see
He edges his way after  , who reaches the wall beyond which is the drop to the street
He leans there comfortably, scanning the crowd,  reaches the wall a few yards away from him
He looks out at the city, getting his courage up
Just as he turns to approach  : (
) know what you're thinking
freezes
appears from the crowd, joins him
He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it
What would you do in my place
Me
He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it
The bitch would be dead
Course ain't sayin' which bitch
He flips the walkie-talkie
lashes out, smacks the walkie- talkie
It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below
goes ballistic
walks away from him - right up to
There's a plot to kill the Governor
If you don't believe me, check that guy right there
He has a gun
looks at
and then at
So do you, Mr
Watson
And   reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie- Talkie that he tosses to
You got this under control
Yeah
It doesn't look like it
It's under control
It better be
walks away
stares at a devastated
He sticks the walkie- talkie into his pocket, grabs  under the arm, drags him to an isolated corner
oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but 'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur
(
) Gentlemen
The  offers a tray of hors d'houvres
Yeah, thanks
Have a cracker
shakes his head
Have a cracker, Mr
Watson
woodenly takes one
The  moves on
There was this guy
Big guy
Irish- Italian
Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch
We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting
Nobody could make me laugh like him
We closed more bars together than can count
He was my pal
loved that crazy mick, 'm not ashamed to say it
But he was fuck-up
He had this image of himself
Thought he was con man
Always trying to shave the edge
Nickel and dime
'll always miss him
Tell me why
What
Tell me why  miss him
He's dead
That's right
He's dead
Tell me why
How should
Tell me why he's dead
stares at him for a beat
You killed him
That's right,  killed him
He fucked up one too many times so  put a bullet in his eye
Then  put two more into him just to make sure
Now that was somebody  loved
He moves in on , crowding him
He breathes hard, looks like one insane piece of work
loved that motherfucker but  got the call and  put him down like a sick animal
So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something
'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat
wave of applause catches their attention
She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward the platform
gladhands people on the way
- 12:45PM He turns' back to
Do what you're supposed to do
Do it now
He grabs  and gives him a push
There is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform
is buffeted along
follows him, keeping him in sight, but then a    move in, start snapping, lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd instinctively turns away, hiding his face
He moves around the  and finds himself separated from  by the mob
He searches, trying to spot him
Shit
- 12:4 6PM In the crowd,  is bumped this way and that
His face displays an inner devastation
His eyes focus desperately on something ahead: It is the back of  ' head
She is turning this way and that, greeting supporters
's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun
He is at the end of his rope
He is going to do it
local  mounts the platform, taps the microphone
Can  have your attention Please
Please welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor of Los Angeles
The honorable Tom Bradley
The  reacts loudly, yells and whistles
-pushes his way forward
It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you
- 12:4 6PM He is now a few yards from
He comes up against the   who gave him the once-over with the metal detector
The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away
He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the
a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind
is close to
She is just a few bodies away, visible between them
His hand moves in his pocket
He swallows
The impulse sweeps over him and
(
) Feeling better
, the young woman from the elevator is next to him, smiling
He looks at her in confusion
An iconoclast with class
The elevator
You weren't feeling well
looks at
genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches
Are you better now
turns, scans the crowd - no sign of
and go to the mat with greedy special interests
looks at , studies her intensely
She's a bit unnerved
The finest Governor our state has ever had
Again  looks at
She's turning around, facing the crowd, facing him
My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant
raises her arms
perfect target
The roars as  turns back to
He leans into her, speaks
My wife always said  had a problem trusting people
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant
You don't understand
'm going to trust you
And you have to trust me
Krista looks at Gene
Yes, you're right,  don't understand
Look
my daughter
she's going to die
unless you can help me
Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice
Obviously a nut case
well-dressed nut case, but a nut case nevertheless
Krista, nervous, looks around for help
Sure, sure, 'll help you
Let me get Mr
White
'm sure he can assist you, he's our
Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, unnoticed by anyone else
(sotto voce) No
You have to listen to me
Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene
'm listening, 'm listening
takes over the microphone from the beaming My friends, my good friends
Gene and Krista are gone

In the background,   delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause
Please

All right, let's just
let's get security in on this
No

They're the best
They're hand- picked

One of them is following me
If he knew what 'd just told you they'd

She recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her
Look, how did  get in here with this

She can't deny the fact

You've got to trust me
'm putting my daughter's life in your hands
She's only six
She's just a little girl
Please, please, trust me
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances
looks at her intently
You're right, it is
(beat) Here
offers  the gun
She is surprised, to say the least
She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers
Will you trust me now
She stares at the gun, at the strange man
guess 'll have to
Come on, there's one person we can go to
The man following me has a walkie- talkie
If he sees 'm not here he'll call his partner
do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech
Wait a minute
She steps closer to the platform/ listens
' voice is heard
(
) remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday
phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news
checks her watch
12:48

) My husband and child senselessly killed by a drunk driver
We've got about ten minutes

We'll take care of him
We will
But
Trust me
You asked me for help
Let me help
Trust me
Okay
She starts to lead him away
Hey
He stops her, points to the gun she still holds

think you're right
She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away
-  - 12:4 9PM still roams the crowd, looking for Gene
But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us strength
He sees   who gives him a questioning look
He ignores it
doubt if  would be before you now, if  hadn't been put through that crucible of loss
notices the    we met before
The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle
glances up toward what the man is shooting
Consternation and anger fill his face
- 12:4 9PM What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising stands at the glass looking down
Behind her, just glimpsed, is
And though  can never forget William and Bill Junior or the love  felt for them

Her Security people may be involved
There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom
The door opens and   emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel
He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, perhaps wearing glasses
Is there a problem, Brendan
There certainly is
This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor
Not hired
They're blackmailing me
Who is this "they"
don't
don't know
Please, Mr
Grant
They have my daughter

Your wife is in trouble
Someone is trying to kill her
Someone is trying to make me kill her
Please, listen
And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite
Does that show good judgment, Ms
Brooks
'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me
He brought a gun onto the pool deck
(beat) What
He got onto the pool deck with a gun
How did he get past her Security carrying a see
Where is this gun

Well, is it real
Do we know anything about it
It looks real

Could  see it
gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands it to him
It lays in the palm of his hand
He unwraps it awkwardly, examines it
My goodness
It certainly looks real
He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite
What's your opinion
You're the expert in these matters, supposedly
turns, to see who he is talking to
- 12:
53PM stands by the open door
Before  can speak, moves
It is fluid and cohtroled and fast
He marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch
He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and goes face to face with
She just has time to wonder what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot
Shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor
can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills
Jesus Christ
(calmly, staring at ) Yeah, 'd say it's real
Are you out of your fucking mind
The door opens
slides in quickly
Somebody mind telling me
(sees 's body)) What the hell happened
Help me get her off the rug
checks the hall, shuts the door
They begin to drag her body to the bathroom
The   watches
What have you done to me
Christ almighty
's eyes follow them
As if rousing from a sleep he comes to life
No
He tries to rush to the bathroom but
is right there, gripping him
struggles frantically, uselessly, watching the bathroom door close
is beyond anger
He grabs ' throat, muscles down
grips the iron hand that's cutting off his air
You fucked up
(
) That's enough
The   grabs
' arm, tries to pry him loose
is beyond reason
You want me to kill your kid
You want me to kill you
's eyes begin to roll back in his head
Everything begins fading to black
The blackness retreats in a rush and  finds himself staring at the butt of
' gun, visible under his coat
He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank into , again, again
' shocked face falls away
heads for the door
Don't let him go
steps between  and the door
shoots him down and is out the door

He hurries down the hall, looking back to see the   and a wounded spill out of Room 2503
The   pulls his weapon   Get him

One of the guest room door's opens and a staggers out
It is a bloody, wounded
stops in shock

You fucked up
And
grabs him by the collar and throws him over a railing
- - - is falling, falling
He passes the ascending elevator and gets a glimpse of
and , pressed against the glass, her face a mask of terror
The floor rushes up to meet  and
2503 -  - 12:5 6PM he hits the floor, thrown there by
His escape has been a dream
wrist-watch fills the frame
12:56
It is 's
We are seeing his
He's laying on the floor, his watch-hand in front of his face
(
) You nearly killed him, too, you idiot
(
) Nearly doesn't count
Lose the
'm on record
never wanted this
wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no
What was good enough for Oswald wasn't good enough for you two
You had to get fancy
Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand
It's academic now
She had to be killed
What were you going to do, Brendan
Lock her in a closet
You're in the fucking kitchen now
Get used to the heat
He's been seen all over the hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes
We even got him on video
It'll work
Don't worry about it
stirs on the floor
(about ) Is he awake
Yeah
He yanks  to his feet
Oh Great
Why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it
It doesn't matter what he hears
He pulls  over to the bathroom door
Throws it open
reacts to what he sees within
That's what it looks like
She was alive a minute ago
Now she's dead
Because you wouldn't do what  told you to do
Get going
You've only got a few minutes to pull it together
takes  out of the suite into the hall
The door closes
Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are alone    don't know if we should go through with this
It's too late for that
There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor
What about it
She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic
Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge
(breathing easier) Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker
He won't be doing any work once get through with him
And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion
The people'd make you king of California if they could
laughs
-  - 12:57PM exits from the room and engages the in conversation down the hall
and
turns the other way, walk
In an undertone: 'm not stupid

Do you now, Mr
Watson

Keep your voice down
Even if you don't, Her Security men will
-  -   -  - 12:58PM They reach the elevator
punches the button turns on him
How am  supposed to get away
That's not my problem, Mr
Watson He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it
(into the walkie-talkie) Come back
How do  know you won't kill my daughter once 'm gone
(into the walkie-talkie) Come Back
Fucking Radio

After you
""  -  - 12:58PM They step into the elevator
Stare at each other
The doors close
erupts
He grabs  slams him into the outside window
's face is smashed into the glass by
' shoulder
His body presses  against the glass wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from 's ear
Look out there
You see the van
The van can be seen below on Flower Street
You see it
He slams 's head against the window
He lifts up the walkie-talkie
Come back
(
) (filtered) Yeah
Do it
He jabs the walkie-talkie next to 's ear
(
) (filtered) Daddy
And then a scream
The horrible sound of a little girl in terrible pain
It cuts through  like a stab in the heart
Lynn
He struggles to turn around
kidney punches him, hard
goes down on one knee
The car stops
starts to board it, stops in surprise
sticks a badge in their face
Security
Take the next car
They back off
The doors close, the car continues its descent
lifts the walkie-talkie
Again
(a gasp) No, please
Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie
is ripped to his soul
hauls him to his feet, shoves him against the glass
You got one last chance
Half an hour and that kid is dead
'll kill her myself
'll rip her fucking head off right in front of you
releases , who goes limp
The elevator doors open onto the lobby
gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat from his face
""   -  - 12:59PM gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the closing doors
He can't even fight back at the doors

Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not fearless
Mrs

She smiles
(friendly as can be) Of course
But suppose we set up an appointment

Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of constituent

She freezes, slowly replaces the phone
How do you know that

He backs away from the stall

He walks over to the stall and knocks on the door
He's gone
And  tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall

You're telling me my people are in a plot against me
You're telling me my husband wants me killed
What do you expect
don't blame you
don't have any proof
But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum
You can't be totally oblivious
You must suspect something
You're doing things which are making people angry
People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs
You know them better than me
How much does it mean to them
How far would they go to hang onto it
Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt
sees it, hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor
Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely
There's only one way to find out for sure
Try to cancel the last speech
(smiling, covering her inner thought) 'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you
Try to get out of it
They won't let you
They can't
Try to change the schedule and you'll know 'm right

Where are we going
Not very far, honey-pie
Not far at all
She pulls the van out into traffic

He goes to the stall and lifts his fist to pound on the door
Out of there, Mr
Watson
Your time's up
The stall door opens and  comes out, zipping up his pants
He brushes right past

reaches out, grabs him
You forgot to wash your hands
He throws him against the sinks
washes his hands
leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above the sink,  sees the stall door swings open
Is huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet doesn't notice
've got faith in you, Mr
Watson know you're not just a regular guy, see,  know that

Eleanor
She nods, turns back to the mirror
Lousy
And  have siesta hair
'm thinking of canceling the speech

And he did help you to get elected, after all
Don't remind me

Nothing

Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her affectionately
Eleanor, please
'll put it this way
This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers
What do you say
Truth is, besides the headache 've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc
Make my apologies
Come on, El, you're a trooper
'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento
This is no time to lay down on the job

Look what happened to Bush
Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine
But do this one and we'll get out of the smog

She rips opens his shirt revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm
His eyes flutter open
Are you all right, Franco

: 1:30 -  - 1:31PM and  roll down the steps, fighting basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue on
