href <b>// --> </b> All About Eve : -    - It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight
long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais
Diner is over
Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy
The overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility
It is June
The , as it has been throughout the  , is on the
It is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse
Exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor
Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise  of deWITT: ' The Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement is perhaps unknown to you
It has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable "honors" as the Pulitzer Prize and those awards presented annually by the film society
The  has   to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who is speaking
We do not hear what he says
' The distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor
Being an actor - he will go on speaking for some time
It is not important what you hear what he says
The    some more, and  until it discloses a fairly   of the room ' However it is important that you know where you are, and why you are here
This is the dining room of the Sarah Siddons Society
The occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our Theater knows - the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement
are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen
The screens are papered with old theatrical programs
The waiters are all aged and venerable
They look respectfully toward the speaker
' These hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the room, Booth breathed this air
It is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death
-   on its altar, it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty
' The minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented
Minor awards are for such as the writer and director - since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington
Eve
but more of Eve, later
All about Eve, in fact
:  -  deWITT, not young, not unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and merciless of tongue
An omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of 'Artagnan
He sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs
His narration covers the  of the  to him: ' To those of you who do not read, attend the Theater, listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of the world in which we live - it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself
My name is Addison deWitt
My native habitat is the Theater - in it  toil not, neither do spin
am a critic and commentator
am essential to the Theater - as ants are to a picnic, as the ball weevil to a cotton field
He looks to his left
is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way
She is scraping bread crumbs, spilled sugar, etc
, into a pile with a spoon
Addison takes one of her bread crumbs
She smiles absently
Addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball
' This is Karen Richards
She is the wife of a playwright, therefore of the Theater by marriage
Nothing in her background or breeding should have brought her any closer the stage than row , center
Karen continues her doodling
' however, during her senior year in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards lectured on drama
The following year Karen became Mrs
Lloyd Richards
Lloyd is the author of 'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the play which has won for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award
Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse hand reaches in to take the spoon away
Karen looks as the with  to
He sits at her left
He's a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension
He smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps
He pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping
Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling
Addison mashes a cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder
He eyes Max
' There are two types of theatrical producers
One has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss
This type is interested in Art
Max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps delicately and close his eyes
' The other is one to whom each production mean potential ruin or fortune
This type is out to make a buck
Meet Max Fabian
He is the producer of the play which has won Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award
Max rests fitfully
He twitches
hand reaches into the , removes a bottle of Scotch from before him
The follows the bottle to
She sits at Max's left, at deWitt's right
An attractive, strong face
She is childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when she should be the other, but always positive
She pours a stiff drink
Addison hold out the soda bottle to her
She looks at it, and at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad
He smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself
' Margo Channing is the Star of the Theater
She made her first stage appearance, at the age of four, in 'Midsummer Night's Dream'
She played a fairy and entered - quite unexpectedly - stark naked
She has been a Star ever since
Margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it
' Margo is a great Star
true Star
She never was or will be anything less or anything less
(slight pause) the part for which Eve Harrington is receiving the Sarah Siddons Award was intended originally for Margo Channing
Addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor
As he speaks the in the direction of his glance
' Having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the Sarah Siddons Society, but also the history of acting since Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line - our distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here
At this point Addison's voice   and the voice of the aged actor
is in    of him and the podium
have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the Theater - "a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage" - and  have been honored to be, for forty years, Chief Promoter of the Sarah Siddons Society
(he lifts the Sarah Siddons Award from its altar) Thirty-nine times have  placed in deserving hands this highest honor the Theater knows
(he grows a bit arch, he uses his eyebrows) Surely no actor is older than  - have earned my place out of the sun
(indulgent laughter) and never before has this Award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight
How fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers
: Lovely, beautifully groomed
In serene repose, they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small evening cup
Such young hands
Such a young lady
Young in years, but whose heart is as old as the Theater
Addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens
Then, slowly, he turns to look at Karen
Some of us a privileged to know her
We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry- Karen never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs
-that have made her name resound through the nation
We know her humility
Her devotion, her loyalty to her art
Addison's glance moves from Karen to Margo
Her love, her deep and abiding love for us- Margo's face is a mask
She looks down at the drink which she cradles with both hands
-for what we are and what we do
The Theater
She has had one wish, one prayer, one dream
To belong to us
(he's nearing his curtain line) Tonight her dream has come true
And henceforth we shall dream the same of her
(a slight pause) Honored members, ladies and gentlemen - for distinguished achievement in the Theater - the Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve Harrington
The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause
Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet
Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the Aged Actor's left
Eve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned
She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation
dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water bugs
Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop
applaud enthusiastically
, Award in hand, he beams at her
smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right
has come to
He applauds lustily
's applauding too, more discreetly
, not applauding
But you sense no deliberate slight, merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on something else
, nor is she applauding
But her gaze is similarly fixed on Eve in a strange, faraway fashion
, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and then at Karen
Then he directs them back to Eve
He smiles ever so slightly
The applause has continued unabated
turns now, and moves gracefully toward the Aged Actor
She moves through applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs keep popping
As she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her
He holds out the award
Her hand reaches out for it
At that precise moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - ,
The
' Eve
Eve, the Golden Girl
The cover girl, the girl next door, the girl on the moon
Time has been good to Eve, Life goes where she goes - she's been profiled, covered, revealed, reported, what she eats and when and where, whom she knows and where she was and when and where she's going
has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring intently at Eve
his narration continues unbroken
' Eve
You all know all about Eve
what can there be to know that you don't know
As he leans back, the    as tumultuous as before
Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen
, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on Eve
Her lovely face    as the     - as she thinks back: ' When was it
How long
It seems a lifetime ago
Lloyd always said that in the Theater a lifetime was a season, and a season a lifetime
It's June now
That was - early October
only last October
It was a drizzly night,  remember asked the taxi to wait
: - Traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour before
The rain is just a drizzle
There are other theaters on the street; display lights are being extinguished
Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls up is:   in '  '
The marquis display below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richards
" The taxi comes to a stop at the alley
Karen can be seen through the closed windows telling the driver to wait
Then she gets out
She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about curiously: ' Where was she
Strange
had become so accustomed to seeing her there night after night -  found myself looking for a girl 'd never spoken to, wondering where she was
She smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head down and makes her way into the alley
-   - Karen moves toward the stage door
She passes a recess in the wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway
' (softly) Mrs
Richards
Karen hesitates, looks
Eve is barely distinguishable in the shadow of the recess
Karen smiles, waits
Eve comes out gooseneck light above them reveals her
She wears a cheap trench coat, low-heeled shoes, a rain hat stuck on the back of her head
Her large, luminous eyes seem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light
So there you are
It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there
Why should you think  wouldn't be
Why should you be
After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater- hope you don't mind my speaking to you
Not at all
've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage  could raise- (smiles) To speak to just a playwright's wife
'm the lowest form of celebrity
You're Margo Channing's best friend
You and your husband are always with her - and Mr
Sampson
what's he like
(grins) Bill Sampson
He's - he's a director
He's the best
He'll agree with you
Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out
Just huddle in that doorway and wait
Oh, no
see the play
(incredulous) You see the play
You've seen the play every performance
(Eve nods) But, don't you find it -  mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive
Standing room doesn't cost much manage
Karen contemplates Eve
Then she takes her arm
'm going to take you to Margo
(hanging back) Oh, no
She's got to meet you- No, 'd be imposing on her, 'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan
Karen practically propels her toward the stage door
(insisting) There isn't another like you, there couldn't be- But if 'd known
maybe some other time
mean, looking like this
You look just fine
(they're at the stage door) by the way
What's your name
Eve
Eve Harrington
Karen opens the door
They go in
-   - Everything, including the doorman, looks fireproof
Eve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican
Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads the way toward Margo's stage dressing room
Eve, drinking in the wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind
Karen waits for her to catch up
You can breathe it - can't you
Like some magic perfume
Karen smiles, takes Eve's arm
They proceed to Margo's dressing room
'   -   - No star on the closed door; the paint is peeling
type written chit, thumbtacked, says
As Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from Margo makes them pause
(whispers) You wait a minute
(smiles) now don't run away- Eve smiles shakily
At the same moment: ' (loudly; through the door) "Honey chile,"  said, "if the South had won the war, you could write the same plays about the North
" Karen enters during the line
'   -   - It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster
It is furnished in beat-up wicker
door leads to an old-fashioned bathroom
Margo is at the dressing table
She wears an old wrapper, her hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle
Also before her is an almost finished drink
is stretched out on the wicker chaise
He's in his late thirties, sensitive, literate
Between them, by the dressing table, is  - Margo's maid
Her age is unimportant
She was conceived during a split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot
She is fiercely loyal to Margo
Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was outside
Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles
Hi
(she goes to kiss Lloyd) Hello, darling- Hi
(she goes right on - in a think "Suth'n" accent) "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South
" How was the concert
Loud
Lemme fix you a drink
No thanks, Birdie
Karen laughs with them
Margo's interview with a lady reporter from the South- The minute it gets printed they're gonna fire on Gettysburg all over again
It was Fort Sumter they fired on- never played Fort Sumter
She takes the wig into the bathroom
Margo starts creaming the make-up off her face
Honey chili had a point
You know, can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers
That was way back
Within your time, buster
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts
Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband
Birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig
You need new girdles
Buy some
The same size
Of course
Well
guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic
She picks up Lloud empty glass, asks "more"
He shakes his head
She pours herself a quick one
(firmly) Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie
know
She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo
It's the tight girdle that does it
find these wisecracks increasingly less funny
'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- - 'at's my loyal little woman
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance -  can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any
Easy, now
(grins) Relax, kid
It's only me and my big mouth
(mollified) It's just that you get me so mad sometimes
of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about- (dryly) Ain't it the truth
Yes, it is
You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain
Autograph fiends
They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes- They're your fans, your audience- They're nobody's fans
They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough
There is a pause
Lloyd applauds lightly
Well
there's one indoors now
've brought her back to see you
You've what
(in a whisper) She's just outside the door
(to Birdie; also a whisper) The heave-ho
Birdie starts
Karen stops her
It's all in whisper, now, until Eve comes in
You can't put her out, promised
Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book- That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone
Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there
Kind of mousy trench coat and funny hat
(Karen nods) How could  miss her
Every night and matinee - well
She looks to Birdie
Once George Jessel played my hometown
For a girl, gettin' in to see him was easy
Gettin' out was the problem
They all laugh
Karen goes to the door, opens it
Eve comes in
Karen closes the door behind her
moment
(simply) thought you'd forgotten about me
Not at all
(her arm through Eve's) Margo, this is Eve Harrington
Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater manner
(musically) How do you do, my dear
(mutters) Oh, brother
Hello, Miss Channing
My husband
(nicely) Hello, Miss Harrington
How do you do, Mr
Richards
(graciously) And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan
Oh, brother
Miss Coonan
(to Birdie) Oh brother what
When she gets like this
all of a sudden she's playin' Hamlet's mother
(quiet menace) 'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear
If  haven't, 'll find something till you're normal
She goes into the bathroom
Dear Birdie
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington
Harrington
'm so sorry
Harrington
Won't you sit down
Thank you
She sits
short lull
Would you like a drink
It's right beside you
was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play
They start together, and stop in deference to each other
They're a little flustered
But not Eve
(to Margo) No, thank you
(to Lloyd) Yes
've seen every performance
(delighted) Every performance
Then - am  safe in assuming you like it
'd like anything Miss Channing played
(beams) Would you, really
How sweet- (flatly) doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr
Richards
think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays
your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr
Richards
Of course it is
How'd hear about it
There was an item in the Times
i like the title
'Footsteps on the Ceiling'
Let's get back to this one
Have you really seen every performance
(Eve nods) Why
'm curious
Eve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes
Well
If  didn't come to see the play,  wouldn't have anywhere else to go
There are other plays
Not with you in them
Not by Mr
Richards
But you must have friends, a family, a home- Eve pauses
Then shakes her head
Tell us about it - Eve
Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve
" Then away, again
If  only knew how
Try
Well
Birdie comes out of the bathroom
Everybody looks at her sharply
She realizes she's in on something important
She closes the door quietly, leans against it
Well
it started with the play before this one
'Remembrance'
Did you see it here in New York
San Francisco
It was the last week
went one night
the most important night in my life - until this one
Anyway
found myself going the next night - and the next and the next
Every performance
Then, when the show went East - went East
'll never forget that blizzard the night we played Cheyenne
cold night
First time  ever saw a brassiere break like a piece of matzos
Eve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands
Eve
why don't you start at the beginning
It couldn't possibly interest you
Please
Eve speaks simply and without self-pity
guess it started back home
Wisconsin, that is
There was just mum, and dad - and me
was the only child, and  made believe a lot when  was a kid -  acted out all sorts of things
what they were isn't important
But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that  couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me
'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't
Not at all
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer had to help out
So  quit school and  went to Milwaukee
became a secretary
In a brewery
(she smiles) When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else
Everything is beer
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group
like a drop of rain in the desert
That's where  met Eddie
He was a radio technician
We played 'Liliom' for three performances, was awful - then the war came, and we got married
Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific
You were with the
, weren't you Mr
Richards
(Lloyd nods) That's what 'Who's Who' says
well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer
Except for a letter a week
One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up
'd saved my money and vacation time
went to San Francisco to meet him
(a slight pause) Eddie wasn't there
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all
That Eddie was dead
(Karen puts her hand on Lloyd's) so  figured 'd stay in San Francisco
i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie found a job
And his insurance helped
and there were theaters in San Francisco
And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'
and  went to see it
And - well - here  am
She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed
Margo squeezes the bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes
(finally) What a story
Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end
That breaks the spell
Margo turns to her- There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect
(to Eve) want to apologize for Birdie's- (snaps in) You don't have to apologize for me
(to Eve) 'm sorry if  hurt your feelings
It's just my way of talkin'
(nicely) You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan
Call me Birdie
(to Margo) As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed the first half for eleven years an' you know it
She slams into the bathroom again
At that precise instant flings open the door to the dressing room
He's youngish, vital, undisciplined
He lugs a beat-up suitcase which he drops as he crosses to Margo- Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do  find you
Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard- Thank you so much
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you
Have you no human consideration
Show me a human and  might have
(conscious of Eve) Bill
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't
start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me
(louder) Bill- Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck
What are you two - lovers
Bill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her
(smiling) Only in some ways
You're prettier
'm a junk yard
(yells) Bill
(vaguely; to Karen) Huh
This is Eve Harrington
Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve
Hi
(to Margo) My wonderful junk yard
The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard- (kisses him) Heaven help me,  love a psychotic
Bill grins, rises, sees Eve as if for the first time
Hello, what's your name
Eve
Eve Harrington
You've already met
Where
Right here
minute ago
That's nice
She, too, is a great admirer of yours
Imagine
All this admiration in just one room
Take your mistress into the bathroom and dress her
(Birdie opens her mouth) Without comment
Birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom
In a moment we hear a shower start to run
Eve gets up
You're not going, are you
think 'd better
It's been - well,  can hardly find the words to say how it's been
(rises) No, don't go
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr
Sampson leaving
Margo, impulsively crosses to Eve
Stick around
Please
Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and , then go somewhere and talk
Well - if 'm not in the way
won't be a minute
She darts into the bathroom
Eve sits down again
Lloyd, we've got to go- Lloyd gets up
Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door
She yells - the shower is going
Margo, good night
'll call you tomorrow
Margo's answer is lost in the shower noise
Karen crosses to kiss Bill
She's joined by Lloyd
Good luck, genius
Geniuses don't need good luck
(he grins) do
'm not worried about you
Keep the thought
They shake hands warmly
Karen and Lloyd move to Eve
Good night, Eve
hope  see you again soon- 'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee- Not just that way
As a friend
'd like that
It's been a real pleasure, Eve
hope so, Mr
Richards
Good night
Lloyd shakes her hand, crosses to join Karen who waits at the open dressing room door
Mrs
Richards
(Karen and Lloyd look back) 'll never forget this night as long as  live
And 'll never forget you for making it possible
Karen smiles warmly
She closes the door
They leave
' - and 'll never forget you, Eve
Where were we going that night, Lloyd and
Funny the things you remember - and the things you don't
'   - Eve sits on the same chair
Bill keeps moving around
Eve never takes her eyes off him
He offers her a cigarette
She shakes her head
He looks at his watch
You said forty-seven minutes
You'll never make it
(grins) told you a lie
We'll make it easily
Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut
He goes to the dressing table, picks up Margo's pocketbook, opens it
He finds a letter
He glances at it, puts it back
She's been carrying that letter around for weeks
've read it three times
There's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom
' You're supposed to zip the zipper - not me
' Like tryin' to zip a pretzel - stand still
Bill grins
What a documentary those two would make
like the mongoose and the cobra- He sprawls on the chaise, closes his eyes
pause
(finally) So you're going to Hollywood
Bill grunts in the affirmative
Silence
Why
just wondered
Just wondered what
Why
Why what
Why you have to go out there
don't have to
want to
Is it the money
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes
Then why
Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater- The Theatuh, the Theatuh- (he sits up) - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City
Or London, Paris or Vienna
(he gets up) Listen, junior
And learn
Want to know what the Theater is
flea circus
Also opera
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater
Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater
Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse
You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you
The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove
It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere
just asked a simple question
(grins) And  shot my mouth off
Nothing personal, junior, no offense
(he sits back down) it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin
He lies down again
But Hollywood
You mustn't stay there
(he closes his eyes) It's only one picture deal
So few come back
Yeah
They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards
pause
read George Jean Nathan every week
Also Addison deWitt
Every day
You didn't have to tell me
Margo, putting on an earring, buzzes out of the bathroom followed by Birdie
Bill sits up
(en route) understand it's the latest thing - just one earring
If it isn't, it's going to be -  can't find the other
She grabs her pocketbook, starts rummaging
Out comes the letter
Throw that dreary thing away, it bores me- Margo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging
(concerned) Where do you suppose it could be
It'll show up
(gives up) Oh well
(to Birdie) look through the wigs, maybe it got caught- Real diamonds in a wig
The world we live in
(she's been looking) Where's my coat
Right where you left it
She goes behind the chaise
She comes up with a magnificent mink
(to Margo) The seams
Margo starts to straighten them
(to Eve) Can't keep his eyes off my legs
Like a nylon lemon peel- (straightens up) Byron couldn't have said it more graciously
here we go- By now she's in the coat and has Eve's arm, heading for the door
Bill puts his arms around Birdie
Got any messages
What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power
Just give him my phone number, 'll tell him myself
Bill kisses her cheek
She kisses Bill
Kill the people
(to Margo) Got your key
(nods) See you home
Margo and Eve precede Bill out of the door
- American Airlines baggage counter
The rain has stopped, but it's wet
Margo, Eve, and Bill are stymied behind two or three couples waiting to be checked in
Margo's arm is through Bill's
They become increasingly aware of their imminent separation
Eve senses her superfluity
lull
Bill cranes at the passenger heading the line, in earnest conversation with the dispatcher
He sighs
They have to time it so everybody gets on at the last minute
So they can close the doors and let you sit
The man up ahead moves on
Ah
have a suggestion
(they look at her) There's really not much time left - mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well,  could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket
if you'd like
think we'd like very much
Sure you won't mind
Of course not
Bill hands Eve the ticket
Margo smiles gratefully at her
Eve smiles back
-  - It's covered, with glass windows
Margo's arm is in Bill's
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name
Eve
'd forgotten they grew that way
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding- Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant
(grins) told her
sounded off
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses
isn't it silly, suddenly 've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle
Bill pauses and pulls her to one side
Some passengers go by
pause
Take care of yourself out there
understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand
Bill
Huh
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss- 'll try
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy- Everybody can't be Gregory Peck
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe
How childish are you going to get before you quit it
don't want to be childish, 'd settle for just a few years- (firmly) And cut that out right now
Am  going to lose you, Bill
Am
As of this moment you're six years old
He starts to kiss her, stops when he becomes aware of Eve standing near them
She has his ticket in her hand
All ready
She hands Bill his ticket, they start toward the gate
-  - The
6 in the b
g
few visitors
Bill hands his ticket to the guard, turns to Eve
Thanks for your help
good luck
Goodbye, Mr
Sampson
Bill puts his arms around Margo
Knit me a muffler
Call me when you get in
They kiss
Margo's arms tighten desperately
Bill pulls away, kisses her again lightly, starts for the plane
Margo turns away
Eve puts her arms through Margo's
Bill pauses en route to the plane
Hey - junior
Margo turns to look at him with Eve
Keep your eyes on her
Don't let her get lonely
She's a loose lamb in a jungle
Eve looks at Margo
Margo smiles
Don't worry
Bill waves, climbs aboard
The door is closed behind him, the departure routine starts
Margo and eve turn to go
They walk down the passage
As they walk, Eve gently disengages her arm from Margo's and puts it comfortingly about her
' That same night we sent for Eve's things, her few pitiful possessions
she moved into the little guest room on the top floor
- slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides of the almost empty highball glass
' she cried when she saw it - it was so like her little room back home in Wisconsin
eyeing her quizzically
He offers her the whiskey
shakes her head, absently
She looks down at her glass again
Then, she raises her eyes to look at Eve
' the next three weeks were out of a fairy tale - and  was Cinderella in the last act
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother, friend, psychiatrist and cop - the honeymoon was on
'   - It's one floor above street level
long narrow room, smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award
'  overlaps into the scene which is a Eve sits at a smart desk
She is just arranging a stack of letters which she carries to Margo with a pen
Margo sits comfortably by the fire with a play script
She hands the scrips up to Eve, shakes her head and holds her nose
Eve smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign
Birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table before the fire
The phone rings
Birdie and Eve both go for it
Eve gets there first
By her polite but negative attitude, we know she is giving someone a skillful brush-off
Birdie glares first at her, then at Margo
Margo leans her head back, closes her eyes blissfully
Birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out
-   - From the wings
The audience is never visible
Eve in the f
g
Margo and company taking a curtain call
Tumultuous applause
the curtain falls
The cast, except for Margo and two male leads, walk off
The curtain rises again
, watching and listening to the storm of applause
Her eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands
, Eve again in the f
g
, but closer
Again the curtain falls
This time the two men go off
Curtain rises on Margo alone
If anything, the applause builds
, that same hypnotic look
there are tears in her eyes
The curtain falls offscene, then rises again - , the curtain falls again between her and
, the curtain just settling on the floor
Margo starts off
One more
(shakes her head) From now on it's not applause - just something to do till the aisles get less crowded
She walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the wings
Eve's eyes are wet, she dabs at her nose
What - again
could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time- (grins) Performance number one thousand of this one - if  play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch
She takes Eve's arm, they stroll toward her dressing room
must say you can certainly tell Mr
Sampson's been gone a month
You certainly can
Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning
mean the performance
Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around
(smiles) Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch
He's been coming closer down every night
When he gets too close, 'll spit in his eye
They're at her dressing room by now
Margo's been unhooking her gown, with Eve's help
They go in
'   - It's undergone quite a change
new carpet, chintz covers for the furniture, new lampshades, dainty curtains across the filthy barred window
Birdie waits within
She's listening to a fight; she shuts it off as they enter
(entering) You bought the new girdles a size smaller
can feel it
Something maybe grew a size bigger
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours
couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours
Margo's out of her wig and dress by now
She gets into her robe, sits at the dressing table
Eve's on the chaise, by the discarded costume
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating
(turns, looks) Well, you've done so much
what's new
The curtains
made them myself
They are lovely
Aren't they lovely, Birdie
Adorable
We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop
Just because you can't even work a zipper
It was very thoughtful, Eve, and  appreciate it- pause
Eve rises, picking up Margo's costume
While you're cleaning up, 'll take this to the wardrobe mistress- Don't bother
Mrs
Brown'll be along for it in a minute
No trouble at all
And she goes out with the costume
Birdie opens her mouth, shuts it, then opens it again
If  may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"
Behind in your dues
How much
haven't got a union
'm slave labor
Well
But the wardrobe women have got one
And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business- (catching on) Oh-oh
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in
As she talks, Margo hurries to the door and out after Eve
-   - Margo pops out, looks for Eve, then stares in amazement
, near the wings
She stands before a couple of cheval mirrors set up for cast members
She has Margo's dress held up against her body
She turns this way and that, bows as if to applause - mimicking Margo exactly
watches her curiously
Then she smiles
(calling) Eve- , startled, whips the gown away, turns to Margo
smiles understandingly
(quietly) think we'd better let Mrs
Brown pick up the wardrobe
Wordlessly, Eve brings it toward her
'  - Margo's asleep
bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3 exactly
The phone rings
Her head comes up out of the pillow, she shakes it
She fumbles, switches on a lamp, then picks up the phone
Hello
' We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills
Call, what call
' It this Templeton 89970
Miss Margo Channing
That's right, but  don't understand- ' We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr
William Sampson in Beverly Hills
placed
' Go ahead, please
' (a loud, happy squawk) Margo
What a wonderful surprise
Margo jumps at his vehemence
As she does so, the , so that Margo remains in the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is disclosed in the upper left
He, too, is in bed, reading
His clock says midnight
(continuing) What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do- (dazed) Bill
Have  gone crazy, Bill
You're my girl, aren't you
That  am
Then you're crazy
(nods in agreement) When - when are you coming back
leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night
those previews
Like opening out of town, but terrifying
There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can- - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket,  want you home
You in a hurry
big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight
Wait a minute
You can't hang up, you haven't even said it- Bill, you know how much  do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day,  want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it
(convinced she's gone mad) Sing it
Sure
Like the Western Union boys used to do
Margo's eyes pop
Her jaw and the phone sag
Bill
Bill, it's your birthday
And who remembered it
Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight
Margo knows damn well it wasn't she
(miserably) Happy birthday, darling
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day
" (the same) Many happy returns of the day
get a party, don't
Of course, birthday and welcome home
who'll  ask
(laughs) It's no secret,  know all about the party - Eve wrote me
She did
She hasn't missed a week since left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write
anyway,  sent her a list of people to ask - check with her
Yeah
will
How is Eve
Okay
Okay
love you
(mutters) 'll check with Eve
What
love you too
Good night, darling- See you
Margo hangs up
Bill hangs up
He replaces the phone, picks up his book
until   is on screen
She puts her phone away
She gets a cigarette
She lights it
She rolls over on her back
'  - Margo is propped up in bed, still reflective
Birdie comes in with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from Margo
She starts on some petty chores
Margo takes a sip of orange juice
Birdie- Hmm
You don't like Eve, do you
Do you want an argument or an answer
An answer
No
Why not
Now you want an argument
She works hard
Night an' day
She's loyal and efficient- Like an agent with one client
She thinks only for me
(no answer from Birdie) doesn't she
(finally) Well
let's say she thinks only about you, anyway
How do you mean that
Birdie stops whatever it is she's doing
'll tell you how
Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints
How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep- (breaks in; sharply) 'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and 'm sure there's nothing wrong with that
There is a sharp, brisk knock
Eve comes in
She's dressed in a smart suit
She carries a leather portfolio
Good morning
Margo says "good morning," Birdie says nothing
Eve shows off the suit, proudly
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit
Very becoming
It looks better on you than it did on me
(scoffs) can imagine
you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself
Quite sure
find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me
(laughs) Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady
'm on my way
Is there anything more you've thought of-
There's the script to go back to the Guild- 've got it
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
Right here
It seems  can't think of a thing you haven't thought of
(smile) That's my job
(she turns to go) See you at tea time
Eve
(Eve turns at the door) by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time
(gasps) Oh, golly
And  forgot to tell you- Yes, dear
You forgot all about it
Well,  was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night  meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and  guess  was asleep when you got home
Yes,  guess you were
It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve
Mr
Sampson's birthday
certainly wouldn't forget that
You'd never forgive me
(she smiles shyly) As a matter of fact,  sent him a telegram myself
And she's gone
Margo stares at the closed door
Then at Birdie
Birdie, without comment, goes out
Margo, alone, looks down at her orange juice
Absently, she twirls it in its bed of shaved ice
-    - , reflectively twirling her highball glass
The applause continues
She lifts her glass to drink
Her glance meets Karen's
She raises the glass in a silent toast
smiles wanly at Margo's toast
Then the smile fades as she looks reflectively back to Eve
' saw Eve quite often after our first meeting, but we never really talked again - until the party Margo gave for Bill when he returned from Hollywood
'  - It's January
The bed is littered with fur coats
Through the open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a late hour
No hilarity
' It's always convenient at a party to know the hostess well enough to use her bedroom rather than go where all the others have to go
Karen is making repairs at Margo's dressing table
Eve enters, carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on the bed
Now who's show up at this hour
It's time people went home - hold that coat up
(Eve holds it up; Karen whistles) whose is it
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late
Discouraging, isn't it
Women with furs like that where it never gets cold
Hollywood
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you
Happy
Eve melts into warmth
She beams, sits on the bed
Karen has spun around on the dressing table stool
There should be a new word for happiness
Being here with Miss Channing has been -  just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me- (smiles) Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality
(she gets up, gets her coat) next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket
(throws it over her shoulder) you've done your share, Eve
You've worked wonders with Margo
She starts out
(hesitantly) Mrs
Richards
(pauses, smiles) Karen
Karen
(she picks at the coverlet) isn't it awful, 'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done
(crosses to her) Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases
what is it
Well
Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape
there isn't enough to keep me as busy as should be, really - not that 've ever considered anything that would take me away from her
but the other day - when  heard Mr
Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her
She looks down at the coverlet once more
you want to be Margo's new understudy
don't let myself think about it, even- (she looks up, rises as she speaks) - but  do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- (suddenly afraid, she sits) - but suppose  had to go on one night
To an audience that came to see Margo Channing
No,  couldn't possibly
(laughs) Don't worry too much about that
Margo just doesn't miss performances
If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays
(nods proudly) The show must go on
No, dear
Margo must go on
(she sits beside Eve) As a matter of fact,  see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy
Do you think Miss Channing would approve
think she would cheer
But Mr
Richards and Mr
Sampson- They'll do as they're told
Eve smiles a little
pause
Then - would you talk to Mr
Fabian about it
Of course
You won't forget it
won't forget
seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't
She hugs Karen, leaves
She nearly collides with Birdie on her way in
The bed looks like a dead animal act
Which one is sables
(pointing) But she just got here
She's on her way
With half the men in the joint
(she hold up the coat) It's only a fur coat
What did you expect - live sables
diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people
They start out
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here- They can always grab oranges off trees
This you can't do in Times Square
Through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out of sight
- Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison, a blonde young lady named   (Addison's protegee-of the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison
Eve
They are all seated on the steps
Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor
Karen remains with the others
Addison is holding forth: Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk
Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings
(as Birdie and the sables pass) Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for
' And probably has
Sable
(to Miss Caswell) Did you say sable - or Gable
Either one
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool
By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children- (to Bill) Gable
Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play
(nods) He must be miserable, the life he lives out there- These so-called abnormalities - they're our stock in trade, they make us actors, writers, directors, et cetera in the first place- Answer me this
What makes a man become a producer
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent
We all have abnormality in common
We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk
We are the original displaced personalities
(laughs; to Eve) You don't have to read his column tomorrow - you just heard it don't agree, Addison
That happens to be your particular abnormality
Oh,  admit there's a screwball element in the Theater
It sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band
But it isn't basic, it isn't standard - if it were, the Theater couldn't survive
(to a passing butler) Oh, waiter
The butler goes right by
That isn't a waiter, my dear
That's a butler
Well,  can't yell "Oh, butler," can
Maybe somebody's name is Butler
You have a point
An idiotic one, but a point
don't want to make trouble
All want is a drink
(getting up) Leave me get you one
(pitching) Oh, thank you, Mr
Fabian
Max leaves with her empty glass
Well done
see your career rising in the East like the sun
(to Bill) you were saying
was saying that the Theater is nine-tenths hard work
Work done the hard way - by sweat, application and craftsmanship
'll agree to this - that to be a good actor, actress, or anything else in the Theater, means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world
(abruptly) Yes
Yes, it does
(goes on) It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands
And 'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone
To give so much for almost always so little
Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says
She looks at no one in particular, just off
So little
So little, did you say
Why, if there's nothing else - there's applause
It's like - like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up
Imagine
To know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you
they smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong
Just that alone is worth anything
She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks of warm interest
She's embarrassed, she turns away - then scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the direction of the pantry
Margo's had too much to drink
Her fake smile fades as Eve gets up
She's unpleasant and depressed
Don't get up
And please stop acting as if  were the queen mother
(hurt) 'm sorry,  didn't mean to- (sharply) Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know
We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- (to Eve) - aren't we, honey
Margo, really
Please don't play governess, Karen, haven't your unyielding good taste,  wish 'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter
(to Addison) 'm being rude now, aren't should  say "ain't "
You're maudlin and full of self pity
You're magnificent
Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink
How about calling it a night
And you pose as a playwright situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep
It's a good thought
It won't play
As a nonprofessional,  think it's an excellent idea
Undramatic, but practical
As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side
Happy little housewife
Cut it out
This is my house, not a theater
In my house you're a guest, not a director-
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast
Hear, hear
Now let's not get into a big hassle- It's about time we did
It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off
(suddenly) All right
'm going to bed
(to Bill) You be the host
It's your party
Happy Birthday, welcome home, and we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you
She starts upstairs
Need any help
(pauses, smiles) To put me to bed
Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out
eve would
Wouldn't you, Eve
If you'd like
wouldn't like
She goes up, exits out of sight
pause
Miss Caswell reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand
forgot  had it
didn't
Bill gets up and goes after Margo
Too bad
We'll miss the third act
They're going to play it off stage
Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears
Coming
In a minute
She crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if  do
But there must be some reason, something 've done without knowing
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out
Einstein couldn't
If  thought 'd offended her, of all people- Eve
'm fond of Margo too
But know Margo
And every now and then there is nothing  want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants
(smiles) Well - if she's got to pick on someone, 'd just as soon it was me
Karen smiles back
She joins Lloyd and Max
Max is going to drop us
've often wondered, Max, why you bother with a chauffeur and limousine in New York City
In my case it's necessary
Too many taxi drivers write plays
And too many of them are produced
Let's go sit by the piano
You have me confused with Dan Dailey
You go sit by the piano
(to Eve) And you come sit by me
(to the others) Good night
They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs
As Eve crosses to Addison: Karen
(Karen pauses) you won't forget, will you
What we talked about before
(smiles) No, Eve,  won't forget
She follows the men downstairs
of an old engraving of Mrs
Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other theatrical mementos on the stair wall
-    - The applause continues
Margo sits back in her chair now, picking at a bit of fingernail polish
' Bill's welcoming-home-birthday party
a night to go down in history
Like the Chicago Fire - or the Massacre of the Huguenots
Even before the party started,  could smell disaster in the air
'  - The same night as the previous sequence, but before the party has started
Margo is all dressed except for jewelry
She stands before her dressing table putting it on
She sips at an enormous Martini
' knew it,  sensed it even as finished dressing for that blasted party
Birdie comes in
You all put together
My back's open
(Birdie goes to work on it) Did the extra help get here
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers
Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency
You're not being funny,  could get actors for less
What about the food
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- (she zips Margo) Voila
(laughs) That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he
There was nothing he didn't know
(she starts tidying the room) There's a message from the bartender
Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake
The only thing  ordered by mistake is the guests
(Birdie cackles) They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns
where's Bill
He's late
Late for what
Don't be dense
The party
ain't dense
And he's been here twenty minutes
Well,  certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up
Her glance meets Birdie's
She turns and strolls out
- Margo speeds up going down the stairs
- Margo shows up again deliberately as she reaches the landing
Sound of Bill and Eve laughing together from the living room
Margo strolls toward it casually
We see Eve seated, looking up fascinated at Bill as he talks - out of the laughter
"Don't let it worry you," said the cameraman, "Even DeMille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end-" (Eve chuckles) So that was the first and last time- Eve sees Margo approach
She gets up
Bill turns
'   - As Margo strolls up, very off-hand
Don't let me kill the point
Or isn't it a story for grownups
You've heard it
About when looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
(to Eve) Remind me to tell you about when looked into the heart of an artichoke
'd like to hear it
Some snowy night in front of the fire
in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres
The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something
Of course
She leaves
short lull
Margo looks into cigarette boxes
Bill eyes her curiosity, crosses to the fire
Looks like 'm going to have a very fancy party
thought you were going to be late- When 'm guest of honor
had no idea you were even here
ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing
That never stopped you before
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested
She's a girl of so many interests
It's a pretty rare quality these days
She's a girl of so many rare qualities
So she seems
(the steel begins to flash) So you've pointed out, so often
So many qualities, so often
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young
So young and so fair
Bill catches the drift
Incredulously
can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time
(laughs) 've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot
don't think that's funny
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else
You know what  think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because  spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid- Twenty minutes
Thirty minutes, forty minutes
What of it
Stage-struck kid
she's a young lady - of qualities
And 'll have you know 'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities
Studying me as if - as if  were a play or a set of blueprints
How walk, talk, think, eat, sleep
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible
Stop calling her a kid
It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which  would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges
For instance what
For instance - you
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but 'm not going to
'm too mad- - guilty
Mad
Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off
love you for some of them - and in spite of others
haven't let those become too important to me
They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp
All right
But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve
What about her teeth
What about her fangs
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it
So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - won't have it
Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love
And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of
Cut
Print it
What happens in the next reel
Do  get dragged off screaming to the snake pit
' (quietly) Miss Channing
Bill and Margo look off
Eve is in the room
They have no way of knowing how long she's been there
The hors d'oeuvres are here
Is there anything else  can do
Thank you, Eve
'd like a Martini - very dry
'll get it
(he crosses to Eve) What'll you have
Eve, involuntarily, looks to Margo
milkshake
Eve smiles, turns to Bill
Martini
Very dry, please
Bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry
As he crosses the stairs, Karen, Lloyd and Max come up from the street level below
General greetings
Bill continues up to pantry
Eve and then Margo come up to add their welcome
(to Karen) May  have your coat
Don't bother,  can take it up myself
Please
Karen yields with a "thank you, Eve-
" Eve goes up with the coat
Lloyd looks after her approvingly
like that girl
That quality of quiet graciousness
Among so many quiet qualities
They start for the living room
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in
'm so happy you're happy
Look, you haven't been running a settlement house exactly - the kid's earned her way
You had a pretty mixed-up inventory when she took over - merchandise laying all over the shop
You've got Margo mixed up with a five-and-ten-cent store
Make it Bergdorf Goodman
and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max
Done up in little ribbons
could die right now and nobody'd be confused
How about you, Max
How about me what
They've come to a halt near the fireplace
Supposed you dropped dead
What about your inventory
ain't gonna die
Not with a hit
This is the most ghoulish conversation
Bill brings two Martinis
He hands one to Margo
(it drips ice) Thank you
Nothing, really
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down
Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her
(smiles) can always get a fresh one
Karen - you're a Gibson girl
He hands Eve's drink to Karen
Max has wandered off
Other guests are arriving
Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill the empty glass
He puts it on a passing tray
Margo takes a fresh one at the same time
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish
What has or is about to happen
(to Bill) What is he talking about
Macbeth
(to Margo) We know you, we've seen you before like this
Is it over - or just beginning
Margo surveys them all
Fasten your seat belts
It's going to be a bumpy night
She downs the drink, hands the empty glass to Bill, and leaves them
She passes two women, gabbing by the piano
As they see her: #1 Margo, darling
#2 Darling
(passing) Darlings
She arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss Caswell
Margo takes a drink from a passing tray
(to Addison) distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list
What are you doing here
Dear Margo
You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon
You remember Miss Caswell
do not
How do you do
We never met
That's why
Miss Caswell is an actress graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts
(his glance is attracted by Eve coming downstairs) Ah
Eve
(deferentially) Good evening, Mr
deWitt
had no idea you knew each other
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction
Until now we have met only in passing
That's how you met me
In passing
(smiles) Eve, this is an old friend of Mr
deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington
(the two girls say hello) Addison, 've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time- (murmurs) It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater- We have that in common
Then you two must have a long talk- 'm afraid Mr
deWitt would find me boring before too long
You won't bore him, honey
You won't even get to talk
(icily) Claudia dear, come closer
(she does, and he points) This is Max Fabian
He is a producer
Go do yourself some good
(sighs) Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits
Because that is what they are
Go make him happy
Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max
Addison puts Eve's arm in his
(to Margo) You mustn't worry about your little charge
She is in safe hands
Amen
Eve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away
Margo looks after them
She downs her drink
'   - It's many Martinis later
Most of the guests have gone
The party has reached that static state - everyone's assumed more or less permanent places
Birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee
her to the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the pianist
He is just finishing "Liebestraum" and she stares moodily into a Martini
Birdie halts beside her with the coffee
Margo looks up
Birdie holds out the coffee
Margo takes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee and waves Birdie away
Birdie goes
"Liebestraum" comes to an end
The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated rhythm
Margo stops him
(quietly) "Liebestraum
" just played it
Play it again
But that was the fourth straight time
Then this will be five
suppose you think 'm too drunk to count
No
You're just crazy about "Liebestraum
" "Liebestraum
" Look, Miss Channing
it's kind of depressing
If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine
My dear Horowitz
In the first place, 'm paying you union scale
Second, it's my piano
Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home
"Liebestraum
" Unhappily, he plays "Liebestraum
" Margo sips her Martini, stares down into it again
Bill tiptoes up
(whispers) Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body
Where has it been laid out
(somberly) It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it
The remains of Margo Channing
Sitting up
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up
(trying to kid her out of it) Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side
If my guests do not like it here, suggest they accompany you to the nursery where 'm sure you will all feel more at home
Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up
Margo
You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house
(sympathetic) Poor Max
Heartburn
(Max nods) It's that Miss Caswell
don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn
No heart to burn
Everybody has a heart - except some people
(she finishes her drink, stands up) Of course 've got bicarb
There's a box in the pantry
We'll put your name on it
Max Fabian
It'll say there
Always
Just for you
(touched) Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck
It's friends that count
And  got friends
love you, Max
really mean it
love you
Come to the pantry
She takes off
Max waits to set Bill straight
She loves me like a father
Also, she's loaded
He starts off after Margo
As the   with Bill we see Margo going into the pantry with Max following her
Bill joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs
- It's a good sized one
In the b
g
, the caterers are packing dishes, glassware, etc
Margo crosses to a cupboard
She finds the bicarb
Here you are, Maxie dear
One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell
The situation 'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out
made a promise
Miss Caswell
(Max nods) What
An audition for the part we're replacing
What's-her-name, your sister
He adds water to the bicarb
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad
She looks like she might burn down a plantation
(mixing) feel right now like there's one burning in me
When's the audition
couple of weeks
tell you what
Why don't  read with her
Would you
Anything to help you out, Max
This is real cooperation appreciate it
Not at all
And you could do me a big favor, if you would- All you got to do is name it
Give Eve Harrington job in you office
Max burps
You get quick action, don't you
Margo,  wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away
To keep her here with nothing to do - 'd be standing in her way
and you need her, Max
But what could she do
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to
you'd be a man of leisure- Well
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track
don't know if this would be a wise move
Promise
promise
(happily) That's my Max
Lloyd enters, looking for her
There you are, both of you
Max, Karen has decided it's time to go
Where is she
Up in the room
If you'll excuse me- (to Margo) 'll tell Miss Caswell
He goes out
pause
Who's left out there
Too many
And you've got a new guest
movie star from Hollywood
Shucks
And my autograph book is at the cleaners
Another pause
You disapprove of me when 'm like this, don't you
Not exactly
Sometimes, though, wish  understood you better
When you do, let me in on it
will
Another pause
How's the new one coming
The play
All right,  guess
"Cora
" She's - still a girl of twenty
Twentyish
It isn't important
Don't you think it's about time it became important
How do you mean
Don't be evasive
Margo, you haven't got any age
Miss Channing is ageless
Spoken like a press agent
know what 'm talking about, after all they're my plays
Spoken like an author
(abruptly) Lloyd, 'm not twentyish
am not thirtyish
Three months ago,  was forty years old
Forty
Four oh
(smiles) That slipped out,  hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it
Now feel as if 'd suddenly taken all my clothes off
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want
as young as they want, you mean
And 'm not interested in whether thousands of people think 'm six or six hundred- Just one person
Isn't that so
(Margo doesn't answer) You know what this is all about, don't you
It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill
pause
Margo closes the box of bicarb
Bill's thirty-two
He looks thirty two
He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now
hate men
(she puts the box down) Don't worry, Lloyd
'll play your play
'll wear rompers and come in rolling a hoop if you like
let's go say good night
They exit into the dining room
As they open the swinging door, the   in the doorway
Margo and Lloyd walk toward the stairs
In the b
g
, Eve is talking to the group
How much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and Lloyd to reach her
(in the b
g
) Imagine
to know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you
They smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong
Anything's worth that
Just as before, she becomes aware of Margo's approach with Lloyd
She scrambles to her feet
Don't get up
And please stop acting as if  were the queen mother
And as Margo speaks - or before - we : - Margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in
It's Friday afternoon - no performance
' What was it the wise man said - "This, too, will pass away"
Two weeks later - the day of the audition - all was well with Bill and me, the world and me- -   - Margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer
She spots Addison sprawled on one of the sofas
Why so remote, Addison
should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where  can lend no support - moral or otherwise
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge
Being violently ill to her tummy
It's good luck before an audition
She'll be all right once it starts
She heads for the auditorium
Miss Caswell got lucky too late
The audition is over
(stops) Over
It can't be
've come to read with her
promised Max
The audition was called for 2:30
It is now nearly four
(lightly) Is it really
must start wearing a watch,  never do, you know
who read with Miss Caswell
Bill
(he shakes his head) Lloyd
(he shakes his head) Well, it couldn't have been Max
Who
Naturally enough, your understudy
consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy- refer to your new and unpregnant understudy
Eve Harrington
Eve
My understudy
(keenly) Didn't you know
(quickly) Of course  knew
It just slipped your mind
moment of silence
How
how was Miss Caswell
Frankly,  don't remember
Just slipped your mind
Completely
Nor,  am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick
Was she that bad
As Addison speaks, he rises with excitement
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith
have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while  experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray
You were one
Jeanne Eagels another
Paula Wessely
Hayes - there are others, three or four
Eve Harrington will be among them
(flatly) take it she read well
It wasn't reading, it was a performance
Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire
How nice
In time she'll be what you are
mass of music and fire
That's me
An old kazoo and some sparkles
Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself
He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning
How nice for Lloyd
And how nice for Eve
How nice for everybody
Addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing
He senses the approaching typhoon, he whips it up
Eve was incredibly modest
She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them
The implication being that  have not been reading them as written
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation
Miss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b
g
Feeling better, my dear
Like  just swam the English Channel
Now what
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television
Margo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium
Addison smiles
He takes Miss Caswell's arm
Tell me this
Do they have auditions for television
That's all television is, my dear
Nothing but auditions
He takes her toward the street
-   - The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating Southern mansion
There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the stage
She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium
There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out
Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace
She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile
She ignores him as if he were a used paper cup
She disappears through the door which leads backstage
Max whistles
Lloyd turns
Max indicated the door and puts his hands to his head in despair
Margo walks out of the wings on stage
Bill and Lloyd turn to her
Eve rises
(cheerily) Terribly sorry 'm late, lunch was long and  couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start
Oh, hello, Eve
Hello, Miss Channing
How are you making out in Mr
Fabian's office
(over the footlights to Max) don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised
As you see,  kept my promise, too
Max slumps in his seat
By the time Margo turns back to them, the others have exchanged swift looks
It's all over
What's all over
The audition
(pleased astonishment) Eve
(she turns to her) How enchanting
(to Lloyd and Bill) Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell
She's your understudy
Eve
Eve, my understudy
But  had no idea
thought you knew
She was put on over a week ago- It seems almost inconceivable that haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around
well, well
So Eve is not working for Max after all- (out to Max again) - Max you sly puss
Max submerges further in his seat
Miss Channing,  can't tell you how glad  am that you arrived so late
Really, Eve
Why
Well, if you'd been here to begin with,  wouldn't have dared to read at all
Why not
and if you'd come in the middle, 'd have stopped, couldn't have gone on- (murmurs) What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off
What fire and music
You wouldn't understand
(to Lloyd) How was Miss Caswell
Back to Copacabana
But Eve
Margo, let me tell you about Eve- (breaking in) was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me -  have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours
'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve
You always do
(to Lloyd) You were about to tell me about Eve
You'd have been proud of her
'm sure
She was a revelation
To you, too
What do you mean
(the ice begins to form) mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress
That's beside the point
It's right to the point
Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them
Addison-
So full of meaning, fire and music
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt- - in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy
Playing that childish game of cat and mouse
Not mouse, never mouse
If anything - rat
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most
Perfectly innocent
Man have been hanged for less
'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel
never said it was
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind
Sherwood
Arthur Miller
Beaumont and Fletcher
Max has edged his way to the stage
(from below) May  say a word
No
(to Margo) What makes you think that either Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense  take from you - you'd better stick to Beaumont and Fletcher
They've been dead for three hundred years
He stalks into the wings
Bill's reaction to the fight is typical
He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered bed
Eve stands frozen with fear
Margo yells after Lloyd into the wings
And they're getting better performances today than they ever got
All playwrights should be dead for three hundred years
Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium
The battle goes on without a pause
As he yells back, he crosses to Max at row , center
That would solve none of their problems - because actresses never die
The stars never die and never change
He starts up the aisle with Max
You can change this star any time you want
For a new, fresh, exciting one fully equipped with fire and music
Any time you want - starting with tonight's performance
Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib
(from the stage) Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr
Fabian
Are you breaking the contract
Answer my question
Who am  to threaten
'm a dying man
didn't hear you
(yelling) said 'm a dying man
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill
(from the top of the aisle) shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind
Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto
Max has already walked out unhappily
Lloyd now slams out
Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his cigarette peacefully on the bed
(quiet menace) And you,  take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano
(Bill waves his cigarette; he's noncommittal) Where is Princess Fire-and-Music
Who
The kid
Junior
(looks lazily) Gone
must have frightened her away
wouldn't be surprised
Sometimes you frighten me
(paces up and down) Poor little flower
Just dropped her petals and folded her tent
Don't mix your metaphors
mix what  like
Okay
Mix
'm nothing but a body with a voice
No mind
What a body, what a voice
The ex-ship news' reporter
No body, no voice, all mind
The gong rang
The fight's over
Calm down
will not calm down
Don't calm down
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you
'm trying terribly hard
Well, you needn't
will not be tolerated
And  will not be plotted against
Here we go
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country
Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt- (sits up) Now don't get carried away- (going right on) - shows up for an audition when everyone knew 'd be here
and gives a performance
Out of nowhere - gives a performance
You've been all through that with Lloyd- The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen
And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed  have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches
am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts
Paranoiac
didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon
Tell that to Dr
Freud
Along with the rest of it
She turns away
Bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed
He holds her down
No, 'll tell it to you
For the last time, 'll tell it to you
Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums
(struggling) That word again
don't even know what it means
(firmly) It's time you found out
love you
(Margo says "Ha
") love you
You're a beautiful and intelligent woman- (Margo says " body with a voice") - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress- (he waits; Margo says nothing) - at the peak of her career
You have every reason for happiness- (Margo says "Except happiness") - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid- (Margo sneers "Kid
") - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy
Now once and for all, stop it
Margo seems quiet
He gets up
She sits up
It's obvious you're not a woman
've been aware of that for some time
Well,  am
'll say
Don't be condescending
Come on, get up
'll buy you a drink
(with dignity) admit  may have seen better days, but  am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut
(laughs) Margo, let's make peace
The terms are too high
Unconditional surrender
Just being happy
Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me
It's not nonsense
But if  tell you it is - as  just did
Were you listening to me
(Margo nods) Isn't that enough
wish it were
Then what would be enough
(Margo doesn't answer) If we were married
wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me
Margo, tell me what's behind all this
-  don't know, Bill
Just a feeling,  don't know
think you do know but you won't or can't tell me
(Margo doesn't say) said before it was going to be my last try, and  meant it
can't think of anything else to do wish  could
(a pause) We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down
Then it comes up again and everything's fine
But not this time
(he takes a breath) You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people
Goodbye, Margo
No word from her
He starts away
Bill
(he stops) where are you going
To find Eve
(smiles grimly) That suddenly makes the whole thing believable
He goes out
Margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly
Then she begins to cry
'   - One large room, a small foyer with a door to the corridor stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of bedroom open
Karen is painting
Earnestly but badly
still life of an orange, an avocado, an eggplant and three bananas
' On the day of the audition, my biggest worry was to keep a banana looking part of an eggplant
then Lloyd came home
(in the b
g
, Lloyd lets himself in) It was right after his brawl with Margo
Lloyd slams the door, flings his hat away, strides in, peeling off muffler and overcoat
Lloyd, what happened
Up to here
That's where 've got it - up to here
Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical- Margo, again
And again and again
Two hours late for the audition, to begin with- That's on time for Margo
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy- It's just possible she didn't
Of course she knew
For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-
(suddenly softening) Karen, let me tell you about Eve
She's got everything - a born actress
Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant- - don't run out of adjectives, dear
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about
until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing
Margo hasn't done badly by it
Margo
Margo's great
She knows it
That's the trouble
She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her
Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves
He starts up the stairs to the bedroom
(murmurs) It's going to be a cozy weekend
(pauses) What is
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night
Just the four of us
Bill, Margo, you and
Well
We've spent weekends before with nobody talking
(continues up stairs) just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects
As he goes into one of the bedrooms, Karen sits thoughtfully on a couch
She muses
' Newton - they say, thought of gravity by getting hit on the head by an apple
And the man who invented the steam engine, he was watching a tea-kettle
but not me
My Big Idea came to me just sitting on a couch
She lies down, folds her hands behind her head
' That boot in the rear to Margo
Heaven knows she had one coming
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve, Bill, Max, and so on - we'd all felt those size fives of hers often enough
but how
The answer was buzzing around me like a fly
She sits up
She smiles
The smile fades
' had it
But  let it go
Screaming and calling names is one thing - but this could mean
She shakes her head, crosses to her easel, resumes work on the bananas
She slows down, then stops
' Why not
Why,  said to myself, not
It would all seem perfectly legitimate
And there were only two people in the world who would know
Also, the boot would land where it would do the most good for all concerned- She puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by Lloyd's work chair
As she crosses: ' And after all, it was not more than a perfectly harmless joke which Margo, herself, would be the first to enjoy
She looks in a leather phone book, pick up the phone and dials
' and no reason why she shouldn't be told about it - in time
There's an answer at the other end
(into phone) Hello
will you call Miss Eve Harrington to the phone, please
Not at all
thank you
And as she waits we
: - Open country
Preferably no houses in sight
Plenty of snow
Lloyd's car drives along
' It was a cold weekend - outside and in
Bill didn't come at all
Margo didn't know where he was and didn't care - she kept saying
Somehow we staggered through Sunday - and by the time we drive Margo to the station late Monday afternoon, she and Lloyd had thawed out to the extent of being civil to each other
- Lloyd driving
All three in the front seat
What time is it
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two
It is now five forty-three
When you ask a minute from no, it will be- just don't want Margo to miss her train
As it is, she'll barely make the theater
Five-fifty-five
We'll be at the station in plenty of time
That little place just two hours form New York
It's on my list of things-'ll-never-understand
Like collecting shrunken Indian heads
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet- Peace and quit is for libraries
The car swerves - suddenly and slightly
Lloyd, be careful
Just a little skid, that's all
This road's like glass
Karen and  just don't want an accident- have no intention of having an accident
It's not important whether you do
We are wearing long underwear
They all laugh
Suddenly the car slows and stops - with that hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas
Now what's this
He tries to start it again
No luck
He turns on the dashboard lights
The gas gauge reads empty
But it can't be
We can't be out of gas
filled it myself yesterday
(to Karen) Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning
(very low) guess  didn't look
You know don't pay attention to those things
Incredible
Futilely, he runs the started again
(crisply) How much time have we
Roughly ten minutes
How far to the station
Three or four miles
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas
(looking) None in sight, there aren't many along this back road
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift
moment of silence
Well
No sense my just sitting here
'm going to walk up about half a mile, just in case
He starts out of the car
The cold comes in like a knife, the women react
You'll break your neck on that ice
(grins) What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time
Tell Max  want to be buried with royalties
Don't joke about such things
(quietly) How fortunate that  have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me
Thank you, Lloyd
Godspeed
Lloyd starts down the road
He slips once, recovers, waves and keeps going
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical- It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous
(smiles) just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
Be brave
He'll come back - with or without gas
They tuck the fur car robe around them
pause
Margo turns on the radio
it's "Liebestraum
" Do you want it on
It doesn't matter
detest cheap sentiment
She turns it off
Another pause
Karen
(Karen says "hm
") haven't been pleasant this weekend
We've all seemed a little tense lately
Come to think of it,  haven't been very pleasant for weeks
For that, 'm truly sorry
More than any two people  know,  don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore
The way you do
We know you too well
So many people - know me
wish did
wish someone would tell be about me
You're Margo
Just - Margo
And what is that
Besides something spelled out in light bulbs,  mean
Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice
infants behave the way  do, you know
They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want
When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved
There's a pause
What about Bill
What about Bill
He's in love with you
More than anything in this world, love Bill
And  want Bill
want him to want me
But me
Not Margo Channing
And if  can't tell they apart - how can he
Why should he - and why should you
Bill's in love with Margo Channing
He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her
but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist
And what's left will be
what
Margo
Bill is all of eight years younger than you
Those years stretch as the years go on
've seen it happen too often
Not to you
Not to Bill
Isn't that what they always say
She turns the radio on again
piano nocturne
don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't
Silly, isn't it
You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm
Margo nods, get some cigarettes out of her bag
She offers one to Karen
They light up
About Eve
've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too
Well
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down
At best, let's say 've been oversensitive to
well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless
To so many things  want to be for Bill
funny business, a woman's career
The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster
You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman
That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman
Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted
and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is
Without that, you're not woman
You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman
(she smiles at Karen) slow curtain
The end
pause
There are tears in Karen's eyes
Margo
(she hesitates) Margo,  want you to know how sorry am about this
About what
(indicating their predicament) This
can't tell you how sorry am
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks
After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank
She snuggles down into her furs
Karen flashes an unhappy look at her
She, too, snuggles down
-   - The snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley, making a lane
The performance is just over
Addison, his back to us, stands looking toward the stage door
few actors, on their way out
' Eve, of course, was superb
Many of the audience understandably preferred to return another time to see Margo
But those who remained cheered loudly, lustily and long for Eve
how thoughtful of her to call and invite me - that afternoon
He starts to walk toward the stage door
' and what a happy coincidence that several representatives of other newspapers happened to be present
All of us - invited that afternoon to attend an understudy's performance
He goes in the stage door
-   - More activity than last time, the performance being just over
Addison comes through the door, picks his way toward Margo's dressing room
' about which the management knew nothing until they were forced to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock
Coincidence
Also every indication of intrigue, skulduggery and fraud
The door tot he dressing room is open just a bit
Addison pauses beside the door to listen
(from within) you were better than all right, kid, you gave a performance, you rang a bell- Addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther, so that both he and  can see as well as hear
'   - Bill faces Eve, who wears Margo's costume
She is a ravishing sight
Her eyes shine up to his radiantly: (continuing) - little things here and there, it doesn't matter
You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be
(quietly) Are you proud of me, Bill
'll admit  was worried when Max called
had my doubts
You shouldn't have had any doubts
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations
But you did it
With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress
If that's what you want to be
Is that what you want me to be
'm talking about you
And what you want
So am
What have  got to do with it
Everything
(lightly) The names 've been called
But never Svengali
(he pats her shoulder) Good luck
He starts out
Addison ducks
Don't run away, Bill
(stops) From what would  be running
You're always after truth - on the stage
What about off
(curiously) 'm for it
Then face it
have
Since that first night - here - in the dressing room
(smiles) When  told you what every young actress should know
When you told me that whatever became, it would be because of you- Your make-up's a little heavy
- and for you
(slowly) You're quite a girl
You think
'm in love with Margo
Hadn't you heard
You hear all kinds of things
'm only human, rumors to the contrary
And 'm as curious as the next man
Find out
(deliberately) Only thing, what  go after,  want to go after
don't want it to come after me
Tears come to Eve's eyes
She turns away slowly
Don't cry
Just score it as an incomplete forward pass
He walks out
Addison ducks to avoid being seen
Eve glares after Bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the dressing table
Her glance is caught by a pair of scissors
Swiftly, she snatches them up and in a sharp, vicious gesture she slashes the wig
Addison knocks politely at the door
Eve turns
May  come in
Certainly, Mr
deWitt
(entering) expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet
consider myself lucky they didn't throw things
She starts creaming her face, removing make-up
Of course your performance was no surprise to me
After the other day regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled
You're more than kind
But it's still Miss Channing's performance
'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original
You're more than modest
It's not modesty
just don't try to kid myself
revolutionary approach to the Theater
However, if  may a suggestion
Please do
think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility
It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly
don't think 've done anything to sound off about
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns
If we don't blow them - who will
Even so
One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy
It'll be forgotten tomorrow
It needn't be
Even if  wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn
how would  do it
'm less than nobody
am somebody
Eve rises
She eyes him steadily
You certainly are
She goes into the bathroom
Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk
Eve does so
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper
(from the bathroom) 'd love to
Or should  pretend 'm busy
(smiling) Let's have a minimum of pretending
'll want to do a column about you- 'm not enough for a paragraph
- perhaps more than one
There's so much  want to know
've heard your story in bits and pieces
your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it
(no answer; Addison smiles) say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it
That's right
San Francisco
An oasis of civilization in the California desert
Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco
Yes
do
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco
Was it - the Shubert
(a slight pause) Yes
The Shubert
(grins happily) fine old theater, the Shubert
Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire
by the way, what was your husband's name
Eddie
Eddie what
Eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door
'm about to go into the shower, won't be able to hear you
can wait
Where would you like to go
We'll make this a special night
(trustingly) You take charge
believe  will
She closes the door
He leans back, lights a cigarette
52ND  -   - cab drives up to "21
" ' Some of the morning papers carried a little squib about Eve's performance
Not much, but full praise
couldn't imagine how they found out about it - but Lloyd said Max's publicity man probably sent out the story
Karen gets out of the cab, pays and goes in
' at any rate,  feel terribly guilty and ashamed of myself - and wanted nothing so much as to forget the whole thing
Margo and  were having lunch at "21" - just like girlfriends - with hats on
- "21" - Karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters
Has Miss Channing come in
Not yet, Mrs
Richards
Karen sees Eve who waits as Addison hands his hat, coat, and cane to an attendant
She smiles, crosses to her
Eve
've heard the most wonderful things about your performance- Mostly relief that  managed to stagger through it at all
She was magnificent
(pleased) Then you've heard too
was there
An eyewitness
(staggered) You were there
At the play - last night
(smiles) happy coincidence
(quickly) We're having lunch with a movie talent scout
They certainly don't waste much time
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch
They'll be wasting this much of their time at any rate
Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood
He turns to Karen, changing the subject
From the smartness of your dress, take it your luncheon companion is a lady
(smiles) Margo
Margo
Lunching in public
It's new Margo
But she's just as late as the old one
She may be later than you think
As he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, opens it as he comes back
(handing it to her) Why not read my column to pass the time
The minutes will fly like hours
(he takes Eve's arm) and now we must join our sunburned eager beaver
He goes up the stairs with Eve
Karen glances after them curiously, then at the column
It is headed: "Things  Promised Not To Tell" by Addison deWitt
He expression becomes increasingly horrified
She drops the paper and rushes out
'   - Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides about reading it
Karen sits miserably
(declaiming) "
my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington
am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops
"
thought that one went out with Woollcott
(she skips part of the column) Down here
here, listen to this- "
Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-" just can't believe it
It get better
"- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-" can't believe Eve said those things
Margo crumples the paper as if it were Eve's neck
(pacing) In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent
One of the differences between the Theater and civilization
(she hurls the paper away) what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance
(weakly) Lloyd says it's a publicity release
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up
well, she won't get away with it
Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen
If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it,  will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr
deWitt's ugly throat
She pauses in midair to look at
Bill
He has come up the stairs tow at a time, stands at the landing
(quietly) came as soon as  read that piece of filth
ran all the way
Margo suddenly starts to cry
She turns from him
Bill takes her in his arms
He holds her
Bill's here, baby
Everything's all right, now
Margo says nothing, just hides in his embrace
He soothes her, pets her
he looks over at Karen
guess at this point 'm what the French call 'de trop'
(smiles) Maybe just a little around the edges
Karen smiles back, waves, and goes out
'  - Karen's having some lunch
Lloyd, still in his robe, sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette
copy of the interview before him
(is saying) - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom
taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say- Where'd you get all that information
(put out his cigarette) Eve
Eve
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her
That was a pity
(gets up) She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo
wonder why
Lloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words, for a position to maintain
She started to tell me all about it - and she couldn't finish, she cried so
He's over by a window, his back to her
Karen eyes him curiously, waiting for the payoff
(finally) You know, 've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression
That's quite a change of subject
(walks again) What with taxes coming up - and since 'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, 've been thinking
'm trying hard to follow you
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps
' into production right away
'm beginning to catch up
If we could cast it properly, that is
(carefully) Maybe get some younger actress for the part
Someone who'd look the part as well as play it
(smiles) You've got to admit it would be a novelty
Now you're quoting Addison
Or Eve
pause
Eve did mention the play, you know
But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello
No,  got the idea myself - while she was talking to me
With gestures, of course
(wistfully) For once, to write something and have it realized completely
For once, not to compromise- Now Karen explodes
She rises
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora
" Now just a minute- Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise
(angry) Now just a minute
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious
Lloyd's full of anger and guilt
He snaps back
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt
She apologized, didn't she
On her knees,  have no doubt
Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe
The cynicism you refer to, acquired the day  discovered  was different from little boys
The phone has been ringing
Lloyd snarls into it
Hello
(he quiets down) hi, Margo
no, not at all, Karen and  were just chatting
hmm
why - why, yes, 'm sure we can and 'm sure we'd love to
right
11:45ish
See you then
He hangs up
He smiles - suddenly, there's peace
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater
For a bottle of wine
(smiles) Margo in the Cub Room
couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb
'm glad Bill's back
They'd die without each other
pause
Darling,  didn't promise Eve anything
Just said  thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties
Such as
(grins) You - for one
told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval
Karen smiles happily
That's fine
Fine and dandy
'd enjoy nothing more
Just refer all of Miss Harrington's future requests to me
-   - Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a table in the rear of the room
bottle of fine wine is being poured
Their mood is equally bubbly
The so-called art of acting is not one for which  have a particularly high regard
Hear, hear
But you may quote me as follows
Quote
Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which have never seen before and expect rarely to see again
Unquote
He does not exaggerate
was good
You were great
As they look at each other, they reflect the understanding that has hit them both at last
It's been quite a night understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice
(eyes still on Bill) Too bad
(eyes still on Margo) 'm broken up about it
The wine has been poured by now
For some reason you can't just pick up champagne and drink it
Somebody's got to be very witty about a toast
(he lifts his glass) For instance
(abruptly) 'm going to propose the toast
Without wit
With all my heart
Lloyd lowers his glass
There's a little pause
To Margo
To my bride-to-be
Glory Hallelujah
Well of all- Margo
Drink
They drink, then burst into a flurry of questions
When
When are you going to do it
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten- (to Margo) - and you're going to be on time
Yes, sir
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters -  see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers
It's only for the license
There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that
'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all
Three days, that's for the bourgeois -  see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person
(to Margo) What are you going to wear
Something simple
fur coat over a nightgown
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends
Lloyd fills all the glasses
There are very few moments in life as good as this
Let's remember it
(he lifts his glass) To each of us and all of us
never have we been more close - may we never be farther apart
They drink
waiter approaches with a note
Mrs
Richards
Yes
For you
Karen stares at it curiously, then opens it
Very discreet
note right out in the open like that
Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass
Lloyd,  want you to be big about this
the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe
(angrily) This beats all world's records for running, standing and jumping gall
She whips the note to Margo, who reads it aloud
(reading) "Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that speak with you
Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room
Eve
" understand she is now the understudy in there
(looking about) Pass me the empty bottle
may find her
why, look
There's Rasputin
Addison sits near the entrance, at a banquette table for two
crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate Eve's place
He nibbles daintily at some blini
Margo hails a passing captain
Encore du champagne
More champagne, Miss Channing
That's what  said, bub
(to Karen) After all, maybe she just wants to apologize
have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say
But what could she say
That's what fascinates me
Go on - find out
Karen, in all the years of our friendship,  have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone
But now must
am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there
Well
all right
She gets up and goes
The  takes her past Addison's table
He rises in polite surprise
Karen
How nice
She walks past him without a word
He smiles, looks toward the group
He raises his glass in a toast
Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand flourish, then eating it
Very effective
But why take it out on me
He eats one in self-defense
'  -   - Never having been,  can't say what it looks like
It is to be hoped that there is an outer and inner room
We are concerned with the outer
There is an attendant in charge, and a constantly changing flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs
All cafe society - including one young drunk stretched out under a mink coat and a wet towel
There are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner
Eve waits there
She rises as Karen approaches
was wondering whether you'd come at all
Don't get up
(she smiles grimly) And don't act as if  were the queen mother
don't expect you to be pleasant
don't intend to be
Can't we sit down
Just for a minute
She sits down
Karen remains standing
've got a lot to say
And none of it is easy
There can't be very much- Oh, but there is- - and easy or not,  won't believe a word
Why shouldn't you
(a pause) Please sit down
Karen sits, reluctantly and rigidly
You know, 've always considered myself a very clever girl
Smart
Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time
but then, 'd never met Addison deWitt
(another pause) remember once  had a tooth pulled
They gave me some anaesthetic -  don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way
heard myself saying things  wasn't even thinking
as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what  did or said- (leading her on) - and you felt just like that talking to Addison
(nods) In a way
You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means- (sharply) Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison
No
don't expect you to believe anything
Except that the responsibility is mine
And the disgrace
Let's not get over-dramatic
(smiles grimly) You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you
We'll 'll give you some pleasant news
've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that
To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be
She turns away from Karen
Karen's embarrassed
Eve
don't cry
(turned away) 'm not crying
Tell me
How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things- But the raves about your performance- - an understudy's performance
Well
think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really
If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison
He's not my friend
You were my friends
He can help you
wish 'd never met him, 'd like him to be dead
want my friends back
This time she does cry
Softly, miserably
Karen looks about
pause
She puts an arm around Eve
Eve
-  don't think you meant to cause unhappiness
But you did
More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else
'll never get over it
(smiles) Yes, you will
You Theater people always do
Nothing is forever in the Theater
Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone
wish  could believe that
Give yourself time
Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented
(she gets up, her hand still on Eve's shoulder) and, believe it or not, if there's anything  can do- Eve has reached up to take Karen's hand
She holds it now, as she turns slowly to face her
There is something
Karen stares down at her
Eve's eyes burn into tears
Karen is caught, fascinated by them
think  know
Something most important you can do
You want to play "Cora
" You want me to tell Lloyd  think you should play it
If you told him so, he'd give me the part
He said he would
After all you've said
don't you know the part was written for Margo
It could have been - fifteen years ago
It's my part now
You talk just as Addison said you did
"Cora" is my part
You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me
don't think anything in the world could make me say that
She turns away again, but Eve's grip is like a vise
Addison wants me to play it
Over my dead body
(cold, relentless) That won't be necessary
Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how  happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town
(Karen stops struggling) it's quite a story
Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth
had a time persuading him
(she smiles, now) you'd better sit down
You look a bit wobbly
(Karen sits) If  play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print
simple exchange of favors
And 'm so happy  can do something for you - at long last
(Karen covers her face with her hands) Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit
And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again
(now Eve gets up) No
it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if  were to play "Cora
" And so much better theater, too
Karen looks up slowly
part in a play
You'd do all that - just for a part in a play
(smiles) 'd do much more - for a part that good
She leaves
Karen is alone
- Eve enters and slides in beside Addison
Hungry
Just some coffee
(pours) 'm not surprised
After all that humble pie
Nothing of the kind
Karen and had a nice talk
Heart to heart
Woman to woman
Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it
discussed it very openly
told her that  had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo
Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that  play the part
Addison puffs at his cigarette, bemused
Just like that, eh
Just like that
(thoughtfully) Do you know, Eve - sometimes think you keep things from me
Eve's feelings are hurt
don't think that's funny
It wasn't meant to be
confide in you and rely on you more than anyone 've ever known
To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when  need you more than ever
(breaks in) hope you mean what you say, Eve
intend to hold you to it
Their eyes meet
We have a great deal in common, it seems to me
They both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her table
, as Karen joins them
Another bottle of champagne has come and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling among them
Margo, in particular, is cheery
pause
Karen downs a glass of champagne
- well
What happened
Nothing much
She apologized
With tears
With tears
But not right away
First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella
Check
Very classy stuff, lots of technique- You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize
What'd you say
Not much
Groom- (Bill says "huh
") - may  have a wedding present
What would you like
Texas
want everybody to shut up about Eve
Just shut up about Eve, that's all  want
Give Karen more wine
(blissfully) never have  been so happy
Isn't this a lovely room
The Cub Room
What a lovely, clever name
Where the elite meet
Never have seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me
Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle
But not tonight
Even Eve
forgive Eve
there they go
They all look
, they get up and go without looking back
, they watch for an instant
There goes Eve
Eve evil, Little Miss Evil
But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom
Something about the good they leave behind - played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre
You've got it backwards
Even for Wilkes-Barre
You know why  forgive Eve
Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault -  forgive her
Karen's reactions are, of course, most important
Knowing what she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must
and Bill
Especially Bill
Eve did that, too
You know, she probably means well, after all
She is a louse
(to Lloyd) Never try to outguess Margo
Groom
Yes, dear
You know what 'm going to be
cowboy
married lady
With the paper to prove it
'm going to have a home
Not just a house 'm afraid to stay in
and a man to go with it
'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be
remember, Karen
(quietly) remember
(to Bill) You'll be there, won't you
(grins) Often enough to keep the franchise
foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady
that's for me
And no more make believe
Off stage or on
remember, Lloyd
(Lloyd nods) mean it, now
Grown-up women only,  might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight
(they all smile) Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me
(smiles) That depends
mean really, deeply angry
don't think  could be
Well
don't want to play "Cora
" (explodes) What
Margo misinterprets her vehemence
(hastily) Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part
And a fine play
But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady
What's your being married got to do with it
It means 've finally got a life to live
don't have to play parts 'm too old for - just because 've got nothing to do with my nights
(then quietly) know you've made plans
'll make it up to you, believe me
'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd
Lloyd never gets to answer
Because Karen, before anyone can stop her, bursts into hysterical laughter
What's so funny
Nothing
Nothing
Everything
everything's so funny
Margo removes the champagne glass from in front of Karen
: -   - Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box
Lloyd sits beside Max up front
On stage, the play is "on its feet
" Eve plays a dramatic scene with a young man
They carry "sides" but do not consult them
As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium
Bill calls a halt
He indicates to Eve that she was to have remained downstage
Eve seems to be at a loss
She looks at Lloyd
Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change
Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing, he'll do the directing
It mounts swiftly to a screaming fight
Bill throws the script out into the auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off
Eve runs after him
Max retrieves the script
Lloyd remains adamant
Karen has risen in dismay
Eve drags Bill back
Without looking at Lloyd, he takes the script from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they left off
Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage
Lloyd smiles, mollified, sits down again with Max
Karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater
' Lloyd never got around, somehow - to asking me whether it was all right with me for Eve to play "Cora"
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct the play at first - with Eve in it
Lloyd and Max finally won him over
Margo never came to a rehearsal, too much to do around the house, she said
'd never known Bill and Lloyd to fight as bitterly and as often
and always over some business for Eve, or a move or the way she read a speech
but then 'd never known Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's directing - as far as it affected Eve, that is
somehow, Eve kept them going
Bill stuck it out - and Lloyd seemed happy - and  thought it might be best if  skipped rehearsals from then on
'  - It is a lovely, large room
Two double beds, not alongside each other and each with an extension phone beside it
In addition to the door to the living room, there are two more - to separate dressing rooms and baths
Lloyd is asleep
But not Karen
She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights a cigarette
' It seemed to me  had known always that it would happen - and here it was
It felt helpless, that helplessness you feel when you have no talent to offer - outside of loving your husband
How could  compete
Everything Lloyd loved about me, he had gotten used to long ago
The phone jangles suddenly, startling her
It wakes Lloyd up
Karen answers
Hello
who
who's calling Mr
Richards
- girl, in a wrapper, at a wall phone
Her hair's in curlers
She's frightened
My name wouldn't mean anything room across the hall from Eve Harrington, and she isn't well
She's been crying all night and hysterical, and she doesn't want a doctor
' , Lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed, looking over
Who is it
What's it all about
(into phone) Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr
Richards
Lloyd picks up his phone
No, Eve didn't say to call him, but remembered  saw Mr
Richards with her a couple of times - and thought they being such good friends
' (into phone) Hello
hello, this is Lloyd Richards
Where is Eve
Let me talk to her- She's up in her room, Mr
Richards
really hate to bother you like this, but the way Eve's been feeling - 'm just worried sick what with her leaving for New Haven tomorrow, and everything
' Tell her not to worry - tell her 'll be right over
'll tell her, Mr
Richards
She hangs up
As she moves from the phone, the to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs
The girls smile at each other
They go upstairs, arm in arm
' , Karen is still in bed, phone still in her hand
She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her cigarette, gets into a robe
The open door and light of the dressing room tell us where Lloyd is
Karen walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her mind
She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes back to the door
(finally) Aren't you
broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit
Rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor
No answer except the opening and closing of drawers
What would you do if, instead of Eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical
Still no answer
Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door
Lloyd,  don't want you to go
Now Lloyd appears
He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with no tie
He's confused and guilty and tortured
didn't think you would
It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general- 'm a human being, 've got some
(goes right on) - and for my feelings in particular
For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater
He goes back into his room
Have you forgotten about Eve
What she is, what she's done
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy
And a phobia against truth
Then tell me this isn't true
That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career
Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket
He crosses to the door, Karen after him
That first, last, and foremost - your reason for going now is that you want to be with Eve
Three in the morning or high noon - play or no play - wife or no wife
(Lloyd stops at the door) Isn't it true, Lloyd
Lloyd goes out
Karen looks after him, despairing
-   - The theater is but a few doors from the
The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by Max Fabian, opening tonight
Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo on a lobby display
None of the actors are starred
' To the Theater world - New Haven, Connecticut, is a short stretch of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel, surrounded by what looks very much like a small city
It is here that managers have what are called out of-town openings - which are openings for New Yorkers who want to go out of town
They start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's
What a day - what a heavenly day
-day
Just like it
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality
(grins) Stop rehearsing your column
Isn't it strange, Addison
thought 'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something
Instead,  can't wait for tonight to come
To come and go
Are you that sure of tomorrow
Aren't you
Frankly - yes
They've arrived in front of the hotel
It'll be a night to remember
It'll bring to me everything 've ever wanted
The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one
All paved with diamonds and gold
You know me better than that
Paved with what, then
Stars
She goes in
Addison follows her
-   - Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door
What time
Almost four
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night
You could sleep, too, couldn't you
Why not
They've arrived at her door
She opens it
The mark of a true killer
(he holds out his hand) Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting
Why'd call me a killer
Did  say killer
meant champion
get my boxing terms mixed
He turns to go
After a few steps- (calling) Addison- (he pauses) - come on in for just a minute, won't you
There's
've got something to tell you
Addison turns curiously, and enters behind her
'  -   - Old-fashioned, dreary and small
The action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom
Addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair
Suites are for expense accounts
Aren't you being extravagant
Max is paying for it
He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted
well
Can  fix you a drink
She indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor, glasses, etc
Addison's eyebrows lift
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian
Lloyd
never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up
Some plain soda
(Eve starts to fix it) Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven
That's for tonight
You're invited
We're having everyone up after the performance
We're
Lloyd and
She carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet
find it odd that Karen isn't here for the opening, don't you
He sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at Eve
As he looks back- Addison
(blandly) She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd
would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her- (breaks in) Addison, just a few minutes ago
When  told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything  wanted- (nods) - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars
didn't mean just the Theater
What else
Eve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common
(her back to him) Lloyd Richards
He's going to leave Karen
We're going to be married
For just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously
Then they crinkle into a bland smile
So that's it
Lloyd
Still just the Theater, after all
(turns; shocked) It's nothing of the kind
Lloyd loves me,  love him
know nothing about Lloyd and his loves -  leave those to Louisa May Alcott
But  do know you
'm in love with Lloyd
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America- You have no right to say such things
- and artistically, the most promising
Eve dear, this is Addison
Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape
Her face lights up - she crosses back to the ottoman
Addison, won't it be just perfect
Lloyd and  - there's no telling how far we can go
he'll write great plays for me, 'll make them be great
(as she sits) You're the only one 've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me
and Karen
She doesn't know
She knows enough not to be here
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and  are going to be married
(thoughtfully) see
And when was this unholy alliance joined
We decided the night before last, before we came up here
(increasingly tense) Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was
He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until  promised to marry him
we sat and talked until it was light
He never went home
You sat and talked until it was light
(meaningly) We sat and talked, Addison
want a run of the play contract
(quietly) There never was, there'll never be another like you
(happily) Well, say something - anything
Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve
Addison rises slowly, to his full height
As Eve watches him, as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades- What do you take me for
(cautiously) don't know what  take you for anything
(moving away) It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them
'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but  don't know what
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did
am Addison deWitt
'm nobody's fool
Least of all - yours
never intended you to be
Yes, you did
You still do
Eve gets up, now
still don't know what you're getting at
Right now  want to take my nap
It's important that - (breaks in) - it's important right now that we talk
Killer to killer
(wisely) Champion to champion
Not with me, you're no champion
You're stepping way up in class
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so can take my nap
Very well, plainly and distinctly
Although  consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as , what am about to say
(they are now facing each other) Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you
What do you mean by that
More plainly and more distinctly Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale
have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because  will not permit it
What have you got to do with it
Everything
Because after tonight, you will belong to me
can't believe my ears
dull cliche
Belong - to you
That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years
don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly  had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and taken it for granted
That you and
She smiles
Then she chuckles, then laughs
mistake
Addison slaps her sharply across the face
(quietly) Remember as long as you live, never to laugh at me
At anything or anyone else - but never at me
Eve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open
Get out
Addison walks to the door, closes it
You're too short for that gesture
Besides, it went out with Mrs
Fiske
Then if you won't get out, 'll have you thrown out
She goes to the phone
Don't pick it up
Don't even put your hand on it
She doesn't
Her back is to him
Addison smiles
Something told you to do as  say, didn't it
That instinct is worth millions, you can't buy it, cherish it, Eve
When that alarm goes off, go to your battle stations
He comes up behind her
Eve is tense and wary
Your name is not Eve Harrington
It is Gertrude Slescynski
What of it
It is true that your parents were poor
They still are
And they would like to know how you are - and where
They haven't heard from you for three years
(curtly) What of it
She walks away
Addison eyes her keenly
matter of opinion
Granted
It is also true that you worked in a brewery
But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it
As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives
(whirls on him) She never proved anything, not a thing
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it
Eve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door
Addison opens it, follows close after her
he can be seen in the bedroom, shouting at Eve who is offscene
That $500 brought you straight to New York - didn't it
- Eve, trapped, in a corner of the room
She was a liar, she was a liar
Answer my question
Weren't you paid to get out of town
Eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears
Addison, merciless, moves closer
Fourth
There was no Eddie - no pilot - and you've never been married
That was not only a lie, but an insult to dead heroes and to the women who loved them
(Eve, sobbing, puts her hands over her ears; Addison, closer, pulls them away) Fifth
San Francisco has no Shubert Theater and North Shore, you've never been to San Francisco
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose, not worthy of you
Eve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming
had to get in, to meet Margo had to say something, be somebody, make her like me
She did like you, she helped and trusted you
You paid her back by trying to take Bill away
That's not true
was there,  saw you and heard you through the dressing room door
Eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it
(into the bed) No-no-no
had lunch with Karen not three hours ago
As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned
(he lets go of her hands) do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night
Eve covers her face with her hands
Please
please
Addison get off the bed, looks down at her
That  should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability
But that, in itself, is probably the reason
You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am
We have that in common
Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love or be loved, insatiable ambition - and talent
We deserve each other
Are you listening to me
Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the coverlet
She nods
Then say so
Yes, Addison
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me
Yes, Addison
Take your nap, now
And good luck for tonight
He starts out
(tonelessly) won't play tonight
(Addison pauses) couldn't
Not possibly couldn't go on
(smiles) Couldn't go on
You'll give the performance of your life
He goes out
The   on Eve's forlorn, tear stained face
Her eyes close
she goes to sleep
-    - of Eve reaching out for the award
The applause and bulb-popping still going on
' And she gave the performance of her life
And it was a night to remember, that night
picks up where it left off
Eve accepts the award from the Aged Actor, kisses him tenderly, folds the award to her bosom and waits for quiet
She speaks with assurance, yet modestly and humbly
Honored members of Sarah Siddons Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: What is there for me to say
Everything wise and witty has long since been said - by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine
For me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous -  am an apprentice in the Theater and have much to learn from you all
can say only that  am proud and happy and that  regard this great honor not so much as an award for what  have achieved, but as a standard to hold against what have yet to accomplish
(applause) And further,  regard it as bestowed upon me only in part
The larger share belongs to my friends in the Theater - and to the Theater itself, which has given me all have
In good conscience,  must give credit where credit is due
To Max Fabian- sits erect, beaming proudly
' - dear Max
Dear, sentimental, generous, courageous Max Fabian - who took a chance on an unknown, untried, amateur
, after applause greets Max
And to my first friend in the Theater - whose kindness and graciousness  shall never forget
Karen - Mrs
Lloyd Richards
resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her
' and it was Karen who first brought me to one whom  had always idolized - and who was to become my benefactor and champion
great actress and a great woman - Margo Channing
, part of Eve's tribute has been over her -
She smiles grimly in reaction to the applause
looks to her right, waits for the applause to die
My director - who demanded always a little more than my talent could provide- , seated at the speakers' table
He has his award before him - a smaller one
He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly as the applause breaks out
- but who taught me patiently and well
Bill Sampson
sits beside Bill
He, too, has a smaller award
As Eve speaks, he throws her a brief glance
' And one, without whose great play and faith in me, this night would never have been
How can  repay Lloyd Richards
waits for the applause to die
Hoe can  repay the many others
So many, that  couldn't possibly name them all
smiles approvingly
' whose help, guidance and advice have made this, the happiest night of my life, possible
stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for self-control
Although  am going to Hollywood next week to make a film - do not think for a moment that  am leaving you
How could
For my heart is here in the Theater - and three thousand miles are too far to be away from one's heart
'll be back to claim it - and soon
That is, if you want me back
Another storm of applause
Much ad lib shouting as Bill and Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures
People are thronging out
The Aged Actor shouts above the hubbub
good night to all - and to all a good night
Eve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way toward Addison's table
Bill and Lloyd follow Lloyd to Karen
They kiss
He gives her the award
For services rendered - beyond the whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling
Max bustles into the
Come on
'm the host,  gotta get home before the guests start stealing the liquor
She and Lloyd follow Max
Addison and Eve are on their way
Lloyd goes right by
Karen pauses at Eve
Congratulations, Eve
Thank you, Karen
Karen goes
Eve is being constantly congratulated
Some ad lib about seeing her at Max's party
(to Addison) 'm giving her a very high-class party
It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her
Max hurries out
Margo and Bill step into the
Eve turns from a well-wisher to face her
nice speech, Eve
But wouldn't worry too much about your heart
You can always put that award where your heart ought to be
Eve looks at her wordlessly
Margo and Bill leave
Addison and Eve are alone
The tables about them are empty
Suddenly, her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull
she glances at the table
don't suppose there's a drink left
You can have one at Max's
(sits) don't think 'm going
(sighs) Why not
Because  don't want to
(patiently) Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you
No, it's not
(she holds up the award) It's for this
It's the same thing, isn't it
Exactly
(she gives him the award) Here
Take it to the party instead of me
You're being childish
well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an "Eve, darling, 'm so happy
" Eve rises, thanks her graciously
Then she pulls her wrap over her shoulder
'm tired
want to go home
(curtly) Very well
shall drop you and go on to the party
have no intention of missing it
They exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables, waiters, and the usual banquet debris
- Eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment hotel
She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters the hotel as the cab drives off
She hasn't the award with her
'  - Smart, but not gaudy
Eve crosses from the elevator to her apartment
She lets herself in
'   - small foyer, from which one door leads to the leaving room, another to the bedroom
The bedroom and living room do not connect except through the foyer
All the lights are out
Eve turns them on in the foyer, the same as she enters the bedroom
There are some new trunks, in various stages of being packed
Eve tosses her wrap on the bed, goes through the foyer to the living room
She turns on the light in the living room
her to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink
As she turns from the bar, she stares - starts in fright - and drops the drink
young girl, asleep in a chair, wakes with a jump
She stares at Eve, horror-stricken
Who are you
Miss Harrington
What are you doing here
-  guess  fell asleep
Eve starts for the phone
The girl rises in panic
Please don't have me arrested, please
didn't steal anything - you can search me
(pauses) How did you get in here
hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed
She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open
sneaked in and hid till she finished
Then  just looked around - and pretty soon was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so  turned them off - and then  guess,  fell asleep
You were just looking around
That's all
What for
You probably won't believe me
Probably not
It was for my report
What report
To whom
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that
You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools
've heard of them
Ours was one of the first
Erasmus Hall
'm the president
Erasmus Hall
That's in Brooklyn, isn't it
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn
Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars
Eve makes no comment
She lies wearily on the couch
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you
(Eve murmurs "uh-huh") From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time
might
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper
She crosses to it
The maid'll fix it in the morning
'll just pick up the broken glass
Don't bother
The girl puts the broken glass on the bar
She starts to mix Eve a fresh drink
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn
Subway
How long does it take
With changing and everything, a little over an hour
She carries the drink over to Eve
It's after one now
You won't get home till all hours
(smiles) don't care if  never get home
The door buzzer sounds
That's the door
You rest
'll get it
She goes to the door, opens it
Addison stands there, the Sarah Siddons Award in his hands
Hello, there
Who are you
(shyly) Miss Harrington's resting, Mr
deWitt
She asked me to see who it is
We won't disturb her rest
It seems she left her award in the taxicab
Will you give it to her
She holds it as if it were the Promised Land
Addison smiles faintly
He knows the look
How do you know my name
It's a very famous name, Mr
deWitt
And what is your name
Phoebe
Phoebe
(stubbornly) call myself Phoebe
Why not
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own
Phoebe lifts her eyes to him
More than anything else in the world
Addison pats her shoulder lightly
Then you must Miss Harrington how to get one
Miss Harrington knows all about it
Phoebe smiles shyly
Addison closes the door
Phoebe stares down at the award for an instant
' (sleepy; from the living room) Who was it
Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington
You left the award in his cab and he brought it back
' Oh
Put it on one of the trunks, will you
want to pack it
Sure, Miss Harrington
She takes the award into the bedroom, sets it on a trunk
As she starts out, she sees Eve's fabulous wrap on the bed
She listens
Then, quietly, she puts on the wrap and picks up the award
Slowly, she walks to a large three-mirrored cheval
With grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her, and bows again and again
as if to the applause of a multitude
