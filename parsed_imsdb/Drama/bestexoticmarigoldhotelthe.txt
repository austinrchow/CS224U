,  -  2 neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated
Framed against a large window which looks out over the city, an elegant woman in her 70's:
She's on the phone, on hold
On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer; the screen reads 'Getting Started
' ( ) Thank you for your patience
Your call is important to us
We will be with you shortly
Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless
She taps her fingers on the desk
(cont'd) ( ) Thank you for your patience
Your call is - slightly-accented voice finally interrupts
Mrs Greenslade, thank you for - () Yes, now if you could stay on the phone for a moment and talk to me, just talk to me
'm not even clear,  don't actually understand what it is 'm trying to order
Is wireless the same as wi-fi
And what do either of them have to do with broadband
Mrs Greenslade, since the account is not in your name, before we can make any changes we need to speak to the account holder
Can please talk to the account holder
What
'm asking if  can speak to the account holder
Before we can make any changes - You can't talk to him, no
() He's dead
He died
There's only me

He passes other judges, going the opposite way
He arrives at the office of  , goes in
is at his desk
His robes are on a hanger, his wig is on a stand beside him
We're late
4
-  4 Moments later
Graham and Giles walk down the corridor
Bloody retirement parties
Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches
Why do people do that
No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short
it'll be you one day
One day very soon
You've been saying that for years
They walk into a large room, full of lawyers
4A
-  4A At one end of the hall, a very old  is giving a very dull speech
3
An occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when  first entered my pupillage
had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to Mr Justice Stancombe Graham's not listening any more
He's looking around the room
At the old, tired faces
(') the unwelcome news that would transfer Chambers, bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium, a tergo 1upi Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the same
The effect is strange
then the sound of laughter
This is the day
Everyone looks round at him
He's almost as surprised as they are that he's spoken out loud
Graham
This is the day
He turns and walks out
5
-  5 Staff bustle around a busy  &  ward
lies on a bed in the corridor
The Head Nurse, , rushes past
Listen, young lady
want a cup of tea, and  want it now
The trolley will be along shortly
How hard d'you have to fall down before you get some proper attention
Hours 've been lying here, and not a single doctor has come to see me
3A
Now that's not quite true, is it Mrs Donnelly
() 4
(') doctor did try and examine you, and you sent him away
That one
She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is washing his hands
He's black
He can wash all he likes, that colour's not coming out
want an English doctor
An English doctor
Why didn't you say so
'll get one right away
She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall, handsome doctor
The bad news for Muriel is (') This is Dr Ghujarapartidar
And this is Mrs Donnelly

-  5A crescent of identical bungalows, part of a brand new retirement facility
mobility scooter carrying an elderly resident trundles down the road
(
) with an unlimited range of leisure opportunities just a stone's throw away
6
-  6 young estate agent, , is showing  and around a very small, and very beige bungalow
So as  say, what you're looking at here is very competitively priced, you can't get better value for your grey pound
Another little feature, not necessary right now, but give it a couple of years () rails on the walls to help you get around, and down here, a panic button in case of a sudden fall, brings the Warden running
4A
What if we fell somewhere else
Sorry
It's just that we might not manage to plan our sudden fall in the exact corner where the button is
Yeah
As  say - 5
And would it be possible to get the rail to go through the middle of the room as well
To help us get across, not just around
( ) Could we have a moment, please
Thanks
Thanks so much
Evan goes
Thirty years in the Civil Service and this is all we can afford
Would it help if  apologized again
No
But try it anyway

-  7 (40ish) is sitting opposite someone
We don't see whom
And then after that  worked as a systems analyst for a few years but  just found it so dull, what really wanted was to do something that was more creative, that matched my
() 'm sorry
On the form they asked for our age bracket, and the age we wanted to meet
and in both cases  ticked 35-45
Now we see the man she's talking to
It's
He's dapper, nice looking
And at least 70
That's right, yes
So did
They're at a speed dating evening
Numbered tables, etc
(') Anyway, don't stop
Something 6
How old are you
Early 40's
'you mean you were born in the early 40's
Judy,  know what you're asking - It's Judith
Judith
And trust me, 've still got it
The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move along to the next table
Judith leaves without looking back
(') just can't find anyone that wants it
Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman
And looks crestfallen at what's on offer
8 /
//
-  8 is in her bedroom
She's arguing with her son-in-law Madge's suitcases are by the door
This is crazy
You're crazy
You can't just up and leave like this
And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen
She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room
Madge's daughter  is on the landing
What's going on
Your mother's lost it
My mother never had it
7
Talk to her
She doesn't listen to me
Nobody listens to you
She heads down the stairs
Craig and Jessica follow
(') ( ) It's one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man
still don't understand what's going on
just asked her to babysit
And now she says she's leaving
They're at the bottom of the stairs
Jessica's children, and , are watching
But you love babysitting
loved it last night
We had pizza and stayed up late
And the night before
We had Chinese and stayed up late
If you don't go, tonight we could do a curry
It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why  must leave
We know
(to her parents) Being here is stopping her finding a husband
8
Another one
Bye Granny
Don't let the buggers get you down
Madge turns to go
How many husbands have you had, anyway
She turns back, smiles
Including my own
Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi
Mother
Mother
9 /
-  9 Moments later
Madge climbs into the back of the cab
Name the place, darling
Where are you going
Madge smiles
have absolutely no idea
10
-  10 Evelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living room
Her son  is there
And her lawyer There's no other way There just isn't
Harold told us this three months ago
And 'm afraid matters have only got worse
8A
We can't wait any longer
We need to put this flat on the market, and at least make a start at paying off Dad's debts
9
Christopher turns to Harold
(') 've talked it through with Polly and the boys, and of course we all agreed
Ma will move in with us
think that's best, Evelyn
It's what Hugh would've wanted
They wait for confirmation from Evelyn
None comes
Good
Settled
End of discussion
That's what your father used to say
- When there'd never really been any discussion at all
want to look after things for you
Like he did for forty years Yes
And look how that turned out
She turns to Harold (') How can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted
And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway
() Obviously the flat has to be sold
(Best, then to Christopher) And you're very kind
And dear Polly
But no,  won't be coming to live with you
9A
11
-  11 Muriel has now been transferred to a ward
She is listening to
You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly
It's not a difficult operation
Easy for you to say, you're not having it
Regardless
You do need a new hip
'm not getting it from you
2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10
Not me personally, no
Not any of your lot
see
So when do  have the operation
'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months
At my age,  can't plan that far ahead
don't even buy green bananas
There is another way
Our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme, that will enable us to out-source you to another hospital, where they can perform the procedure almost immediately, and at a fraction of the cost
Is it local
That depends how you define local
12
' /'  -  12 Evelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher
They're both sitting at computers
Evelyn's new-found dexterity is impressive
Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full
( ) When did you get a computer
How far along is the progress bar
The strip at the bottom that tells you - know what it is
What are you showing me anyway
11
The webpage has come up
It's a picture of a beautiful old building
And underneath is written ' '
As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous Indian voice
'Come and spend your autumn years in an Indian palace with the sophistication of an English country manor
Steeped in the tradition of the Raj, tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur
' 13
-  13 The mellifluous tones continue
Madge mouths the words to herself as she scans the same web-page
it exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings
' 14
-  14 Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at the hairdressers
Her stylist  listens to her reading a computer printout for the same hotel
Which looks classy, elegant, and welcoming
Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's
() 'Lofty terraces, open courtyards, domes, arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time
' wouldn't mind going there myself
15
-  15 In the background, a train rumbles along the Piccadilly Line towards Heathrow
Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend Douglas is lining up a tricky putt
There won't be any golf courses
12
Just as well
can't afford the green fees
But a retirement home
Douglas misses his putt
It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years
Like the Costa Brava
Yes
But with more elephants
Simon holes out
16
-  16 Graham, the judge, is in his office
It's nearly empty; his entire life is being packed away
His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes
How long have we known each other
And you've never once talked about India
'you want these books
You might need them again
Graham smiles at him, calls out
Mrs Megson
His cleaner,  , comes in
Sir
Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to her
want you to have this
Are you sure
13
Absolutely
There's a slight crack on the bottom
But  think you might know something about that already
Mrs Megson goes
(') used to live there
long time ago
17
-  17 bedsit
Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished
Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone
We don't see who
Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old battery radio
have to go
do
And  could say  wish you'd come, but 've never lied to you
We both know need more than you can offer
We know that
Don't we
We see who's sitting in front of him
An ancient dachshund
(') (to the dog) Don't make that face at me
Norman's Polish landlady,  , is at the door
(to her dog) You
Upstairs
The dog hops off the chair, and leaves
Norman watches him go
(cont'd) Any warm clothes you have use for no more,  take them
And not forget to leave keys when you go
She leaves
Norman is left alone
'll miss you too
14
18
-  18 The district ambulance driver, , is pushing Muriel in a wheelchair across a housing estate
You know who'll be there, don't you
Indians
Loads of them, sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices
Never see one on their own, do you
No, becuase they hunt in packs
All the better to rob me blind and - You know what
You can take it from here
You're supposed to see me into my flat
That's what they said
My wife is from Mumbai
He heads off
Muriel shouts after him
No good moaning to me, mate
You married her
But he's gone
Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground
19
-
-  19 reluctant Christopher is pushing a trolley carrying Evelyn's cases to the terminal
You're sure your tickets are in order
They should be
The hotel paid for them
'm sure they'd rather have us there than not
And its fantastically cheap for the first three months
wonder why
They walk on in silence
(') How will we know you're alright
15
'll call
They do have phones there, you know
Or you can just read my blog
Your what
On the interweb
You can log in whenever you like, read my news
just hope the first item will be announcing your return don't suppose they'll be paying for the journey back
Evelyn stops
They've reached the terminal
Could you please, before  go, say one thing that is supportive
Because 've never done anything like this before
Without Dad, you never did anything at all
And i don't think you'll be able to cope
Well
suppose we'll find out, won't we
They head into the building
20
-
-  20 Madge is at the First Class Check-In desk
And the connecting flight to Jaipur is first class too
The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport
(') tell you, it's tough to get upgraded nowadays
had to flirt so hard with the travel agent, it was practically phone sex
21
-  21 The light is fading
15A
Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a female Security Guard
Come on
Thorough as you like Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt
We'd like to take a look in this bag, Madam, if you don't mind
He lifts the bag onto a table
It's heavier than he thought
16
(cont'd) What you got in here anyway
He opens the bag, stares in astonishment
Tips
Brown sauce
Ten jars of Marmite
Thirty one packets of Chocolate Hobnobs
Pickled onions
Pickled eggs
And pickle
No liquids on the plane
What does that mean
It means you can't take the pickled onions
Or the pickled eggs
() The pickle's fine
22
- / 22 The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the gate, waiting to board
Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end of the only remaining row of empty chairs
Douglas and Jean are already sitting there
Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats away
Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end
He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits
Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between Graham and Douglas
And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of their common fate
The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs them
23
-  23 The plane cruises down through a stunning sunset, and lands at Delhi Airport
17
24
,  -  24 Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an escalator
Madge is a few steps up
Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends
And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas
'm sorry
( ) And is this your first time in India
You don't seem like an experienced traveller
'm not
Although one has read one's guidebooks
Jean blinks
Evelyn and Graham share a smile
Douglas hides his
And Madge sees it all
As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator
Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair
Norman Cousins
Madge Hardcastle
pleasure
Play your cards right, it could be
Madge stares at him
voice comes over the tannoy
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that owing to bad weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has been cancelled
The airline is happy to arrange : 18
25
-  25 Hours later
The airport is deserted, except for the Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other end
After a moment, Graham says Alright
Plan
26
-  26 Moments later
They're all moving briskly through the hi- tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building
Of course it's a good idea
Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge
And this way we see more of the country
Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair
(leaning down, to ) If anyone asks, say you're my mother
don't want people to think we're together
In your dirty dreams
Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right
The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought
27
-  27 Moments later
Our heroes are in the middle of an extraordinary scene
Stifling heat, deafening noise; the chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life
They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage handlers,beggars etc
All clamouring for their attention
Evelyn looks a little shocked
Jean is traumatized, a handkerchief to her face
19
Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a fistful of tickets
(shouting over the din) The bus will drop us in the centre of town
We can take tuk- tuks the rest of the way
They follow him through the hordes
And see their bus
It's absolutely rammed
People are practically hanging out of the windows
There's not enough room
It's time to prove the first and only rule of India: there's always room
He starts to fight his way to the door
Evelyn's at the back
She stops, for a moment, looks around her
What larks, Pip
Douglas is just ahead of her
He turns, smiles
Let's hope so
28
-  28 Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus, which is screaming down the six-lane highway
huge tower of luggage is piled precariously on the roof
The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even cows overtaking each other
The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which is overtaking some slower vehicles
As the truck pulls back into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling towards them on the wrong carriageway
Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream
At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside lane
The Indians on the bus take absolutely no notice
29
-  29 Norman is grinning from ear to ear
20
'm loving this
Evelyn is sitting next to Madge
few months ago  was organising the church flowers
Are you struggling with the feeling you're not in control of your circumstances
little
You know what the shortest prayer in the world is
No
Fuck it
Evelyn laughs
(') You're not doing the church flowers any more
May as well enjoy the ride
Douglas is watching a nice Indian family
They're having a picnic
The father notices Douglas looking, offers him some food
Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily
Are you insane
"Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water
" Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment
It's just a sandwich
Marvellous
Then 'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please
Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato
Douglas turns to Muriel
21
Would you like some of this believe it's aloo ka paratha
If  can't pronounce it, 'm not eating it
The cacophony of horns continues
Jean screams, as another collision looms
30
-  30 The last of the light
The bus moves on through a beautiful landscape
31
-  31 Everyone is asleep, or trying to sleep
Except Muriel
She reaches into her bag, and carefully removes a biscuit
She surreptitiously lifts it to her mouth, and starts to chew
Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder
But Evelyn is still awake, as is Graham
How long since you were here
Forty years
As long as  was married
() He died recently
My husband
'm sorry
'you think we're going to be alright
God, don't ask me
'm more scared than you are
They both smile, sit in silence for a bit
(') Yes
think it's going to be extraordinary
22
32
-  32 The sun rises
beautiful, pearly dawn
The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur
Below, the city shimmers in the heat
It's a magnificent sight
(
) What exactly is a tuk-tuk
33
-  33 Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning streets of the city
They stare in amazement at the world racing past them
scooter overtakes
young man is driving, his girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back
Her sari billows out behind her
Douglas and Evelyn both watch her, struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality
34
/
-  34 The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge, exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at the Marigold Hotel
Once a beautiful building, once possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs
Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding
huge old tree towers over an untended garden, its branches poking into the windows of the building
34A
-  34A young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the arrival below:   (early 20's)
He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races off across the rooftop
34B
/
-  34B Dazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway
cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks to collect their luggage
23
34C
/
-  34C Sonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard below
He spreads his arms wide
Welcome to India
They stare up at him
35 /
/
-  35 The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat delapidated
fountain at the centre does not look as if it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up haphazardly
Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building, towards her room
This is a building of the utmost character, which means that perhaps not everything will function in the way you expect it to
But as the manager and chief executive supervising officer of the Marigold Hotel,  can tell you with great pride that the building has stood for centuries, and will stand for many more, in 100% shipshape condition
Please follow me, carefully avoiding that naughty stone there round this corner, leading us most successfully all the way to your bedroom
The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully decorated
But there's no door
Where
Here
In here
My dear man
Rooms have doors
What you're showing me here is an alcove
The door is coming soon, most definitely
How soon
24
Let us not concern ourselves with details, Mrs Hardcastle
Rather than speaking of doors, we should instead take pleasure in the freedom to roam
Does your room have a door
Oh yes
Then that's where 'll be staying
36
,   -  36 Douglas and Jean arrive at their room
Douglas goes in through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again
Bird in the room
Bird in the room
Jean pushes him aside, goes on in
Several pigeons are flying around in some panic
37 /
/
-  37 Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in
The room is light and airy
And rather nice
But all the furniture is covered in sheets
As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all the sheets off, and runs out again
38 /
/
-  38 Muriel wheels herself towards her room
Standing inside is a male nurse,
Muriel swivels her chair around
Graham is just going into his room
There's an Indian in there
Graham smiles, goes on into his room
Which is dusty, but comfortable and pleasant
He looks around with satisfaction
25
39
,   -  39 Norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room
He stops, catches his breath
40
,   -  40 Ajit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel
My what
Your physiotherapist
To help with your recovery after the operation
You're not touching me
Traditionally that is how physiotherapy is practised
41
,   -  41 Norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel
His room is right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin
bed, but not much else
The trees poke in through the open window
He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view
This'll do
42
-  42 Jean is confronting Sonny
want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure
Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be amazed
This is that very building
You've Photoshopped it
have offered a vision of the future
() 26
(') Of course  had hoped that by now it would be the present
But in India we have a saying: everything will be alright in the end
So if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end
What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund
Of course if that is what you desire, you must have it
Absolutely no problem,  will refund you completely
You will
Straight away
Without question, Mrs Ainslie, most definitely will
Straight away in three months
43
'
-  43 Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during the Raj, official documents yellowing with age
He picks up a photograph, looks at it
From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist (
) a stay of five days and it is done under general anaesthesia
hip replacement usually takes only two hours 44
-  44 Ajit's explanation continues
Muriel is trying not to panic
Your surgeon will remove the top end of the thigh bone, and insert an artificial bone instead most routine procedure
Have you got a marker pen on you
Why
27
want to mark it
So you don't take the wrong hip
45
-  45 Douglas is on his way down the stairs
Evelyn comes out of her bedroom
Oh, hello
Is everything alright
was just going to find the manager
'm afraid he's dealing with my wife
Or vice versa
promised 'd call my son, to tell him 'd arrived, and - And the phone in your room doesn't work
May
45A
'
-  45A Douglas picks up the very old-style phone
Evelyn is watching
(') Now, did you try jiggling it a bit
Yes, did that
Did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times
That too
Hmm
He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the receiver carefully
And blows on it
28
How did you come to be here
In India
invested our - well, my - retirement money in our daughter's internet company
She assured me that as soon as the start-up actually started up, and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable, then she would be able to pay it all back
'm not sure  understand what most of those words mean
It turns out neither did she
Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver to his ear
(') There you are
Good as new
Really
No, of course not
've got no idea what 'm doing
Evelyn bursts out laughing
(') Now, would you like me to not fix that chair
Because  can do that too
45B
-  45B The houseboys are struggling with the unequal task of pulling Muriel's wheelchair, with Muriel in it, up the narrow steps
(
) In honour of your arrival, a special welcome British roast for you all
46
-  46 group of mismatched table and chairs, that constitute the dining area of the hotel
29
Sonny is serving up a meal
His guests, wearing garlands of marigolds, listen politely
Cooked lovingly by myself and my most loyalist factotum and helper, Young Wasim
He points to
Who is about 80, and is sitting in the corner, fast asleep
Roast what
wonderful taste of Blighty
Roast what
Roast goat curry
Yes please
So the upshot is that he's spent all our money getting us here, and we can't leave till he's made some more
Muriel has arrived at her table
Gentle friends, you have found your way to this place, bequeathed to me by my beloved father, that  have raised from the ruins of his broken dreams, and renamed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel For The Elderly And Beautiful
Yes,  use the words most deliberately
Norman is not looking very well at all
Sonny doesn't notice, keeps on going
(') You have all heard the chimes at midnight, and long in tooth have youbecome
Who knowshow many daysyou have left
But we are mosthonoured that youhave chosen tospend that time with us
Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his chair onto the floor

My brother is a doctor
He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels for a pulse

Madge looks around
All there is is a napkin
She passes it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman
Who promptly coughs
He just coughed

The atmosphere is faintly threatening
As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and people have come out to stare at her
She has stumbled into their home
Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face to another
'm so sorry
didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground
She goes to pick them up

He's good, too
He whacks a ball off into the distance

Graham half-runs, half- walks to the other end, then turns for a second run, breathing heavily
Then walks back to the crease, gets ready for the next delivery
It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for years
Give me the ball
can take him
He turns cheerily to Graham
(') Down is where you're going, Uncle
Come on
Do your worst
They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to bowl
As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to reach the crease
He looks at the faces of the other boys, frozen, waiting
The ball seems to take forever to leave Sanjay's hand
Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and is bowled
That's what 'm talking about felt the need, the need for - Graham still hasn't moved
(') Are you alright, Uncle
Graham finds his voice at last

Yes

This is a place for ambitious people
Young people
see that
Good day
Please

Evelyn stops
(') It is really builder's tea
41
Yes
We dunk biscuits into it
You dunk
It means lowering a biscuit into your tea, letting it soak in there, then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the mouth, and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined
() It's more relaxing than it sounds
Perhaps you can help us after all

Sonny, you own a hotel

It is not an attractive quality
It isn't

Let's go

-  70 Jean is sitting in a chair, reading
Graham comes up the path
Good evening, Your Honour
Mrs Ainslie
hope you had a good day
What did you get up to
Well,  started in my bedroom, where  had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names
Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn,  came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me
And how glad  am it was you
Why would you not go out
There's so much to see
Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is floored by his question
She can hardly understand, let alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort
(') Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie
All life is here,  tell you
Jean stares at him
He goes on through the archway into the hotel
Then stops
(') could talk to the chef, if you like
Perhaps get you some grilled chicken, plain rice
would appreciate that very much
Graham goes on in
Jean just sits there
Wishing he'd come back out again

Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet Muriel's eyes
She puts the tray down and leaves
Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night, the untouched tray of food by her side
72

Graham is there, at a table in the corner
Good evening
Good evening
Evelyn sits at her table
(') trust you had a good day
'd rather hear about yours
got a job
My first
Ever
'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor
role 'm sure you'll perform with great distinction
He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and Jean emerge from their room
Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself
'm flattered you shared it with me
He turns to greet the new arrivals
(') Good evening, the Ainslies
45
Have you had a good day
Spectacular
( ) went to the temple you told me about
place of meditation and peace, quite stunning
So spiritual,  bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung
No elephants, sadly
Still none
( ) thought  might see you there
Where did you get to instead
Yes, where do you get to every day
Well, 've just finished telling Mrs Greenslade all about it
Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing
'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again
She waits
But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful
talked to the chef for you
He said it will be no problem
Did you hear that, Douglas
Plain grilled food; manna from heaven
don't have to have it too, do ( ) don't know how to thank you
( ) You really should see this temple
46
'd like that very much
But maybe take a clothes peg for your nose

Graham starts down the stairs
Goodnight

He seems about to say something else
She waits for a moment, then walks on
(') Mrs Greenslade
Evelyn
Can  show you something
74
'  -  74 Moments later
Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's collage
grew up here
Just a short drive away
It was a big house, and we had servants, everyone did
We knew their wives, their children
One boy, Manoj, became my friend
We played a lot of cricket together, played anything we could
And that's how it stayed for years
Until one night, he became something more
() We had a few months, we had that
There was a weekend in Udaipur, we sat by a lake and watched the sun go down, and  remember thinking
will never be this happy again
And  was right
Because quite suddenly it was over
We'd fallen asleep, and they found us
() 47
(') () For me it was bad enough
But already knew who  was, and think my family had guessed
For Manoj, the disgrace was absolute; a double taboo
His father was fired, they were sent away, all of them
don't know what could've done, but it should've been more than nothing
put up no fight
let it happen
() Soon afterwards  went to England, to University
always told myself 'd come back
But never did
Until now
And now  think
what if  am the last person on earth he wants to see
Evelyn says nothing
(') don't think  can go through with it
Do you want to see him again
Yes
Yes
Oh yes
Then you must

She tucks in a perfect hospital corner

Anokhi is on the verandah, replacing her untouched supper tray with breakfast
Anokhi is about to leave, but stops
Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the windowsill, and places it on the table
Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the tray
From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard
(
) And so now that we are fully operational, Mr Maruthi, it is clear that with a small injection of funds for the Phase Two Development
77

-  77 Brimming with confidence, Sonny is walking a wealthy investor,  , around the grounds
Some builders are dismantling scaffolding
the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can rise like a phoenix to its previous state of glory
And when  say small injection, mean small in the sense of medium- sized
Possibly larger
This hotel was never glorious
Just the phoenix part then
How many rooms will there be
Many
How many
great amount
Plenty of rooms, no question
They've arrived in the courtyard
(') am not a details man, Mr Maruthi
49

They see Muriel on her verandah
Mr Maruthi,  present to you one of our beloved guests
Dear Mrs Donnelly, please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
Kill me

Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks quietly
The wheel is spinning
But the hamster is dead
He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the doorway
This is the redoubtable

My second favourite
He went to Kerala to make his fortune
But make it, he did
As  will make mine
have a dream, Mummyji
most brilliant one: to out-source old age
And not just for the British
There are many other countries where they don't like old people too
Your brothers own a third of the hotel each, they are entitled to a third of the profits
Success does not happen overnight, Mummyji
This is blue sky thinking, and it requires long-term strategy and patience
How is your girlfriend
look forward to you meeting her
And  look forward to you meeting the woman you will marry
She is from a good family in Delhi
can marry as  choose, Mummyji
need no permission
presume it is your girlfriend who teaches you such nonsense
One reason not to marry her
51
What if  love her
An even better reason
Now send Young Wasim to the car for my luggage
He cannot carry, he has a dicky back

You won't get the dirt out like that
Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly
(') worked in service for years, looked after a lovely house kept it spotless
You need a bit more pressure on that brush
Graham walks past, on his way out
She won't speak English
She's what used to be called an Untouchable
An outcast, born below society
To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted
He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door
Where d'you go every day
Is it a woman
Nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters
52
don't think so
'm gay
Although nowadays more in theory than practice
Good day
He leaves
moment later, Jean comes rushing out
Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has already gone
And second, that Muriel is watching her
Good morning
Muriel says nothing

Still nothing from Muriel

Any maharajahs
Wealthy widowed land-owners
It is not the policy of this club to divulge details of our members
They go past a very handsome older Indian man

Yes, you did say that
You did
54
While it is most pleasant to see you, your presence does not actually accelerate our investigation

Instead they are sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn
Who is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention
You ring in the morning
Let's assume the person answering will be a woman
She will have had her breakfast
Tea or coffee
Semi-skimmed milk, always
If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast
The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers
The girlfriends' mothers,  mean, not their own
Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights
Sunaina is in the audience
She calls out
'm not surprised people hang up on us

That's the point

'Your custom is valuable'
Right
That one
Don't ever say that
'Service is our middle name'

Perhaps you could seat me next to him
This way, madam
He leads her along across the terrace
Madge follows, checking her hair, her breath, etc
The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture
There's someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm draped over the side of the chair
(') His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent
The man rises from his chair and turns
And Madge is left staring at Norman
There's a pause
Then Madge reaches into the barman's breast pocket, and removes her money
'll have that back, thank you very much

Sunaina smiles at this
(') My mother doesn't want us to be married

In business, if you stand still, you move backwards
No,  have that wrong
If you stand still, you are overtaken by people going the other way
Wait - You didn't answer the question
Do you love me
My feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word
It's a nice word, Sonny

That lady at the bar keeps looking at me
As one would something in a museum

Where she sits a couple of seats away from the woman
Who is called
She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to the barman
(') Rejected again
Many years ago, that man over there gave me the most extraordinary night of my life
He may seem coarse and uncouth, but that only disguises a tenderness and an exquisite sensitivity to a woman's needs Norman arrives at the bar
Those drinks not ready yet
Madge turns to Carol
They say patience is passion tamed
Carol smiles
(') 'm Madge
Carol
And this
is Norman
How do you do
Carol
As in Christmas
Madge winces
suppose
Great
Silence
60
So what brings you to Jaipur, Carol
Yes, Carol
What brings you to Jaipur
run a small boutique travel agency
But 've actually lived here all my life
My father worked in the Foreign Office
Another silence
You're very fit
beg your pardon
Oh god
mean you look like you keep yourself in shape
Physically
Well,  did join a gym last year
It cost a fortune, and  didn't get any fitter
Apparently you have to actually go
Madge laughs
Norman doesn't
Then realizes that it was a joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter
(') And so what do you do, Norman
Me
Yes
Oh
'm Norman's in business
Really
Yes
61
What business
( ) You tell her
Import-Export
Although these days there's rather more Ex- than Im-, if you see what  mean
'm afraid  don't
Madge gets up
have to splash some water on my face
Please God  drown in it
She heads for the bathroom
Norman and Carol share another silence
Well look, it's been lovely chatting
No it hasn't
No
It hasn't
But  really - Carol
She was about to go, stops
(') Can we drop all this pretence
And start again
'm not charming
'm not good at repartee
And 'm not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino
My name is Norman
And 'm lonely
My name is Carol
So am
89
-  89 Minutes later
Madge comes out of the bathroom

) Day 22
Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment
And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available
Madge looks across the bar
And is startled to see Norman and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together
As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns smiling back to his new friend
Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night

Will you check in at the bank
Douglas emerges from the bathroom
checked yesterday
And the day before
As requested
() Will you be staying in again
Why do you ask that every morning
Because  hope for a different answer
Because  think you'll be hurt if  don't
And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel
He goes back into the bathroom
Jean changes the subject
didn't sleep a wink
The tap in there never stops dripping

What did he say
(
) No idea
It was in Hindi
Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap

Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony
Down below she can see Graham leaving

Norman arrives
Your Madgesty
gather the night went well
Would you like to hear about it
Not in the least
Good
Because you're going to
Two drinks, some sexually charged - Douglas comes out, carrying a tap
And heads out of the archway
Morning
Lovely day
Good morning
They watch him leave
Two drinks, some sexually charged banter, and we were heading back to her place
Bidding the rickshaw farewell,  walked her to the door

And
And what
Is that all
You didn't seal the deal
We have a date next week
What is wrong with you
wanted to prolong the anticipation
To spend some time with the knowledge that soon 'm going to eat, drink, and laugh with someone, hold her to me, kiss her softly
Then go back to her place and get my end away
96
-  96 The market is buzzing with commerce
Evelyn is at a stall selling fabrics, talking to the vendor,
(holding up a pashmina) Bow much for this, please Kitna One thousand rupees Ek hazaar Thank you
She reaches for her wallet
Then Douglas speaks from behind her
No no, forgive me
That's not how it works
65A
Evelyn turns, happy to see him
66
Good morning
And to you
Sorry to butt in, but you don't ask him how much he wants, you just tell him how much you'll pay
( ) She'll give you two hundred
Absolutely no more, final offer
One thousand rupees
Pity
( ) Now walk away
Walk away
- know what 'm doing
Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away
Yes
The thing is, you see, did actually want to buy that
To brighten up my room
He'll come after us
Do you think so
Absolutely
This is how the game is played
Just keep on walking
They push through the crowds
(') He's playing it cool, but he'll come
They keep walking

They keep walking
Then Douglas stops
Evelyn looks at him
67

: Moments later
They're back at Akram's stall
Evelyn counts out the money
Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand
She turns to Douglas, smiles
(') You'll get him next time
Then she notices something

She stands, then sits again
Then stands
98
-  98 Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum
The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin shacks
Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation
And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as depressing as we would expect
The colours are bright, the smiles on the children's faces even brighter
Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course
She's horrified by her surroundings
And acutely aware of the stares of the slum-dwellers

Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph - are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself, her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children
They all smile at Muriel
long pause
Then Muriel turns to Ajit
How soon can  leave
100 /
-  100 Douglas is talking to , who works behind the counter
Evelyn sits outside
You see what  think, and of course 'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground
Douglas glances back at Evelyn
Who betrays not the slightest scepticism
Jamshed studies the tap
The gland nut has come away from the spindle
Well of course, it could be that too
Can you fix it
Not cheaply
Not cheaply
Most expensively indeed
Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts to fiddle with it
Douglas joins Evelyn
was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel
It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure  would prefer
And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law
() 69
(') One wants to trust, in general, don't you think
But you never really know, do you
Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap
And takes a hammer to it
The day  met my husband was the day the fair came to town
My girlfriend and  went on the carousel
Her horse was fine
But when the ride began  felt mine give a little, like it might collapse
Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together
And a voice in my ear said "Just trust me"
And  did
Without question
Until the day he died
How wonderful
The sale of our flat went through last week
had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts
() 've been forced to get a job out here
Which, in fact,  love
But even at Sonny's rates, still couldn't make ends meet
After what my own husband did to our life savings
() So no
You're right
You never know
Jamshed holds up the tap
Which is now in several parts
No good
You must be buying another
101
//,   -  101 Jean walks down the path to the gate
She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity outside
She's unable to move
Finally, she steps out
And is of course immediately assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors, etc
As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace, brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost running
70
102
'  -  102 Muriel is still at the tea party
Anokhi speaks
Ajit translates
She wants to thank you for your kindness

You're the only one that acknowledges her
Anokhi brings out a plate of food
Tarkha dhal
Chapati
'm not eating that
You will insult her very deeply if you do not
Muriel looks up
They're all still watching, waiting smiling
She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is old
Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray
And has a bite
It's not too bad
'd still rather a Scotch Egg
Then she sees something through the open doorway: the children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are spinning the wheels
She's on her feet in a flash
(') Get off
Get off it, you dirty thieving bastards
Several terrified faces turn
One little girl starts to cry
Everyone is staring at Muriel

They were playing

104
//
104 - The corridors are full of people patiently waiting their turn to grapple with a vast bureaucracy
Reaching the top of the staircase, Jean takes it all in
She walks down another corridor
Then stops
Through a doorway, she sees Graham at the desk, talking to Mr Chidambram
: In the office
But 've filled out that form
've given it to you
Many times
There is a process
You are making an enquiry
For each enquiry a form must be filled in
But it's the same enquiry  make every day
And therefore the same form you must fill in
Graham glances towards the doorway, catches sight of Jean
Their eyes lock, then Jean pulls back out of sight, panicked

Behind her, Graham emerges from a doorway, and calls to her Mrs Ainslie

106
-  106 Later
Jean and Graham are sitting in an elegant tea room
Jean is still very shaken
don't know how you can bear this country
What do you see that  don't
Unutterable beauty
Everywhere
In the light, the colours, the smiles, the people who see life as a privilege not a right, and so teach me something every day
The waiter brings their tea
Is this milk pasteurized
Yes madam
But that's not true, is it
You're just lying to me right now It'll be fine
The waiter goes
(') It's a pleasant surprise to see you out and about
Is it
She looks at him
Yes
That's progress
Where were you going
73
To the bank
was going to the bank
Not that there's any reason to think something has changed
But our daughter, you see, she did promise, and one does try to remain optimistic
One has to
Otherwise Graham worries she might be about to break down
He reaches across the table, puts his hand on hers
She leans forward, puts her other hand over his, holds on tightly
Graham is startled
He tries gently to pull back, but she holds on
- Oh god
Is it possible you feel the same
She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it
(') The way you talk to me
Your compassion, your understanding the wonderful, tender consideration, it had to be more than just - 'm gay
She stares at him
Beat
As in
happy
Graham says nothing
Jean lets go of his hand
(') Yes
see
Of course  see
The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them both
(') appear to have humiliated myself
And embarrassed you
'm not embarrassed
Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie
74
Like  said
This country is driving me mad
() Shall we go

- DAY107 Evelyn is outside in the courtyard
We don't see Douglas
Anything
(
) Not yet
Evelyn waits a moment
How about now
(
) One second
Another pause
(
) (cont'd) Oh good lord
What
(
) Listen
The sound of a flowing tap
(
) (cont'd) And now
The tap stops
(
) (cont'd) No drip
He appears in the doorway, triumphant
(') No drip
He walks towards her, hand in the air
(') Hi-five
Evelyn just looks at him
She's never hi-fived anyone in her life
After a moment Douglas puts his hand down
75
(') 've never done that before
It just seemed appropriate
Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard
Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her
(') Darling
Mrs Ainslie, how are you
Did you have a good day
Jean doesn't answer
She's staring at Douglas
Who looks so happy
Let me tell you about ours
Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to - ( ) We have to get out of here
What did you say
can't stay in this country a moment longer
Why
Do excuse me
She makes a tactful exit
Jean is going past Douglas into their room
don't understand () Pick a reason
Pick ten
The climate, the squalor, the poverty She goes past him into their room
76
108
'  -  108 we should never have come
This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy
It's time to go home
Jean starts to pack
Irrationally, compulsively
Who's paying for the tickets
(not hearing him) Look at us
group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year
Humiliating ourselves Not us, we can't pay
And don't see you asking our friends () We should just face up to the truth
That we're all old, we're all past it
That's the real truth, the raw, unvarnished fact of the matter
All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner
She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying quietly
Nobody speaks for a while
() We just have to make the best of it, darling
really think that's the best thing to do
Yes, well
When  want your opinion, 'll give it to you

The phone is answered at the other end
(') ( ) Sunaina,  must see you
must
If  cannot hold your body against mine,  swear  will go mad

It's not Sunaina on the phone, but Jay, who is standing next to her
' ( ) yearn for you,  burn for you, - think it's my sister you're burning for there, Sonny boy
Thank you, Jay
Thank you
Jay hands the phone to Sunaina
Hey
Private line, Sunaina
Do those words mean nothing to you

He took the phone
What could do
miss you
miss you every moment
Come and see me
Tonight
cannot tonight
It is my parents 25th wedding anniversary
Tell your mother that
Come after
Come late You'll be asleep
'll be waiting
You'll be asleep
But i can wake you in that special way
You will sneak in
'm not ashamed
Neither am
Absolutely not
There is no shame
You do not have to sneak
() All the same, if you did want to be very quiet, and not let anyone see you, it couldn't hurt

'm worried there's no lead in my pencil

No snap in my celery

Mr Smith - Will the lance dance, and the trouser lion roar
What is your problem
79
don't know if  can still have sex
Ah
'm not a young man anymore, doctor
And 'm a little bit scared
Truth be told, 'm a lot scared
How long since you've been with a woman
What's today
Monday
Six years
've got some pills that'll help

Very dilapidated
Anokhi is cleaning pots
Young Wasim sits in the corner
Ajit has just wheeled Muriel into the courtyard

Anokhi looks up
(') ( ) Tell her
Tell her  was glad to come, glad she invited me
Ajit translates
(') Glad to meet her family
Her grandmother
Her kids

Anokhi speaks
80
She asks if you have children

Ajit translates
(') This one family, years  was with them
ran the house, looked after the money, did it all, cared for them like they were my own
Ajit starts to translate
But Muriel doesn't wait
(') That's the mistake, see
You don't want to get like that, to start feeling part of something
One day they decided  needed some help
was grateful, tried to teach her
Not just the books, but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it, the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed
The things you only know if you care
But then they said  was no longer useful to them
Thanked me for my service
As if that's all it was
() got a flat in the end
'm the only one in the building not a foreigner
More Indians there than here
But before  came to this place, my biggest problem was what to do with all the time had
Because that flat's so small,  can have the whole place spotless in half an hour
And then what am  supposed to do for the rest of the day
There's silence for a bit
Then Ajit speaks
Did you want me translate that as well
Muriel smiles
It's the first time we've seen this
Muriel stops, thrusts something into Ajit's hand
Give her these
81
Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of Chocolate Hobnobs
This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye
Tries to hide her desire to leave
Ajit turns her chair and pushes her away
Over this, the sound of singing 113
-  113 Norman's on his rooftop, under the primitive spout of water that passes as his shower
Hanging from a nail in the wall, the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover version of the Chic song "Le Freak"
Norman is naked, and singing along lustily
Aaaaaah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Aaaah, freak out
Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco move

There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby
He pays no attention, then stops and thinks for a moment
Then realises what it is
He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts frantically looking for the telephone
115
-  115 Graham and Evelyn are having drinks
've been getting out and about as much as  can, but  feel 've hardly scratched the surface
And of course 'd love to see Udaipur
The lake you talked about

Douglas and Jean have come in
Jean looks rather desperate
() Good evening
81A
An awkward moment
Graham stands
82
Good evening, Mrs Ainslie
Please allow me
He pulls a chair out for her
She shoots him a look of passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity
You're very kind
But  rather think 'll turn in early
Goodnight everyone
She goes into her room

Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead
Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out
He looks transformed
And rather handsome
Is this it
This is it
You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age
Norman shrugs
If she dies, she dies
He leaves
Sonny sprints into the courtyard
Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Hardcastle
The wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour
He shoots up the stairs

Sonny bursts in
Mr Dashwood
Everybody
Great news

What is it, Sonny
They are working, they are working
That is great news
What are working
The telephones of the Marigold Hotel
Well, congratulations
Thank you

Comes back
(') Oh wait
You have a phone call
118
,
-  118 Graham, Evelyn, and Douglas are walking quickly up a quiet street
It's a false alarm
There's no way they could find anything in that office
They probably just picked an address at random, just to keep me off their backs
'm sure that's what happened
It's going to be nothing
Don't you think it's going to be nothing
think you should knock on the door and see
Yes
Yes  should
() Yes
119

84
Across the street, Graham approaches a house
At a polite distance, Evelyn and Douglas wait
Graham knocks at the open door
woman, , appears
She stares at Graham
'm sorry to disturb you so late
My name is Graham Dashwood long time ago  - know who you are
Beat
am afraid  don't know you
am Gaurika
The wife of Manoj
(after a fraction of a ) 'm very pleased to meet you
And if you could, if you would tell him that  called around, 'd appreciate that very much, - He breaks off
She's walked past him, looking to the other side of the road
He turns to look at the men playing cards
Gaurika calls in Hindi
beautiful-looking man looks up
He looks across at the house
Stands up slowly as Graham walks across the street towards him
Graham reaches him
The two men just stand there for a moment
Then they hug very tightly
From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches
Evelyn looks at her, fascinated
Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each other, unable to let go
120

(a tiny bit sloshed) () 85
(') First time going in to London with my dad, on his commute
He'd always been so extraordinary to me, so unique
But there he was standing on the station platform, utterly indistinguishable from all the other men in suits
And then of course a few years later  was one of them
Hated my job
Hated it
() Sorry, talking too much
Blame a good dinner out
What was she thinking
beg your pardon
His wife
Manoj's wife
She knew who Graham was
Had he told her
() 'you think we'll find out tomorrow
Not me, 'm heading up to the Badi Mahal Palace
Very excited, been reading all about it
Tell me
would, if  could remember a word
Evelyn laughs
Then Douglas suddenly grabs her
And pulls her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them
Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on towards the Marigold
Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding each other
Something passes between them that embarrasses them both
Then they part quickly, guiltily
They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune
Come, please
Nice meal, please
86
( ) We've eaten, thank you
They continue on their way
Slightly further apart than before
121
-  121 It's the middle of the night, and everything's quiet Or as quiet as it can be in the middle of the usual night-time Indian cacophony
Sunaina parks her bike outside the hotel, goes on in

Not sneaking, exactly
But making no sound

She takes off her clothes
And climbs, naked, into bed beside the sleeping figure
128
,   -  128 loud scream
In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up
And remembers
87
129
,   -  129 It's Sunaina that's screamed
Because she's in bed with Madge
Who couldn't be happier
midnight booty call
How utterly marvellous
130

131
,   -  131 Sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room, grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her nakedness
'm so sorry, 'm so sorry don't know what your name is, but 'm incredibly sorry
Don't be
Most action 've had in weeks
If you could just please not - Sonny bursts in
Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle can explain each and every thing
Hesees Sunaina
(') Oh my god you are naked
He turns to Madge
(') Mrs Hardcastle,  must apologise with deep and profound sincerity - How could you not tell me you weren't in your room
88
Yes, Sunaina, to you too  must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity
Now go
Get out
Quickly
'm going
Just let me get dressed, and - No no, quicker than that
You must leave, before - MrsKapoor flings open the door
What is going on here
Who screamed
She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina
(cont'd) No no no no no
No
This is a respectable hotel, not a brothel
( ) You, get out
( ) And Mrs Hardcastle,  expected better of you
Actually, this is exactly what  expected of you, but nevertheless - Mrs Kapoor, 'm Sunaina
Since  will not be paying for your services, your name is of no interest to me
() How do you know mine
Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know her name
Sonny steps forward reluctantly
Because this
is my Sunaina
The girl who my son described as not too modern
This is getting interesting
( ) Tell me, please
() 89
(cont'd) Is there anyone in this building you haven't slept with
Mummyji, do not get the wrong idea
Sunaina was not here to be with Mrs Hardcastle
She was here to have sex with me
Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina
Who is speechless
This is the sort of woman you are
Each to her own
But do not ever try and tell me that you are suitable wife for my son

Someone picks them up for him
It's Graham, who smiles as he puts them back
The trader gives him a fresh one
Graham takes it, and walks on, munching the delicious fruit
contented man
134
-  134 Norman is sitting on a stone bench under a spreading tree
90
(
) How did it go
Norman turns, to see Graham standing above him
have seen the top of the mountain
And it is good
Graham nods, sits down next to him
They gaze out at the waking city
saw someone yesterday, a man hadn't seen for many years man 've loved all my life
Norman is a bit startled by this
man
Yes
Carry on
(smiling, unperturbed) didn't know how he'd been in the meantime, didn't want to guess
brought disgrace upon him and his family, and imagined he might hate me for it
() But we talked all night
He's been happy
He's led a peaceful life, married to a woman who understood him and loved him nonetheless
But he's never forgotten me
That's what he said
() asked his forgiveness anyway
He said he had nothing to forgive me for
That instead  should forgive myself
() All that time
All that time believed 'd sentenced him to a life of shame
When  was the one in prison
() But not any more
91
Silence for a while
Top of the mountain
Yes
Norman smiles, then stands and goes on inside
Graham settles back into his chair, looks out at the world
(') Not any more
135
/,   -  135 Norman comes into the courtyard
Madge, sipping from a cup of chai, calls down from her verandah
How was the night
Rather special
He leaves
Madge just stares after him
136
-  136 Norman on the stairs to his room
He stops, catches his breath
137
-  137 Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird
snow crane; white and magnificent
It's on the grass in front of him
Then it opens its huge wings, takes off
And flies up into the bright blue sky
It's an extraordinary sight
As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip, it appears suddenly to slow and stall, until it seems to hang in the air, almost motionless
138
-  138 Norman crosses the rooftop to his bedroom
He comes inside, sits on the bed
139
,   -  139 Graham is still sitting in the garden
92
(
) You're back
He doesn't turn round
Evelyn has come out to the garden
She goes over to him
(') It's been rather an extraordinary night all round
First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off
Graham is dead

-  139A (

) Day 45
Of course it was inevitable
Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes
Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered 140
-  140 train is crossing the endless fields
141
-  141 Evelyn stares out of the window
Madge, Norman, Douglas and Jean are behind her
Opposite sits Manoj
Evelyn turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who sits beside him
(
0
) We all know it'll happen, but few of us know when
Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first
So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us
His prerogative
142
-  142 Three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway, which barely rises above the surface of the lake
They seem to be floating
Clouds of dust billow behind them

At the place they had visited together
Not a holy place
Although for them perhaps it was

What must once have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and overgrown
Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the flames
Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika
He recites a Hindi prayer

Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead
The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash

(

) Where do our souls go
is that all of us that is left behind
Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water
The ashes shim r and dance, caught in the gentle currents
145
'
-  145 Muriel and Anokhi are in the servants' garden
Young Wasim sits silently in the corner
So there's a process, they call it pickling
have no idea what it is, or how they do it, but whoever invented it was a smart man
But the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system
That  could never have thought of
94
Ajit looks at her, ready to translate
(') No, forget it
Muriel is looking out at the yard
She sees Mrs Kapoor, talking to some surveyors
They're mapping out the building
Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them
Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing here
You should not be here, talking with this one
'm helping her clean
If these pots get any dirtier, you'll have to serve the food with penicillin
We have other rooms
Go to one of them instead
While this is still a hotel
She turns back to the surveyors
( ) What's her problem
What's happening here
Ajit can't answer
But he knows a man who can
He points to Young Wasim
He can tell you
146
,
- 146 stunning view over the city
Madge is having a drink with Norman
Douglas is sitting on the wall, but keeps looking down towards the stairs
When someone dies, you think about your own life
And in my case, there is less of it in front of me than behind
And don't want to grow older don't want to be condescended to, ignored and marginalised by society
To become peripheral to the action
() 95
(coat' d) don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis
They laugh together
And don't even see Douglas go
147
-  147 The landing is large, and open to the sky
Evelyn has just come up the stairs to go to her room
She's leaning against the stone baluster
wondered where you'd been
Evelyn turns
Douglas is on the stairs above her
(') We're all up top, having a drink
went to see Gaurika
Manoj's wife
wanted to ask her what she knew
And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would
He told her when the marriage was arranged
() They had no secrets from each other, none
Suddenly she's crying
Unable to stop
Douglas puts his arms around her, and holds her to him
(') And that's right, don't you see
That must be right
Because what is the point of a marriage in which nothing is shared
Her words hang in the air
They stand there for a moment
Jean has come out of her room, and stands there, watching them
Mrs Greenslade, might  have my husband back now
They spring apart
(') Douglas
She walks off back into the room
Douglas turns to Evelyn
96
Yes, of course
Forgive me
Evelyn goes quickly to her room, leaving him standing there
148
'  -  148 Douglas closes the door
She was upset
Spare me your explanations
'you think 'm jealous
don't see why else you would have embarrassed me
And Evelyn
You were already doing a perfectly good job of embarrassing yourself
Can you imagine how ghastly it's been for everyone to watch you mooning around after that simpering doe- eyed ex-housewife, taking advantage of her loneliness and - God, can you hear yourself
Can you
Do you have any idea what a terrible person you've become
Jean is stunned into silence
(') All you give out is this endless negativity, a refusal to see any kind of light and joy even when it's right in your face, and a desperate need to squash any sign of happiness in me or anyone else it's a wonder  don't fling myself at the first kind word or gesture that comes my way
But don't
Out of some dried-out notion of loyalty and respect, neither of which  ever bloody get in return
97
There's a long silence
checked my emails
This came
She hands him a piece of paper
149
-  149 Evelyn comes onto the terrace, and heads for Madge and Norman
She picks up Madge's glass
Are you alright
just need some water
She drains the glass
That was a gin and tonic
Yes
know that now
What's happened
Good evening, the Ainslies
Douglas and Jean are approaching them
How are you both
We're particularly well
Douglas, tell them our news
She looks to him, waits
He says nothing
So she turns, and smiles
(') We're going home
150
' /
-  150 Sonny is with his investor, Mr Maruthi
They emerge from the upper courtyard onto the terrace overlooking the back of the hotel
98
And so  would ask you to loosen the strings on your purse, Mr Maruthi, and to do it most rapidly
So that Phase Two Development of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can begin with immediate effect
Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel
She's with Anokhi, Ajit, and Young Wasim
He calls down to her
Mrs Donnelly,  believe
Sonny spots the danger, tries to lead Mr Maruthi away
And now if you would please be following me to the ground floor Mr Maruthi ignores him, calls down again
How are things at the hotel
Mr Maruthi - ( ) Better
They're going better
Sonny takes a moment to recover
You see
Profound satisfaction
Such is the inevitable result of a prolonged stay at the Marigold Hotel
And now Mr Maruthi has spotted something else
The surveyors, who are still taking their measurements
What are those men doing
(Glancing back for a moment) Working for me, Mr Maruthi
To create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die
Stare death in the face and say- () 98A
(') (follows Mr Maruthi's ) What are those men doing
99
151
/'
-  151 Moments later
Through the window, Muriel watches Sonny confronting his mother
Mummyji, what is going on here
have spoken to your brothers
They want to sell the hotel
These men are here to value the building
They are valuing the land
My brothers do not care about the building
They will knock it down
They could just wait a month for it to fall down of its own accord
You joke, Mummyji, but inside know you are not laughing
You do not want to see this dream destroyed
Send these people away
No, my son
It is too late
152
'  -  152 Mrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts
Sonny stands opposite her
Mummyji, please - These figures do not support your argument
There is still time to turn things around
With a small injection of funds, we can - Who is trusting you with that money
Eh
You, who cannot run a chai stand
Just like your father
100
Beat
Then Sonny speaks quietly
Do  remind you of him so much
Is that why you must be cruel to me
You think  am cruel
You loved my father
And he loved this hotel
() Two mistakes
There will not be a third
() Say goodbye to all this, Sonny
And come with me to Delhi
Your life will become easier
Not easier, Mummyji
Smaller
He leaves
Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some paperwork, discomfited
She turns to the doorway
Muriel is there, in her chair
Mrs Donnelly
Can  help you
Depends
Do you know how to use a computer
assume you are joking
Mrs Ainslie said she had an address where  could get some things  need
Some biscuits
She said  could get them on the line
wish you luck
Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves
Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer
Her fingers fly across the keyboard
101
153
-  153 The train rattles its way through the night
Jean is chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for some time
Evelyn listens in silence
The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting
Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left
Turning left
First class
And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary
We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion
Perhaps a minute's silence
154
' ,   -  154 Ajit keeps watch, while Muriel is at the printer
Waiting as it disgorges pages
155  155 155A
-  155A The tuk-tuks are lined up
(hailing a tuk-tuk) Two should fit us all,  think
'm actually going to walk
Apparently they're getting ready for a festival
Perhaps you'd like one of us to accompany you
'm happy to walk with you
102
'll be fine
Evelyn speaks to both Douglas and Jean
(') 'm delighted for your daughter's success
wish you all every happiness
Thank you
Evelyn turns, and walks away
156
- -  156 Douglas and Jean are in the tuk-tuk with Madge and Norman
There is a sombre atmosphere
motor-bike hurtles past them, going the other way
Was that Sonny
157
' ,  -  157 phone is ringing
Christopher is still in bed, his wife Polly asleep next to him
He answers
(can't believe his ears) Ma
158
-  158 Evelyn stands under the awning of the ticket office
just wanted to hear your voice
() No, 'm sorry,  didn't think about the time
How are you
And Polly
The boys
how are the boys
She listens to him
She's holding back tears
(') Oh good, 'm glad you've been reading it
Yes
Yes, 've made some very good friends
() No, 'm fine, of course  am
103
As much as she had wanted to speak to him, she now wants the conversation to be over
(') think my money is running out, 'd better go
Goodbye for now, darling
'll call again later
She hangs up
And stays there with her hand on the phone
Out on the street, Sonny is pulling up
She looks over to him
Mrs Greenslade
Where are the others
They're on their way to the hotel
Sonny looks around, at a loss
(') What's the matter
wanted to warn you before you see for yourself of the most momentous changes that are occurring, absolutely all of them without question for the very positive
What are you talking about
am delighted to announce the closing of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and the joyful return of all of its inhabitants to their home country
What
159
-  159 Norman and Madge have arrived back at the hotel
Mrs Kapoor is breaking the news to them
Please relax in the knowledge that your journey home is being arranged, and paid for by the hotel
104
Our journey here was arranged and paid for by the hotel, and look how that went
'd rather walk back to England
'd rather not go back at all
voice comes behind them
Carol has come out of the courtyard
Why would you have to
160
-  160 Sonny and Evelyn are still talking
And for myself the news is even better
shall be moving to Delhi to live with my mother, and furthermore  shall be wed to a most suitable person of her choice, whom  look forward very much to meeting before  spend the rest of my life with her
But what about your girlfriend
She is no longer my girlfriend
This is a disaster
Then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph, is that not what your Mr Kipling tells us
Although of course, here we have a problem
Because , Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have never had a triumph, so of course do not know how to treat one
No, all  have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe, an unending stream of total - Sonny, do you love her
Sunaina
105
Most deeply
Have you told her you love her
It is because  love her that must not tell her
She can do so much better than me
And you have told her that
Many times
Good
Women love it when you say that kind of thing
It's a powerful aphrodisiac
Really
No, of course not
Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever
Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours
You can have anything you want, Sonny
You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it
Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love - Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling
You have struck oil
He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off
161
-  161 Madge is sitting, pensive
Carol comes in
Where's Norman
106
Packing
But we don't have to leave yet
asked him to come and stay with me
Is that wise
'm not sure he's trained
You think it's too soon
It doesn't matter what  think
It is too soon
But at our age we can't afford the luxury of taking it slow
And it's either this or he goes home and  don't want him to go home
Madge looks at her for a while
Then smiles
wish you both the very best
You haven't met anyone
Single by choice
Just not my choice
() actually think it might be over
For me
With men
And if that's gone, 'm not quite sure what's left
Did you know Norman brought pills
The first night he stayed with me
They obviously did the trick
saw them in his pocket didn't want it to be like that
So when  had the chance swapped them
() () 106A
(') He went all night on two aspirin

Then Muriel speaks from her verandah
She's not back yet
Douglas stops

Right
() Then perhaps you could tell her said goodbye
He turns and walks out

Let's go

Jay appears on the landing above him
What's going on
Sonny is doubled over, totally out of breath
Holds up a finger
(') Sonny
need to see Sunaina
Her shift's not over
And when it is, she doesn't want to see you
Beat
Jay, you are the son my mother wished  was; an intelligent man, with a strong head for business
You see things as they are, not as you wish them to be
So fuck off out of my way
Jaydoesn't move
(') Or you can give her a message
Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny, listening
(') Tell her from me what  should have told her the day we met
What  will announce to anyone who asks
And many who do not
Sunaina speaks to Jay
Including your mother
( ) Including my mother
His mother
110
( ) Your mother
will tell every mother in the land
( ) What will you tell them
( ) What will you tell them
The only thing that matters in this world
That  love you
And always will
() And by you,  mean Sunaina, Jay, not you
Although if you are to be my brother-in-law,  hope we can become better friends
Why is he only saying this now
( ) You ask him
Why are you only saying this now
Because, Sunaina, love of my life, no more will  believe that am not worthy, for only by loving you as you deserve will become so
On Sunaina's face as she hears this
173
,   -  173 The cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the Ganeshi festival begins to unfold
Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the back
They're speeding through the city
Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is confronted by a huge traffic jam
The Ganeshi procession is bringing everything to a standstill
He does a -turn, speeds off back the way they came
111
174 /
/ -  174 Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam
It's funny
They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves
() It's not that funny
() Although  suppose it's all about context, isn't it
mean - Douglas
Yes
If you say one more word, 'll kill you with my thumbs
174A
-  174A Muriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning
Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by Mrs Kapoor
They cross towards the arch
Where d'you think you're going
You may well ask
Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree
We're moving in together
Already
That point has been made
The hotel is closing
Doesn't have to
Silence
Everyone stares at Muriel
She takes out the spreadsheets
112
(') 've been going over the accounts
174B
,   -  174B If anything, the traffic is now worse
Jean and Douglas's taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the arch
The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far entrance to the archway
Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead and behind
This is ridiculous
It could go on for hours
There's no way we're ever going to get out of here
Maybe there is
rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the traffic
It is ridden by
You
Can you get us to the airport
Sorry long way sore legs not possible
'll give you everything  have
Step right in mind your head let's go
Come on, Douglas
Come on
Douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab
Sorry no manage people and cases
(grabbing her suitcases) What
Not possible
Two person, no cases; one person, and cases
113
(taking off her watch) How about if  give you something else
My watch
( ) Sure
Thank you
Still not possible
We'll get another flight
We can go back to the hotel, and leave in the morning
No
Jean, you heard what he said
He can't do it
He can do one person, and cases
Yes, but Could fate find a better way to tell us what we need to hear
Which is what
That it's over
It was over a long long time ago
This is not the time to talk about this
Let's wait till we - have to go, Douglas
won't let you
No, you'll want to come after me
Chase me to the airport and tell me everything will be fine
But please don't
Because the truth is we both deserve more than we've had
You're just too kind and too loyal to admit it
113A
Beat
(') will be alright
( ) 'm turning left
She climbs onto the rickshaw
114
As the drumming intensifies, Douglas stands holding his suitcase, watching her weave through the traffic and out of sight

don't know what any of these figures mean
Sonny and Sunaina drive into the courtyard, screech to a halt
They dismount
Mummyji
Mummyjit Right here, you do not need to shout
Do you remember what my father used to say
That nothing happens unless first we dream
Like him have dreamt, Mummyji, and like him,  have failed
The Marigold Hotel is crumbling into dust
And it turns out  can live with that
But the one thing  will not do is live without this girl
To whom  did not introduce you properly before
() This is Sunaina Shantanu Palawat
The woman  love, and wish to marry
am very pleased to meet you, Mrs Kapoor
115
Sunaina puts out her hand
Mrs Kapoor will not take it
(shaking her head) No
forbid it
forbid this match
Utterly and completely
Do you hear me, Sonny
This cannot happen
And then a low, rumbling sound comes from the corner
Like a quiet volcano
Young Wasim is speaking
It's a long, poetic and heartfelt speech
Unfortunately it's in Hindi
What is he saying
What he said to me,  imagine
She turns to Sunaina
(') Can you help
He is saying
he is saying that he has been with this family as long as he can remember
Given them a lifetime of service
And that he remembers another fight, between two young people and their parents
And he remembers the moment where the young man stood up to his mother and said yes,  want to marry this woman
Yes, she is from a different community
But she is smart, she is beautiful, and love her
Long pause
(cont'd) don't know who he's talking about
She offers Sunaina her hand
(cont'd) Take care of my favourite son
Sunaina shakes her hand
116
So 'm not clear now
Am staying or going
Depends how you read the accounts
The accounts
Turns out the original plan is good, it works
Just not in the hands of an imbecile
knew that plan was good
What the place needs is more money
Unfortunately my investor, Mr Maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors, he - He's reconsidered
You spoke to him
So long as there is someone to help the manager
The manager needs no help
Sonny
The manager needs a little help
( ) So will you stay
Norman looks at Carol
'd like to
117
In the shack on the roof
sleep in the trees
( ) We have a double room
Bathroom ensuite
And a fully working door
He points to Graham's room
(') guest has recently checked out
Madge can't believe he just said that
'll think about it
( ) Mrs Hardcastle
You're staying
On my own
You're off your game
Lost your confidence, maybe
But you're a thoroughbred
You'll be back
Madge smiles
(') And what about you, Mrs Greenslade
Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all
Except Muriel
What about me, Mrs Donnelly
We haven't talked much, you and My loss, evidently
() 'm not sure what  should do
Nothing here has quite worked out as  hoped
117A
Most things don't
But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff
() () 118
(') Haven't you got work in the morning
Evelyn nods
(') Besides, he'll be back
You don't know him
He's the most loyal man 've ever met
50,000 rupees says 'm right
At your current salary that should take you three months to pay off
Muriel stands up
Everybody stares
She starts to walk slowly but proudly across the courtyard
She reaches the doorway, turns back
If you'll excuse me, someone's waiting to help me make mango chutney
Why did no one tell me about that stuff
Who is the new assistant manager
Why
Are you thinking of applying for the job
She gestures for her wheelchair
Sonny rushes up with it
She sinks down
