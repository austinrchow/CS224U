- During Brian's monologue, we see various views of things inside the school including Bender's locker
() Saturday
March 24, 1984
Shermer High School, Shermer, Illinois
60062
Dear Mr
Vernon
we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong
But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care
You see us as you want to see us
in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions
You see us as a brain, an athelete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal
Correct
That's the way we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning
We were brainwashed
: 2
'  - We see  and her  sitting in their car in the parking lot
Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob
can't believe you can't get me out of this
mean it's so absurd have to be here on a Saturday
It's not like 'm a defective or anything
' 'll make it up to you
Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn't make you a defective
Have a good day
Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks up the school front steps : 3
'  - We are in 's car
His  is there and so is his little
He is sort of a nerd
' Is this the first time or the last time we do this
(upset) Last
' Well get in there and use the time to your advantage
Mom, we're not supposed to study; we just have to sit there and do nothing
' Well mister you figure out a way to study
' (annoyingly) Yeah
' Well go
Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school
: 4
'  - We see  and his
Andrew is clearly a jock; hes wearing a lettermans jacket with lots of patches on it
' Hey,  screwed around
guys screw around, there's nothing wrong with that
Except you got caught, Sport
Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright
' (angry) You wanna miss a match
You wanna blow your ride
Now no school's gonna give a scholarship to a discipline case
Andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school
: 5
- We see   walking towards us
He is wearing sunglasses
car is coming towards him but he doesn't stop walking
The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him
Bender gets out of the frame
Out of the car steps She is dressed all in black
She steps forward to look in the car's front window and the car drives away
: 6
- There are six tables in two rows of three
Claire is sitting at the front table
Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her
Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table
She shrugs and he sits there
In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process
He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library
Brian reluctantly gets up and moves
Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up
Allison walks in
She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian
Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker
Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away
Enter  , a teacher
He holds a stack of papers in his left hand
He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job
Well
well
Here we are
want to congradulate you for being on time
Claire raises her hand
Excuse me, sir
think there's been a mistake
know it's detention, but
um
don't think belong in here
Vernon doesn't care
He just continues to talk
It is now seven-oh-six
You have exactly eight hours and fifty-four minutes to think about why you're here
To ponder the error of your ways
Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his mouth again
Claire looks like she is going to gag
and you may not talk
You will not move from these seats
He glances up at Bender and points at him
and you
Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet
will not sleep
Alright people, we're gonna try something a little different today
We are going to write an essay--of no less than a thousand words--describing to me who you think you are
Is this a test
Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice of Bender
And when  say essay
mean essay
do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times
Is that clear Mr
Bender
Bender looks up
Crystal
Good
Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself
Maybe you'll even--decide whether or not you care to return
Brian raises his hand and then stands
You know,  can answer that right now sir
That'd be "No", no for me
'cause
Sit down Johnson
Thank you sir
He sits
My office
Vernon points
is right across that hall
Any monkey business is ill-advised
He looks around at them
any questions
Yeah
got a question
Vernon looks at him suspiciously
Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe
'll give you the answer to that question, Mr
Bender, next Saturday
Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns
Vernon leaves
That man
is a brownie hound
Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud snapping sound
Brian turns and looks and it is Allison, biting her nails
Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look
Everyone is looking now
Allison notices them looking at her
You keep eating your hand and you're not gonna be hungry for lunch
Allison spits part of her nail at Bender
've seen you before, you know
We see Vernon look out from his office
We see Brian playing with his pen
(quietly to himself) Who do  think  am
Who are you
Who are you
He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top under his upper lip
am a walrus
Bender looks at him in utter confusion
Brian notices this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth-- embarrassed
Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the same time
They both notice this
Brian stops removing his jacket
Bender takes his all the way off
Brian rubs his hands together and pretends to be cold
He pulls his jacket back on
He turns and looks at Bender who is still staring at him
It's the shits, huh
Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable laugh
Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper
He throws it at Claire
It misses and goes over Claire's head
Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore Bender
Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a song
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
nah, nah, nah
(to herself) can't believe this is really happening to me
Bender stops "singing" abruptly
Oh, shit
What're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss
(disgusted) Please
If you gotta go
We hear Bender unzip his fly
You gotta go
Everyone is now looking at Bender
(disgusted) Oh my God
Hey, yer not urinating in here man
Don't talk
Don't talk
It makes it crawl back up
You whip it out and you're dead before the first drop hits the floor
Bender gasps mockingly
You're pretty sexy when you get angry
grrr
He turns to Brian
Hey, homeboy
Brian points at himself with his pen
why don't you go close that door
We'll get the prom queen-- impregnated
Claire turns and glares at him
Hey
Bender ignores him
Hey
What
If  lose my temper, you're totalled man
Totally
Totally
(to Bender) Why don't you just shut up
Nobody here is interested
Really
(to Claire about Bender) Buttface
Well hey Sporto
What'd you do to get in here
Forget to wash your jock
(nervous) Uh, excuse me, fellas
think we should just write our papers
(to Bender) Look, just because you live in here doesn't give you the right to be a pain in the ass
so knock it off
Bender mockingly registers pain in his face
It's a free country
(to Andrew) He's just doing it to get a rise out of you
Just ignore him
(to Claire) Sweets
you couldn't ignore me if you tried
Claire rolls her eyes
So
so
(to Andrew and Claire) Are you guys like boyfriend/girl- friend
(a beat) Steady dates
(another beat) Lo--vers
(another beat) Come on Sporto, level with me
Do you slip her the hot
beef
injection
Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious
(screams) Go to hell
(screams) Enough
: 7
'  - We see Vernon in his office
(yells) Hey
What's going on in there
(to himself) Smug little pricks
: 8
- They all look at each other
Andrew turns away from Bender
(to himself) Scumbag
Bender stands up and walks over to the railing
He sits on it
What do you say we close that door
We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds
Well, you know the door's s'posed to stay open
So what
So why don't you just shut up
There's four other people in here you know
God, you can count
See
knew you had to be smart to be a
a wrestler
Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway
Really
You know, Bender
you don't even count
mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference
You may as well not even exist at this school
Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment before speaking
He doesn't let his emotions out, however
Well
'll just run right out and join the wrestling team
Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at Bender
(to Claire) Maybe the prep club too
Student council
No, they wouldn't take you
'm hurt
You know why guys like you knock everything
(to himself) Oh, this should be stunning
It's 'cause you're afraid
(with mock enthusiasm) Oh, God
You ritchies are so smart, that's exactly why 'm not heavy in activities
You're a big coward
Brian feels left out
(to no one imparticular) 'm in the math club
See you're afraid that they won't take you
You don't belong so you just have to dump all over it
Well
it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes
now would it
Well you wouldn't know
You don't even know any of us
Well,  don't know any lepers either, but 'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs
Hey let's watch the mouth, huh
Brian again feels he needs to contribute
'm in the physics club too
(to Claire) 'cuse me a sec
(to Brian) What are you babbling about
Well, what  said was
'm in the math club, the Latin club and the physics club
physics club
Bender nods and turns to Claire
Hey
Cherry
do you belong to the physics club
That's an academic club
So
So
academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs
Oh, but to dorks like him
Bender points at Brian
they are
(to Brian) What do you guys do in your club
In physics, um, we ah, we talk about physics
about properties of physics
So it's sorta social
demented and sad, but social
Right
Yeah, well,  guess you could consider it a social situation mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton
You load up, you party
Well, no, we get dressed up mean, but, we don't
we don't get high
(to Bender) Only burners like you get high
And, uh,  didn't have any shoes
So  had to borrow my dad's
It was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes
And, uh, my cousin Kent
my cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana
He got high once and you know, he started eating like really weird foods
And uh, and then he just felt like he didn't belong anywhere
You know, kinda like, you know "Twilight Zone" kinda
(laughs) (to Bender) Sounds like you
Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here
got a meet this Saturday and 'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads
(to Andrew) Oh and wouldn't that be a bite
Bender lets out a moan of fake agony
Missing a whole wrestling meet
Well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot
You never competed in your whole life
(with mock hurt) Oh,  know
feel all empty inside because of it
have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys
Ahhh
you'd never miss it
You don't have any goals
Oh, but  do
Yeah
wanna be just--like--you figure all  need's a labotamy and some tights
Brian becomes interested
You wear tights
(to Brian) No  don't wear tights,  wear the required uniform
Tights
(defensive) Shut up
They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and Andrew
He folds his hands on the table
Vernon goes back into his office
Bender laughs and gets up
He starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway
You know there's not s'posed to be any monkey business
Bender turns and points at Brian
(in a stern voice) Young man
have you finished your paper
Bender turns back away and goes to the door
He looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door
What are you gonna do
Drop dead,  hope
: 9
- We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain
He stands up and checks the way he looks in a mirror
He does a muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga
: 10
- Brian looks up
Bender is messing with the door to the library
Bender, that's, that's school property there
you know, it doesn't belong to us
It's something not to be toyed with
The door slams shut
Bender runs back to his seat
That's very funny, come on, fix it
You should really fix that
Am  a genius
No, you're an asshole
What a funny guy
Fix the door Bender
Everyone just shhh
: 11
- We see Vernon walking back to his office
He stops and listens to them through the closed door
() 've been here before,  know what 'm doing
() No
Fix the door, get up there and fix it
() (screams) Shut up
: 12
- We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall
() God damnit
He opens the door and storms in
Why is that door closed
For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare at Vernon
Why is that door closed
How're we s'posed to know
We're not s'posed to move, right
Vernon turns to Claire
Why
We were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to
Vernon looks around and looks at Bender
Who closed that door
think a screw fell out of it
It just closed, sir
Vernon looks at Allison in the back
Who
Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the table, hiding in her jacket hood
She doesn't talk, sir
(to Bender) Give me that screw
don't have it
You want me to yank you outta that seat and shake it out of you
don't have it
screws fall out all of the time, the world's an imperfect place
Give it to me, Bender
Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw
(to Claire) Watch it, young lady
Vernon goes over to the door
He tries to hold it open by putting a folding chair in front of it
The door's way too heavy, sir
The door slams shut despite the chair
() God damnit
They laugh
Vernon opens the door again
He comes back in
(pointing) Andrew Clark
get up here
Come on, front and center, let's go
Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon
Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up
If he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy
Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel magazine rack in front of the door
Okay, now, watch the magazines
It's out of my hands
They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire door
That's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire
think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir
Vernon thinks about it
He turns to Andrew
Alright, what are you doing with this
Get this outta here for God's sake
What's the matter with you
Come on
You know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library
Brian points at them and Bender glares at him
(to Brian) Show Dick some respect
Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of the library
(to Andrew) Let's go
go
Get back into your seat
Andrew sits
(to Andrew) expected a little more from a varsity letterman
(to Bender) You're not fooling anybody, Bender
The next screw that falls out is gonna be you
Vernon turns to leave
(under his breath) Eat my shorts
Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again
What was that
(loudly) Eat my shorts
You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister
Oh, Christ
You just bought one more right there
Well, 'm free the Saturday after that
beyond that, 'm gonna have to check my calendar
Good
'Cause it's gonna be filled, we'll keep goin'
You want another one
Say the word, just say the word
Instead of going to prison, you'll come here
Are you through
No
'm doing society a favor
So
That's another one, right now
've got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don't watch your step
You want another one
Yes
You got it
You got another one, right there
That's another one pal
(worried) Cut it out
Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender
You through
Not even close, bud
Good
You got one more, right there
Do you really think  give a shit
Another
Bender glares at him
You through
How many is that
That's seven including the one when we first came in and you asked Mr
Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet
(to Bender) Now it's eight
(to Brian) You stay out of it
Excuse me, sir, it's seven
Shut up, Peewee
(to Bender) You're mine Bender
for two months gotcha
gotcha
What can  say
'm thrilled
Oh, 'm sure that's exactly what you want these people to believe
You know something, Bender
You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people
You might be better off
(to everyone) Alright, that's it
'm going to be right outside those doors
The next time  hafta come in here
'm cracking skulls
(Bender mouths Im cracking skulls) Vernon leaves and closes the door
musical riff builds to a climax as Bender screams
(screams) Fuck you
We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight
We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe
We see Claire thinking
We see Brian playing with his balls
We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt
We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple
We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out
He then plays air guitar
We see Allison drawing
We see Andrew playing paper football
He cheers silently
Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture
We see everyone fall asleep
: 13
- Later
Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids
Wake up
Who has to go to the lavatory
Everyone raises their hands
: 14
- Later
We see the clock, it now says 10:22
We see Andrew stretching
We see Bender tearing pages out of a book
He is tossing them around
That's real intelligent
You're right
it's wrong to destroy literature
He continues to tear pages out
It's such fun to read
and, Molet really pumps my nads
(pronouncing it correctly) Mol-yare
love his work
Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian
He picks up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards out
Big deal
nothing to do when you're locked in a vacancy
Speak for yourself
Do you think 'd speak for you don't even know your language
Andrew turns to Claire
Hey, you grounded tonight
Claire shrugs
don't know, my mom said  was but by dad told me to just blow her off
Big party at Stubbies, parents are in Europe
Should be pretty wild
Yeah
Yeah, can you go
doubt it
How come
Well 'cause if  do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay
There's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag
It's like any minute
divorce
Who do you like better
What
You like your old man better than your mom
They're both strict
No,  mean, if you had to choose between them
dunno, 'd probably go live with my brother
mean,  don't think either one of them gives a shit about me
it's like they use me just to get back at each other
Suddenly, from the back of the room
Allison speaks
(loudly) Ha
Everyone looks at her shocked
Allison blows her hair out of her eyes and grins
Shut up
You're just feeling sorry for yourself
Yeah, well if  didn't nobody else would
Aw
you're breaking my heart
Sporto
What
Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew
You get along with your parents
Well if  say yes, 'm an idiot, right
You're an idiot anyway
But if you say you get along with your parents well you're a liar too
Bender turns and walks away from him
Andrew follows and pushes Bender
You know something, man
If we weren't in school right now, 'd waste you
Bender points his middle finger at the floor
Can you hear this
Want me to turn it up
Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew the bird
Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's shoulders
Hey fellas,  mean
Andrew pushes away from Brian
don't like my parents either, don't
don't get along with them
their idea of parental compassion is just, you know, wacko
Bender turns to Brian
Dork
Yeah
You are a parent's wet dream, okay
Bender starts to walk away
Well that's a problem
Look,  can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes
But face it, you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie
What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen
Why do you have to insult everybody
'm being honest, asshole
would expect you
to know the difference
Yeah well, he's gotta name
Yeah
Yeah, (to Brian) What's your name
Brian
See
(to Brian) My condolences
Bender walks away
(to Bender) What's your name
What's yours
Claire
Ka-Laire
Claire
it's a family name
Nooo
It's a fat girl's name
Well thank you
You're welcome
'm not fat
Well not at present but  could see you really pushing maximum density
You see, 'm not sure if you know this
but there are two kinds of fat people
There's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat
so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside
You see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh
He mimes becoming fat, making noises
Claire gives him the finger
Oh
obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl
(resentfully) 'm not that pristine
Bender bends down closer to Claire
Are you a virgin
(a beat) 'll bet you a million dollars that you are
Let's end the suspense
Is it gonna be
(another beat) a white weddin
Why don't you just shut up
Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth
(a beat) Have you ever been felt up
Over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off
hoping to God your parents don't walk in
Claire is getting upset
Do you want me to puke
Over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on the front seat past eleven on a school night
Leave her alone
Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew
said leave her alone
You gonna make me
Yeah
Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing
You and how many of your friends
Just me, just you and me
Two hits
Me hitting you, you hitting the floor
Anytime you're ready, pal
Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on the ground with a wrestling move
don't wanna get into to this with you man
Andrew gets up
Why not
Bender gets up
'Cause 'd kill you
It's real simple
'd kill you and your fucking parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and  don't care enough about you to bother
Chicken shit
Andrew turns and walks away
Bender takes out a switchblade and opens it
He stabs the switchblade into a chair
Let's end this right now
You don't talk to her
you don't look at her and you don't even think about her
You understand me
'm trying to help her
We see the janitor,  come into the room
Brian, how you doing
Your dad works here
Brian is embarrassed
Uh, Carl
What
Can  ask you a question
Sure
How does one become a janitor
You wanna be a janitor
No  just wanna know how one becomes a janitor because Andrew here, is very interested in persuing a career in the custodial arts
Oh, really
You guys think 'm just some untouchable peasant
Peon
Huh
Maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years 've learned a couple of things
look through your letters,  look through your lockers
listen to your conversations, you don't know that but  do
am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends
By the way, that clock's twenty minutes fast
Everyone groans
Bender smiles
Shit
: 15
'  - The clock says 11:30
Vernon gets up and leaves
: 16
- Bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody joins in
Vernon enters
Bender begins to whistle Beethoven's 5th
Allright girls, that's thirty minutes for lunch
Here
Here
Well  think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in, sir
Well,  don't care what you think, Andrew
Uh, Dick
Excuse me, Rich
will milk be made available to us
We're extremely thirsty sir
have a very low tolerance for dehydration
've seen her dehydrate sir, it's pretty gross
Bender stands
Relax, 'll get it
Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub
Bender grins
What do you think,  was born yesterday
You think 'm gonna have you roaming these halls
He points at Andrew
You
He points at Allison
And you
Hey
What's her name
Wake her
Wake her up
(to Allison) Come on, on your feet missy
Let's go
This is no rest home
Allison gets up
There's a soft drink machine in the teacher's lounge
Lets go
: 16
- Andrew and Allison are walking in the hall
So, what's your poison
Allison doesn't answer
What do you drink
Allison still doesn't answer
Okay
forget  asked
Allison waits for two beats and then speaks
Vodka
Vodka
When do you drink vodka
Whenever
lot
Allison smiles
Tons
Is that why you're here today
Allison doesn't answer
Why are you here
Allison snaps back
Why are you here
They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall
Um, 'm here today
because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride
See  get treated differently because uh, Coach thinks 'm a winner
So does my old man
'm not a winner because  wanna be one
'm a winner because  got strength and speed
Kinda like a race horse
That's about how involved  am in what's happening to me
Yeah
That's very interesting
Now why don't you tell me why you're really in here
Forget it
: 17
- Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around waiting for the Cokes
Claire
you wanna see a picture of a guy with elephantitus of the nuts
It's pretty tasty
No thank you
How do you think he rides a bike
Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust
Oh, Claire
would you ever consider dating a guy like this
Can't you just leave me alone
mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car
Although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat 'cause his nuts would ride shotgun
You know what  wish  was doing
Op, watch what you say, Brian here is a cherry
cherry
wish  was on a plane to France
'm not a cherry
(to Brian) When have you ever gotten laid
've laid, lotsa times
Name one
She lives in Canada, met her at Niagra Falls
You wouldn't know her
Ever laid anyone around here
Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is still turned
Oh, you and Claire, did it
Claire spins around
What are you talking about
(to Claire) Nothin', nothin
(to Bender) Let's just drop it, we'll talk about it later
No
Drop what, what're you talking about
Well, Brian's trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagra Falls area, that presently you and he are, riding the hobby horse
(to Brian) Little pig
No 'm not
'm not
John said was a cherry and  said  wasn't, that's it, that's all that was said
Well then what were you motioning to Claire for
You know  don't appreciate this very much, Brian
He is lying
Oh you weren't motioning to Claire
You know he's lying, right
Were you or were you not motioning to Claire
Yeah, but it was only
was only because  didn't want her to know that  was a virgin, okay
Bender just stares at him
Excuse me for being a virgin, 'm sorry
Claire laughs
Why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin
Because it's personal business, it's my personal, private business
Well Brian, it doesn't sound like you're doing any business
think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin
Bender looks suprised
You do
Claire smiles and nods
: 18
- Later
Everybody has lunches now
Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag
What's in there
Guess, where's your lunch
You're wearing it
You're nauseating
Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who catches it without even looking up
Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter
What's that
Sushi
Sushi
Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed
You won't accept a guys tongue in your mouth and you're gonna eat that
Can  eat
don't know
give it a try
We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag of cookies and a carton of milk
Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over
She loudly slurps it up off the table and her fingers
Andrew sees Bender looking at him
What's your problem
Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up
It lands on the sculpture above
She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that
She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it
Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes Brian's bag lunch
What're we having
Uh, it's your standard, regular lunch  guess
Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos
He sets it on the table and points at it
Milk
Soup
Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box
Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand
That's apple juice
can read
&  with the crusts cut off
Well Brian, this is a very nutritous lunch, all the food groups are represented
Did your mom marry Mr
Rogers
Uh, no, Mr
Johnson
Ahhh
Andrew and Claire smile at each other
Bender stands
Here's my impression of life at big Bri's house
(in a loud and friendly voice) Son
(in a kiddie voice) Yeah Dad
(loud) How's your day, pal
(kiddie) Great Dad, how's yours
(loud) Super, say son, how'd you like to go fishing this weekend
(kiddie) Great Dad, but 've got homework to do
(loud) That's alright son, you can do it, on the boat
(kiddie) Geee
(loud) Dear, isn't our son swell
(quiet and motherly) Yes Dear, isn't life swell
Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father kissing mother and then father punching mother in the face
Suddenly it's not so funny anymore
Alright, what about your family
Oh, mine
That's real easy
Bender stands again and points forward
(as his father) Stupid, worthless, no good, God damned, freeloading, son of a bitch, retarded, bigmouth, know it all, asshole, jerk
(as his mother) You forgot ugly, lazy and disrespectful
Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable mother
(as his father) Shut up bitch
Go fix me a turkey pot pie
(as himself) What about you Dad
(as his father) Fuck you
(as himself) No, Dad, what about you
(as his father) Fuck you
(as himself--yelling) No, Dad, what about you
(as his father--yelling) Fuck you
He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him
Is that for real
(to Brian) You wanna come over sometime
That's bullshit
It's all part of your image,  don't believe a word of it
Bender actually looks hurt
You don't believe me
No
No
Did  stutter
Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn
Do you believe this
Huh
It's about the size of a cigar
Do stutter
You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage
Bender begins to walk away
See  don't think that  need to sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore
Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the maps on the floor
He climbs up on top of the table and then up to the second floor balcony
(to Andrew) You shouldn't have said that
How would  know,  mean he lies about everything anyway
: 19
'  - Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to pour coffee out of his thermos
The top comes off and the coffee goes all over his desk
Oh, shit
: 20
- Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself
Coffee
looks like they scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi river
Everything's polluted, everything's polluted
the coffee
Bender comes out of the library doors followed bye veryone else
Bender and Claire are walking next to each other
Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the end of the line, Allison is following
(to Bender) How do you know where Vernon went
don't
Well then, how do you know when he'll be back
don't
being bad feels pretty good, huh
(to Andrew) What's the point in going to Bender's locker
Beats me
This is so stupid
Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught
dunno
So then what are we doing
You ask me one more question and 'm beating the shit out of you
Sorry
Bender opens his locker
Slob
My maid's on vacation
Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana
Drugs
Screw that Bender
put it back
Bender walks away
Drugs
the boy had marijuana
Claire walks after Bender
That was marijuana
Shut up
Andrew follows the other two
Brian looks at Allison who is standing there with her mouth open
Do you approve of this
Brian turns and leaves
Allison steals the lock off of Bender's locker
We see the crowd walking down the hall
We'll cross through the lab, and then we'll double back
You better be right, if Vernon cuts us off it's your fault, asshole
(to Claire) What'd he say
Where're we going
They see Vernon down one of the halls
We have various sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon until they stop
Wait
Wait, hold it
Hold it
We have to go through the cafeteria
No, the activities hall
Hey man, you don't know what you're talking about
No you don't know what you're talking about
Allison squeaks
Now we're through listening to you, we're going this way
They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by an iron gate
Shit
Great idea Jagoff
Fuck you
(to Andrew) Fuck you
Why didn't you listen to John
We're dead
No, just me
What do you mean
Get back to the library, keep your unit on this
Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's underwear
Bender runs away singing loudly
wanna be an airborne ranger
We see Vernon hear Bender
The rest of them run
That son of a bitch
We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in the gym
Bender is going up for a basket
Three
two
one
He dunks the ball
Vernon enters
Bender
Bender
Bender
What is this
What are you doing here, what is this
Oh, hi
Out
That's it Bender
Out, it's over
Don't you wanna hear my excuse
Out
'm thinking of trying out for a scholarship
Gimmie the ball, Bender
Bender fakes the ball at Vernon
He then sets the ball down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him
They leave
: 21
- The rest of the kids are all sitting back in their seats when Bender and Vernon enter
Vernon pushes Bender
Get your stuff, let's go
(to everyone) Mr
Wiseguy here has taken it upon himself to go to the gymnasium
'm sorry to inform you, you're going to be without his services for the rest of the day
(to Vernon) -- --
Everything's a big joke, huh Bender
The false alarm you pulled, Friday, false alarms are really funny, aren't they
What if your home, what if your family
(a beat) what if your dope was on fire
Impossible, sir
It's in Johnson's underwear
Andrew laughs
(to Andrew) You think he's funny
You think this is cute
You think he's bitchin', is that it
Lemme tell you something
Look at him, he's a bum
(to everybody) You wanna see something funny
You go visit John Bender in five years
You'll see how God damned funny he is
(to Bender) What's the matter, John
You gonna cry
Let's go
Vernon grabs Bender's shoulder
Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me
expect better manners from you, Dick
Bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays them in front of Andrew
For better hallway vision
Bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the way
: 21
- Vernon has put Bender in a closet and is in there talking to him
That's the last time, Bender
That's the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids, do you hear me
make $31,000 dollars a year and  have a home and 'm not about to throw it away on some punk like you
But someday, man, someday
When you're outta here and you've forgotten all about this place
And they've forgotten all about you and you're wrapped up in your own pathetic life
'm gonna be there
That's right
And 'm gonna kick the living shit out of you, man, 'm gonna knock your dick in the dirt
Are you threatening me
What're you gonna do about it
You think anybody's gonna believe you
You think anybody's gonna take your word over mine
'm a man of respect around here
They love me around here, 'm a swell guy
you're a lying sack of shit
And everybody knows it
Oh, you're a real tough guy
come on, come on
get on your feet, pal
Let's find out how tough you are
wanna know right now, how tough you are
Come on
'll give you the first punch, let's go
Come on, right here, just take the first shot
Please, 'm begging you, take a shot
Come on, just take one shot, that's all  need, just one swing
Bender just sits there staring at Vernon
Vernon fakes a punch and Bender flinches
That's what  though
you're a gutless turd
Vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him
Bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and disappears
: 22
- Bender is slowly crawling through a heating duct
(to himself) naked blond walks into a bar, with a poodle under one arm and a two foot salami under the other
She lays the poodle on the table
Bar- tender says: " suppose you won't be needing a drink
"  The naked lady says
The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through
(screaming) Oh shit
: 23
- We see the door to the bathroom
We hear Vernon inside
() Jesus Christ, allmighty
24
- Bender walks down the stairs
forgot my pencil
We hear Vernon in the hall
() God damnit
What in God's name is going on in here
Vernon enters
What was that ruckus
Uh, what ruckus
was just in my office and  heard a ruckus
Could you describe the ruckus, sir
Watch your tongue young man, watch it
We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs
He sits up and bangs his head on the table
He groans
Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit for the noise by making more noise
What is that
What, what is that, what is that noise
Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and can see her panties
He puts his head between Claire's legs
What noise
Really, sir, there wasn't any noise
Claire squeels
She squeezes Bender's head between her knees
Everyone starts faking a coughing fit
(flustered) That noise
Was that the noise you were talking about
No, it wasn't
That was not the noise  was talking about
Now, may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet  will
Allison laughs at Vernon
You make book on that missy
(to Claire) And you
will not be made a fool of
He turns and walks away
We see that he still has the toilet seat cover stuck to his pants
Vernon leaves
Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a barage of slaps
It was an accident
You're an asshole
So sue me
Bender gets up and walks over to Brian
So, Ahab
Kybo Mein Doobage
Brian gives Bender his bag of marajuana
Bender turns and walks away
Yo waistoid
you're not gonna blaze up in here
Claire gets up and goes after him
Then Brian
Shit
Andrew goes
: 25
- We see Vernon go down the stairs
: 26
- Brian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and laughing hysterically
Bender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out
Brian laughs at her
He exhales and tries to eat the smoke
He talks in a really weird voice
Chicks, cannot hold der smoke
That's what it is
Do you know how popular  am
'm so popular, everybody loves me so much, at this school
Poor baby
Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over
We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room
He inhales another puff and then starts dancing to everybody's applause
He goes back in the room he was in
He screams and it shatters the glass in the door
: 27
- Vernon is glancing through the confidential files in the school basement
(to himself) Mister, oh mister Tearney
a history of slight mental illness
Wooh, no wonder he's so fucked up
Carl enters
Afternoon, Dick
Hey Carl, how you doin'
Good
Good, what's up
Not much, what's happening, what are you doing in the basement files
Oh, nothin' nothin' here
'm just doin' a little homework here
Homework, huh
Yeah
Carl, laughing, comes over and looks at the files that Vernon was looking at
Confidential files
hmmm
Look, Carl
this is a highly sensitive area and ,  tell you something
certain people would be very very embarrassed
would really appreciate it if if if if this would be something that, that you and could keep between us
What're you gonna do for me, man
Well, well what would you like
Got fifty bucks
What
Fifty bucks
: 28
- We see Andrew and Brian laughing
Allison is hanging out over by the statue in the back of the library
No no man, no; you got a middle name
Yeah, guess
Allison suddenly takes interest in the conversation and as she speaks, she moves over and sits next to the two
Your middle name is Ralph, as in puke
Brian and Andrew look at her in confusion
your birthday is March 12th, you're five-nine and a half you weigh a hundred and thirty pounds and your social security number is 0-4-9-3-8-0-9-1 (a beat) 3
Andrew is impressed
Wow
Are you psychic
No
Well would you mind telling me how you know all this about me
Allison reaches in her bag
stole your wallet
She produces it in her hands and grins
Give it to me
No
Give it
Allison reluctantly hands over the wallet and Brian glances through it to make sure nothing is missing
This is great
you're a thief too
Huh
'm not a thief
Multi-talented
What's there to steal
Two bucks and a beaver shot
what
He's got a nudie picture in there
saw it, it's perverted
Alright, let's see it
We see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of Claire's cosmetic brushes
We see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures
Are all these your girlfriends
Some of them
What about the others
Well, some  consider my girlfriends and some
just consider
Consider what
Whether or not,  wanna hang out with them
You don't believe in just one guy, one girl
Do you
Yeah
that's the way it should be
Well, not for me
Why not
Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that
He acts defensive
How come you got so much shit in your purse
How come you got so many girlfriends
asked you first
(shrugs) dunno
guess  never throw anything away
Neither do
Oh
We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet
This is the worst fake  've ever seen
Brian laughs
Do you realize you made yourself sixty eight
Oh,  know
know,  goofed it
What do you need a fake  for
(like it's obvious) So  can vote
Allison looks up suddenly
You wanna see what's in my bag
& No
Allison looks hurt and then resentful
Just to spite them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch
Lots of stuff comes out
Holy shit
What is all that stuff
Do you always carry this much shit in your bag
Yeah
always carry this much shit in my bag
You never know when you may have to jam
Are you gonna be like a shopping bag lady
You know like, sit in alleyways and like talk to buildings and wear men's shoes and that kinda thing
'll do what  have to do
Why do you have to do anything
(with feeling) My home life is un
satisfying
So you're saying you'd subject yourself to the violent dangers of the Chicago streets because your homelife is unsatisfying
don't have to run away and live in the street
can run away and, go to the ocean,  can go to the country,  can go to the mountains
can go to Israel, Africa, Afghanistan
Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew
Andy
you wanna get in on this
Allison here says, she wants to run away, because her home life is unsatisfying
Well everyone's home lives are un- satisfying
If it wasn't, people would live with there parents forever
Yeah, yeah  understand
But think that her's goes beyond, you know, what guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying
Nevermind
forget it, everything's cool
Allison starts putting everything back in her purse
What's the deal
No
There's no deal, Sporto
Forget it, leave me alone
Wait a minute, now you're carrying all that crap around in your purse
Either you really wanna run away or you want people to think you wanna run away
Eat shit
Allison gets up and walks away
The girl is an island, with herself
Okay
Andrew gets up and goes after her
Hi, you wanna talk
No
Why not
Go away
Where do you want me to go
away
Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry
You have problems
Oh,  have problems
You do everything everybody ever tells you to do, that is a problem
Okay, fine
but  didn't dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems
Did
So what's wrong
What is it
Is is bad
Real bad
Parents
Allison is silently crying
Yeah
Andrew nods
What do they do to you
They ignore me
Yeah
yeah
They both are crying silently
: 29
- Vernon and Carl are sitting talking
What did you want to be when you were young
When  was a kid,  wanted to be John Lennon
Carl don't be a goof
'm trying to make a serious point here
've been teaching, for twenty two years, and each year
these kids get more and more arrogant
Aw bull shit, man
Come on Vern, the kids haven't changed, you have
You took a teaching position, 'cause you thought it'd be fun, right
Thought you could have summer vacations off
and then you found out it was actually work
and that really bummed you out
These kids turned on me
they think 'm a big fuckin' joke
Come on
listen Vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you, huh
Hey
Carl, you think  give one rat's ass what these kids think of me
Yes  do
You think about this
when you get old, these kids; when  get old, they're gonna be runnin' the country
Yeah
Now this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night
That when  get older, these kids are gonna take care of me
wouldn't count on it
Vernon ponders that statement for a moment
: 30
- They are sitting on the floor in a circle
What would  do for a million bucks
Well,  guess 'd do as little as had to
That's boring
Well, how'm  s'posed to answer
The idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit
Like, uh, would you drive to school naked
Andrew laughs
Um, uh
would  have to get out of the car
Of course
In the spring, or winter
It doesn't matter
spring
In front of the school or in back of the school
Either one
Yes
'd do that
They all look at her
'll do anything sexual,  don't need a million dollars to do it either
You're lying
already have
've done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal
'm a nymphomaniac
Claire rolls her eyes
Lie
Are your parents aware of this
The only person  told was my shrink
And what'd he do when you told him
He nailed me
Very nice
don't think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since  paid him
He's an adult
Allison is relishing this attention
Yeah
he's married too
Claire notes her disgust
Do you have any idea how completely gross that is
Well, the first few times
First few times
You mean he did it more than once
Sure
Are you crazy
Obviously she's crazy if she's screwing her shrink
(to Claire) Have you ever done it
don't even have a psychiatrist
Have you ever done it with a normal person
Now, didn't we already cover this
You never answered the question
Look, 'm not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers
It's kind of a double-edged sword, isn't it
what
Well, if you say you haven't
you're a prude
If you say you have
you're a slut
It's a trap
You want to but you can't but when you do you wish you didn't, right
Wrong
Or, are you a tease
She's a tease
Oh why don't you just forget it
You're a tease and you know it, all girls are teases
(to Andrew) She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot
don't do anything
That's why you're a tease
Okay, lemme ask you a few questions
Allison is suddenly defensive
've already told you everything
No
Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love mean don't you want any respect
don't screw to get respect
That's the difference between you and me
Not the only difference,  hope
Face it, you're a tease
'm not a tease
Sure you are
You said it yourself sex is a weapon, you use it to get respect
No,  never said that, she twisted my words around
Oh then what do you use it for
don't use it period
Claire is on the verge of tears
Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological
didn't mean it that way
You guys are putting words into my mouth
Well if you'd just answer the question
Why don't you just answer the question
Be honest
No big deal
Yeah, answer it
Answer the question, Claire
Talk to us
& Come on, answer the question
It's easy, it's only one question
Claire silences all of them by screaming
(screaming) No
never did it
Silence for two beats
never did it either, 'm not a nymphomaniac
'm a compulsive liar
You are such a bitch
You did that on purpose just to fuck me over
would do it though
If you love someone it's okay
can't believe you, you're so weird
You don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth
you unload all these tremendous lies all over me
You're just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to
Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre
What's bizarre
mean we're all pretty bizarre
Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all
(to Andrew) How are you bizarre
Allison decides to field that question
He can't think for himself
She's right
do you guys know what, uh, what  did to get in here taped Larry Lester's buns together
Claire laughs
(to Andrew) That was you
(to Brian) Yeah, you know him
Yeah,  know him
Well then you know how hairy he is, right
Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too
Oh my God
And the bizarre thing is, is that did it for my old man tortured this poor kid, because wanted him to think that  was cool
He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school
all the wild things he used to do
And got the feeling that he was disappointed that  never cut loose on anyone, right
So, 'm
'm sitting in the locker room, and 'm taping up my knee
And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me
Yeah
he's kinda
he's kinda skinny, weak
And started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness
And the next thing  knew,  uh, jumped on top of him and started wailing on him
And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on
And afterwards, when  was sittin' in Vernon's office, all  could think about was Larry's father
And Larry havin' to go home and
and explain what happened to him
And the humiliation
fucking humiliation he mustuv felt
It mustuv been unreal
mean, (he's crying) mean, how do you apologize for something like that
There's no way
it's all because of me and my old man
Oh God,  fucking hate him
He's like this
he's like this mindless machine that  can't even relate to anymore
"Andrew, you've got to be number one won't tolerate any losers in this family
Your intensity is for shit
Win
Win
"  You son of a bitch
You know, sometimes,  wish my knee would give
and  wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore
And he could forget all about me
think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling
Andrew laughs briefly
It's like me, you know, with my grades
like, when , when step outside myself kinda, and when , when  look in at myself you know
And  see me and  don't like what  see,  really don't
What's wrong with you
Why don't you like yourself
'Cause 'm stupid
'cause 'm failing shop
See we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um
and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on
my light didn't go on,  got a on it
Never got a  in my life
When  signed up, you know, for the course  mean
thought  was playing it real smart, you know
'Cause  thought, 'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average
Why'd you think it'd be easy
Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop
take shop
you must be a fuckin' idiot
'm a fuckin' idiot because  can't make a lamp
No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp
What do you know about Trigonometry
could care less about Trigonometry
Bender, did you know without Trigonometry there'd be no engineering
Without lamps, there'd be no light
Okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one
Allison feels left out
can write with my toes
can also eat, brush my teeth
With your feet
play Heart & Soul on the piano
can make spaghetti
(to Andrew) What can you do
can
uh
tape all your buns together
wanna see what Claire can do
can't do anything
Now, everybody can do something
There's one thing  can do, no forget it, it's way too embarrassing
You ever seen Wild Kingdom
mean that guy's been doing that show for thirty years
Okay, but you have to swear to God you won't laugh
can't believe 'm actually doing this
Claire takes lipstick out and opens it
She places it between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage
When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect
Everyone claps
Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow
All right, great
Where'd you learn to do that
Camp, seventh grade
That was great, Claire
my image of you is totally blown
You're a shit
Don't do that to her you swore to God you wouldn't laugh
Am  laughing
You fucking prick
Bender turns to Andrew
As he speaks, we can see his words hitting home
What do you care what  think, anyway
don't even count, right
could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference
may as well not even exist at this school, remember
(he turns to Claire) And you
don't like me anyway
You know,  have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them
God, you're so pathetic
(furious) Don't you ever
ever
Compare yourself to me
Okay
You got everything, and  got shit
Fuckin' Rapunzel, right
School would probably fucking shut down if you didn't show up
"Queenie isn't here
"   like those earrings Claire
(quietly) Shut up
Are those real diamonds, Claire
(angry) Shut up
bet they are
did you work, for the money               Shut
for those earrings
Your mouth
Or did your daddy buy those
(furious) Shut up
Claire starts crying
bet he bought those for you bet those are a Christmas gift
Right
You know what  got for Christmas this year
It was a banner fuckin' year at the old Bender family
got a carton of cigarettes
The old man grabbed me and said "Hey
Smoke up Johnny
" Okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay
There are a few beats
My God, are we gonna be like our parents
Not me
ever
It's unavoidable, it just happens
What happens
When you grow up, your heart dies
Who cares
Allison is on the verge of tears herself
care
Um,  was just thinking,  mean know it's kind of a weird time, but was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on Monday
When we're all together again
mean consider you guys my friends, 'm not wrong, am
No
So, so on Monday
what happens
Are we still friends, you mean
If we're friends now, that is
Yeah
Do you want the truth
Yeah,  want the truth
don't think so
Well, do you mean all of us or just John
With all of you
That's a real nice attitude, Claire
Oh, be honest, Andy
if Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do
mean picture this, you're there with all the sports
know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him
No way
'Kay, what if  came up to you
Same exact thing
(furious and screaming at Claire) You are a bitch
Why
'Cause 'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch
No
'Cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone
And you don't got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like
Okay, what about you, you hypocrite
Why don't you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties
Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high
What about Andy for that matter, what about me
What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together
They'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me
(furious once again) Don't you ever talk about my friends
You don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's  and your poor--rich--drunk mother in the Carribean
(furious and sobbing) Shut up
And as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it
'Cause it's never gonna happen
Just bury your head in the sand
and wait for your fuckin' prom
hate you
Yeah
Good
There is silence until Brian speaks
Then  assume Allison and  are better people than you guys, huh
Us weirdos
(to Allison) Do you, would you do that to me
don't have any friends
Well if you did
No
don't think the kind of friends 'd have would mind
just wanna tell, each of you, that  wouldn't do that
wouldn't and  will not
'Cause  think that's real shitty
Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us
Brian laughs at her
You're so conceited, Claire
You're so conceited
You're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that
(crying again) 'm not saying that to be conceited
hate it
hate having to go along with everything my friends say
Well then why do you do it
don't know,  don't
you don't understand
you don't
You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and  are friends with
You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you
Brian is shocked
don't understand what
You think don't understand pressure, Claire
Well fuck you
Fuck you
Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying
Know why 'm here today
Do you
'm here because Mr
Ryan found a gun in the locker
Why'd you have a gun in your locker
tried
You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on
and it didn't go on,  mean, What's the gun for Brian
Just forget it
You brought it up, man
can't have an ,  can't have it and  know my parents can't have it
Even if  aced the rest of the semester, 'm still only a
And everything's ruined for me
(with pity) Oh Brian
Brian bashes a chair over
So  considered my options, you know
No
Killing yourself is not an option
Well  didn't do it, did
No, don't think so
It was a hand gun
No, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker
Really
Andrew starts to laugh
It's not funny
They all start to laugh, including Brian
Yes it is
fuckin' elephant was destroyed
You wanna know what  did to get in here
Nothing
didn't have anything better to do
Everyone laughs
You're laughing at me
No
Allison starts to laugh too
Yeah you are
: 31
- Later
We see Brian putting a record on and then music starts
We see them all dancing
This goes on for the duration of the song
: 32
- We see Bender crawling back through the heating duct
: 33
- Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that order on the railing
Brian
Yeah
Are you gonna write your paper
Yeah, why
Well, it's kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper, don't you think
Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us to do
True, but  think we'd all kinda say the same thing
You just don't want to write your paper
Right
True, but, you're the smartest, right
(with pride) Oh, well
We trust you
Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in approval
Yeah
All right, 'll do it
Great
Claire looks at Allison who looks back
(to Allison) Come on
Where're we going
Come on
We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison
Don't be afraid
Don't stick that in my eye
'm not sticking it, just close
just go like that
Claire closes her eyes
Allison mimics her
Good
Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals
You know you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes
Hey
like that black shit
This looks a lot better
look up
We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write
We see Andrew just thinking
We see Allison and Claire again
Claire is still putting make-up on Allison
Please, why're you being so nice to me
'Cause you're letting me
We see Brian begin to write
We see Andrew, still deep in thought
: 34
- We see Bender, in the closet once again
Claire opens the door and enters
You lost
Claire stares at him
Bender smiles
Claire smiles
: 35
- Brian is busily preparing the essay
Andrew looks up and sees the newly made over Allison and is in awe
Allison walks towards him and stops when she notices Brian staring at her with his mouth open
She glares at him
Cool
(smiling) Thank you
: 36
- Claire kisses Bender, then she breaks the kiss
Why'd you do that
'Cause  knew you wouldn't
You know how you said before, how your parents used you to get back at each other
wouldn't  be outstanding in that capacity
Were you really disgusted about what  did with my lipstick
Truth
Truth
Bender nods and speaks at the same time
No
: 37
- We see Brian lift up his paper and kiss it
We see Andrew and Allison
What happened to you
Why
Claire did it
What's wrong
Nothing's wrong, it's just so different
can see your face
Is that good or bad
(laughing) It's good
Allison smiles
We see Brian laugh and give himself a congratulatory punch in the arm
: 38
- The five are walking down the hall where they are met by Carl, sweeping up
Brian nods at him
See ya Brian
Hey Carl
(to Carl) See you next Saturday
You bet
: 39
- Brian gets into his dads car and leaves
Andrew and Allison kiss, Allison rips a patch off Andrews jacket and gets into the car
Andrew's dad arrives and looks at him, then at Allison
Andrew gets into the car and they drive off
We see Claire take out one of her diamond earrings and put it into Benders hand
They kiss and she gets into her car
She leaves
We see Bender put the earring in his ear
: 40
- We see Vernon pick up Brian's essay and begin to read
() Dear Mr
Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong
But we think you're crazy to make an essay telling you who we think we are
You see us as you want to see us
In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions
: 41
- We see Bender walking towards us as Brian's monologue continues
() (') But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain
() and an athlete
() and a basket case
() a princess
() and a criminal
() Does that answer your question
Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club
We see Bender walking across the football field as he thrusts his fist into the air in a silent cheer and freezes there
