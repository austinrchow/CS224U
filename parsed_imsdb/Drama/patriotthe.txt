Beautiful
Untamed
Soaring old-growth elms arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently curving, deep-water Santee River
: April, 1776 Upstream, the swamps
Beautiful
Hundreds of
Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns covering the high ground
The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads, each with a stark white flower rising from it
: - farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps
Good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness
The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco
Two sturdy brothers, , 13 and , 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley
The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained
There's a barn, a workshop and a forge
It is a home of substance rather than wealth
On the front porch, , 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, , 6, watches
, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder
At his side walks , 14, also carrying a musket
- perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period
foot-powered lathe
drop-forge
lifting saw
Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places
All very well-worn
methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel
He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered
His hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision
Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth
finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table
The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue
Sitting on the woodpile, , 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father
Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place
Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork
He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight
The chair floats
Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks
Susan nods, so far, so good
Marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle
Then, the acid test
He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time
Not a creak
He smiles and sits back with a sigh
under Marion's weight, on his ass on a pile of broken wood
Damnation
He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look
He calms himself
Sorry
Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace
As she climbs back up to her perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over again
- Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side
Nathan and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the field
Father,  saw a post rider at the house
Thank you
Did you finish the upper field
We got it all cut and we bundled half of it
Those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they
Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off the blame
Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn
Father, a post rider came from Charleston
You have a letter inside
Thank you
How's the spotted one's milk
Better
She's near ready to calve
Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house
She does so and Marion walks on alone toward: -   - The loveliest spot on the farm
beautiful view of the house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree
It reads: 1738-1773 Above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the center of which is the  , steady and guiding
Marion approaches
He gives himself a moment to look at the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact than sorrowful
and they bundled half
almost no trace of the boys you knew
soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground
Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply
no, she still hasn't spoken
Margaret was her age when you remember the time at the river when we couldn't find Catherine
you couldn't stop crying
and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time
Marion pauses, remembering
The , followed by the     rises from the house below
Marion shakes his head with an exasperated sigh
Your children
He heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from the lights of candles and oil lamps
'  - Pre-dinner chaos
Everyone talking at once
Marion's seven children and his two family servants,  and , a middle-aged black couple, prepare dinner
Susan silently watches from the stairs
Marion walks in
smell turnips
Father, Samuel broke the blue plate
did not
Dinner
Marion hands the apples to Abigail and steps over to open his mail and dispatches
News of Boston, father
hate turnips
William knocked it right out of my hands
Father
Samuel, William, both of you clean it up
Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a letter
The Assembly has been reconvened, 've been called to
Marion's children go wild
Charleston
We're going to Charleston
When, father, when
We'll leave tomorrow
The children    and  into the dining room
Charleston
We're going to Charleston
Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look
Then Marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply
love turnips
Marion follows his children into the dining room
'  - Quiet
The only sounds are the soft calls of a few and the
faint light moves through the downstairs, passing windows in the otherwise dark house
'  - Marion, holding a candle, does a father's bedtime check
The   him as he makes his rounds into: Everything is clean and put away in its proper place
Marion checks that the doors are closed and bolted
He heads up the stairs
'  - Marion enters, finding William asleep on the floor and Nathan and Samuel in bed
He lifts William into bed, takes a slingshot from Nathan's hand, tucks in Samuel and walks out
'  - Marion steps to the doorway, finding Margaret and Susan at the window, looking up at the night sky
now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the Big Dipper, and that's the North Star, that's her
Susan gazes up at the North Star
The girls notice Marion and climb into bed
He puts a chair against Susan's bed and kisses her
He pulls a blanket up around Margaret, who whispers: It helps her to know Mother's there
Marion nods with a thin smile, kisses Margaret and walks out
'  - Squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as Thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men
Gabriel reads the new pamphlets and broadsides
Marion walks in and pours a drink
Gabriel hands several of the pamphlets to his father
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved
The middle colonies
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent
He died of burns
In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July
Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box
He begins reading
Scott Higgins joined the militia
Marion hears but doesn't respond
Thomas looks up from his lead soldiers
He's seventeen
year younger than Gabriel and Thomas wait for a reaction
There is none
Gabriel goes back to reading and Thomas resumes playing with his toy soldiers
Marion's eyes drift from the page to Gabriel
- The Marion family, in two tightly-packed carriages, drives on a beautiful road, cut through the swamps
The canopy of swamp maples and weeping willows forms a tunnel of green, mottled by sunlight
- The two carriages pass a view of their entire valley
Scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields surrounding the town of Bennington
- Passing through rolling farmland, the Marions head toward the coast
They pass a large contingent of South Carolina Militia, drilling in a field
The children, particularly Gabriel, watch avidly
- big, bustling city
Marion and Gabriel negotiate the carriages through the busy streets
The children watch, wide-eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards, street entertainers, well-dressed ladies attended by their maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear
'  -  - Grand
Four stories
Marion and his children pull up
hurries out
She's in her mid-thirties, beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can
The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her, embracing her, smothering her with kisses
Aunt Charlotte
Aunt Charlotte
Welcome
Welcome
Margaret, William, look at you
(to Marion) They're huge
What have you been feeding them
They're from good stock on their mother's side
Thank you
Charlotte hustles the children toward the door
Come, come, inside, wait until you see what  have
(simultaneous) Presents
For me
What do you have
Inside, inside
Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house
- '  - Marion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents
Susan plays with a new doll
William has half-a-dozen new spinning tops, skimming around the floor
Margaret holds a new dress up to herself
Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers
Gabriel looks through a new book
Charlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at the doorway
You look well, Charlotte
As do you
Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway, forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close
They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles
The moment is broken by the
Marion and Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them
- Down the block from the Motte house
yelling crowd of Sons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from which hang dozens of glowing lanterns
Most of the men in the crowd are drunk
Vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, "Don't Tread On Me
"  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards, watch the proceedings
Several Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King George and Governor Wilmington
They light the effigies on fire
As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers
'  - Marion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony watching the mob
Marion steps out onto the balcony
Inside, all of you
The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions
Marion relents
Very well
The children turn back to the mob
Marion joins them
Look
There's Gabriel
They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd
He sees them and waves, then enters the house
moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: , a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword
Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children
Children, inside
All of you
Right now
The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it
They file into the house
Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and shoos the children inside
Gabriel steps out and joins them
What news
The British army is barricaded in Boston
Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army
Is that why the Assembly was convened
Yes
He seeks a levy of troops and money
And the Governor
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts
Our governor is a bigger fool than thought
Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist
Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of Lee's expectations
Marion turns back to watch the mob
-  - The capital building of South Carolina
large crowd of lower-class men and women is massed in front of the Assembly Hall
As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the building, the   words of encouragement to some and berates others
In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron of blue-uniformed    drills recruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captain and several military clerks
Marion and Gabriel walk across the square toward the Assembly Hall
As they push their way through the crowd, Gabriel eyes the Continentals
- Two dozen , ,
Among them are ,  and , who are Patriots
Opposed to them are ,  and  who are Loyalists (loyal the the King)
As Marion makes his way to his seat, the
Slowly, the room quiets down
Our first order of business
And out last if we vote a levy
The
Mr
Simms, you do not have the floor
The
Our first order of business is an address by Colonel Harry Lee of the Continental Army
An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of the assembly
He's   , about Marion's age and cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with a powerful bearing
The room quiets down
Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion returns, stone-faced
Then Lee speaks, simply and clearly
You all know why  am here
am not an orator and  will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause
am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from Philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war
In preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a Continental Army ask South Carolina to be the ninth
Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at war, along with New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Virginia, but South Carolina is not at war
Massachusetts and New Hampshire are not as far from South Carolina as you might think and the war they're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies
It's for the independence of a nation
And what nation is that
Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up
An American nation
Colonel Lee, with your permission
Please
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists
It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested
We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away
Thank you
Were  an orator, those are the exact words  would have spoken
Laughter
Marion rises
Mister Robinson, tell me, why should trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away
Laughter from the Loyalists
Surprise from Lee and the Patriots
In the gallery, Gabriel winces
Sir
An elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a King can
Captain Marion,  understood you to be a Patriot
It's Mister Marion
understood him to be a Patriot as well
More laughter
If you mean by a Patriot, am  angry at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp Act
Then 'm a Patriot
And what of the Navigation Act
Should  be permitted to sell my tobacco to the French traders on Martinique
Yes, and it's an intrusion into my affairs that  can't
legally
Laughter
And what of the greedy, self-serving bastards who sit as Magistrates on the Admiralty Court and have fined nearly every man in this room
Should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to England
'll do it myself
(beat) And do  believe that the American colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of King and Parliament
do, and if that makes a Patriot, then 'm a Patriot
Marion grows more serious
But if you're asking whether 'm willing to go to war with England, the answer is, no
've been to war and  have no desire to do so again
The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off- balance
Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his father's speech
This from the same Captain Francis Marion whose anger was so famous during the Wilderness Campaign
Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles
was intemperate in my youth
My departed wife, God bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility
Robinson looks derisively at Marion
Temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear
Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in
Mister Robinson,  fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign
We served as scouts under Washington and  have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield
There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom would more willingly trust my life
stand corrected
Nonetheless,  would like to know, Mister Marion, how
how
how
Lee's oratorical skills peter out
Damn it, Francis
How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war
Harry, Harry, Harry
Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more than two old friends, pissed off
My hairy arse
You live in a cave if you think we'll get independence without war
The Speaker
Gentlemen
Please
This is not a tavern
Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought under
long time ago
Thirteen years
That's a damn long time
The Speaker    again
Gentlemen
Please
Marion and Lee ignore the speaker
You were an Englishman then
was an American,  just didn't know it yet
The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder
We don't have to go to war to gain independence
Balderdash
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal
Name five hundred
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery
That's five, keep going
time, royal succession, regicide, bribery
You said bribery twice
Marion speaks slowly and firmly
We do not have to go to war to gain independence
Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly
Francis,  was at Bunker Hill
It was as bad as anything you and  saw on the frontier
Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River
The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range
And still, they advanced and they took the ground
That is the measure of their resolve
If your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way
It has come to that
Marion is silent for a long moment
He softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to
have seven children
My wife is dead
Who's to care for them if go to war
Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of weakness
At first Lee has no answer, then: Wars are not fought only by childless men
man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles
That's what 'm doing
will not fight and because  won't,  will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead
And your principles
'm a parent,  don't have the luxury of principles
The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare at him, appalled
Marion, feeling weak, sits down
Lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment
Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses the chair
Mister Speaker,  call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army
Second
So moved
The vote is taken on a roll call
Gabriel watches from the gallery
Mr
Robinson
Yea
Mr
Hamill
Yea
Mr
Johnson
Yea
Mr
Simms
Nay
Mr
Marion
No response
Mr
Marion
Nay
In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out
The roll call continues
Marion sits, eyes straight ahead
- The crowd waits
The doors open and a   dashes out and runs to the Continental Captain at the recruiting table
Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy passed
The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron
They raise their muskets and    into the air
Other soldiers, Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, and jostling for position
The delegates walk out
Both Patriots and Loyalists give Marion a wide berth
Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table
Marion walks up to him
Father, 've lost respect for you
thought you were a man of principle
When you have children,  hope you'll understand
When  have children,  hope  don't hide behind them
Marion looks closely at Gabriel
Do you intend to enlist without my permission
Yes
They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from his father and walks away, joining the crush around the recruiting table
Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos
The continue to play
Marion doesn't hear them
Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly
Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion
Lee sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment table
One of yours
Gabriel
recognize him now
Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age
No, thank the Lord
He's more like his mother
'll see to it that he serves under me
Thank you
They shake hands
Then Lee walks over to the soldiers
Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads off through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table
- Springtime
The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with blossoms
: "  " -   - Marion plows a field
Nathan leads the plowhorse
Samuel follows, breaking up the clods of dirt
Hard work
They stop to catch their breath
blows
Marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice
He hears nothing
He snaps the reins and continues plowing
'  - Dark
Thomas steps up into the attic
He finds a trunk and opens it
Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a trove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat, a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its scabbard
Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow shoulders
He stands in front of a dusty mirror, appraising himself, then stops as he hears coming up the stairs
It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing
Thomas grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake his head gently
Not yet, Thomas
When
Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy of really thinking about the answer
Seventeen
But it's already been two years and that's two more years
The war could be over by then
God willing
Thomas considers it, then nods
Alright
Seventeen
Marion offers his hand
They shake firmly, like adults
Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in the trunk
They walk down the stairs together
- All is quiet
dawn mist hovers close over the ground
Some sparrows feed at the base of the apple tree near the gravesite
Low and rolling
The birds stop feeding, uneasy, then fly away
'  - At another roll of the   Marion awakes
He gets out of bed and pulls on his clothes
- '  - Marion steps out to his front porch and listens
He knows the sound, the      and the One by one the children join him
Thomas, Nathan and Samuel listen analytically
Margaret and Susan press close against their father
William looks curiously at the cloudless sky
Is it going to rain
That's not thunder
The   ,
They all notice the change
Father
Six-pounders
Lots of them
How far away
Four, five miles
Waxhaus
Just east of it
Are we safe here
Marion puts on a smile
Don't worry
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm
She's to the west
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads
We're safer here
Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets
He gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father
Put those away
But father, they might come this way
Put them away
Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house
Enough
'll be in the workshop
Samuel, the cows
Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch
Nathan, on the back porch
If you see anyone, come get me
Margaret, please keep William close to you
No one is to go past the yard wall
They all nod
Marion walks off toward the workshop, followed by Susan
The others hesitate
Children
They head off to do as they were told
- Marion works the lathe
Susan watches from her perch on the woodpile
- The     from inside the barn
An angry cow runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who is holding onto the cow's neck
Samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt
The cow runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the bank of the river
Samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the cow
As Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly approaching then retreating from the water
Then he sees the cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue
Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is
Behind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yard wall
Samuel
He doesn't respond
Margaret, trailed by William, walks down toward Samuel
Samuel, get up to the house
You heard father
Then she sees it, too
The pale pink is turning redder and redder
And then the
First one, then more, many more
Torn apart
Missing limbs
Those with wide- open wounds, are already drained of blood
Others are still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water
Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and fascinated
steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river
He can't see what they're looking at
Irritated, he walks toward them
Then, as he nears the river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children
He quickens his stride, speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them
Up to the house, now
All of you, come on
Now
'  - Quiet
Dark
Marion stands on the front porch, looking out into the night, listening, hearing nothing
He glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from the Big Dipper to the
,     , carrying a musket, moves from shadow to shadow
- Margaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low
They're going to come
Quiet
We're going to have to fight them off
Father will do that
They'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women
Samuel
They all stop
Something moved behind the kitchen
Margaret silently eases the others out of the room, through the darkened hall toward their father
, Big
Hulking
In uniform
Margaret
William and Samuel
The figure moves toward them
Marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the house
He sees the figure, moves toward it
Marion sees the bloodied face
Gabriel
Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty
He carries a musket and a dispatch case
He sways
Marion catches him and eases him to a seat
You're hurt
The battle, were you there
Margaret, get bandages and water
Thomas, the porch, eyes open
Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not life-threatening
Have you seen any Redcoats
Not yet
What happened
Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings
It wasn't like Saratoga
There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats
They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw was given these dispatches
saw Virginia Regulars surrender
as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits
killed them all, over two hundred men
Marion's appalled
They had surrendered
Gabriel nods
Marion's stunned
Gabriel tries to rise
have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro
You're in no condition to ride
have no choice,
Gabriel passes out
Marion catches him and carries him to a day-bed in the parlor
As Marion lays him down, they hear   ,
Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night, the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight
Pitch black
Then a  , creating a that illuminates a tableau of soldiers, about three dozen Redcoats and as many Patriots
The strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an ensuing    in every direction
Then darkness, punctuated by   , and the
Then the pattern repeats itself:    , illuminating a tableau of targets for another Margaret, take William and Susan down to the root cellar
Thomas, go to the back porch
Nathan and Samuel, the side windows
Keep out of sight
They hurry off
Marion steps into the house and opens his gun cabinet
He extracts two pistols and a pair of muskets
Then he steps back to the front door
He waits and watches
-   - First light
The morning mist lies low over the field
Marion warily approaches the scene of the battle
He carries a Pennsylvania rifle, has another slung over his shoulder, and has a pair of pistols in his belt
As Marion nears the field he sees, appearing out of the low mist, a nightmarish vision
Young Redcoats and Continentals are scattered on the ground, dead and wounded
Many have been hideously torn apart by the massive musket balls
Blood is everywhere
Marion hurries back toward the house
-   - Marion loads the wounded men onto a wagon, helped by Thomas, Nathan and Samuel
'  -   - The porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital
There are about two dozen wounded, a few more Patriots than Redcoats
Thomas, Nathan, Samuel and Margaret help Marion tend the soldiers
William and Susan watch from inside
Marion treats an arm wound, retying a tourniquet, stanching an ugly flow of blood
Marion moves to the next of the wounded
Thomas starts to help but Marion shakes his head
He's dead
Marion moves on to another
Thomas, help me turn him over
They turn over a young Continental and see a horrible wound on his back
Thomas, swoons
Thomas
hard glare from Marion strengthens his son
Together they bandage the wounded man
'  - Triage completed
Margaret and Samuel give water and food
Marion kneels next to a   and a who are less severely wounded than the others
Thank you
Marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks
Sergeant, there are seventeen wounded men here
Seven Redcoats and ten Patriots, counting my son inside
That puts me in a difficult position
The Continental Sergeant knows what's coming
The Privates and Marion's children don't
You three are the least severely wounded
have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere
The Privates are stunned at the request
The Sergeant looks at Marion's children and nods
understand
He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two Privates to do the same
Come on, boys
Nathan, Samuel and Margaret are confused
Father
But they're wounded
There are rules, even in war
Marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm
After the Battle of Ashuelot River, against the French,  got this and the one on my leg
couldn't walk
Washington had to march north
He left me with other wounded men and a like number of French prisoners
Nine for nine
When the French found us, their surgeon gave me the best of care
We'll be safe this way
Marion's children are not convinced
The Sergeant and the two Privates gather themselves to leave
Your best chance is in Bennington, seven miles east, along the river road
The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road
Thank you
Marion and his children watch them go
- dirt road runs along the edge of the Santee Swamps, stretching toward green, rolling hills beyond
Beautiful country
Peaceful
Then, the rises, louder and louder
From around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops: British
The finest light calvary in the world
Hard, strong men
Excellent horsemen
Their mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for
The Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with the blood and dirt of a recent battle
Tired and vigorous
They're armed to the teeth
Each carries a flintlock carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword
Some carry lances as well
Regimental flags flutter
They are forty of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable
And at their head, the most imposing man of all,
"The Butcher

His men struggle to keep up with him
Behind them, two dozen    (American civilians loyal to the crown)
Nasty, local men

Riding at their head is  , grizzled, lower-class, wearing ill-fitting patrician's clothing
The three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road, raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender
The Green Dragoons rein in
Tarleton stops in front of the three men
He motions for one of his men to lower his weapon
Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded men
You're surrendering
Yes, sir
What unit
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton
Who cared for your wounds
They hesitate
We did
With a lace table cloth
Tarleton turns to his second-in-command,
Kill them
Tarleton rides off
Wilkins and several other Dragoons calmly   , killing the three Patriots
The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the three men

Gabriel, weak but walking, helps

Three dozen men
Scouts and flank units covering the main body
Marion gathers his family around him, stands and waits
The Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded and Marion's family
young   motions his men to check out the house and barn, then looks at the wounded, doing a silent count
He turns to Marion
These men are of my regiment
Thank you

Rebel dispatches, sir
Gabriel steps up

The
All turn and see: Thundering down the road toward the house
It's an impressive, frightening sight
They rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, enveloped by their trailing cloud of dust
Tarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the young Redcoat Lieutenant
Lieutenant, have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing
Use whatever horses and wagons you can find here
Yes, sir
He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton
We found this, sir
Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents
Who carried this

(to Lt
re: Gabriel) Take this one to Camden, he's a spy
He will be hung
Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel
Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and that's a marked dispatch case
Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the Lieutenant
Fire the house and barns
Yes, sir
Colonel
And the Rebel wounded
Kill them
The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked by the order
Marion is, also, but he's more concerned with Gabriel
He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at Tarleton's mount, looking up
dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying
Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion
He looks down at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles
We're not going to hold him, we're going to hang him
But
Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion
Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly Redcoat Corporal
Father
Oh, he's your son
You should have taught him about loyalty
Colonel,  beg you, please reconsider
By the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case
Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol trained on Marion's face
Would you like a lesson in the rules of war
Marion doesn't answer
He looks up at Tarleton coldly, taking his measure, waiting to see if he's going to pull the trigger
Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his aim, pointing the pistol among Marion's children
Perhaps your children would
The children are terrified
Thomas is more angry than frightened
Marion quickly steps between the pistol and his children and speaks quietly to Tarleton
No lesson is necessary
Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of Marion's children
He smiles at the effect
Then he holsters his pistol
Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats ties Gabriel's hands
Thomas is beside himself
Father, do something
Thomas grows increasingly agitated
He sees that his father is going to do nothing
He gauges the distance between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods
Then suddenly, Thomas
He ,  , into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel,
Gabriel
Run
Gabriel is too shocked to take flight
few of the Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual gesture
One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the neck and yanks him to his feet

Without pausing he ,
is thrown to his knees by the shot
Stunned, confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in his chest

The  are frozen in place
Tarleton's are impassive, having seen worse
holds his son, looking at the huge, incomprehensible wound
He knows that Thomas is already dead, though his body still moves
' stunned agony turns to fury
He rises, his eyes trained on Tarleton, then stops as
raises a second loaded pistol and a raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Marion and his children
, torn between his fury and fear for his other children
He locks his eyes on Tarleton
calmly baths in Marion's anger
Then, with a hard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head around and utters a sharp command to Wilkins
Major
Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking back
His    after him

Margaret tries to revive Thomas' lifeless body, gently caressing his cheek

The Redcoats watch in silence and turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant
Lieutenant, please
The Lieutenant wavers, but he looks after the departing Tarleton and his resolve stiffens
He turns coldly to Marion

The Redcoat infantrymen scatter, some to get horses and wagons from the barn, others to torch the buildings
stands among the children, all of whom look to Marion with pleading eyes, waiting for him to do something
Papa, look what they did to Thomas
Father, they're going to take Gabriel
With stone-faced fury, Marion watches the Redcoats do their work
From the barns, they hear the sounds of   and the     being killed
Other    ,
The Redcoats bring out Marion's wagons and carriages and begin loading the Redcoat wounded
The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men walk among the Patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet, begging for mercy
The Redcoats quickly  , as if to get it over with

Then
, his hands bound behind him, looks to his father with a combination of resoluteness and fear
Marion locks eyes with him
Father, you can't let them take him
Quiet
Watch as the Redcoats form up and move out, leading Gabriel on a tether
Gabriel looks back helplessly but a hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him around
They disappear around a bend in the road
,  speaks firmly to his weeping children
Don't move
to his front door and ,
Picking a route between the flames, Marion walks to his gun cabinet
He opens it and pulls out weapons -- two Pennsylvania rifles, two muskets, two pistols, a long-bladed knife and a worn tomahawk
He carries them, with powder horns and ammunition pouches back toward the door
Marion walks
Nathan, Samuel
Without breaking stride, Marion throws muskets to Nathan and Samuel who catch them
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed
Hide there
If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house
They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm
Nathan, Samuel, and  are going to get Gabriel
But what about Thomas
Leave him
Take care of William and Susan
Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel follow
Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan toward the river
The house is enveloped in flames
- Marion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady pace
Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded than their father
Marion makes up with cold fury what he lacks in youth
- Marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill
Slows
Crawls the last few feet
Nathan and Samuel just behind him
Looks over the hillside
path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below
Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for advantage
He points
Nathan, there
Samuel, there
The boys go where they're told
'll fire first
Then, Nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to Gabriel
Samuel, kill the last man in the line
They stagger under the weight of the orders
Marion notices but continues
After that, Samuel, load for Nathan
If something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill
Hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte's farm
The boys hesitate
Marion looks at them firmly
Boys

& Yes, father
Marion disappears into the underbrush
The dozen Redcoats approach
Leading Gabriel on the rope
Marion waits in the thick undergrowth
On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look

Samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who ,
Marion , killing the Corporal, the last man of rank
Marion ducks to the side as a tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke
,
He strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush, offering only glimpses of himself
He changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving
He never gives the Redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock
It's an Indian tactic and it works
The Redcoats     , about to fire
Marion suddenly  ,  , several
Six Redcoats left
Some primed, some reloading draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and , killing him
Samuel,  as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who

He instantly     , drawing the Redcoats' attention from his sons
Marion    , killing two Redcoats
One Redcoat finishes reloading
Marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and  him in the face with the butt of the musket
This is a  , a vicious, savage Marion, killing with stunning brutality
Marion drops his own expended rifle and '   before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another Redcoat's belly and
Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading

Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and
Then, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons
Nathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage, stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel
Marion runs up and motions for them to stop
Marion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead
Samuel, reload
Nathan, untie Gabriel
They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush
In a moment they're ready
Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush
- The house and barns smolder
Thomas' body lies in the yard
Nearby, the bodies of the Patriot wounded, now dead
-   - Margaret waits in the shed with William and Susan
They hear a
Margaret pulls her sister and brother to her and waits
The door opens
It's Marion and Gabriel, Nathan and Samuel
Margaret and the little ones throw themselves into Marion's arms
Margaret notices the blood on Marion
She hesitates but her relief tightens her embrace
- Marion, trailed by his children, walks past the soldiers' bodies and the remains of their house
He kneels down next to Thomas' body
On the ground Marion sees several of '
He stares at them for a moment, picks them up and puts them in his pocket
Marion picks up Thomas and carries him up the hill toward the apple tree and Elizabeth's grave
The children follow
-   - Marion digs a grave
The children watch
The only sounds are Marion's labored , the     and the     blown along the ground by a soft wind
Some dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as if trying to bandage his wound
-   -  () Marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave
Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to Elizabeth's gravestone
The soft wind blows
Marion listens
He turns and sees his children looking up at him
Holding in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and let's them cry
There, there
he's alright
he's with your mother now
He stiffens, speaking formally: Lord, we pray that You accept this child, Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother
We ask that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your mercy works
This we ask, in Your name
Amen
' Amen
Marion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases his children away
- Marion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing the Santee River valley spread out before them
The from two dozen farms rises
The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, Stantons
The smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds
They walk on
'  - Marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods
They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte
Father, it's safe
Marion hustles the children out of the woods
- Charlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan
The other children lie awake on pallets
Marion, still streaked with dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaret into bed
Sleep, now
Marion moves on to Nathan
Father
killed those men
Don't blame yourself, you did what told you to do
'm glad  killed them
'm glad
Marion isn't
He turns to Samuel who's cried-out
Marion reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's blood-streaked hand
Marion sighs and tucks him in
Try to get some sleep
Marion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her head
'll stay with them
Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children
'   - Marion enters
He starts to pace but grows unsteady
He rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are searching for the solace of sleep
He opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours and drinks
Then another
Gabriel walks in
Tired
Grim
How are they
Marion just shakes his head
Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army
'll leave in the morning to join him
Marion nods
Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a long moment, neither one finding words
Then Gabriel speaks softly
'll tend my horse
He leaves Marion alone
'  -  () Marion stares at the fireplace
Charlotte walks in carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing
They're asleep
Marion is silent
Charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to Marion
He takes off his shirt
She begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck
How did this
how did  let this happen
You couldn't have known
should have known
once  would have
used to be wary
and today  watched my son killed before my eyes
your sister civilized me and  damn myself for having let her
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed
've done nothing and for that  am ashamed
She looks at him closely
If you go, 'll care for them as if they were my own
'll leave in the morning with Gabriel
He stares past her, looking at the flames in the fireplace
She tends his wounds
- '  - Marion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses
Marion embraces Nathan and Samuel
Then he turns to Margaret, William and Susan
When will you be back
don't know, William
Tomorrow
Marion winces
Margaret puts her arm around William
No, not tomorrow
Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to coax a word out of the silent four-year-old: Goodbye
She just looks at him
Just one word
Goodbye
That's all want
Susan shakes her head
He sighs, rises and turns to Charlotte
They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment longer than one would expect
She looks up at him
he kisses her on the cheek
Marion mounts up
And he and Gabriel head off, Susan, unnoticed and unheard, whispers: Goodbye
Marion and Gabriel ride away
- Marion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small skirmish
Bodies
Abandoned wagons
Dead horses burning farm
- Marion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill
vista spreads out before them
They see an awesome sight -- approaches a
battle is taking place about five miles away
Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him
No, it's too late
Gabriel stops
Marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army
Command posts
Patriot
British
The distant slash of red stops
Marion and Gabriel hear only a   and some nearby
Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a sudden, silent eruption of white smoke
An instant later, the blue slash quivers
moment later the    ,     and rolls over Marion and Gabriel
The    moving
It darkens as thousands of Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position
Marion's eyes dart
He knows what's coming
Break for the trees
break for the trees
billows from the red slash
An instant later, the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant Patriots fall
The      reaches Marion and Gabriel like the pattering of rain
Then the   ,   erupts from the Patriot lines
The red line holds firm
Send them to cover
Goddamn you
But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field
From behind the Redcoats, - move quickly onto the battlefield
Father, we have to do something
The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it
Tiny bits of blue move in every direction
Father
It's already over
Marion watches, appalled
At this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful
Marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines
- nightmare
few hundred battered, Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move out
The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically painful and ugly
Marion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs and arms
Marion sees at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying to pull things together
Damn you, Sergeant, don't move the wounded twice, put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons
Yes, sir
Lieutenant, detail men for outriders
We move out as soon as the wounded are ready
Yes, sir
The Lieutenant rushes off
Lee notices Marion and Gabriel, surprised to see them
He jerks his head for them to follow him into: ' Once out of sight of the men, Lee loses his command bearing
Exhausted, he leans on his campaign table and looks closely at Marion, asking with his eyes why Marion is here
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas
It was Tarleton himself
'm sorry
'm sorry  wasn't here for this
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool
We saw
begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle
He spent too many years in the British army
Where is he now
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up
Who's in command
am,  think
What are my orders
Lee gives Marion a tired smile
If you want orders, 've got some for you
Lee     for Marion and Gabriel
We're a breath away from losing this war
In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats
(pointing) Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back
He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield
(beat) Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga
The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops
When
Fall, six months at the earliest
Long time
The bigger problem is where, not when
The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then
Not me, you
'm going north with every Continental regular  can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia
Not held, just slowed down
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard
They'd be better off letting it move on
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry
(beat) including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton
At the mention of Tarleton, Marion nods
'll do what  can
Lee quickly writes something
'm giving you a field commission as a colonel
He hands it to Marion
Gabriel steps forward
Colonel Lee,  request a transfer to Colonel Marion's command
Granted
Lee scribbles another order and hands it to Gabriel
Then he turns to Marion
Good luck
Marion nods
They duck out of the tent
-  () Marion and Gabriel stand watching Lee and his Continental regulars move out
Gabriel turns to Marion
What now, sir
We put out the word
We'll start along the south side of the Santee
We'd cover more ground if we split up
It's safer if we stay together
Gabriel steps in front of Marion
Colonel,  didn't request this transfer because you're my father
requested it because  believe in this cause and this is where  can do the most good
Oh
've been doing this for two years
'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and  know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston
Is that so
Yes, sir
(beat) My father taught me
Marion looks at Gabriel closely
Did your father teach you humility
He tried
It didn't take
Marion looks Gabriel up and down
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp
'll take the north side of the river
We'll meet at Snow's Island
Yes, sir
They mount up
And, Corporal
(beat) be careful
Yes
(beat) father
They ride off in different directions
- Marion rides into a small village, passing several bodies in blue Continental uniforms, hanging from lampposts
Marion stops in front of a tavern, dismounts and enters
-  - As Marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half- a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks
'm looking for John Billings
He's dead
Marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men
If he comes back from the dead, tell him Francis Marion is looking for him
'll be sure to do that
As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of Madeira on one of the tables
He stops
'll wait
Miracles happen
stand-off
Then, a hulking  appears in the shadows at the back doorway
He's  , big, coarse, about Marion's age
Billings jerks his head for Marion to join him in the back room
-  - Dark
Marion and billings talk over a bottle
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia
expect to try
Trust you and Harry Lee
Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis
It worked
How many men can you raise
Not many
Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev
Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose
(beat) What about you
You've got a lot to lose
Marion drains his glass and stands up
You coming, or not
Billings drains his glass
They walk out together
-  - Marion and Billings ride away from the tavern, passing the hanging Patriot bodies
'  -   - Swamp maples and willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools of plant-choked water
Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp
They cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men, including Marion who kneels at a campfire
:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted in a cast-iron pan
The little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal
The new arrivals dismount and greet the others
Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which  and
Father, this war is about more than Thomas
Marion doesn't look up
Is it
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself
How old are you
You know how old  am
God help us all when you're forty
Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan
Gabriel shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse
'   - Day breaks
low, thick swamp mist covers the encampment
Marion, sits alone by the embers of last night's campfire
The men are awake
Some eat, others talk
Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie
He takes the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch attached to his weapons' belt
Then he rises and heads over to the men
He surveys his brigade
Twenty-six men:  framers, artisans, mountain men, none in uniform
Marion walks among them, nodding familiarly to several
He notices an imposing looking Cherokee Indian,  , standing a bit apart from the others
They exchange nods
He notices a stern-looking man in partial clerical garb, Reverend
heard about your son
'm sorry
Marion accepts his condolences
He notes  , a tough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare
Dalton
Dalton doesn't respond
Marion recognizes another face, , African-American, around thirty, rugged
Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much as just give him their attention
You all have your own reasons for being here
lost a son and intend to kill the man who killed him
Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel
But  don't consider that man's life adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won't keep the sons of other men from dying
Gabriel nods, approvingly
Cornwallis has to move north
We have to keep him right here
If he's south of the Chesapeake when the French arrive, if the French arrive, we have a chance of winning this war
Marion looks from face to face
Eat, get some rest, we move out in two hours
Marion heads back to his campsite, passing Gabriel without looking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him
-  - massive British army field encampment
Thousands of well-armed, veteran troops
Large detachments of Redcoats march through endless rows of tents
Some are battle- worn, others are fresh troops moving out
and his  , covered with dirt and sweat, ride into the encampment
Tarleton and Wilkins peel off, riding to the front of a farmhouse that has been commandeered for British headquarters
They dismount and stride in
'  -   - British officers, clerks and aides work
They're in good spirits
, a proud man, comfortable with command, coldly notes one of his officers slapping another on the back
rolls out a map for Cornwallis
Gentlemen
The officers gather around the map
Major, this is not an adequate map
We have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from Charleston
useful place for our maps
'm sorry, sir, it won't happen again
Tarleton enters, followed by Wilkins
My harrier
Join us, Colonel
Sir
Tarleton and Wilkins join them around the map
Gentlemen, celebration is premature
We have a difficult campaign ahead of us
We are in predominately hostile country and we cannot rely on forage
As we move north, the bulk of our supplies will reach us by sea, through Charleston, which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line, one that can only be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown
' (multiple) Yes, sir
Cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particular attention to Tarleton
Nonetheless, we must remember that this is a civil war
Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis' look
These colonials are our brethren and when this conflict is over, we will be reestablishing commerce with them
Surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults on civilians will cease
Wilkins shifts uneasily
Tarleton isn't cowed
expect this war to be fought in a vigorous but civilized manner
Cornwallis looks at his other officers
Have  made myself clear, gentlemen
(multiple) Yes, sir
Cornwallis shifts his eyes back to Tarleton who was not among those who spoke
Tarleton pointedly pauses a moment, then says: Yes, sir
Cornwallis turns his attention back to the map
His men gather around
'   -  - Tarleton and Wilkins walk out and mount up
believe he was speaking to us, Colonel
Did you know that Lord Cornwallis' father was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather
Tarleton jerks his reins and rides off
Wilkins laughs and follows
- British supply train of several dozen wagons, a herd of horses and accompanying Redcoats makes its way
, Gabriel lies on the ground, observing the convoy
He eases back, mounts up, and rides off
-   - Marion and his men wait, well-hidden in the brush on a rise, just above the bridge
Gabriel rides up
Less than a mile
Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear
Flanking riders

Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word
Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father
- The British convoy rounds the curve
When two-thirds of the wagons have crossed the bridge, Marion , killing the Redcoat of highest rank, a

With half of his men  , Marion and the other half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and wounded

The Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes reloading, then coldly ,   helpless Redcoat
Marion, Gabriel and Rev
Oliver see Dalton kill the wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British musketballs   all around them

As Marion's men get the wagons turned and unblocked from each other, they   , one after another
Brother Joseph, Abner and the rest of the rearguard make it to Marion and
snaps the reins and they  , away from the and the  Redcoats
'  - Marion's men tend their wounded and look through the British wagons, taking inventory
two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping
We have enough arms for an army
Now all we need is an army
Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with   and , a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen
They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans
Reamer, boring tool
Swage, broach, etching tool
rolling gunsmith's shop
We can rifle those musket barrels
Get another hundred yards out of 'em
We'll need a forge
Easy enough
We've got clay to make a chamber
Oak to make charcoal
Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows
And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows
Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look
(to Fielding) That's why he's a colonel
Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work
Marion hears a and strides over to find Billings cowering before who stand guard at one of the wagons
Shoot them
Shoot the damn things
Dalton prepares to do so
Put that pistol down
They followed us from the bridge
They won't let anyone near the wagon
Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the dogs
Stay
stay
stay
The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his throat
Don't you growl at me
The dogs decide to obey
Marion lets them sniff his hand, then firmly pats them
Now let's see what's in this wagon
Rev
Oliver and Abner join him
Billings eases past the dogs
Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with bottles
Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, Port
No wonder they were guarding it
Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands
Rev
Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers
My heavens, personal correspondence of
Lord Cornwallis
Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching cases on nearby wagons
These four wagons must be his
And the dogs, too, 'll wager
say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding
His journals, letters, maps, books
Abner calls from another wagon
Colonel, we got a wagon full of officer's uniforms and more powder and muskets here
Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read
'  - Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis' field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil paintings and an elaborate folding commode
The sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily
The men have divided themselves into two groups, one coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a separate fire
The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and , a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew
The civilized men, including Rev
Oliver, Gabriel, Scott, Fielding and Abner, talk quietly
Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the campfire where the rougher men are gathered
He stands just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all can hear: Today was hard earned but a good start
Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as well
In the future wounded British soldiers will be given quarters
Like they gave quarter to my family
My wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came
The Redcoats locked the door and torched the house
You have my sympathy
but the order stands
And who are you to give an order like that
We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness
That hits home but Marion remains calm
'm your commanding officer
This is militia, not regular army can't hold you here, but as long as you stay, you'll follow my orders
Marion looks from face to face
Most begrudgingly nod
That's enough for Marion
As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by Rev
Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other men, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear
Thank you
For what
For trying to impose some decency on that sort
Don't depend on my decency
'm one of that sort
Marion walks on
Rev
Oliver exchanges a look with Gabriel, then heads off
As Marion joins Gabriel and Billings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle
Am  one of that sort
You're the worst of that sort
You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name
Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long drink
He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally long drink
Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle
'm going to check the watch
He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and Billings at the campfire
He shouldn't make light
That Redcoat should not have been killed
He's not making light
Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look
You don't know him very well, do you
He's my father
Billings looks closely at Gabriel
know him well enough
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier
It was a harder time and a harder place than you know
Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire
'  - The men are beginning to stir, gathering around the campfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear from the stolen British wagons
Marion reads Cornwallis' journal
He looks up, stretches and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and Rev
Oliver cook
The dogs follow at a distance
Well
've just been inside the mind of a genius
Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than  could in a dozen lifetimes
Cheerful news to greet the morn
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically
But he has a weakness
They all turn to Marion
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant
His weakness is that he knows it
Father
Pride is his weakness
The men consider that
Personally, 'd prefer stupidity
Pride will do
:  Series of shots as follows: --      erupts from some thick underbrush, cutting down half of a squadron of Redcoats on the march
The surviving Redcoats   into the trees at unseen targets to little effect
-- Marion rides with about fifty men
--  British supply convoy makes its way through the woods
Suddenly, Marion's men appear, rising up from the ground as if by magic, having been camouflaged by leaves and brush
They   on the convoy escort, which holds for a moment, then flees
-- Marion rides with about seventy-five men
-- Cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously flings it across the room
-- Marion rides with about one hundred men
-- Snow's Island
Marion and his men do an inventory of a large haul of stolen British supply wagons
The booty includes dozens of   , some of which Marion's men  in celebration
-- Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men
-- Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the flaming supports of a    collapse into a river
--  seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking at the charred, now cooled, remains of the bridge
Cornwallis angrily mounts up and rides off
His contrite staff officers mount up and follow
-- Snow's Island
Marion sits with his muddy feet on Cornwallis' campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, with Cornwallis' Great Danes at his side
- Glittering lights shine from the Camden Inn, a grand structure in the center of town
line of   discharges well-dressed passengers, arriving for a ball
Ladies in their finery
Patrician husbands
Redcoat and Green Dragoon officers in magnificent dress uniforms
'   - Cornwallis, standing in front of a full-length mirror, is dressed by his  while Major Halbert, Colonel Huntington and Tarleton look on
Why am  here, Colonel Halbert
For the ball, sir
Cornwallis holds his temper
Why, after six weeks, are we still here to attend a ball
By now, we should be attending balls in North Carolina, not South Carolina
Our supply line, sir
Excellent guess, Major
The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the garment with deepest disdain
And what, praytell, is this
Uh
borrowed it from Colonel North
took it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs
It's a horse blanket
(to Major Halbert) First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked
Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come
Sir, they're not like regulars, we can't find them and we don't know when or where they're going to strike
How impolite
And who leads these clever, secretive fellows
We don't know, sir
He's called, the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others
Colonel, 'm a civilized man but 'm finding to difficult to remain civil
Secure my supply line
Yes, sir
Cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and strides out
Tarleton, amused, follows
- At the far end of town Marion, Gabriel, Billings, Dalton, Scott and several other men slip through the shadows into an alley
The lights from the ball shine from down the street and the   of a  drift to them through the night
- block-like building on the far edge of town
pair of stand guard
stagger out of a side-street,
The Redcoat guards look at the drunk Redcoats enviously
Hey, what you got there
The drunken Redcoats look up, bringing their faces into the light --
We got our own little party
To hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball
Give us a nip, here
Billings and Dalton walk over to the Redcoats guards
As the guards reach for the bottles, Billings  one of the guards back against the building
Dalton    and   into the second guard's belly and
Dalton shoves Billings out of the way, '
Billings is taken aback by the speed and ferocity of Dalton's attack
Marion and Scott duck into the shadows of the doorway, pull out hammer-less carving chisels and quickly and silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of the heavy door
Billings and Dalton take the posts of the guards while the other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight
Everything appears as it should
- Grand
Opulent
Cornwallis speaks with a small gathering of loyalist civilians, among whom is the spectacular
, who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormous expanse of bosom
At her side stands her toady of a husband,
No
The beasts took your dogs, as well
Fine animals, a gift from His Majesty
Dead now, for all  know
Is there no decency
Among the rebels
We know the answer to that
Yes, we have learned
/
- Marion and Scott shove their chisels through the door which falls away from the hinges
They all duck inside finding barrels and casks of gunpowder, boxes of weapons and hundreds of muskets
Gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of the weapons as Marion opens a cask and pours a trail of gunpowder across the floor
-   - Cornwallis, taking the night air with Mrs
Talbot, gazes at the moon, achieving the calculated effect
You seem far away
It's the weight of command and the lot of a widower -- memories, loneliness
(with a self- deprecating laugh) and long gazes at the moon
Mrs
Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located inches above her stunning cleavage
Oh, you poor man
as a erupts from the armory
British officers, including Major Halbert and Tarleton,   along with Mr
Talbot and other Loyalist civilians
Good God
Mr
Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at his wife, clinging to Cornwallis' arm
These rebels seem to lack fear as well as decency, eh, General
Cornwallis registers the insult, glances at the hapless Major Halbert, then turns to Tarleton
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels
Yes, sir
Tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony
- The village of Pembroke lies nestled in a valley, surrounded by tilled fields and small farms
- Forty of Marion's men water their horses
Marion, with the two Great Danes at his side, speaks with  , a middle-aged storekeeper with a marked limp
four baskets of apples, salt pork, sweet potatoes, jerky, hard tack, salt and powder
It's not much, but 'll get you more
We can't pay for this
'll give you what  can, when can
You pay me what you can
Green's daughter, , very attractive, around sixteen, joins them
Gabriel sees her and sidles over
Francis, you remember my daughter, Anne
Nice to see you again, Anne
Gabriel clears his throat
Anne looks at him coolly
know who you are, Gabriel Marion
The last time  saw you,  was nine and you put ink in my tea
uh
that wasn't me, it was Samuel
mean Nathan
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month
Uh
uh
He's sorry
Come
Green heads across the square where some townspeople are giving Marion's men provisions
Anne and Gabriel follow
Marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits
Billings, nearby, reads    that announces:  "Reward Offered:  For the capture or death of the rebel known as 'The Swamp Fox'"
He tears it down and walks over to Marion
and your terms of enlistment will be month-to-month
Every thirty days you can re-enlist or return to your families
, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to Marion
'm in
The others nod in agreement
Talk to Abner and Scott about provisions, powder and mounts
The recruits head off
Billings hands Marion the wanted poster which Marion glances at and crumbles up
Twenty men here, seventeen in New Brighton, a dozen along the Black River
We'll pass three hundred by week's end if this keeps up
Gabriel and several of Marion's men take supplies from Green, Anne, and some other townspeople
Gabriel looks at Anne
If 'd known you were going to look like this,  never would have put ink in your tea
You call that a compliment
It's a start
She gives him a bit of a smile
He checks out her teeth
They look nice
As white as can be
She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh
watch as Anne gives Gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again
Marion smiles at his son's flirtation
Billings smiles as well
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly
(softly) No, he takes after his mother
Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's words
the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth
she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine
her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know that
Billings nods
Gabriel's already a better man than  could ever hope to be
Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel, adopting a coarse, joking tone
What do you mean, old and ugly
You got me beat on both accounts
The hell  do
They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind
Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off
He says goodbye to Anne, then    , He  up, taking his place at his father's side
Marion doesn't turn to look at him, but he knows he's there
- patchwork of fields with a village visible in the distance
The  , 10 and 12, work a field, harvesting grain
Hearing the   ' , they stop and listen
Then they see a    rising over the ridge line
Growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to intersect the approaching sound
At the bottom of the hill they pass their father, , who watches his sons plant themselves on the side of the road, gazing in awe at: ,
They're an impressive sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the road
- Marion and forty of his men, including Gabriel, sit on their motionless horses in the middle of the road
There are a number of new faces among Marion's men, among them Ben Rollins
Gabriel is lost in thought
Gabriel
Are you asleep
We're low on salt
should go to Pembroke and get some
You got salt last week
Oh, right
(beat) Baking powder, we need baking powder
We've got plenty of baking powder
You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago
Gabriel sighs
They hear a  , then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only , commanded by a
The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop
Halt
Look alive, boys
The young Redcoat privates nervously Sergeant, this road is closed
Those wagons now belong to the Continental Army
Ready arms
By twos
Marion's surprised by the Sergeant's order
Sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die
Just leave the wagons and go
Steady, boys
Marion sighs and lets loose with a
The underbrush parts and more of Marion's men show themselves, at the outnumbered Redcoats
This is the King's highway and advise you and your men to make way
(to his men) Prepare to fire
Marion exchanges a look with Rev
Oliver who, like Marion, doesn't want to kill these men
Seeing no other option, Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a ,
moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well ,   , growing louder by the second, toward them from the road behind the British wagons
Then, the    , coming in fast on both flanks
It's a trap
The canvas sides of the British wagons are   and , armed with muskets, spill out
Marion's unmounted men run to their horses,  into their saddles
Then   appear, galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving through the trees without slacking their pace, ,
from the Redcoat infantry, several of Marion's men
Marion's men   from their  , most of their shots going awry
Behind the British wagons, a huge detachment of appears,  among them
spur their mounts, taking off down the road in the opposite direction
The     gallop out of the woods, , riding in hard pursuit
- Marion and his men  down the road
The much larger body of Green Dragoons  after them
- Marion and his men ride along a raised road that drops off into Black Swamp on either side
They     , reining back their horses in confusion as they see: heading straight toward them
from both directions, several more of Marion's men,  others
Marion's men   as best they can, caught in the and They remount, doubling-up with the wounded
sees an unaided wounded man , heaves him onto his horse, slaps it
Marion's men head off both sides of the road into the swamp, struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee- deep water
Marion on foot with four men, only three horses , aiming his pistol,  down on Marion
, killing the Dragoon
Marion's men mount, one motions to Marion
Marion's men ride off, leaving him
a Dragoon is almost on him,
Marion, his weapon spent, sees a thick branch on the ground, two feet long
grabs it
The sword flashes and
Marion , brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and Marion rides down the embankment
The Dragoons rein back, slowed by the dead horses and men
They spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and follow Marion and his men into the swamp
- , galloping along a circuitous, barely visible dry trail
, Tarleton and Green Dragoons follow
- to a dozen of his men, including Gabriel and Billings
Several of the men are badly wounded, barely clinging to their saddles
They ride through the shallow water, get to a fork, As they disappear into the swamp, the sounds of their horses are swallowed up in the and the
moment later, Tarleton and the vanguard of Dragoons ride up
Tarleton signals stop at the fork
Looks
nothing
Listens
nothing
Chooses a path, the one Marion took
Rides off, the Dragoons following
- Darker still
Tarleton and his men come to a dead end, blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn bushes
They rein back their horses, stopping in a confused mess
Tarleton calls to Gaskins and the Loyalist scouts
Which way
This way
no this
think
Tarleton makes his own choice
rides off
the Green Dragoons follow, the Loyalists bring up the rear
- Tarleton and his mounted Dragoons struggle through a nearly impassable morass of swamp-grass, reeds and swarming mosquitoes
The exhausted Dragoons are wet, covered with mud, and bleeding from swamp briars
The horses are spent and foaming
Tarleton struggles harder than any, but finally even he has had enough
He reins back his horse
Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant- choked water and swamp
Enough of this
There are other ways to run down a fox
Tarleton yanks on his reins, turns his horse and starts back the way they came
His grateful men turn their horses and follow
, Marion, Gabriel, Billings and three badly wounded men, with only four horses between them, calm their mounts
They can hear, but not see the Dragoons
Then, through the thick undergrowth, Gabriel, tending the wounded men, sees his father lock his eyes on Tarleton
Marion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets he made from Thomas' lead soldiers
Walking to his horse, Marion loads
Marion mounts, scanning the terrain, planning a route
Father, no
As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel grabs the bridle
He  , stopping Marion's horse dead
, nearly throwing Marion
That's him
Tarleton
which tries to respond but is by Gabriel
Marion angrily turns on his son
Damn you
Let go
Gabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his iron grip on the bridles but speaking softly, almost pleadingly: Father, please
Marion looks down at Gabriel
Then Marion looks over at Billings and the three wounded men
One bleeds from an ugly neck wound
their shared mounts are nearly spent
Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing Tarleton
Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded
Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then joins him with the wounded
- Dark
Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock
Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past wary sentries
, dismounts and reports to Marion, out of earshot of the other men
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured
should have killed him when  had the chance
When was that
In the swamp at the expense of your men
Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family
No
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause
Marion is silent
There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself
(beat) Stay the course
The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings a thin smile to Marion's face
Stay the course
your mother used to say that to me when 'd get drunk or lose my temper
She'd say it to me when  picked on Thomas or Nathan
You learned her lessons better than She got me at a more impressionable age
Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded
'  - cold, winter rain falls
Most of Marion's grim men are huddled in lean-to's and around campfires
Green and several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of supplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow the provisions
Gabriel and Anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean- to, taking quietly
He's troubled
She tries to be hopeful
Next time we'll bring more blankets
That would be nice
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow
That would be nice, too
She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of tea
Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come
He nods and takes a drink of the tea
She smiles
Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink- stained, black teeth
Before she has time to laugh
Marion hurries over, accompanied by the Great Danes
The other men gather around
They're to be hung
But they're prisoners-of-war
Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel
He is, however, taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth
Gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth
Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news
- sees a lone figure on horseback ride out of distant woods
It's Rev
Oliver, carrying a white flag with one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other
The sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch
Sir
'  -   - temporary  has been set up in a commandeered farmhouse
Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor measures him and marks alterations on a partially completed uniform
Tarleton enters
General, a message from the commander of the rebel militia
Cornwallis reads the message
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley
Are you going to meet with him
Most certainly
Arrange it
- Marion rides, trailed by Cornwallis' Great Danes
Behind him, two dozen heavily armed Patriots, including Rev
Oliver who carries a white flag
detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert, waits
The Redcoats fall in on either side
They ride on
- Redcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoats and open the gates
Billings and the other Patriots stop, a hundred yards outside the barricades
alone rides through the gates, flanked by the British cavalry, the Great Danes following closely behind
'  - Major Halbert ushers Marion in
The Great Danes follow sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently
Thank you
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but  must warn you that
(interrupting) 'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley
Yes, quite, but you should know that
That will be all, Major
'll wait for Lord Cornwallis
(coldly) Yes
you will wait
Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out
One other thing
Major Halbert stops
The proper form of address to a superior officer, even one of an opposing army, is "Yes, sir
" Major Halbert sneers and strides from the room ,    , allows himself a fleeting smile
Then he looks around the room
He notes a rocking chair
Curious, he hefts it
Too heavy
He puts it down, sits and rocks
The dogs walk over and lay at his feet
'  -  () Marion patiently sits rocking
One of the dogs has its head in his lap and Marion scratches it behind the ears
: '  - stone-faced Marion stands in the center of the room, playing with the dogs
One of the dogs jumps up, putting its front legs on Marion's shoulders, and licks his face
Just then, Cornwallis walks in, overjoyed to see his dogs
Jupiter
Mars
The dogs just look at Cornwallis
He holds out his arms, waiting for them to rush to him
They look up at Marion who nods to them
Go
The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly but not enthusiastic manner
Cornwallis pats them vigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joy the dogs are showing at their reunion
My boys
my boys
you seem to have been well fed
Thank you for that, Colonel
My pleasure, sir
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting
Apology accepted
Thank you, Colonel
'm afraid don't know your name
Colonel will do
As you wish
with four Dragoons, all armed
Marion freezes
Marion and Tarleton lock eyes
Marion searches for some sign that Tarleton recognizes him
There's none
Colonel
Colonel Banastre Tarleton
Tarleton nods
Colonel
Marion, like ice, looks Tarleton up and down
Then he slowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons, two on either side of Tarleton
Marion measures the odds and finds them wanting
With a supreme effort of will, Marion forces himself to turn from Tarleton to Cornwallis and the matter at hand
Shall we proceed
Let us
Unless you object,  would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices
Perhaps  could explain them to you
'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled
Oh
served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War
Oh
Very well, then
Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status
Cornwallis is surprised
He exchanges a look with Tarleton
You are familiar with how these things are done
In fact,  would like to claim aggrieved status
Very well, proceed, sir
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which  would like to have returned to me
will do so as soon as possible
Cornwallis is surprised
Thank you
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner
Apology accepted
Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable
That one is a bit more difficult
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other
There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children
That is a separate issue
consider them linked
beg to differ
One is a command decision on your part
The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances
As long as your soldiers attack civilians,  will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement
(beat) And my men are excellent marksmen
Cornwallis sighs
Very well, let us move on to
Prisoner exchange
Sir
You have eighteen of my men
want them back
do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but  hold no prisoners-of-war
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men
What officers
Marion steps to the window, checks the view
wooded hillside is visible in the distance
Marion reaches into his jacket
The Dragoons move on him
Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he hands to Cornwallis
In the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark pines
Cornwallis looks through the spyglass
Though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering haze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat officers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their heads
turns coldly to Marion
Their names, ranks and posts
They refused to give me their names
Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow
Their posts
We picked them up here-and-there last night
Cornwallis glares at Marion
You are not a gentleman
Marion can't help but laugh at the insult
If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman,  take that as a compliment
(coldly) Get my men
Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington
Arrange the exchange
Colonel Huntington leaves to do so
Thank you, General
'm sure your officers will thank you, as well
Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute
He walks up to him and looks him in the eye
You don't remember me, do you
Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but unable to place him
then Tarleton remembers
Ah, yes, that boy
Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare
Ugly business, doing one's duty
Yes, ugly business
Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very softly, very slowly, very clearly
If you are alive when this war is over, 'm going to kill you
Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says
Tarleton tries to cover his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by Marion's icy words
Marion turns and walks out
The two Great Danes start to follow, but Cornwallis   : Jupiter
Mars
, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn back
The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis' side
-   - Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting
His eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and directed to waiting horses
Surprised to be freed, they mount up
step out onto the front porch of Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men ride toward the gate
, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side
Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to They do so and Marion and his men, without hurrying, ride out
Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion, without turning around, lets loose with a , making it through the gates just as they're closing
, seeing his dogs run after Marion, , then turns and storms back into his quarters
, still off-balance from Marion's parting statement, watches Marion ride away
Then he turns to Major Wilkins who stands nearby
Take a detachment and go get our officers
Wilkins hurries off
-    - Major Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that Cornwallis saw through the spyglass
As the Dragoons ride out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeing that: " " are not real -- they're nothing more than
There's no sign of Marion or his men
'  -   - :  One of the "Redcoat Officers," stuffed with straw is thrown onto Cornwallis' desk by Tarleton
Cornwallis looks at the scarecrow, then turns to Tarleton
This fox believes himself clever
We shall see
- Tarleton and Wilkins wait while Green Dragoons and Loyalists search the remains of Marion's house and barn
Gaskins, filthy from the ashes, walks up to Tarleton
Nothing
No one's been here for months
But now we have a name for our Colonel
Francis Marion
And with a name will come a family
'  - thick ground fog surrounds Charlotte's house
The soft lights of candles glow in the windows
All appears peaceful
Then, the   of appear out of the mist, silently approaching the house on foot
'  - fire crackles in the fireplace
curtain blows in the open window
Green Dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished
No sign of occupants
barks a command: The Dragoons
Tarleton and Wilkins stride in, watching the search
the parlor
nothing
The kitchen
food is cooking
The dining room
the table is set, half-eaten food is on the plates, abandoned in mid-meal , touches some of the food, gauging its warmth
They can't be far
Check the outbuildings and the woods
The Dragoons race outside
'  - dozen Dragoons light torches off of it and fan out to search
The thick fog turns the torches into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions
, carried by a particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of the underbrush closest to the house
As the torch moves, its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the underbrush
The   to reveal, in the brush,  , , dark, motionless, watching the search
Behind them, '  , Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan
Around them,    ' , including , weapons ready
The moving lights play on their faces
, the torches converge, illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order
The torches fan out and begin     , grips Charlotte's arm
Gabriel motions and they all ease back, disappearing into the brush
- compound of rude shacks, built of scraps of lumber and rough-hewn logs, stands on the side of the Magpie River
Marion's men wait with the children while Abner, Charlotte and Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion's middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence, talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot, is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen particularly troubled
Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty town
- ends with a guarded exchange of handshakes
Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaron and Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men
It's all set
They follow Aaron, down an alley to
Small
Barely standing
The children stop in their tracks, knowing this is to be their new home
Charlotte sees their hesitation
She walks up to the little structure, examining it with a critical eye
She looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor, wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude, chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall
She smiles
This will do fine
She turns to Aaron and Abigail
Thank you
Charlotte walks inside without looking back
The children hesitate, then follow her inside
-   - The children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out of armloads of hay
, Charlotte and Gabriel talk quietly
So he's the one they talk about, the Swamp Fox
Yes
thought it might be him, the bits and pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows the swamps
They won't stop looking for you and the children
We'll be alright, here, for now
(beat) How is he
Gabriel searches for an honest answer
don't know
'm his son
Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte
These are for you and the children
They sense someone behind them
Why didn't father come
Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his heretofore silent sister
Charlotte nods, smiling
Speaking for months now
Why didn't he come
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men
He left us
know he did and he's sorry
He'll come back as soon as he can
Susan says nothing
Gabriel continues, hopefully
There are some letters here from him
Some are just to you
don't care
hate him
You don't hate him
Yes,  do
hate him and  hope he never comes back
Gabriel kneels down and embraces her
She stands coldly with her arms at her sides
'  - An astonished Marion talks to Gabriel
She spoke
Susan spoke
Full sentences
As if she had been speaking all along
don't believe it
and  wasn't there for it
The cloud passes quickly
Tell me everything she said, word for word
Gabriel hesitates
She said
she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her
She said that
Oh, my Lord, she said that
Gabriel nods
Isn't that something
Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself
Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject
Father, there's something else need to talk to you about
What
Come with me
'll tell you when we get there
Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel
- Dark
The village square is deserted
Marion follows Gabriel into the shadow of the village church
They dismount, tie up their horses and enter the back door of the church
-   - Marion walks in and stops dead
At the altar of the small sanctuary, --  stand with Rev
Oliver
At the center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green, flanked by her parents
Father, 'm looking for a best man
Marion is stunned but recovers quickly
'd be honored
They share a moment, then head down the aisle
Marion greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and bowing to her mother
Abner, at the door, nods that the coast is clear
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony
feels every word, looking straight ahead but knowing that he's standing next to his son
- In the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say goodbye to the wedding party
Anne talks quietly with her parents
Marion and Gabriel talk nearby
Sir, 'd like to request a furlough
Two days
Granted
Where are you going
Cheraw Falls
It's beautiful there
Your mother and  were there once, before you were born
know
They're silent for a moment
She would have been pleased
Gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily checking his pack ropes
Anne joins them
Marion embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss
'm sorry we didn't give you more warning
It's alright
'm very happy for you
He helps her mount up
Abner, on guard near the road, motions them on
They all watch as Gabriel and Anne ride off
- Marion, Rev
Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road
It's a beautiful, moonlit night
Marion breaks the silence, speaking as much for himself as the others
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part
Marion nods
They ride on
- British packet, a small, fast warship, lies anchored just offshore
rowboat, manned by half-a-dozen sailors, carrying a Redcoat Lieutenant, beaches
Several Redcoats wait
The Lieutenant, carrying a dispatch case, jumps out off the boat, mounts a waiting horse and rides off
- Cornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him, sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch rider waits
They're on a hillside, looking over the burned-out remains of a small British fort as some Redcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine
Cornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards from the other officers and speak, out of earshot
From General Clinton in New York
(reading) "
your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem
" (aside) He underlined, 'militia'
(reading) "You have spent over six months dealing with a six-week problem
It is essential that you quell the militia
" (aside) Underlined again
(reading) "
insurgency, particularly because of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable arrival of the French
Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long
" Tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show
(reading) "
it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your Parliamentary and Court patrons
Only then might you share in the victory, on the verge of which  now stand
" (beat) "Your guardedly respectful Commander, General Sir George Clinton
" Cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton
If  fail, you fail
Perhaps
And if  triumph, you triumph
Probably
How can we end this madness
Difficult, sir
This is, as you pointed out, a civil war
Cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply
Civility is a secondary virtue
It is superseded by duty
understand, sir
Tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and rides off
- Tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly picking at the petals of some wildflowers pierces the calm
Tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream, then rises, passing several Green Dragoons who wait with their horses in front of the farmhouse
believe they are almost ready
Blood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpses lie in a jumbles mass on the floor
In the parlor, Tarleton walks past more bodies, including a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under eight-years-old
In the kitchen, Tarleton finds Wilkins, some Green Dragoons, and Gaskins, the Loyalist Militia commander and some of his low-life men
Rob Fielding, one of the craftsmen in Marion's force, is tied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terrible effects of
Wilkins and Gaskins are nervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room
'm sorry, sir
He died
Tarleton sighs, irritated
Very well, get one of the others
Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached woodshed where Billings sits, bound
They roughly grab him and drag him into the kitchen
Damn your eyes
Do your worst
intend to
They tie Billings to the table
- Silence
tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in the floor, disappearing into a gap between two floorboards
Marion, Dalton, Rev
Oliver, and several other men walk slowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence
Marion sees the body of the mother, draped over her two young children
Marion turns to Rev
Oliver who can only stare, offering no solace
They pass Fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and see , , still tied to the table
Marion reels
- Marion's men dig graves
Marion watches
Dalton steps up next to him
You still want me to give wounded Redcoats quarter
Marion doesn't answer
Gabriel  up
He reins back his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it
regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well
Where
Seven homes along the Black River so far
Rollins doesn't pause
He rushes to his horse, mounts up and rides off
Marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him
- Marion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on with him
'  - The small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where the two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catch a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade
The house smolders
No sign of life
Gabriel, Abner and a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared area around the house
Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next to an increasingly frantic, Rollins
They see Gabriel wave, signaling all clear
,       to the house
Rollins is the first to see
Horrified, he reins back and dismounts, almost falling
His  , , an   and , lie dead in the dirt
Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony
Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner, as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer
Marion and Rev
Oliver dismount and move toward him
Rollins sees them coming
He hardens and strides to his horse, pulling his   from his saddle holster
Rev
Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins
It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and
, Every man freezes in place
For a long moment no one moves, no one speaks
Then Marion pulls himself together and addresses the men: Five day furlough for all men
Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the word
We'll reform at Acworth
Any man who doesn't come back won't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause
Attend to your families
The men mount up
Marion and Gabriel ride off together
- Marion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up
The three of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, some heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty mounts
-   - Dark
Quiet
Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while Marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks slowly toward the shack
He warily checks every shadow
No one anywhere
Then a --    , immediately followed by: (
) It's him
told you it was him
'       to Marion
He's practically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel and William fling themselves into his arms
Father
Papa
, watching the reunion as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go
over the heads of the children
Thank you
Charlotte smiles
Then Marion notices  peeking out from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt
He kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't move
He smiles to her and speaks softly: Susan
She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her
Marion looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance
Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children
- Marion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne up a steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded hillside
- The remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm
The house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole
Nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which has fallen to the ground through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the structure
Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing nearby, startling him
He looks back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative reaction
Margaret smiles and turns to the other children, speaking for Marion's benefit
told you, things would get better
The children smile and dismount
- The ceiling drips
Marion lies, awake, with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of the few dry spots
They're covered with tattered quilts
On the other side of the children, Charlotte is also awake
She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in the darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children
- Marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan and Samuel
They listen carefully
The overlook, up there should be where you post the watch
Work out a schedule
Short watches, especially at night
(pointing) If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms
(motioning for them to follow) Now let's find someplace to cache extra weapons
They follow Marion like soldiers
- Marion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair
She takes her time, touching him on the head and shoulders, extending the process
Marion, sits back, enjoying it
He notices Susan, nearby, watching silently
He smiles
She turns away
-   - Dark
Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the roof
Marion, standing in the shadows, senses someone coming
He freezes
figure rounds the corner
It's
William William   , then chases his father around the corner, tagging him
They laugh
Marion covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide
-  - Marion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids looking at him
Using the knife we've seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them
Good apple
No response
Very good
Sweet
He cuts a slice and offers it to her
She doesn't take it
He puts the slice between them
After a long moment she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops, seeing something on it
She puts it back
Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it
He looks at his knife and realizes that it's dried blood
Off-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead, a thousand miles from Marion
- Marion washes the knife carefully, almost obsessively
Anne steps up behind him
May  ask you a question
Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without explanation
Yes, of course
She speaks with a sly, withheld smile
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl
No
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy
No
Good
Anne smiles and walks away
Marion figures out what she just told him
When
Late summer
Congratulations
Thank you
Marion laughs at the thought
- Marion's children swim and play with the two Great Danes in the pond at the base of the falls, along with Gabriel and Anne
Marion and Charlotte sit on the bank, watching them
Charlotte turns and looks at Marion for a long moment
He's unaware
As Charlotte looks at him, her smile disappears, replaced by anger
She snaps at Marion
'm not my sister
Startled, Marion turns to Charlotte
Excuse me
said, 'm not my sister
know that
Do you
Of course,  do
(irritated) Very well, then
She turns from him
Marion, tries to figure out what just happened
After a long moment he gets it
Stunned at first, his gears turn
After a very thoughtful moment he turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile
She rolls her eyes
- Dark
full moon shines
- Marion wakes
He looks across his sleeping children and sees that Charlotte isn't in her place on the other side of them
He rises and walks out into the night
-   - Marion walks into the glen
He tenses, sensing someone in front of him
Then he sees Neither one speaks
They walk silently to each other
They stop, looking at each other closely, as if seeing one another for the first time
Only then do they kiss
The kiss grows more passionate
then much more passionate
- Marion finishes tying his gear onto his horse
The children are silent
He stands beside his horse
One after another, the children walk to him and embrace him -- Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William
He sees Susan, standing next to Charlotte
He motions to her but she doesn't move
Then he kneels down and gently hugs her
Just a little goodbye
One word
That's all  want to hear
Susan remains silent, standing with her arms at her sides, not responding to the embrace
Finally, Marion lets go of her
She just stares at him
Marion stands and turns to Charlotte
Goodbye, Charlotte
Goodbye
They embrace
Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell a different story
Only Anne and Margaret notice, but to them it's as clear as a bell
They exchange a knowing look
Marion and Charlotte break apart, self-consciously
Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away
As they're about to round a curve and disappear, : Papa
With halting steps, then faster and faster, she runs down the path toward Marion
Papa, don't go, 'll say anything
Marion stops, turning in his saddle to see Susan running after him, her eyes filled with tears
Please, Papa, 'll say anything you want
Marion yanks his reins, turning his horse
Just tell me what to say
Tell me what to say
Marion spurs his horse straight toward her, toward the running, crying child
Please, Papa, please don't go
Charlotte, Anne and Marion's children watch as: without slowing down
She sits astride the saddle, facing him, her arms wrapped around him, pleading, the words tumbling from her, as fast as she can get them out
'll talk to you, 'll say anything you want, just tell me what you want me to say, 'll say anything,  promise, please, Papa, just stay
Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her, letting her cry, fighting his own tears
He reins back the horse, stopping in front of the others
He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the horse
to take Susan
Marion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face with kisses
'll come back
promise
Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte
Marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and spurs his horse
As he rides away the children take off after him, running
Susan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well
Marion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster, leaving a trail of dust
The children slow, then stop, one after another, watching as they ride away
-  - Grim
The most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen
Rain pours
Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial protection from the cold rain
Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire going
Rev
Oliver tries to cook
Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount
Marion joins Rev
Oliver
How many came back
About a hundred and twenty
Less than a third
Marion nods
He and Gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean-to's
- The rain has stopped
The ground is still wet
It's spring
The first buds are on the maple trees
fox tentatively comes out of its winter den, followed by a pair of pups
Marion stands on the side of a river, looking up at a chevron of Canadian geese flying north
- The Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of packhorses
mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock
Suddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see -
She's initially frightened but the , speaks politely
Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been requested to gather at the church
Everyone
Colonel Tarleton wants to address, the whole village
The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to follow him and his men
She sees several other townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down the street
She follows along
- Tarleton and Wilkins, on horseback, watch as a large, mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry directs the villagers into the church
One of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a bowl of gumdrops
As he starts giving them to a few of the children their parents waver, unsure of the gesture, but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy
The townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of the Redcoats who, though carry muskets, are polite and unthreatening
Into the church, please
Colonel Tarleton wishes to address all of you
Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the church
He nods to the Redcoats near the door
The Redcoats   , chaining them shut
The from the inside
Open this door
By what right are we made prisoners
who, along with several rough- looking  , disappear into the blacksmith shop
They reappear a moment later with and approach the church
Several Redcoats see what's about to happen and are appalled
Even some of the Green Dragoons, including Wilkins, are troubled
Wilkins rides over to Tarleton
Sir
Yes, Major
Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church, torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from Tarleton
The    from inside the church grows louder
Sir, there is no honor in this
The honor is found in the end, not the means
This will be forgotten
(to Gaskins) Proceed
The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers
The Redcoat officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself
Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress
Finally, Wilkins accepts it
Weakly steadying his horse, he takes his place next to Tarleton
The Redcoats and Dragoons follow his lead and watch as Gaskins and the Loyalist Militiamen light the church on fire, heaving their torches onto the roof, through the windows and under the raised foundation
are heard from inside
The   with the shoulders of men trying to escape
The
As the  , another group of Loyalist Militiamen and some Redcoats drag half-a-dozen young women out of a side-street
Among the women, desperately pleading, kicking and screaming, is
The men drag her and the other women into the livery stable
Tarleton watches them carried off, stone-faced
Then he turns and watches the church go up in
, with a chair heaved from inside
, but waiting Redcoats , driving the others back
The      grow louder
The
-   - dark forest of old growth trees
No underbrush
Marion and a couple dozen of his men, including Gabriel, Rev
Oliver, and Dalton ride warily on a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke, visible over the treetops in the distance
With hand signals, Marion directs his men to fan out
They do so, weaving through the dark forest, weapons ready
- Marion and his men slowly ride into Pembroke
The remains of the church smolder only slightly
The town is deserted, no one, dead or alive, is visible
Unsure what they have found, Marion and his men spread out and dismount, warily checking out the buildings, looking for some sign of life
Rev
Oliver and a few other men head for the charred remains of the church
Side-stepping some still-hot, charred beams, Rev
Oliver looks through the rubble
Then he sees the bodies
of
Dozens of charred, blackened bodies, intertwined with the remains of the church
Rev
Oliver staggers from the rubble
The other men see what he has seen
One-by-one Marion and his men walk over and look into the remains of the church
Marion see several charred hands extended through a shattered window, as if grasping for escape
one of the hands is tiny,  '
Marion is stunned
No one says a word
Dalton and a few of the other men continue the search, weapons ready
They step into the livery stable, then walk out a moment later, ashen faced
Dalton speaks quietly to Marion, motioning toward an increasingly frantic Gabriel who has just found Anne's packhorses
Gabriel notices the gesture, he watches Marion walk into the livery stable
Growing more nervous by the second, Gabriel hurries after his father
Anne
As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable, Marion walks out and intercepts him
Don't go in there
Is it her
Is Anne in there
She is
Don't go in there
Gabriel understands
he reels
growing faint
Marion grabs him
keeping him from falling
Marion holds Gabriel who begins to weep
- Marion's men, led by Rev
Oliver, tend to the dead
Some dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the church
Others carry out the grim task of pulling the charred bodies out of the rubble
Marion sits alone
Gabriel walks up behind him
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness
You know what happened
No,  don't
Everyone knows
It's what made me a hero
Me, Harry Lee, all of us got a medal
Men bought me drinks
They still do sometimes
Everyone knows what happened
Tell me what everyone doesn't know
And what do they know
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation
That's right
That's not enough
Tell me
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born
was drunk and  was foolish enough to answer her
Marion shakes his head to himself
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas
It took me that long to regain her respect
'm not my mother
can't have the respect without the knowing
Marion's quiet for a moment
Then he speaks: It was in '63
It was a bad time
The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge
All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it
We were sent in relief
Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us
We already had something of a reputation for being
harsh
When we got there the fort was abandoned
Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere
They had left a week earlier
What we found was
bad
Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad
They had left the settlers there
The men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes
Marion's silent for a moment
We buried them, then we went to track
It was a cold trail and they were moving fast
We went faster
We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford
Go on
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort
It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two
We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon
(beat) The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee
(beat) The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight
(beat) That seemed to make a difference
The war went another year, things went better
and men bought us drinks
Gabriel is silent
Marion looks at him closely
It was a different time, son
And you're a better man than that
see, do as  say, not as  do
Yes
They hear
Abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church, not having seen the results of the massacre
Excited, he dismounts
'
, ' Marion and Gabriel just look at him
Abner is confused by their reaction
Then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies
- Mixed gatherings of Marion's militia and Continentals are clustered around the campfires, with more Continentals arriving all the time
Some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired, talking quietly
couple of Patriots play a Marion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen
Gabriel walks to Marion's gear
Finding Marion's weapon's belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint-flecked     ' As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind him
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well
Stay the course
As you did at Fort Wilderness
Before Marion can answer they see He dismounts, excited, voluble
He strides over, pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's mood
Look at you
knew you could do it
Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull
We have a chance
Better than a chance
Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at Yorktown
wish  could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships floating there
And Washington should be a day or two behind him
(beat) And on top of everything,  have a son
Born last month in Alexandria
Gabriel rises and walks away
Lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel
He turns to Marion
His wife was killed yesterday
She was with child
'm sorry,  didn't know
Marion nods
They stand in silence
Lee hands Marion the bottle
He takes a drink
- Dark
Quiet
Sentries are on duty
Marion's tent glows from a single candle
He blows the candle out, then steps out of the tent into the night
He begins his nightly walk of the perimeter
Almost immediately, Marion notices something amiss
Dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over to Marion
Marion and Dalton and several of the other men look down at some empty bedrolls
Gabriel and at least a dozen others
They must have left right after the watch change
That means they have two hours on us
Marion strides to his horse
The other men follow him
- Marion, Dalton and Rev
Oliver and two dozen other men ride
- Dark
Very quiet
moonless night
Marion and his men, on foot, make their way along the side of the river
Brother Joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to Marion
Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a quarter mile from here
Sentries at four points
Suddenly they hear the     ahead of them in the darkness
Marion takes off at a full run with his men right behind
- Marion and his men
Running toward the    , which grows louder with every step

The rest of Marion's men thunder into the Dragoons

Throws himself onto the ground next to him
Cradling him
Gabriel is stunned, confused by the wounds
'm alright,
He tries to stand
Let me help you
Gabriel weakens in Marion's arms

Marion watches the life drain from Gabriel
He tries to hold the blood in, to no avail
Dalton plants himself next to Marion, defending him and Gabriel
Marion caresses Gabriel and watches as
The life drains from Marion
No anger
Only pain
He looks at Gabriel, lost in a dream, an incomprehensible nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness
- Marion's men finish laying out the bodies of their dead
The Dragoons are still where they fell
The Patriots are laid out in a row, their faces covered by their coats
Marion sits on the battlefield, next to Gabriel's body
Dalton gingerly approaches him
Colonel
Marion slowly stands and picks up Gabriel's body, cradling him like a child
They head off into the brush
- More Continentals have arrived, now outnumbering Marion's men three-to-one
The encampment is active
few of the men drink and
The two men playing the fife and violin
'  - Dark
Shadowed
The sounds of celebration can be heard outside the tent
Marion sits on his camp chair
Gabriel lies on the ground carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket

Rev
Oliver enters the tent
May  help you try to find solace with the word of God
No response
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he
Yes, he does
Rev
Oliver pulls up a camp stool
He and Marion sit in silence

Most of the tents have been taken down
Wagons are rolling out
Companies of Continentals march off in good order

His men finish packing up, storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear onto their horses
Marion still sits
Gabriel's face has taken on a deathly, ashen look
Lee enters the tent
He's silent for a moment, then speaks softly to Marion
You have to bury him
No response
'll help you bury him
Lee moves toward Gabriel's body
Don't touch him
How many men have we seen die
Two
Gabriel and Thomas
They're gone
And there is nothing you or  can do to bring them back
But there is something you can do to help end all this
It is ended
No
It's not over yet
Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia
Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton
It will end, one way or another
(beat) Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice
Marion doesn't respond
Lee waits for a long moment, then he hears the He looks at Marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks out
- The last of the soldiers move out, leaving their smoldering campfires and refuse
The only tent that remains is Marion's
'  - Marion sits in his tent, gazing obliquely at Gabriel's body which has grown even more ashen in the distance
- dark, moonless night
The sky is filled with stars dead leaves along the ground
few of the leaves are blown through the opening of Marion's tent
Marion looks down, noticing the leaves,
He listens for a moment
Then he stands and walks out of the tent
Marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground
He listens to the wind
The
The stars are bright
His eyes are drawn to the Big Dipper and from there to the Little Dipper and the
Holding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he gradually reorients himself
He looks around at the abandoned encampment
Then he looks into the tent and sees Gabriel's body
The
Marion nods in response
-   - Marion finishes burying Gabriel, putting the last shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth
He stands next to the grave, looking down, and says a silent prayer
- The   are on the move, all heading in the same direction
Continentals and militiamen fill the road
Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot
Among them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and Rev
Oliver
Behind them, a single horseman rides up
It's
Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee
They exchange nods
Marion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev
Oliver on the other
They pass a sign that reads, "Yorktown
20 miles
" - The road to Yorktown skirts an  with a view of the town and the harbor
few dozen arriving Patriots have stopped to look out at the view
Marion, Lee, Rev
Oliver and Dalton join them
The French Fleet is visible in the harbor
The British encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large island
In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula, the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible
It's a grand and impressive sight
Marion and the others turn their horses and head down the road toward the American lines
- Not a battle, but pre-battle pot shots
Behind the American embattlements, hundreds of American and French soldiers drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications
, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of the British defenses
, a boy about fifteen, dashes up to Marion
You called for me, sir
Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single which he hands to the boy
Take this to General Washington
The boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if he's joking or crazy
He's neither
The boy shrugs and runs off with the walnut
'  - Staff officers
Flags
Tents
French and American officers look over maps and sort out dispatches
Messengers, runners and dispatch riders come and go hurriedly
The flap of the central  tent opens and steps out, followed by a pair of
Washington is tall and powerfully-built, an imposing man, worthy of respect
He looks around and sees the awe-struck, slightly confused messenger boy, waiting nearby
Washington, holding the walnut in his hand, motions him over
Did you bring me this
Yes, sir
Washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to the boy
Take this to Colonel Marion
Yes, sir
The boy runs off
Washington smiles
- Marion walking through the chaos of the encampment
He walks to the cluster of tents around Washington's
He nods to the officer in charge
Colonel Francis Marion
Washington, leaning over the maps on his campaign table, hears the voice and turns around
The officers nearby stop and watch, curious
Step up to one another, looking each other in the eye
To the astonishment of Washington's officers, Marion reaches up and lifts off Washington's wig, looking at his hair underneath
Marion shakes his head
Gray
Earned
Washington holds out a small bag to Marion who reaches in and pulls out a walnut
Come
have something  want to show you
Washington turns to his staff officers
Gentlemen
Washington and Marion walk off with Washington's officers and aides
As Washington and Marion walk, they both , a prodigious display of strength that both men take for granted
They eat walnuts as they walk
- Washington's officers who include  , , ,  , and various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of the hill and wait for Washington and Marion who trail a bit behind them, talking privately, eating walnuts as they go
While they wait, the officers look out at the view, seeing the
Finish the walnuts
They stop for a moment to catch their breath
was sorry to hear about your son
lost another a year ago, Thomas
He was only fifteen
've had no sons to lose, nor daughters
(beat) lose the sons of other men
They look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men
Life was easier when we only had ourselves to get killed
They walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill
The officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at the British emplacements
Gentlemen, what do we see
Mortars, center, with two lines of enfilading trenches
More along the right flank and behind the forward redoubts
formidable defensive position
Very formidable
They could hold out for weeks
Washington nods and turns to Marion
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis
Remember Braddock
That bad
Worse
Proud, priggish and competent very bad combination in an adversary
Washington sighs
For those of you who don't know, we intercepted a British dispatch this morning
General Clinton has sailed from New York to relieve Cornwallis
That hits Washington's officers hard
How long before they arrive
Less than a week
Sixteen ships and over nine thousand Redcoats
Sooner or later that message will get through to Cornwallis
And when it does, he'll just wait us out
And when the British ships arrive, the French ships will flee
And when the French ships flee, General Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well
Marion speaks up
Then you must let the message go through
They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as if he's insane
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait
He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that
No, he won't
There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis
First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory
(beat) If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it
And what is the second thing
Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and leafs through it
'll let him tell you himself
(reading) "
but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome
Not worthy of my attention, but demanding it; not worthy of British blood, but taking it; and not worthy of a soldier's honor, but sullying it
Those nights of mine that are not sleepless, are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers
" Marion closes the journal
He has no respect for citizen soldiers
That's your bait
militia
Washington nods, considering it
'  -  - Under fire
Cornwallis and his staff
Major Halbert strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch
Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines
Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it
It staggers him
He sits down
Sir
Cornwallis fumes
His jaw sets with anger
He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury
Call a general staff meeting
Yes, sir
- - Marion stands at the American battlements, looking out at the British defensive works
Above him, stars are visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn glow from the horizon
Marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the , but in the increasingly harsh light of this day, he can't find it
He turns his eyes back to the battlefield
- The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards
Men move like ghosts
finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist
There is no overview, just separate detachments: An orderly regiment of  , mounted, waiting, steadying their horses
Two long lines of
An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners
And, finally,    , who stand in the middle of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long, valley-line depression
They stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass in front of them
They're all grim
They know what's coming
Then, the     , heard but unseen, coming from over the slope
Then,  , more and more, Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them
, Dalton, Scott, Rev
Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from other units
They quickly gather around
The British army believes in officers
believe in soldiers
After we engage, there will be no more orders
Every man here must know what 'm about to tell you
They listen closely
We are the bait in a trap
We're militia
Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers
And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him
Listen up
They gather around closer
- Cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the morning mist begins to burn off
Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines
He turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass
Do you see that, Colonel
Unless 'm dreaming,  think  see irregulars at their center
Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look
-  - Marion and his men wait
Soft, muted
The men turn their heads, listening, their eyes shifting
They hear the        , advancing
as they listen to an unseen army approaching
'  we see him hearing every sound and we see of what he knows he's hearing: The
Shouldered muskets  against pack buckles
at a stop
The men around Marion wait
,
appears over the rise in front of them
Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them
Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move
The

almost
The  explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev
Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion
All are frightened but all are motionless
Closer and closer, the British line approaches
The American's don't move
Then, the
At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets, then aim
Still, Marion and the Americans don't move
Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British lines
,  , three thousand British muskets fire simultaneously
just as the entire line of Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many others are torn apart by the British musketballs
it obscures everything
Each musket spits out a billow of think white smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of them just fired
The massive, opaque white cloud quickly spreads over the entire battlefield
The astonished Redcoats instantly reload
And watch as the Americans rise in   and Some Redcoats laugh
, , watches through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke obscures everything
He barks to his
Fix bayonets

The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the message

advances at a quickstep, bayonets fixed
From behind them,    appear, at a full gallop, Tarleton at their head
It's an astonishing sight
total madness
hell
a painting by Hieronymous Bosch
The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing Patriot militiamen
The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs
to the head of the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots
The cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter
Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise, a     , rock solid
It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through it like water
then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall
, , turns and joins the blue American line
flurry of orders, then the of musket fire that stops the disorderly British advance in its tracks
Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly
Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with them
The effect of the volley is devastating
' The American timing is perfect
Again, the amount of  is astonishing
visibility drops to less than twenty feet in most places
Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and there but it is primarily a battle of sound
Men simply follow the men in front of them
The Blue Continentals advance in an orderly manner from both flanks onto the Redcoats, trapping them
The Redcoats try to flee
Fighting small, gathered holding actions
one of his pistols
Draws his sword
Slashes downward
killing one Redcoat after another
No remorse, no hesitation, no pity
relentless, simple battle
Slashing through the Redcoat infantry
His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British musket and is pulled from his hands
Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol
,   , Marion freezes
his eyes locked on Tarleton who is fighting a pitched battle, making his way toward the perimeter of the field, trying to escape back to the British lines
Seeing nothing but Tarleton, Marion hurriedly tears open his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made from Thomas' lead soldiers
As he loads the pistol, his eyes still trained on Tarleton, Dalton runs up in the chaos
Marion finishes reloading
distracted he turns to Dalton for an instant
Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line, seeing
Scott, Rev
Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental line
He looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol
Then Marion looks to Rev
Oliver and the others
Dalton can't wait
he runs off
Marion wavers
Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots
sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed
Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats
As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, sees Marion and fights his way toward him
Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American line
Tarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path that takes him directly past Marion
Tarleton gets closer
raises his sword
slashes
Marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of his eye
Diverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount
Tarleton hits the ground
Marion draws his pistol, about to fire at Tarleton
Tarleton  , knocking the pistol from Marion's hand
Tarleton   ,    who dodges the blow
Tarleton advances
Marion scrambles back, then rises
Marion grabs a    and from Tarleton's
Then Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground
Marion makes his way toward the weapon
still from Tarleton's sword
Marion focuses on the pistol
leaving himself exposed
Tarleton sees the , about to deliver the killing blow
Marion dives Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive, watches Tarleton fall
Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle at hand
Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the which stiffens as Dalton and Rev
Oliver are joined by Marion and a dozen other Patriots
The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line
Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body, along with the place and the moment of his death, has disappeared into the smoke of the battle
Marion and his men fight on
then, Redcoats start fleeing the field
First one Redcoat at a time
then more and more
- The next day
Silence
The battlefield, as far as the eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men and scattered weapons
The British have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field
The Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their barricades
Then, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets
, no more than ten-years-old
Behind him, a single British officer
They boy begins to beat the drum
The officer raises a white flag
In the American lines, the men see the flag
Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them , simply take a deep breath
It's finally over
- massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield
Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance
The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification
At the head of the avenue,     stand waiting
musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, "The World Turned Upside Down," a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent
marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead, covering his agony as best he can
As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the South Carolina militia
, standing with Dalton, Rev
Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass
glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them
It's only a glance and he '   , who is just one man among the many
Cornwallis reaches Washington
They exchange unheard formal greetings
Cornwallis,
, American and French, in a
With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony between Washington and Cornwallis,  quietly and unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks away
- The surrender ceremony continues
Marion, on the fringe of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to leave
walks out of the crowd and joins him
They lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up
Goodbye, Francis
Goodbye, Harry
Marion reaches down
They shake hands
And congratulations on the birth of your son
Thank you
Maybe all of this will buy him some peace
hope so
As Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops, speaking back to Lee over his shoulder
Your son, what did you name him
Robert
Robert
Lee
Marion smiles
good name for a farmer
Lee nods
Marion rides off
- Marion's children and Charlotte sit by the river
Samuel sits on the lookout ledge with his musket
Suddenly he stands, looking out, seeing something
Charlotte and the others notice
They're worried
Then they see Samuel throw down his musket and tear down the path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining his feet
Charlotte and the others know who's coming
The children take off running after Samuel
Racing toward the road
Charlotte hurries after them
, riding at a full gallop
The children cry out with tears of joy
see Susan
He gallops toward her
Without slowing, he    into the saddle
She wraps herself around him
He reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other children reach him
They throw themselves into his arms
embracing him
Charlotte hurries up behind them
She and Marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs of his children
- Summer
The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with apples
Marion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable
The workshop is already completed
' , Nathan, Samuel, Margaret and William, play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two sits on the front porch,
walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan
He carries a just-completed rocking chair
The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue
He steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the rocking chair next to her
Two pounds, fourteen ounces
Lovely
He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's position
Then he sits down, settles back and begins rocking
Not a creak
Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard, calling as she joins the other children
Wait for me
As the   , Marion and Charlotte disappear beneath the overhang of the porch roof
Suddenly, the (
) Damnation
The      as Marion walks off the porch, crosses the yard and enters his workshop
