From out of the shadows comes            -- dog of war
Big, mangy, muscular, scary
As he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly choked with fallen structures
and signs of tumult
- as he comes onto a battlefield
The hellish scene is     -- as the Dog traverses a landscape of -- , frozen in contorted death poses
This was furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human  and nightmare , their corpses now in piles to the horizon
The Dog climbs a mound of casualties
At the top, the Dog looks back across the battlefield
The Dog's eyes are sad, his expression weary and disgusted
: - The entrance is patrolled by a dozen
They don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace wall and disappear inside
-   - Bloodied and battered, the King's  are disagreeing loudly about strategy
loud  sound pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to -- , a striking man in his prime, his handsome face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw
He commands the room -- Now we end the debate about tactics
and begin to plan for victory

The Dog stares at the King
Then slips away
-   - Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs
-   -  - The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the shadows

He moves forward

In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased
My King
Has the strategy been set so quickly
The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius, including the distinctive scar
He regards her hungrily
Come to your Queen, my King
-   - The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with and Guards
Suddenly, the King stops
() 3
: On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged creature -- and now it appears: The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power
Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back
The others raise their weapons
The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes close by
No one dare move
The Dog disappears into the shadows below

Her arms are bound

The women weep, the men agonize
Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it closed
On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest to the edge and drop it into the rough sea
We  a from within
Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at their King, outraged by this double murder
Acrisius registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to leave the promontory
in his face what the others do not -- shame and doubt
, the chest rights itself and rides out on the tide
- Two  gallop in the moonlight
The first Rider sways in the saddle and falls from his mount
He staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands
It is King Acrisius, very drunk
The second Rider, the King's , dismounts to give aid, though he's also drunk

: () My own subjects condemn me
They dare judge me
And what emboldens this treachery
You are mistaken, my King
None would risk your anger -- (oblivious to him) It is Zeus who warps my kinadom
Zeus the ungodly, Zeus the defiler
This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about fearlessly
Please, speak not these things                           -- Acrisius spins on him, out of control -- He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes my precious Queen
This is a low, conniving God
But  have bested him on this day and humbled the great Prime
( ) Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on Olympos
Who does the Fearless One fear
beg you, Your Highness -- Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's throat
Tell me what the Priests say
(terrified, halting) Tiamat
Tiamat, Queen of the Deep
() Those who dare, whisper she covets Zeus' throne and schemes to achieve it, the ambitious Goddess of the Dark Oceans
() 5
: Yes, Tiamat
And today  have honored her
The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune
've taken Zeus' whore and the bastard she grows in her belly and thrown them to Tiamat in her rough sea
(toward the moonlit ) honor Zeus' rival with all that was dear to me -- (falters, ashamed) -- and commit double murder in her honor
About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again -- so that Zeus will know despise and disdain him and spit on his foul name
The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in fear
the King is silhouetted in the moonlight, arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly -- -- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking his being
( ,  ) and  ' And thus,
The Steward  what we now cannot
An   and the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward

In awe and fear -- Thoth the Quick
(sensing the boy's ) Messenger of the Gods
Bound for Olympos
The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a violent wave in the long grass and suddenly -- /// - : the landscape is just a blur
But up ahead is a mountain: the summit -- --  the clouds above the peak
the mist -- villas, classical facades:
The polished stone of the grandest villa reflects ' dark form touching down

He strides past the reflecting pool in the center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging -- -- each of the   seated around the perimeter

Thoth bows deeply before the throne of , majestic, bearded, awe-inspiring

: (rumbles, like ) We have debated, we have voted, and it is decided
We offer the Humans peace
Thoth, you will take them the terms of a treaty -- (
) () treaty
Zeus and his eagle turn their heads
The God's eyes are familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog
In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand Olympians:   , whose countenance is death made visible, and -- -- ,    , the only God fearless enough to challenge Zeus' rule -- We don't negotiate with them
We dictate to them
Their place is to beg
They have forgotten their role and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers
Our mercy will give them reason to be grateful
They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before
They will bow down when we snap their backs
Mercy
We are Gods
Some of us remember that and are not afraid -- Zeus has had enough: furious    jump to the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage
Silence
Or learn what it is to be afraid
The debate is over, the votes cast
Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears  chips of alabaster versus  shards of obsidian
() 8
: We guarantee an armistice, we shield the bridegroom and the Joppan royal family
(turning again on ) And we do not interfere in their actions
We leave them undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs
And if they refuse our terms
They have suffered terrible losses
They will not pass up a chance for peace
-   () Only Tiamat and Set now
Tiamat regards Zeus' throne
This is your rightful place to take
Soon enough, Set
Zeus has grown weaker than  knew
Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the two black shards representing their votes
He hands one to Tiamat
So have they all
They no longer see clearly
() They're beginning to think like Men
But you and  shall not
Set agrees, his eyes searching her face
We will manage these thick-witted Humans to our own ends
(off his look) Yes, we will be bound by great Zeus' rules
until their fragile membranes tear
We dare not interfere with these insects
() () 9
: (') but we may be invited to intervene
Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool -- the whole pool darkens and choppy waves crash over the sides
a tiny tempest

Among the war-torn buildings is a bustling market

Fear grips the crowd
An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- The clouds stop dead
The crowd stops moves to the , the royal residence and assembly hall

Expecting someone
Flitting nearby is his Queen -- , a fading beauty, fiercely intelligent, but not wise; she can be impulsive and vain

The emissary approaches
Take your time in your responses, debate nothing
() 've received ambassadors before
None like this
'm not cowed
If these arrogant Gods are so powerful, why are they the ones seeking a truce
() 10
: () only recommend you take care with the tone of the conversation
truce would benefit all
In my palace,  decide how the discourse proceeds, not some messenger sent on errands by Zeus
(
) You are correct, Your Highness, do the bidding of Zeus
To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the Throne Room, behind them
Startled, they turn to see      -- Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward
as do all Gods
and all men
Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull
(with an edge) King Kepheus, as humble messenger of Zeus, 've come to talk of peace
() Thoth the Quick,  am Amoun, the King's Magi Strategos
We welcome you with humility, honored by your visit from the realm of the Gods
The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by Thoth's sudden appearance
Cassiopeia tries to recover her composure
am a reasonable man
Everyone wishes for the conflict to cease
Zeus above all
He has so long desired the tragedy end, he made a plan that began twenty-five years ago
() 11
: Twenty-five years
How is that possible
Amoun winces at her tone
Thoth sends a scary glance her way
Icy -- Beauteous Queen, let Thoth limn for you the forethought and wisdom of Zeus, God of Gods
- The market, now quiet, tries to return to normalcy
But the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's presence
- Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned
Amoun watches without surprise
treaty marriage
You have a daughter of age
() Andromeda
Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal father to give his daughter to a God
No
Such a union would be unclean
Years ago Zeus created a scion of mixed blood
Half-man, half-God
Bred for just this union
That is how important Zeus considers this truce
Is my only daughter to marry a demigod, not of this earth
prince, of both Olympian and Human royalty
chosen one
()                                                     () 12
: (') Zeus has given his son to the cause of peace
have heard of no such demigod
Majesty, if  may -- the young man does exist
He lives in a small fishing village on the isle of Seriphos
Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge
You knew about this and said nothing
() Just which king do you serve
My Queen,  serve only the great order of things
was the boy's tutor years ago
How haughty this boy must be, who knows he is half-God
He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man
He has never left his village
He can be overconfident, but it is from inexperience, not arrogance
Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks
Sharply What assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe
( ) You have my word, as Ambassador of the Gods
With our daughter's future at stake, we do not bestow trust easily
() If any harm should come to her -- () 13
: Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been : Suddenly, the  , compressing with an The room
Kepheus and the Queen grab for a solid handhold, frightened
The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and pile up in defiance of gravity
Wine goblets tilt toward Thoth
() The Princessa shall not be harmed
(urgently, to the ) Your Majesty
() Of course
of course your word is unquestioned here
Thoth's demeanor changes
The marbles spill off the table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet his intimidated face: Where is the lucky young suitor
(  )                            - Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface
appears, ensnared in a fisherman's net
Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can
As the net passes we see -- , a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in the net, desperately trying to hold his breath
When they have disappeared, we see a  appear through the blue in pursuit
As he passes, we get our first look -- ,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw, a knife in his teeth
He swims with the power and grace of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man
- The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros
() 14
: Perseus swims   and uses his knife to cut the net near the shark's snout
The shark tries to swim through the hole, but instead drags the net upwards
Perseus hangs on
One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net, bumping the young hero as it swims away
Perseus pulls Anteros toward the surface
- of  wait desperately at the rail
, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony
Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend in his arms
Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus is mad with despair
They have to pull him away
Spyros watches sadly
But also, relieved to see the one survivor
- Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits alone, downcast, in pain
Spyros watches in silence
Then, gruffly -- Your grieving does Anteros no good
It comforts only you
It's my fault he's gone
He was careless with the net
Perseus gives him a hard look
So it's his fault
Not mine, not fate, not the Gods
() The Gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy while we act
We make our own history
() 15
: (breaks down, crying) Now my history is  let my friend die in my arms
made it back, why couldn't he
What you do, no other man can do
Have you not noticed
To what purpose
failed him
() Purpose
Looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the superstition of the Gods, as surely as your friend was caught in that net
And all the searching leads down to the same place
The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos
Perseus looks off at the rocky coast
Collects himself, -- You always say that my abilities are greater than other men's
But they were not enough to save him
You are still a man, confined by man's limits
You are just as likely to fail as succeed
How is that greater than other men
Ordinary men fail most of the time
The trawler rounds a point on the island
Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff
closer -- huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe figure
Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias
Young yet ancient
() 16
: She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes
He turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but no one has
When he looks back, she's gone
- Perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his friend
,                                             14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up from the modest stone dwelling
She sees his mood and touches his arm gently
Mother wants you to come in for supper
(as he is ) Perseus, why are you so sad
This breaks his spell
He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they head inside
-  - Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife , and Tekla
Spyros is patient and twinkly with his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs
still don't understand
Your mother can explain
She believes everything has an explanation, even if we have to make it up
( ' ) It's one of the reasons  love you, Marmara
Tell me
Why is there war between Man and the Gods
Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food
At the beginning of time, when Man was young, he prayed to the Gods
His belief in the Gods gave his life meaning
It was a good thing
() 17
: If you consider superstition, fear and darkness good things
( ) But Man grew, as children do, and he turned away from the Gods
Be began to put his faith in other things
Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes
What things
Learning, science
love
() self-determination
Those things that give Man dignity and independence
But what of the Gods, who had protected and guided us so long
They must breathe our prayers to survive
They hunger for -- -- as lions hunger for blood
Spyros
( ) Your father's mind is closed on these matters
The Gods were desperate to claim our awe again
Desperate
the Gods
Yes, even the Gods
If they could not earn our faith with love, they would demand it with fear
Whatever was necessary to ensure their continued existence
() 18
: Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit down
And that is how war broke out between Man and Gods
(turning to serve ) Now eat your dinner, which the Gods -- and your father -- have provided
- '  - Middle of the night
Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny space
He stares, thinking about his friend
Suddenly, a  at the door
-  - Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl
Her beauty electrifies him
She glows from within, but her color is oddly faded, washed-out
You
saw you watching our boat at the cliff
It was not the boat  was watching
Can  be of service
Yes, of service
need you to come with me on a journey
Perseus gives her a look
Right now
(as she nods) It wouldn't take much persuading to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible
My family can't wake and find me gone
Where do you want me to go
It's not what  want
am in the service of others
() 19
: Perseus can't get over her beauty, the dulcet sound of her voice
Even so -- Come back in the morning and we can talk about it
'm sorry
For what
Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet
Then a centipede, a scorpion
Then a swarm, racing toward him
He feels the first spider and looks down
The creatures climb his legs, biting
Weakening from the venom, he stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and falls
' The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him
He blacks out
( )   - white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat swiftly across the sea
The Wilting Girl, alone, sits quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering
We  that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat
Her eyes slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame
There are bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be healing as we look at them
Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting Girl
How long have  been out
() 20
: This time
Only a few hours
The time before, almost a day
How was your rest
had a dream
fell into a dark pit
thought  would never stop falling
But a beam of light formed a soft net, caught me and tossed me back
TheWilting Girl watches him
When  came back up to the world, a beautiful woman appeared and spoke to me
But as she spoke she would sometimes disappear into the whiteness with a strange sound
' The Wilting Girl listens to his story
When  could hear her, she spoke nonsense
She said that my father was a God and my mother a -- At that moment the blinding-white sail swings between them as she tacks, obscuring his view of her for a moment
The wind makes a    in the cloth
Then she reappears, the sail on her other side
' as he realizes she is his vision
You are special, Perseus
Your birth was ordained for this very purpose
am an ordinary man
Do you ever lie awake during a storm and listen to the thunder
() () 21
: (') And it sounds as though it matches the beating of your heart
He doesn't have to answer; it's written on his face
How long can you hold your breath
Longer than the others
Are there times when you know you should feel pain, but you don't
None of that means anything
Look at your arms, Perseus
Perseus watches the bites on his arm heal visibly
good trick
You must be the demigod, not me
("") 'm a Chthonian
Chthonian
An Earth Goddess
( ' ) The Gods have a caste system just as men do
The Olympians are our nobility -- few but cosmic
The Chthonians are the peasants
Our abode is this earth, and we exist as long as men worship us
And when none worship you
Sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes
() We fade away
This touches Perseus deeply
His tone changes
And demigods, where do they stand in your hierarchy
() 22
: Nowhere
Sorry
If demigods rank so low, why do you need me
For a marriage
What
Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a treaty to end the war
At the center is the marriage of a mortal with a demigod
Who, me
Zeus himself has chosen you demigod may be less than a God, but he's more than a Man
One foot in Humanity, the other in Divinity
Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between our races
Forget it
Such a union could save millions of souls
Perseus is struck by that
He looks off across the sea
And just who exactly am  supposed to marry
()                                                   -   - :  hot embrace
In the blur of movement our first good look is at the , a beauty -- ,                                                18
The  is , a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy
It's hard to tell who's the aggressor here
Gasping, Andromeda holds him at bay -- () 23
: Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way
(as he kisses her) As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant
Another steamy kiss
In between liplocks, she whispers -- very mistaken
a woman of my station

They go at it again
-  - hurries past  hanging laundry in the atrium
She's , handmaid to Princessa Andromeda
She has a feline quality -- eyes, grace, agility
She raps on the scullery door

Andromeda
You'll care enough if you're caught
Remember last time
From inside we  complaining, more kissing and moaning
(
) Peshet
Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach
() 24
: Where is the Princess
- Andromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor, finger to her lips
He ignores her, starts again
Andromeda does something below the frame that jolts him off
The girl can take care of herself
- Peshet faces the Queen
Is she not in her chambers, ma'am
She is not
You are expected to know her -- and  from the closet stops Cassiopeia
She throws a perturbed glance at the door
Peshet looks guilty
() Tell the Princess -- should you find her -- her father and  want to see her at once
She stalks away
Urgently, through the door -- Princess, it's the King as well
-   - lavish room
Cassiopeia and Kepheus sit in golden chairs, looking off
Andromeda  , furious
with conviction -- To please you,  would submit to such a marriage
except  would rather die; Please let me know you're serious about this perverse plan so  can make arrangements to kill myself
() 25
: She stomps out
Their gaze follows until she's gone
: It will take more than half-a-God to handle her
She'll be a great ruler one day
(  )                                        - Perseus can't take his eyes off the Wilting Girl, who steers
She tries not to be self-conscious; she would blush were she not so pale
You're looking in the wrong direction
don't think so
Perhaps you should give some thought to your immediate future
(laughs, flirtatious) That's what 'm doing
Maybe you should take another look
She indicates the view behind him
Perseus turns, jaw dropping
breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts
At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the working-class area -- the
Above, twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the with its gleaming villas, temples, statues, and colonnaded towers, hugging the precipice
- () 26
: The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through the city
He's never seen anything like it
He rubbernecks, awestruck as he passes a  who takes a dragon skin from the coals and fashions armor by pounding the white-hot scales over a mold
All the goods, armies, and culture of Man's dominion flow through this port
He who reigns in Joppa, rules the world
Amidst the exotic chaos, Perseus is struck by   the homeless refugees on the street and the ruins   of once- proud buildings
The war has badly scarred this place
It is the war you have the power to end
He throws her an angry look, grim
Don't joke about such things
'd be useless before such a huge responsibility
Perhaps you would be
( ) as you are now
They pass an evangelist                        () haranguing a crowd
(-) -- one true God is not Zeus but she called the Deep -- Tiamat
(quoting from his ) 'Before the first dawn, the eyes of the Deep watched the earth
' (to the crowd) Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos or know despair, for Tiamat will rule the heavens and the earth
Perseus is mystified by this talk
He turns to Vidalia for explanation, but she seems disturbed by the preacher and does not return Perseus' gaze
() 27
: Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and see the regal Basilica
hang banners and decorations, preparing for a big event
What are they celebrating
You
-   - Cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor to find: Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him
before  am a king or a peacemaker,  am a father
Do you know what that means
'm not sure, Your Highness did not know my father
() Yes, well
it means  had no desire for my little girl's carefree springtime to be cut -- (to Cassiopeia, ) What is she
() 'm sure she's preparing herself to make the best possible impression
Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple
Kepheus paces with mounting impatience
( ) -- and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict
of which she knows nothing at all
() 28
: She's not the only one, sir don't know much about the events for which 've been drafted
(disarmed, but tough ) take no comfort in that, young man
In fact,  find little to take comfort in here
You are a stranger from a distant place, and am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you
( ) If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any kind should come her way,  will have your head on a stake
Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face
He puts his hand on the hilt of his sword
Is this amusing to you
Not even a little, my lord
It's just that  myself was waylaid -- snatched also, as you say, from my happy springtime
Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him
've been told 'm to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose
of which 'm not at all convinced
Does a truce in the war between Men and Gods not strike you as a higher purpose
With all respect,  have never seen a God
On my island, they're no more than a story
You will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island
() () 29
: (-) ( ) This is supposed to be the son of a God, yet he doubts their existence
( ) They exist, young man
But if you doubt their power,  join you -- () Cassiopeia
We have agreed such talk has no place in this palace
() Have we
can only proceed based on what have experienced, not on a faith do not possess
Where does a young person get such ideas
Perhaps from my adopted father, sir
admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand
Is he a scholar
No, Your Highness, a fisherman
(
) know this mentor who so influences young Perseus
Amoun has silently entered the chamber
Perseus reacts in amazement
Master Amoun
He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him warmly
() 30
: Porpoise
You've grown tall and strong since my departure
Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at arm's length
What are you doing here
am honored to serve the King as an advisor
His Magi Strategos
From my village tutor to Magi Strategos
What a path
The King's patience is exhausted
To Cassiopeia Where is Andromeda
At the least, the two should meet before tomorrow's ceremony
() Tomorrow
Is the wedding so soon
The wedding comes later
Tomorrow we will have the public announcement
And a celebration of the treaty
Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear
Kepheus is irritated
It seems our Andromeda has wandered away
Cassiopeia reacts, upset
Perhaps the thought of her new life has made her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one
() 31
: Perseus, if you're to take the wild girl for a wife, this is a good time to start your training
Go into the city and retrieve her
How will  know her
She is unmistakable
'm a stranger here
Any hints
Follow the lights and the sound of profane music
-   - The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief
- The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley, headed toward the outskirts of town
Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones, blocking her way
She startles, but does not stop
She goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right through the stone, like a ghost
On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing hard
She looks around and hurries down an intersecting passageway
She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her, thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier
She takes a breath and dives into the surging growth
She almost makes it through, but at the last moment, vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner
She gives up, with a sigh
We  the  of a God
Zeus
Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an intimate way -- a beautiful sound

: (
) Why do we have to play these games, my lovely girl
You know you cannot leave
The vines retract, freeing her

Have you forgotten your place in this
As 've lost my believers, the future has become dimmer to me

Close your eyes and see your tomorrow
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath
single tear runs along her cheek
She opens her eyes
It's too painful

(
) You you already involved
Such is fate
We cannot hide from the trials of our future
no matter how dark the alleyway
She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness

Rich and poor mix in the crowded streets
As always, the poor have suffered the most from the conflict

Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane

She gives him a deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the crush
- Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset
The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture stops him cold
(
) Very beautiful
Andromeda spins, petulant
Will you please give me some -- The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause
What did you say
said, 'Very beautiful
' Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family

She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder
Do you always start a seduction with an insult
Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the sea

My home is across that water

: What brings you here
To Joppa

He looks over at her a long moment
've come to see my future wife
Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is
mad mix of emotions crosses her face
- Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens
She stays close, attracted to him
It's not personal
You're not a bad-looking boy
(as Perseus laughs) 'm too young
don't want to be married
Me either
Then why are you doing it
No one asked me
And now that 've met you,  don't know if can go through with it
(off her look) It's not personal
Seeing you makes it real
think a man should make his own decisions won't be the pawn of a King or a God
She looks at him with new interest
Since we agree, it's settled
No marriage
() 35
: don't think it's going to be that simple
Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer
That doesn't mean we can't be friends
Get to know each other
want to show you something
She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze
-   - Beautiful in the moonlight
She hurries him quickly around one turn, then another, and another
He laughs at her excitement
'm already lost
'll take care of you
They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber
Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed
This is my special place
No one can see or hear or even find us now

Do you want to
When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and gives him a long deep kiss
He's surprised, but handles it well
When she tries to continue, he slows things down, holding her at bay
Do you not find me attractive
One of the most beautiful women 've ever seen
() 36
: Of course, you haven't been much in the world
True
Maybe a lot of girls look like you
Don't you want to make love to your almost-wife
Maybe we'll find we're not compatible
What if we find we're very compat-- She stops him with another kiss
He starts to surrender to his desire, but again, he stops
Her voice is a low -- Is it true you're a demigod
(makes a face) It seems what everyone wants to believe
Her face is inches from his
She looks into his eyes
-- don't see it
(as Perseus laughs) But let's find out for sure
She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of foliage
He can no longer resist
Together they fall into the softness
He kisses her passionately as their bodies begin to move together
She breaks the kiss for only a moment, her voice husky -- think 'm becoming a believer
They start to make love

Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd

When they make eye contact, she quickly looks away
Perseus is surprised by his feelings
Andromeda has seen her, too
He has a guilty moment and averts his eyes

The room  as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of the dais with a cup of wine, not her first

You all know  am a modest person, no matter my rank
Some of the crowd react silently
Andromeda watches her mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus, watching from his throne
( ) This is not a celebration of a betrothal
(as Kepheus is on ) not the celebration of the happiness of two parents, or of our good people
Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal Entourage
This union represents new hope for a lasting peace
That is the only cause for celebration
The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause
Amoun wills her to stop
Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks over at the Princess

Look at her

Her subjects agree loudly
Andromeda wishes this would end
Cassiopeia raises her glass

More beautiful than the turquoise ocean and its sublime Goddess of the Deep

: Tiamat tears off her cloak and
Her body, made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy and terrifying
Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the streets, is in the throng
His reaction is a mix of religious ecstasy and outright lust
The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't
She crumples, aging before our eyes
Every word shakes her frame -- Look upon the sublime and know your error
You'll not blink
Tell me now, mortal, how bright your preening urchin shines
No one dare look long at the Goddess
No one but Perseus
Tiamat notices Perseus
and his boldness
People of Joppa, hear me
For the sacrilege of this arrogant creature,  will loose Leviathan upon you
The people react in terror
Cassiopeia starts to faint, but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness                  -- 'm not finished
Hold your gaze
(to the people) For thirty days, Joppa shall suffer the scorn of Leviathan
And on the final day, you will be wiped from the earth

All monsters of the sea are but shadows of Leviathan the Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and nigh indestructible
The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he looks exhausted
My Queen lies near death
Am now to choose between the survival of our state
and the life of Andromeda, my only child
Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group, expectantly
But Perseus looks only perplexed, an observer
beg you, do not even consider such a sacrifice -- () Do you tell me only what you think wish to hear

: (') The citizens of Joppa are fighting for their lives
Would you have me gamble the city to save one girl
Again, Amoun looks to Perseus
You need make no such choice, Your Highness
Andromeda must
be saved, and the city too
Impossible
( ) No
We need only the will to do it
You spoke the words -- the monster is indestructible
() How can that be
Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with relief
Perseus
You had something you wanted to say to the King
All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self- conscious
What
No, Master Amoun
'm listening
You're 'listening'
We're talking about the precious life of your betrothed
Perseus meets his gaze, confused
'm a newcomer here
would not presume to tell these men -- () 45
: Exactly
newcomer with a fresh perspective
Share your thoughts with the King, your future father- in-law
The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence
Perseus, uncertainly -- know that  am young and have not seen much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible
The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance
(
) am far from young and have seen much of the world
and  agree with my son
Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive father, Spyros
Perseus goes to embrace him
Father, how did you find me
thought this boy's father was a God
How does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King
sent for him, Lord
This good man raised Perseus from infancy
He will help him now
Help him with what
With whatever is needed
Perseus approaches the King
Surprising himself -- He will help me destroy Leviathan
Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay, sure
" 46
Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus
But how
Perseus has no idea
Majesty, we can seek the counsel of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia
They know the hidden ways of the Gods
If Leviathan can be slain, they'll know how to do it
We have thirty days to find its weakness
Twenty-nine
(flashes him a look) We'll leave tonight
With what army
dare not weaken our forces when the city is about to be besieged
(uncertain, glances ) We'll go alone
( ) Yes
Give us a map
Amoun laughs
When some of the others join in, the   King gives them a look that stops them dead
My King, with your permission
The King assents, seemingly lost
Amoun speaks to Perseus

: 'll give you a map and much more
'll go with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission
We can leave at first light

The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a map from dozens
Something catches Perseus' eye

Spyros drops back beside Perseus
Who would have thought we'd be on a journey like this
Two simple fishermen
() 49
: 'm afraid 've dragged you into real danger, Father, when  have little idea of what 'm doing
Living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable
It's all in your attitude
What's our attitude about destroying Leviathan
The Kraken is just another big fish
Perseus smiles, but is not as sanguine

Andromeda looks over at her, thinking
My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster

Only Perseus stayed his decision

She gives him a sharp look
Is he mocking her
He's defensive
That's a pretty name
Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'
How's that
'Vidalia'
That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are
She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road ahead
You don't like it

She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead
He smiles

Mongke and Tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls of timber and kindling
Draco glances up from striking his flintstone

The evil God strokes the sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's skull

Hear me, my pet
Let my instructions be seared to your primal mind as natural law

How long do you think you could stay on one of those
Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look
Don't goad the boy, Icos
No Man can ride a Pegasus

You're right
But he was a demigod
() Then this will be a good way to find out just what  am
Stop it, rogues
One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief
What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up
() 56
: Don't worry, Commander, the boy won't even get on its back
With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises
Draco pulls him back down
Don't do this
If we go back to camp right now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight
true leader will not be distracted
'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is
'm too young to start avoiding trouble
Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly
It  and threshes its wings, buffeting Perseus with gusts
The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head
It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus face-first into the dirt
Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the clearing
'll collect him right now, Commander
Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a
The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and swallows it whole
Humbaba turns and  the air, homing in on Perseus

: The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces its nose
From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's mouth with his saber

cyclone of descends from the sky and dives straight into the monster's mouth
As the Humbaba tries to shake them away, Mongke is thrown clear

Slash the belly
Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same moment Draco sweeps down
The two blades barely miss each other, opening a huge  in the belly
The others are shocked and impressed by Perseus
Steaming purple entrails spill over Perseus and Draco The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake the viscera from their feathers and take flight

You know that the good common people of Joppa trust that  will look after their welfare
Some do

Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit -- Strange, beautiful   sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti

Startlingly, a huge  // scrapes onto a boulder
Pulling himself   in repulsive  -- Kalibos
(There, within his frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form
) When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up the mountain
illuminates his awestruck countenance
Above him -- () 63
: -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock
Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on Kalibos, like a benevolent mother
My loyal friend
it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one
Events demand more decisive action
Kalibos'  is as tortured and deformed as his body -- Grorashnrd

Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when  restore you to your rightful form -- proud Acrisius
With me, your protector, on the throne of Olympos
the violator Zeus deposed
Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction
Go down into this valley
See what  am building for you -- an army dangerous and fearless as you, their leader
- Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the of the Lotus flowers
They pluck petals and chew them
The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to take their fill of the drug
Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from across the field of Lotus blossoms
- '  - Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on Andromeda's bed
On instinct, she hurries to the bed and throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no Andromeda
Peshet races out

- Peshet sprints through the , dodging the  and like a cat, peering under each hood, searching for her mistress
-   - On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees
Fantasos, the Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by , including Agenor
As before, Fantasos seems to have actual hypnotic powers
How much are we meant to suffer
Where is your mighty King
Safely cloistered above the flood
on the high ground, with the high- born -- the privileged gentry
The angry crowd responds, fists shaking
Peshet moves through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda
She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers her presence
Does Kepheus worry about you
No
Only the Princessa
And still, the Kraken comes
Does the King build his defenses at the water's edge
"
" cries the crowd
Peshet is shocked to find herself replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the stage
No
He makes his stand at his daughter's chamber door
We will show Kepheus we're not sacrificial fodder
We will tremble the walls of his Basilica
from the mob
Peshet stops suddenly, peering ahead
at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified
() 65
: (
) Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants
We die so she may live
As the crowd , Andromeda hurries away in tears
Peshet fights through the crush to follow her

- Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated
Andromeda is gone
hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her
It is Fantasos
Peshet, you've come at the right time
Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power
Peshet nods, trance-like
One night soon, a gong will sound three times
When you hear it, unlock the back gate of the Basilica
Then go to Andromeda's chambers
(hands her a dagger) and bring the Princess out
My men will take her to Leviathan
Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling
Do you understand me

She nods, horrified by her predicament

Watch your surround

The Alkali Lotus
She stops, spotting something in the distance
Kosmo pulls up
What is that
shimmering through the desert heat -- tents and flags
() An army bivouac
flying the flag of Joppa
Its the Cleon Legion
- The Expedition enters the abandoned camp
They look around in dismay
Where is everyone
Spyros  something and follows the  to a tent, weapon ready
- Spyros looks inside
cauldron  over a fresh fire
blossoms bob on the boiling broth
Spyros, uneasy, backs out

: Draco, tell me what this -- Everyone is standing perfectly still

The transformed Cleon Legion lurches
The only resemblance to the soldiers they were is their armor
Now they're monstrous creatures:
as it plants in the dust
The companion foot lands beside it -- completely different
: Kalibos
Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters
Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod
He sniffs the air around Perseus
() Lotophagi
Lotus-eaters
We should leave

Perseus
The whole Expedition comes to life as                                                 -- , swift and brutal
Long arms thrash and rip at the Praetorians
Mongke and Tamburlane  the swarm with
Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon
Amoun opens a leather sack of sand
Muster to me
() 68
: Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there
Amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all
The ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of insects
Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting
Come on
You can pass through
Draco bolts for the barrier
Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him
Draco slides inside the swarm
He looks back at Kosmo in horror
Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm
He's almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull
Polluc sticks his sword into the creature; they both fall over dead
Icos and Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside
Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle
The tide of  and  Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail
Only humans can penetrate the shield
Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking
Only humans
He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier
Drop the barrier
r No
It's too late for her
Drop it, Amoun
At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop
At the top, he turns, and , his message clear: "If you want to save her, come and get her
" He hungrily rips her leather bandeau
Perseus turns to Amoun
() 69
: Take the barrier down or 'll go through it
Have you learned nothing
If you break out now, we're all at risk
On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh
Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love
've learned one thing for certain
Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian
Get down
Perseus backs away three steps
To the others               -- Get ready to defend yourselves
Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans
They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses
Let's kill these freks
Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi
Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia
Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: "You're the one that  want
" They face off, looking for an opening
Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword
Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape
Perseus rolls out of the way
Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head
The monster catches the blade in his jaws and
Bloody spittle flies from his tongue
Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus
He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder
Vidalia cracks a rock into Kalibos' head
The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens toward her, head bloody
Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge
() 70
: Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets off, pinwheeling through the air
The grotesque figure hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck
He slams into the dust, dead
Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite
When he tries to rise, his legs are rubbery
Vidalia catches him as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the bloody puncture wounds
() Okay
sshh

Vidalia scans the horizon
Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending off the Lotophagi
Outnumbered, they won't last long
The earth
The Lotophagi are distracted, looking around nervously
Over a rise stampede , rhino-sized scorpions
Riding them,  , flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes
They lay into the Lotophagi
The Scorpiochs skewer the beasts with
The Djinn use flashing to cut them down
in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing in
Vidalia
we need to help them
He blacks out
Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell
She is mystified by what : The deformed monster Kalibos is gone
In his place, neck broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace -- King Acrisius
71
-   - , each a lantern hanging from a Scorpioch's tail
The Expedition members ride on the Scorpioch with the Djinn
Some of the huge scorpions carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs
- Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious
Vidalia replaces the dressing on his bite wound
Knowing he cannot hear her -- To save me, you risked everything -- your mission, your friends
the fate of multitudes
Men need better judgment in the one who is meant to lead them
No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love
-- You shouldn't have risked your life for me
It is a waste to save me when 'll be gone so soon
She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead
Thank you for your reckless disregard
Thank you, Perseus
Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a quick incantation
small shoot  and Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers Perseus' wound
The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus
Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest
Vidalia gently lays him down
Perseus gags
from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its stomach
The poison is gone now

We all did
But their leader, Shaikh Suleiman, has some special interest in you
(off his confusion) Just sleep
She waves her palm over his face, and he does sleep
- Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen
One reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but suddenly the petals blacken and curl
The creature, spooked, sniffs the air
All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel over, dead
The cause: Set the Void glides over, surveying the battlefield
- The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of stucco and thatch
and   shut as they pass,   skitter about
:
15 The Skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war
The Legions of the Gods have battered them
It's no wonder they shy away from all strangers
Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting company with the Djinn Raiders
only one of the Djinn is staying --  , a veiled priest
Why does this Djinn priest stay with us
() 73
: Because of you
You're the reason they saved us
Me
don't understand
Why don't you ask him
thought they didn't speak
They have no mouths
That doesn't mean they do not speak
: -    - The Expedition climbs through rugged country
At a turn, Amoun looks up
Dead ahead, wreathed in fog -- sheer granite pinnacles, one towering above the others
The Pillar of Moirai
Lair of the Norn Sisters
Tell me of them
They're witches in the form of Strix
Not a pleasant sight, a Strix
They have powerful magic and dreadful habits
Baby-eaters, among other things
(off Perseus' shock) But they owe me a favor
When the war broke out, they lent their power to men against the Gods in exchange for infant sacrifice
Tiamat struck them blind for their treachery
When they came for help,  fashioned them an artificial eye, for their Second Sight
You made only one eye
() 74
: (pleased with his ) Yes
They have to take turns
If they all could see at once, they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque
()                           - The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle
Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus
The comes from behind his veil
He pulls a from his cloak
The priest, blade poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus
runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a strike
Stay away from my boy
Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with an "
" Perseus jolts awake
He reaches for his sword, but has none
Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge
Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his position
The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood; eyes like slots in a furnace
Perseus listens to the Spyros, he means me no harm
The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt
The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face
He kneels before Perseus, head bowed
hear you and  understand you
But  don't know how
Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene daeva

: You are praying to me
There must be a mistake
The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag,    engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus
An offering'
thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering
He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh
Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr
You honor my father
You honor Spyros
Ho Zeus Patir
Zeus
Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger

So sorry to see you again

The Sisters
Skuld  down
Icos and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck
Skuld tosses the Eye back to Urd
Perseus watches with growing irritation
Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness
You owe me this answer at least
The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man
She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention on Perseus
There's something wrong with that one
don't like having him here
Let me take a look
Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld
Perseus leaps and snags the Eye out of mid-air
The Strix
Perseus goes to the precipice

The Strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith
Since you cannot see, let me tell you what's about to happen
'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below

The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, too: the young demigod shows growing leadership
The Strix are panicked -- We can't tell you
We don't dare betray Tiamat again
She sees all
Her touch is felt in every evil thing
second offense and she will You don't have to tell us the secret
But you will have to live as blind as she made you
No
Give us the Eye and we'll tell
Tell me first
If  like the answer, you get your Eye

: We need the Eye to see the answer
You know the answer sure as you already knew the question
The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings
-- Leviathan can be destroyed
The beast has one weakness
Tell us now
The Strix are torn, frightened
Finally -- The stare of Medusa
No creature can look directly in her eyes and still survive
The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned Expedition
They're lying, Perseus
Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response
believe them
(tosses the Eye high) Here's your second sight
Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in her socket
(to the Norns) And Medusa
Where does she abide
In Tartaros, beyond the frozen Tethys Sea
Only Charon's ferry dare challenge the ice
How can she be slain

Skuld flaps to the pitch-black portal to an And the proper tools
Explore our cache of spoils
You may find such a tool
Perseus stares into the black entrance
Don't go in there, Perseus
It's a trap
No
We have guaranteed the rage of Tiamat with this revelation
we ask only that the young God mention our aid

With respect, Magi, do not recite that black tale

Suddenly, she sweeps his legs out

She's got a tail and she'll use it just like that
Perseus opens his eyes
Keep your eyes shut
Open them with Medusa and it will be your last look
( ) You're enjoying this too much

: He can't see her smile
Or that she regards him with something hotter than amusement
She tries to punch him, but he blocks it
Good
Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks him down
Do you think the Gorgon will hit once and then surrender her head
He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive position, turning as she moves around him
Listen
you will hear her muscles coil
Feel her hunger in your gut
Ask, how will she feed it
wish it, but  can't perceive the world that way
You can
You're the son of a God
Nothing  have done has convinced me of that
You do not see yourself clearly yet
In time, your actions in crisis will sharpen your view
Her faith touches him deeply
She resumes the lesson: You can do those things, Perseus, and much more
He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth
We think a room is silent until someone points out the wind
Then the wind is all we hear
She strikes
He dodges and locks her neck
Pleased, she flips him

Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free
Draco sees the tail before him
Unthinking, he instinctively spins and looks
Medusa's face is inches from Draco's
His muscles lock and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically
a hole blasts through the roof of the cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt -- dead, a gaping wound in his head
Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a Spyros   and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the sound
as its sails cleanly through slanted pillars and debris, , , until it comes through a tiny opening and -- into Medusa's body

Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield
In the reflection on the bronze, he : Movement

Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him
Medusa's talons  the blade and the sickle flies from his grip
Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees
Behind him, Medusa  down the column and heads for Perseus
Perseus reaches the sickle
He lifts his shield up in front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer behind him
He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping soft - as the blade slices through something
Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking into the shield
Still, Medusa looms behind him
But suddenly, Medusa's head  and rolls on the ground
The headless reflection topples over, dead

Mongke sees something, smiles and  in his language
They all turn to see: Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top of the Temple steps
Perseus grasps the canvas sack
Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag and sends a crimson drip to the stones

Siege towers roll toward the city

How many days remain
Four, Majesty
Kepheus lowers the glass, looking grim
Our forces prepare
We have cards yet to play
We'll buy the time we need until
Until the Expedition perhaps returns
Until we're saved by the fisherman's son
My king, remember and take hope
he is not truly the son of a fisherman

Andromeda has appeared

She addresses the others with an authority we've never seen

The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away, leaving father and daughter alone

You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world

And  thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth
But now, with Mother so

She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city
If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it
To save my people, yes, of course
Such an act is within my power
He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed
Stop itl  forbid you to entertain such thoughts
Perseus and the others were willing to give everything

By the time this is over, your mother and  may well be gone

They've stopped at a well beside a

: Spyros studies the ancient words carved into the milestone: "Polis of   :  stadia
" Eleven stadia to the South
What is 'Polis of Jove Pater'
'm ignorant of this
Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known
This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities
Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters "-" and the other the letters "-
" 'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the ancient name of -- -- Joppa
Yes, Joppa
once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove
(dawning on him) Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage
(as Amoun confirms ) She compels the people to make human sacrifice of the Princess Andromeda
and transforms Joppa into the new church of Tiamat
The ancient abode of Zeus
() becomes the new home of Tiamat, granting her sway to supplant him as the God of Gods
(urgently to Perseus) You can't allow Tiamat to rule Olympos
() 95
: Perseus holds her look
"No," he won't let that happen
But in his eyes are fear and doubt
()   - The Expedition passes through deep woods
Spyros and Perseus ride side by side
Father, we've seen much on this journey we cannot hold in our hands
Yet these things are real enough
At each turn, we find monsters and Gods
Yes, the evidence is everywhere once we leave our island
That's why  so rarely leave
These Gods, what do you make of them
As you always said, they're petty, vengeful
and dangerous
Yes, as bad as men
(as Perseus smiles) And would you have that sort guide your life
No
Men must be accountable to themselves
Otherwise we serve poor masters
That's my boy
Amoun rides up
We should stop for the night
We must keep moving
Time is running out
If we don't rest the horses, they won't make it to Joppa
() 96
: ( ) We all need rest
If you don't save yourself, you'll have nothing left when you face the Kraken
Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral than ever) is suddenly alert
She peers into the woods, agitated
Then she  , dismounts and runs into the woods
Vidalia
Perseus slides from his horse and follows her
Mongke says something to Tamburlane; they
Amoun to : Why don't we stop here tonight
Spyros smiles, looking off after Perseus

She stops, closes her eyes, moves off again
, Vidalia appears again, and stops, searching her senses
Perseus arrives and watches her

Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree
She probes the foliage, steps forward
and descends into the ground, out of sight
Following, Perseus pulls away greenery, revealing an opening in the tree's massive roots
- Perseus drops into a dim, earthen den
Vidalia stands motionless before a bare altar
This is my church
Where  was born to the world
Where my people prayed to me

: Who were they
() know they were humans
They seemed so fragile
sheltered them because  thought the harsh world would break them
Now know  underestimated them
Her eyes pierce Perseus
When  saw you come out with Medusa's head,  saw that a Man had done an impossible thing
Beautiful, yes, but not fragile
Resilient
Fearless

was no hero
just didn't want to die
Perseus turns toward the altar
What is this
marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced
Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring
When the war began, Men ranged through the hills, stamping out any trace of God-worship they found
(touching the tablet) My true name was carved here
When it was obliterated, my worshippers lost faith and my last season began
How long do you have
Only days
What will happen
will vanish, quick as dew evaporating at dawn

: (') No one will notice the moment because all thought of me will be gone
What about me
Nothing can save me

Why did you have to give me a name
The light is almost gone now
They kiss
The wilted blossoms in her crown slowly open with color
They begin to make love

When you vanish, 'll find you
Close your eyes

Baby snakes and beetles spill out of her neatly-sliced neck
Tiamat is furious
How did he do this
They were not even to reach Medusa
Fate has begun to shift
The future ripples with uncertainty
Spare me your pitiful maundering
There is no Fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will

He is ignorant of the rules, or unconcerned with them

Set absorbs her tirade, stung
And Zeus

That is all you need to know
Bloody your hands and rid me of this pestilence
You have liberated me, my Queen

Set disappears

He reaches for Vidalia, but she is gone
Amoun stands over him, his manner severe
Where is she
This is my fault
've permitted this infatuation to progress too far
It is not yours to permit, Master

Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of berries
Look what 've found for us -- She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries

The berries turn brown and shrivel
Amoun grabs his chest
Perseus and Vidalia crumple in agony
Amoun tries to invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun splits open
Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen wall
The God is there in an instant, strangling her
Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand
It flies across the shrine and sinks with a  into the tablet that once held Vidalia's true name
Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm
Perseus doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch
Suffocating, Vidalia
Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches : (low, rasping) am half God
and now is the time
Perseus rises
He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an ear-splitting    and a sparking Set drops Vidalia and lurches back, aghast

Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set

It seeps into the sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain
Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent than ever
They look with pain at the remains of Amoun
'm so sorry, Perseus
look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus' face
( ) You faced a God in lethal combat

Never have  heard of such a thing

Princess Andromeda
She goes deeper into the rooms, then , looking off, -- Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony, preparing to jump to her death
She turns at the sound, teetering
Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a knife of her own
Peshet is shocked, not afraid
Peshet, stop

My lady, please -- was afraid, Peshet
Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me

Today, you are only a Princess
One day your people may need a Queen ready to die for them

She moves with feline agility, but is separated from the Princess

The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda

Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel
Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily closes the gap

Perseus reaches out and touches his foster father warmly

They need only one thing
Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell me

Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand
Leviathan spirals on, but       and the chain
Andromeda, suddenly separated from the monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles

Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his arms into her still body --
Movement
Breath
Color returns to her face
Perseus, too, breathes again, relieved
For the first time since the start of the adventure, they find themselves alone, holding each other

Finally, she nods

No

Father
Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word
His expression softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride
You have freed me

You've made me understand that my responsibility is to myself
So it is with us all

It matters not
Whatever the source,  are only grateful
He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human throng
This war will end the moment you choose for it to end
and Men agree

Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an offspring, what a creation
What will you do, Man of free will
Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his back
'm going to find Vidalia
So
my Son, you will be a pawn for love
