Written by Hal Hartley -- garbage truck roars by and
Simon Grim hangs from the back of it
He is a shy, skinny and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old
The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to go punch out at the time clock
-- Moments later
He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer
He begins to relax
This is his quality private time
Then he hears something and looks up
He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances and sees
Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having sex
Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then
(to Amy) You want some
Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up
Simon is fascinated
He drinks and looks on as
Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe
The boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt
Simon can't believe this
He looks around to see if the coast is clear, then returns just in time to see
Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her
The pipe falls from the young girl's hand
Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her
Simon's mouth falls open in awe
But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees
The amazed garbage man; caught
Amy starts screaming insanely
Simon runs for his life
Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase him away
-- Moments later
Simon runs up and throws open the screen door
He stands there in the doorway catching his breath
His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small portable  while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away in the living-room watching another  tuned to a different channel
(to Simon) Where the hell have you been
(to Mary) Mom, come on and eat
'm not hungry
(pissed) Then why'd  cook
Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in the evening
don't know why you cooked
don't know why you bother
Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs
She glares at her brother
Sit down and eat, Simon
Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel
He hesitates, then lifts his spoon
Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust
Fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more
Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it
He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table
The container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out
He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while
Fay and Mary look on in disgust
-- Moments later
Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house
He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits, sickened
He looks up, though, and sees
little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing there in the street watching him
Simon tries to smile at her
But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head
He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away
Lowering his hand, he sees he's bleeding
Desperate, lonely and ill, he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement
Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick
God,  wanna get fucked
Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs
You
Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes
He looks back at his sister
Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off
See ya later
Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction
He cocks his head, sits perfectly still and listens
He hears it now
We do, too
Footsteps
Big ones
Like a giant somewhere in the distance
The neighborhood trembles
Titles begin
Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, the house, the highway at the end of his block
Finally, he focuses on
The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood
Music starts
He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement
He stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road
The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of the music over the scene
Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and
Puts his ear right down against the road
He hears
The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life
Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens his eyes and sees
man approaching
The music swells up full
Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at
This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders
Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road
Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops
Titles finish
Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the house
Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at Simon
Get up off your knees
He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off towards his new home
-- Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to his basement apartment
He approaches
Simon follows, carrying the suitcases
'  -- Moments later
The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw by a decade of dank airless gloom
He coughs
Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the main room
He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair and smashes it
He tosses the wood in the stove
Simon looks on, amazed
Henry lights a fire with unusually quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon
Where you gotta go to get a six-pack of beer around here
-- This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which to eat donuts
Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the safety of the counter
Say something
(calling) She's mute
What
She don't -- you know -- talk
Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's gaze to the door
Simon enters
Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees
Warren and Amy
He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler
Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple of vampires
Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the counter
Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening
Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at
Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull
Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, but
Warren shoves himself between it and Simon
Simon freezes
Warren is expressionless
Simon looks back at Amy
She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down her panties, then leans forward on to the counter
Leering back over her shoulder, she hisses
Kiss my ass
Simon is nonplussed
Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets
red light flashing above the stockroom door
Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's bare behind
Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass
But then
Simon throws up all over her
Warren falls back in disgust
Gnoc covers her face with her hands
Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming bloody murder
Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down around her ankles
Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight
(scared) Oh, shit
Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the store
Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents
(in Vietnamese) Stay the hell out of my store, you good-for-nothing punks
Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming at Simon
Look at this
What's going on here
Simon, get up off the floor
Is this beer paid for
'  -- Later
Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases
It is filled with dozens of old, worn notebooks
Henry stacks them on the mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling and bright
Simon steps over and looks at
The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'
(off-screen) Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end
Simon looks over and sees
Henry's silhouette against the fire
He steps forward into the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor
He hands one to Simon
Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his eyes to Henry
Where do you come from
Nowhere in particular
He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely impressed with himself
go where  will and  do what must
(stops, drinks) That's why 'm in trouble
'm sort've what you might call
'in exile'
Why are you in trouble
(stopping) An honest man is always in trouble, Simon
Remember that
Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully
Henry stands in a dim corner across the room
How do you know my name
Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally
He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon
He lifts his finger and points to
Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt
Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks
Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his shoulder, laughing mischievously
(stopping him) am not retarded
(pauses) Well
'll take your word for that
(explaining) People
mean
They think
You know
Because
He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up gesticulating curiously with his hands
This finally dissolves into a dumb stare into empty space
see
Simon looks at him
Henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece
He tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket
He hands the now fresh writing tablet to Simon
Here
Take this
And
He searches his pockets and finds a pencil
this
Keep them with you at all times
You ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down
Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts
Henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece
What are these
(proudly, returning) This
This is my life's work
My memoirs
My 'Confession'
(carefully) What have you done
Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire
(wistfully) 've been bad
Repeatedly
(shrugs and steps away) But why brag
The details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths
(contemplating the notebooks) What is this
It's a philosophy poetics
politics, if you will literature of protest
novel of ideas
pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions
It is, in the end, whatever the hell  want it to be
And when 'm through with it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world's own idea of itself
He smokes
Simon is impressed
They hear a bottle smash outside in the street and Henry goes to the window
They're throwing bottles at the house
(throwing down his cigarette) Come on, let's go break their arms
Simon jumps up
No
Henry stops
Simon looks away and sits back down
(pauses) If 'm quiet
He is ashamed of himself
Henry sees this and settles down
He considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette
He lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close by Simon
They sit there in silence a while, then
Once
forget where  was
Central America maybe
Somewhere hot
Stupid job
Bad pay
Dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it
This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb
And  say, listen, hombres, , you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice 'm gone
Fine
But one of you
one of you
one of you is gunna have his eye torn out
Period
Silence repeat myself
One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket
promise
It's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered
But  will succeed
Because it's the only thing  have left to do in this world
So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more
(smokes, waits) They sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves
Henry stares into the flames and falls silent
Simon is riveted
He leans forward, on the edge of his seat
What happened
(winking) Well, here  am, still, after all
-- Later that night
Simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex from his sister's room
He stands outside her door and listens
(off) Did you throw up all over some girl
Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking
He approaches and stands in her doorway
They were throwing bottles at the house
Simon says nothing
He looks down at his feet
(gesturing to Fay's room) She's got some ex-con in there she met at the bar
Tattoos all over himself and a big red bloated nose
Did you take your pills
Now she says nothing
She smokes and looks away
Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication
He runs a glass of water and brings it in to her
She swallows the pills and washes them back with water
You want me to tell her to be quiet
She looks away, unconcerned and cynical
What's the use
She might as well get it while she can
She's not always gunna have the ass she has now, you know
That's just how life is
She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light
Simon stands there in the dark
-- Moments later
Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits at the table
He listens to the traffic on the highway and stares off into space
Finally, he takes the notebook Henry gave him from his pocket and places it before him
But then he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his head
Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil
He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover
Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page
Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins writing in a slow, laborious hand
-- The next morning
Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee and some jelly donuts
Simon jumps up from where he sits asleep over his notebook at the table
Good morning, Simon
Glorious day, huh
Here, have a donut
Can you lend me twenty dollars
Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and reaches for his wallet
Thanks
Where's the library in the scruffy little burgh
(handing him cash) Down the highway about a mile and a half and then make a left
Excellent
'm polishing up the final chapters of my 'Confession' and need a reasonably well-stocked reference section
He lifts up Simon's notebook
What's this
Simon hesitates, shyly
thought
Um
was
wanted to
Maybe
He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor
Henry flips through the book, impressed
It is full from cover to cover, every page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl
Henry frowns, intrigued
Then
Can  take this
Simon looks up, terrified
But his friend puts him at ease
'll correct the spelling
-- Later that day
Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing garbage
-- That evening
Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of soiled classics
He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and tries to read
It's an obvious struggle
He puts it aside and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture of the pages
page flutters away and he climbs down to the edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it
It's now wet and torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit it back into the book
He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks
He bites his lip and tries again
He sits back, exhausted and thinks
He hears a twig snap and looks back over his shoulder to see
Amy throws a bottle at his head
Smash
He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his neck
Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out of the puddle and smacking him in the head
Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which she sets aflame with her lighter
Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him
Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch
Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy
Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the rusted fence and gasps for breath
Warren waves the flaming torch in his face
(weakly, unheard) One of you is gunna lose an eye
Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline
Simon pulls himself to his feet as she splashes him with fuel
Warren is waving the torch deliriously above his head
(screaming) One of you is gunna lose an eye
Warren stops
Amy steps back and lowers the gas can
Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses and continues
One of you
promise
Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle
He drops it
Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused
Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at Warren
You can set me on fire
But one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head
promise
Warren is transfixed
He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can
She turns and walks away
Warren looks back at Simon, troubled
He hangs there still, glaring at him
Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands
Amy looks ill
Fuck
Take me home
-- Henry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees
Simon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics to the floor
Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him
(scared) Simon
Who did this to you
was gunna tear out their eyes knew  could do it
Whose eyes
told them
Like you said
told them
And  knew  could do it
He passes out
Henry looks at Mr Deng
You should take him home
He smells like a toilet
Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor
Mr Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out into the parking lot
Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits open on the table
She looks at it, then reads
She lifts it off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply engrossed
Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back into the store and stops, startled, when he sees
Gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook open in her hands before her, singing quietly
-- Twenty minutes later
Fay is in the bathroom helping Simon out of his clothes, trying to clean his wounds
(calling) Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a hospital
No
Oh, shut up
Turn around
Henry is at the kitchen table with Mary
She watches him suspiciously
He lets her
This kinda thing has happened before
(standing) It won't happen again
She watches him as he walks around the room, browsing
How do you know
He stops and lifts a small framed photo of a soldier off the piano
This your husband
Violated somehow, she gets up and snatches it out of his hands
She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry plays one note on the piano
Stop that
He fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck
She steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door
They look over to see
Mr Deng enter with the notebook
(nods to Mary, then) Mr Fool, what is this
It's poetry
Are you sure
Henry comes over, takes the notebook from him and shoves it in his pocket
Of course 'm sure
corrected the spelling myself
It made my daughter sing
Yeah, well, you know -- that's what poetry does
But she has never spoken in her life
Meanwhile, back in the bathroom
Owww
Keep still
Let me do it
(fed up) Fine
You do it, Simon
don't care
She storms out to the top of the stairs, cocks her hip and whines
Mom
Simon's got a broken rib, his shoulder's dislocated or something, and he won't let me disinfect the gash in his head
Fay, just take him to the hospital, will ya
(stamping her foot) But he won't go
(screaming) Simon Grim, you go to the hospital with Fay right now, do hear me
Simon reaches out and slams the bathroom door
Fay looks from the bathroom door down the stairs to Mary
Mary, her nerves rattled, glances over at Mr Deng, who turns and leaves the house
Henry lights a fresh cigarette, loosens his tie and heads upstairs
-- moment later
Henry throws open the door and enters
He steps over Simon, who is on the floor, folded up against the toilet
We gotta talk
Henry sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes the notebook from his pocket
What the hell were you trying to do when you wrote this thing
Simon just looks at him, not certain what he means
Nothing
Well, you know you wrote it in a kind of iambic pentameter
Iambic what
Verse
He scratches his chin and smokes
Look, in my opinion, this is pretty powerful stuff
Though your spelling is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a little naive, your instincts are profound
But the whole thing needs to be given a more cohesive shape
It can be expanded
Followed through
Unified
(smokes, then) You see what 'm getting at
Simon just stares at him, overwhelmed
Henry drops the notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette
Are you willing to commit yourself to this
To really work on it
To give it its due
In the face of adversity and discouragement
To rise to the challenge you yourself have set
Simon just blinks, looks away and wonders
And don't gimme that wonderstruck ''m-only-a-humble-garbage-man' bullshit, either
It hurts to breathe
(nodding) Of course it does
Simon coughs and Henry leans back and smokes
-- An hour later
Fay cringes outside Simon's room as Henry goes about setting her brother's arm
Like this
Yeah
No
Wait
Don't move
Fuck
There
Are you sure that's right
Yes
Now shut up and lie back
Simon does
Is this gunna hurt
Yes
He pauses, then leans back
You gunna be alright
Simon nods and stares at the ceiling
Henry hands him a towel
Here
Bite on this
(spots blood on it) What's that
(looking) It's blood
From your head
Lie back
Shove that in your mouth and hold on to something
Simon bites down on the towel and grips the edge of the bed with his free hand
Henry sits on his legs and gently raises the broken arm
Outside the door, Fay bites her knuckles
Further down the hall, Mary listens from her bedroom
Okay
You ready
Simon nods
Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces himself
Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight
Aaagghhh
Fay turns and runs down the stairs
Mary backs away into her room and shuts the door
-- Later that night
Henry comes downstairs and stops, tired
Fay is sitting at the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses
She has dolled herself up a little and Henry likes what he sees
He looks her over and she smiles
He sits
She pours
They drink
So, do you have, like, you know, a girlfriend, Henry
No
They drink again in silence
He lights her cigarette and they watch each other closely
Finally, Fay leans on the table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers
Do you find me attractive
Yes,  do
look young for my age, don't
How old are you
How old do you think  am
You look young
(playfully) How young
don't know
Young
But how
mean, do  look more like twenty, or
you know, thirty
He drinks and studies her
She presents her profile
Finally, he leans back
Thirty
Fay jumps up, furious
Listen, you geek, after a couple of drinks plenty of people mistake me for eighteen
She grabs her bag and storms out of the house
Henry watches her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another drink
-- Next morning
thirty-year-old cocktail waitress named Vicky walks up and stops when she sees
Warren, sitting back against the side of World of Donuts, smoking a joint and thinking about his future
She sighs and approaches
Hey, Warren, are you a registered voter
Bug off, Vicky
Unruffled, she hands him a flyer
(reading) 'Saving America From Itself
' What the fuck is this
It's everything you need to know about the upcoming elections and congressman Owen Feer and all the really good things he wants to do for our country
He tokes deeply, then
Oh yeah, like what
He wants to win back this country for us Americans, Warren, and restore some kind of cultural-moral standard to our way of life
Warren looks over the flyer, then reconsiders Vicky
What time's your kid go off to school
(carefully) Nine o'clock
How about  come over and visit you later
Vicky sighs, troubled
She adjusts her waitress uniform and looks mildly offended
Well,  don't know, Warren
mean
Warren gets up, too
Come on
mean it
'm trying to change
Vicky is hard-pressed
She wants to believe him, but knows better
She thinks about it while
Henry passes by and approaches the store
-- Same time
Henry enters and takes Simon's notebook from his pocket
He flips through a few pages and selects one in particular
He tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the register so customers can read it
He winks at Gnoc
She smiles shyly and makes him a coffee
He takes it and moves off to a table just as
Vicky enters
She starts accumulating groceries, placing them on the counter one item at a time
Henry settles down and watches as
Vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice and notices the poem
She reads, holding the orange juice out to her side
Gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of the cigarettes
Vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified expression clouding her face
Finally
Smash
She drops the bottle of orange juice and stands back
Mr Deng and Gnoc jump back, alarmed
Henry tilts his head and pays close attention
(screaming at Mr Deng) How dare you put something like this up where anyone can see it
Mr Deng looks from her to the poem and then over at Henry
Henry urges the man to stand up for himself
(to Vicky) It's poetry
It's pornography
The product of a diseased mind
You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Mr Deng
It made Gnoc sing
(pauses, confused) It's disgusting
There oughta be a law or something
She grabs her things and leaves
Mr Deng holds his head and looks over at Henry
(winking) There's no accounting for taste, is there, Mr Deng
Mr Deng has no idea
He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess
- Later
Henry is at the kitchen table with Simon, working on the poem
Simon is bandaged up, his arm in a sling, black eyes, etc
See, Simon, there are three kinds of there
There's 'There'
----
There are the donuts
Then there's - ---; which is the possessive
It is their donut
Then, finally, there's 'they're'
----'-- contraction, meaning they are
They're the donut people
Get it
Uh-huh
Henry lifts up one of Simon's newly acquired classics
And look, if you're gunna read Wordsworth you've gotta get a more up-to-date edition
This odoriferous tome you're so attached to doesn't even have all fourteen books of the Prelude
And you need notes
Commentary
'll go to the library and find you the best edition they have
Thank you, but that's
'll stop there on my way back from work
Well, yes, maybe not today, but, you know, tomorrow, probably
Quit
My job
Yeah
Why
You need time to write, Simon
To study
To reflect
But  like my job
We all have to make sacrifices vocation like ours, Simon, is not a nine to five thing
You can't put a fence around a man's soul
We think and feel where and when we can think and feel
We are the servants of our muse and we toil where she commands
Simon looks past him and Henry follows his gaze to find
Mary standing at the foot of the stairs, listening to them
She says nothing
She looks Henry up and down, then shakes her head disdainfully and grunts
She throws herself on the couch and turns on the , casting acid glances over at the kitchen
- Moments later
Henry and Simon come outside
She's clinically depressed
Yeah, and what's that mean
(thinking, then) guess it means it's not her fault
Henry wanders out to the road, checking his wallet, then
(sighing) You ever think of leaving
Here
Yeah
To go where
Out there
You know, into the world
Where ever
Simon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods
Yeah,  guess
(reciting) 'Opportunity will step away and make room for a man to pass it by
' Is that from your book
No
found it in a fortune cookie
He pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of his pockets and shows it to Simon
Can  read your confession
No
Not yet
Soon
We'll see
Is it almost finished
(puffing himself up) Well, you know, Simon, a piece of work like this, it's
vocation like ours
You can't put a fence around a man's soul
What 'm trying to achieve, it's
Well, it takes a lifetime really
It's a life's work
(looking around) But soon
Don't worry
'd appreciate your feedback
gotta go
See ya
He hurries away around the corner
Simon walks back to the house and stops when he sees
plain-clothes policeman, Officer Bunuel, drive up and park before the house
Simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on Henry's door
He, of course, gets no answer
-- Later that day
Simon works on his poem at the kitchen table while Fay flips through a magazine and watches
Mary, lying on the couch in her bathrobe, watches her own
The cacophony is augmented by the rattling dishwasher and the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside
Mary looks over at her son, suspicious, and leans off the couch
What are you doing there, Simon
He carefully finishes writing a word, then looks up and pauses
'm writing a poem
Mary looks at Fay, who looks up from her magazine and considers her brother
Then they break out laughing
Simon looks on
They laugh and laugh and laugh
-- Later
Simon is bent over his notebook, consulting a dictionary, hard at work
Amy and three kids are grouped around the register, reading the page Henry taped up earlier
As they read, Amy glances anxiously back at Simon
They finish reading and stand back
So what
It ain't so great
(to Amy, of Simon) That him
Amy nods 'Yes', then leads them towards Simon
Simon scribbles away
(off) Pardon me, Simon
He looks up, sees her, panics and slides away on the seat
Amy looks down and bites her lip, contrite
She sighs
Uhm
Look, ah
'm the editor of the high school newspaper now and
One of the editors
One of the editors, and we
You
wanted to know if we could print your poem in this month's issue
Simon looks around at them all, threatened
Why
Because  think it's great
don't
(to Pat) Who cares what you think
You're a drag
well-known drag
(to Simon) Please
Simon fumbles with his pencil, ill at ease and self-conscious
Then, to get rid of them, he nods his consent
-- That evening
Fay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair
She switches on the  and looks for cigarettes
She finds Mary's pills on the table and remembers to ask
Ma, you take your medication
Mary is lying on the couch
She drags her eyes from the and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the
(to herself) Guess so
She sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine
Henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library books
His eyes brighten when he sees
Fay sitting there wearing only her towel
He knocks
She looks back over her shoulder and sees him
Evening, Fay
(disdainfully) What do you want
've got these books for Simon
She turns away
Well, leave 'em there on the counter, then
He comes in and stacks the books near the sink
Fay pretends to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair anyway, to show more shoulder
This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against the counter, salivating
Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and leans against the fridge
She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her attention to the
She senses him step aside and follows his movements without turning
Suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair
She freezes, waits, wonders
He leans his face down beside her
She looks at him
He looks at her, then down to
Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair
His hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things
Her mouth drops open
He looks back up at her
He grins
Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around herself
Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out of his face and shivers with lust
Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride
Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs
He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze
She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar
Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on
He takes a step up the stairs, then stops
He looks over to the couch and sees
Mary, lying there, sedately amazed
He pauses, then grins
Mary blinks and smiles sleepily
-- Same time
Simon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck
Putting down his pencil, he looks up and sees
Warren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler
Seeing Simon, he waves and approaches
Hey, Simon, you a registered voter
Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly
Warren hands him a flyer
This year when you go to the polls,  want you to consider Congressman Owen Feer
He wants to restore America to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security
He's a good man
He steps over to the register and pays for his beer
Mr Deng glares at him, distrustfully
Warren stops on his way out and snarls at the old man
Immigrant
He leaves
Simon looks down and studies the flyer
-- Same time
Fay lies across her bed in her towel, holding a pose and glancing anxiously back at the door
Finally, losing her patience, she gets up
Where is he
She opens the door and looks out into the hall
He's not there
She steps out into the hall and listens
Henry
Nothing
She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint activity from down below
She proceeds downstairs
She sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living- room and stops
She goes white, her mouth falling open in horror
Henry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch
Sloppy, impassioned, brute sex
(screaming) Mommy
They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue
Mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers
Fay is crushed
She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs
Henry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, uncertain and confused
You bastard
What
Get out
-- Simon is asleep with his head down on the table
He wakes finally and sees
Henry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading the poem
He finishes, shuts the book and drinks
Listen
know a man
He's a big shot in the publishing business
Angus James
Smart, adventurous and tons of integrity
When this thing is ready, 'll recommend he reads it
He'll respect my opinion
Simon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds carefully
man was here today looking for you
(alert) What man
don't know
He drove by the house a few times
Henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair
Jumping to his feet, he paces maniacally
Why do they torment me like this
Why
They're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes
customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves
What do they want from you
They want to suffocate me, Simon
They wanna extinguish me like a flame
Some kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around and asks
But why
They're afraid, that's why
They're afraid of what  might do
What might say
Think
They're afraid of my ideas
He drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon
You and  are alike in this way, Simon
Yeah
We're outsiders
We think and feel too much and too deeply
And the world can't handle that
Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security
Sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead
But now
Now, when we're alive
Now, they wanna burn us at the stake
He drinks, burps, then slams down the can
He glances over at Tim who is still looking on
Scram
Tim hesitates, but then obeys
He gets up and leaves
Henry returns to Simon
For example,  made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now 'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea
Simon blinks
Henry adds
mean to say,  think Fay may be jealous
Simon is deeply confused
He looks ill
He stands and takes a few steps away, staring at the floor
don't want to think about this
Bad move, Simon
Simon stops and looks at him
(pointing at him) poet has got to be able to think about anything
Simon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops
Am  really a poet
Henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the top of his voice
Of course you are
great poet
But you need experience
You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while, for cryin' out loud
He walks to the door
Come on
Let's go out
There's a den of iniquity right across the street
You got any money
He strides out of the store
Simon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old man wipes off the table with a wet rag
-- Later that night
Henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk topless dancers
The place is rocking and the crowd cheers them on
Simon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as
Henry starts stripping
-- Later that night
Simon stumbles in and heads upstairs
But he stops, seeing
Mary, sitting on the top step, smoking
She looks guilty and tense
So does Simon
That man's a bad influence
On who
She gets up and storms into her room
'  -- Moments later
Simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when he sees
Fay, passed out drunk on her bed
Her clothes are half off and her lipstick smeared
She still grips a bottle of tequila in her hand
Simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes
He gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed
Her bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself staring at her thigh
He reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked- up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind
He catches himself, snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket
He flees
'  -- Moments later
Simon is alone in the room with his bed
The pale sheets beckon
He is flushed
He blinks
-- Moments later
He creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books
Sitting at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful position and begins to read
: -- The next morning
Henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its various accessories and a couple of coffees
He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen counter
Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes
(shoving him) Simon
Hey, Simon
(Simon wakes) Come on
got ya some coffee
Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem
Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table
Seeing the computer
What's this
It's a computer
You write on it
He reaches into his pocket
Here's the manual
Simon looks over the computer and flips through the manual
Where'd you get it
stole it
Now listen
Remember how yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation to the readability of
(off) Oh, shit
Not you again
Fay is on the stairs, hungover and disgusted
Henry throws up his hands and gets up to go
Simon,  can't work under these conditions
Yeah
Get outta here, you freak
Get a life
Eat shit and die, Henry
Mary throws open her bedroom door
(screaming) Beast
Fiend
Rapist
Oh, shut up, Mom
Fay stomps back upstairs
Mary slams her door shut
Simon runs out after Henry
-- Moments later
Simon follows Henry out into the street and over towards World Of Donuts
Henry, wait up
am not a rapist
But Henry stops short, seeing
Officer Bunuel enter World of Donuts
Shit
Come on, this way
And he runs down the street in the opposite direction
Simon hangs back, but then follows
-- Moments later
They scramble in and Henry is out of breath
He slumps down into a pew
Keep a look out
Tell me when he's gone
Simon does, but then
Henry, what's going on
Who is that guy
What's he want
He wants to help me
He wants to be my friend
He pats his pockets, looking for his smokes
Simon looks on, baffled
He comes closer
Help you with what
(suddenly) Shhh
He hears something, stands and moves further into the church
Simon hesitates, but then follows
They hear someone crying
Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find
young priest named Father Hawkes
He's a wreck
He looks up from his quiet sobbing and sees
Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed distaste
He lowers his head in shame
Henry moves closer and sits beside the distraught priest
What's wrong
The priest sighs hopelessly
doubt
Henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes
So, you're an honest man
Why beat yourself up about it
He offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts
don't know if there are grounds for faith
Is my vocation relevant
Does it make a difference
difference in what
The world
The way it is
Is this a way to help relieve suffering
Your vocation makes a difference
How can you be so sure
Because vocation is the difference
Only someone who really cares doubts
Listen, father, as  was about to tell my friend Simon here,  am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish
But still, 've gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities  see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home
You seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man
like to think so
But the fact is appreciate depravity
Nevertheless, insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss
Listen, have you got any money
Let's go have a drink
-- Warren is stopping people on their way in and out of World of Donuts
Excuse me, miss, are you a registered voter
Oh God, really  don't know
Well, 'd like to give you some information about Congressman Owen Feer
This man is gunna make a big difference in the lives of every American in the years to come
Thanks, sure
gotta go, thanks
man, Bill, steps up
Pardon me, sir
Fuck off
Right
Warren stands back and loosens his tie
He looks over at Pearl age seven, who is sitting outside the store
What time's your mother get off work
She doesn't respond
He shakes his head and approaches
He sees Fay exit the store
Fay, are you a registered voter
(stopping) Don't you dare talk that way to me
And keep your hands off my brother
Pearl, what are you doing here
'm watchin' her
Fay figures it out and approaches
You and Vicky get back together
gotta regular job now and everything
She lifts a flyer and reads
saw this retard on  this morning
He's gunna be the next president of the United States of America, Fay
Keep dreamin' Warren
The guy's a Nazi
like him
Gimme a light
(lighting her cigarette) He's a decent man
He takes complicated issues and totally simplifies them
And  appreciate that
You still sell dope
No
You know what the problem is with this country, Fay
Me
'm the problem
We live in a culture of poverty and crime, where the work ethic is undermined and male responsibility is made irrelevant
She studies him a moment more, lost, then shakes her head and helps the child off the car
Come on, Pearl, let's go play at my house
She gives you any trouble, Fay, you just let me know
-- An hour later
Henry and Father Hawkes are drinking
Simon leans on the bar, nodding off to sleep
After a while, Father Hawkes leans back and
Do you think human beings are innately bad
Worse than bad
Monstrous
But love that about them
(banging on the bar) Wake up, Simon
Simon falls off his bar stool
-- Moments later
Warren straightens his tie and looks over to see
Simon stagger up
Warren shakes his head in dismay and approaches
Simon steadies himself against the wall of the building
Jesus Christ, Simon, you're letting yourself go to hell
You read that flyer  gave you
What
Simon, wake up and smell the coffee, huh
It's up to guys like you and me to help create a better tomorrow
Simon is lost
-- Moments later
He staggers into World of Donuts and heads for the coffee machine, but stops when he sees Bunuel talking to Mr Deng
Bunuel looks over
Their eyes lock
-- Same time
(to Vicky) Why would  steal a computer from the campaign office
'm not saying you did, 'm just saying one was and since you do have this criminal background
Whack
He slaps her
(pointing) Don't judge me
Simon runs out of the store and limps away towards home as Bunuel storms out in pursuit
Simon tries to run, but Bunuel catches him easily
Look,  know you know him
People have seen you around together
Simon ceases to struggle, but shakes himself free and stands looking down at his feet
Bunuel stands aside and watches him a moment, then reaches in his jacket and brings out his badge
'm his parole officer
Simon studies the badge and waits a little, before asking
What did he do
'm not supposed to talk about that stuff with people
He's my
Friend
Bunuel pauses, then puts away his badge and looks around the parking lot
Mr Deng says you're some sort of a poet, or something
Simon doesn't corroborate this
He looks away and readjusts his sling
Bunuel scratches his head, satisfied and prepares to leave
But first
You tell Henry to call me -- Officer Bunuel -- pronto
Or they're gunna chuck his ass straight back into jail
Got it
Simon shrugs
Bunuel waits a moment, then steps away and gets back in his car
Simon watches as the parole officer drives away and passes
Vicky, look 'm sorry
Don't you even come near me
-- Later
What do you mean, you quit
quit my job
Why
There are things  want to do
Like what
Simon thinks of trying to explain, but then decides not to
'Opportunity will step out of the way to let a man
pass it by
' Are you drunk
Now you have to go out and get a job
am not gettin' a job
(paces, then) Who's gunna look after Mom
will
Fay looks at the ceiling and sighs
Pearl, go outside
They wait as the child goes outside
Mary listens, unseen, from her bedroom door
Fay comes over and frowns at her brother
She's about to lecture him, but he cuts her off
If you treat Mom like a sick person, she's gunna stay like
you know, a sick person
Fay tries to control herself
She sighs tiredly and attempts to reason with him
Simon, don't be retarded
(banging the table) am not retarded
Fay steps back, startled
Simon stands, but can't decide which way to go
He sits back down
can see with my own eyes
Mary turns away from her door and sits on her bed
Fay leans over the stove, where a large pot of water is beginning to boil
Mom can't be left alone with no one to keep an eye on her
Simon is frustrated and lashes out
Well, who's been keeping an eye on her while you've been out getting fucked by every  winner in town
Fay's mouth falls open and she staggers back, hurt
Simon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared
But Fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him, splashing boiling water all over his back
Aggghhhh
Outside, Pearl turns and looks back at the house
Simon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen
Fay falls back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into her hands
-- Later
Fay is crouched on the floor, sobbing, while Simon lies in a tub of cold water
Mary comes in with a pathetic little freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub
She steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down the stairs
She glares back at Fay, who cries even louder as Simon stares up at the ceiling
Mary shakes her head and walks into her room, slamming the door behind her
(sniffling) What happened to her, Simon
How did she get this way
Will it happen to me too
Huh
Why are we so fucked up
Simon has no answers
But he reaches out and touches his sister's hand
-- Evening
Simon comes limping in, all stiff because of his scalded back
He's not familiar with the library, so he stands looking around, trying to figure it out
-- Moments later
He wanders into an aisle, overwhelmed by all the books
Coming to the far end of the aisle, he looks off to his left and sees Henry sitting on a small stool, reading, with ten or twenty open volumes scattered around him on the floor
(approaching) Henry
(looking up and rising) Simon
What are you doing here
Henry
Your parole officer, Officer Bunuel, came by again today
Henry sighs and sits back down
He told me to tell you that if you don't call him they're gunna put you back in jail
Simon
He gave me this number
Simon
He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, well, you know,  was thinking
Simon, just shut the fuck up
Simon blinks and looks down at his feet, unable to respond
Deeply hurt, he simply turns to walk away
But Henry reaches out and grabs his arm
Simon stops, pauses and looks back at his friend
Forgive me
He lets go and turns away on his stool
Forgive me, Simon
Simon comes back over to him
Call him, Henry
Please
Henry gives in slowly to the inevitable
He sighs deeply and stands, handing Simon a book
Look, do me a favor
You got a library card
Yeah
Check this out for me
Simon looks at the cover: Paradise Lost
Milton
Seventeenth century
English
You see, Simon, it's important my 'Confession' dig up the past, comb previous evidence and help chart the historic -- even the aesthetic -- inevitability of my ideas
And
young woman passes by, scanning the stacks
She and Henry have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves away
Henry straightens his tie and watches her go
This place is crawling with chicks, Simon
Wander around
Leer a little
Cop a feel
Impose yourself on 'em
See what happens
make girls uncomfortable
Bullshit
You've got a rough hewn charm that sets 'em on edge
Now, listen,  gotta go
Henry
Henry stops and turns
Simon pauses, then
What did you do
Henry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer
got caught
Simon waits for more but is disappointed
With one final cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, slicks back his hair and strides off
Simon watches him go and frowns, not comforted
He flips through the pages of Paradise Lost
(voice over) 'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable
' -- Moments later
He comes out from the stacks, working his way through the first page of Paradise Lost
He nearly bumps into a girl and they stop and look at one another
He tries to hold her gaze for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and stalks to a table
He sits and leans over the page
After a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at
Another girl, sitting further down the table
She looks up from her reading and returns his gaze
He smiles at her
She gets up and leaves
Simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book
He takes out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees instead
third girl sitting at another table, listening to her Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer
He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to his book
But he can't help himself and glances back over at her
With a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook
(voice-over) Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad
Does she know how beautiful she is
Do people tell her
Does she ever feel stupid
He looks back over at her
She happens to look up and their eyes meet
She smiles
Horrified, he looks down
Why don't  smile when she looks at me
look away
Ashamed of myself
He watches her again, thinks, then writes
Her figure makes me violent
want to somehow break her
But tenderly
How is this possible
Ask Henry
He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, then stops and looks back over at the girl
(voice-over) can't breathe
He tears out the page and folds it in half
Then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work
She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset with a pleasant smile
He places his note on the table before her, then turns and walks quickly away
The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and reads
(voice-over) Why do  do this to myself
And why do  reduce you to only one possibility
These are not even questions anymore
know the answers myself
This isn't a page of notes
It's a letter
letter to you desperate act
You are a miracle to me
can't breathe
By now, Simon is gone from the library
The girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment
-- Evening
Henry enters and sits with Bunuel
How are you, Henry
(frowning) Peachy
Gimme a light
Have you found a job
Henry just glares at him and smokes
How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, did you go over and visit them yet
What happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with
Bunuel looks down, disappointed
tried, Henry
really did
So what happened
Henry, with your background
Well, mean, with your record, they didn't think it'd be right to have you at the neighborhood library
Why not
They thought you'd be a bad influence on the kids
Henry sits back, offended
(adds) Or worse
So my word is not enough
My promise worthless
The fact 've served my time nothing but the emblem of my continuing guilt
Apparently
Henry leans back and sighs, furious and indignant
-- Simon comes in, excited and preoccupied, and finds Fay working at the computer
What's up
(guiltily) Nothing
'm creating my resume
This computer's got a program especially for it
bought some special stationery too
It's scented
Look
She shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he backs away in disgust
It's roses
Simon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the fridge
Can you type my poem into that thing
(shocked) That's your poem
Yeah
(smokes, then) Simon, Mom's right about you
poem's supposed to be a small, delicate kinda thing
Kinda feminine
Gentle
Look at this
You've made a fuckin' telephone book
He places the notebooks on the table and leaves the house
Fay clears the computer screen, pulls the notebooks closer and gets down to work
'  -- Moments later
Simon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting in front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding darkly
was caught
Yes,  was caught
once
was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named Susan
She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, admit, are deep and many
He drinks, then looks at Simon and adds
You appear shocked
(he is) Sorry
Henry stands and leans over the fire
It was a pathetic little conspiracy
transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label me a mere pedophile
As if 'd be ashamed of such a thing
As if Socrates himself hadn't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of Athens
He comes over and takes a beer
He strides around the room, thinking, reflecting
Seven years
Seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression
But what of it
Who cares
Prison's not so bad; particularly if one's a sex offender, free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy
Stops, drinks declares
They were not 'lost years'
He approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece
put them to good use
began my major work
My opus
He glances over at Simon, who sits gripping his beer, watching, rapt
Believe me, Simon, this incident with the girl, prison
It pales to insignificance in the wider context of my career
He pauses and swills back some beer
He brightens up, gets excited
Nothing in comparison to the day my 'Confession' is unleashed
(beginning to pace) What an orgy we'll have then, huh
What shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue
They'll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis
Apoplectic with indignation
Drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm
Their feelings will be hurt
He smashes the bottle in the fireplace
Yes, like a mirror which reflects only the inside of the person before it, my 'Confession' will lovingly render humanity's common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory
He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap
Why should  blush or feel shame before the common lot of humanity, anyway, for a few banal and, again admit, inelegant transgressions
He drinks, sighs and sits back down
After all, really, 'm doing civilization a favor
Simon sits back in awe
He waits a moment and thinks
Finally he stands and approaches the 'Confession'
He reaches out and drags his hand across the notebooks
When can  read it
Henry sits staring into the flames again
He pauses, then
Soon
-- Next day
Simon and Father Hawkes are deep in conversation
We are told not to judge
But to forgive
Not to look into our neighbor's eye to find the bad, but to find the good
(pacing) Now this is difficult
admit
(pause) But having a good friend is not always easy
Simon listens and carefully considers all the priest says
Yes, but
do you think Henry is
dangerous
Father Hawkes pauses, then comes closer and sits
He needs help
Our help
Yours especially
But what can  do
The best parts of himself come to the surface when he's helping someone learn
've seen this
Let yourself be taught
Show your appreciation for his guidance
In this way, you know, perhaps
Well
There's hope for everyone
Even
Even Henry
-- Fay comes walking up through the parking lot with Simon's notebooks and a pile of typed papers
She's a wreck; tear- stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like a weapon
She throws open the door to the World of Donuts and looks around
The place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it was a cafe or student union
Fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter
Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex, will ya
Gnoc gets the Kleenex while Fay overhears two kids near Simon's poem
The violence of the imagery reminds me of early Clash, while the lyricism of the verse recalls, for me, Walt Whitman
would have said Dickinson, maybe even Eliot, and so on
But  agree with the punk roots
Fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back of the store where she finds Simon with Henry, who is holding forth to his friend and the small coterie of high school students surrounding them
The greats all say the same thing: little
And what little there is to be said is immense
Or, in other words, follow your own genius to where it leads without regard for the apparent needs of the world at large, which, in fact, has no needs as such, but, rather, moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice
(drinks) We can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness
This divine fatigue
this
(sitting) Push over
Henry takes the typed manuscript from her and continues
As  tried to make plain in Paris: 'Nous savons que nous avons chute parce que nous savons qui nous sommes
' 'We know we have fallen because we know who we are
' (skeptically) When were you in Paris
(interrupted) That's beside the point
But did they listen to me
Of course not
Fay blows her nose and Simon is concerned
You alright, Fay
(lighting a cigarette) No, 'm not alright
Your poem brought my period on a week and half early
So just shut up
Everybody just shut up
She drops her head to the table and cries
Henry and Simon look on in silence
Then Henry continues
For is this not the best of all possible worlds
Are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos that could not exist without them
Amy's girlfriend, Chris, leans forward studiously and asks
So, do you believe in God
(smokes, shrugs) Unfortunately
(lifting her head) Yeah, but when were you in Paris
(aggravated) At
One
Time
Simon, can  have your autograph
Simon looks from her to Henry
Henry winks at him
Go ahead
But never let yourself be flattered
Simon signs the girl's book
(to Henry) So what about this friend of yours, Hot Shot
The publisher
Who
(reminding him) Angus James
Yeah
Angus James
How about sending this poem to him
Henry seems a bit put upon
Because it's not done yet
(to Simon) When's it gunna be done, Simon
don't know
Well, you oughta be home writing instead of hanging out over here with all your groupies
Hey, 'm not a groupie
Pardon me, swivel-hips
Is that your PowerBook
Yeah
Can  see it
Fay and Amy talk tech as
(continues) The thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first
That kinda thing
You know
Substantiate it
(looking up) What's 'scatalogical' mean
Henry sips his beer and looks at her
Filth, child
preoccupation with excrement
Why
That's what the Board of Education called Simon's poem, yesterday; scatological
Henry reaches across the table and shakes Simon's hand
-- The next day
Fay is frying something on the stove, a cigarette hangs from her lip
middle-aged woman with a press  on her lapel appears at the kitchen door and taps
Hello
Yeah, 'm listening
My name is Edna Rodriguez and  write the human interest column for the Queens County Examiner and  was just wondering if  could have a word with Simon Grim
Intrigued, Fay steps over to the door with her spatula
She looks Edna over, studies her , then steps away and screams upstairs
Simon
(startled) Thank you
Fay comes back over near the door, waving her spatula
You can't talk to him for, you know, too long or anything, 'cause he's gotta, you know
he writes all day
That's all he does
Can you believe that
No response
(calling again) Hey
Simon
Get down here
Simon finally shuffles into the kitchen
Simon, this is Edna
She's from the newspaper
(rapid fire) Simon, the Parents' Association at the local high school are calling your poem pornography
The teachers are defending the students' right to exercise their critical tastes and sensibilities
The county agrees with the Church and considers the poem emblematic of modern society's moral disintegration
How do you feel about these controversial reactions to your poem
Simon says nothing
He just stares at her
(punching him) Simon, answer the woman
Simon just looks away, thinks, then wanders back upstairs
Mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes up to Fay and Edna at the door
need my prescription filled
Mom, this is Edna
Edna, Mom
Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a child
We all thought he was retarded
Everyone did
Never said a word
He masturbated constantly
Had no friends
Till he met Henry
And that's when all the trouble really started
'  -- Henry is shaving
Simon sits in the kitchen, sorting through rejection letters
(reading) Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day
Every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal
But this tract you've sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us
Drop dead
Keep your day job
Sincerely, The Editors
De gustibus non disputandum est
(thinking) You can't argue with taste
About taste
You can't argue about taste
God, Simon
Simon gives up and pushes the letters away, beaten
The other twenty-five are almost as bad
don't know why  bother
Henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall
What do you mean you don't know why you bother
You bother because you know the poem is excellent
Do
Of course you do
'm not so sure sometimes
Can you sit there, look me straight in the eye, and tell me you don't think this poem is great
That it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth
That it is not a genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of existence
Simon holds the stare, overwhelmed
, ah
Can you
Simon looks away, thinks a moment, then looks back at Henry
No
can't
So, you see, you have no choice
He goes back into the bathroom
Simon thinks a while, then
(calling) Can you recommend it to your friend, the publisher
No response
Henry
Can you recommend the poem to him
Still no response
Simon gets up and stands in the bathroom doorway
Henry is shaving
mean,  think it's finished and, for better or worse, it is book length
That might not be as easy as it seems
Why
Well, it's been a long time
My name might not carry as much weight as it once did with Angus
But he's your friend, right
We were close at one time
You said he respected your opinion
Henry puts down his razor and looks at Simon in the mirror
Look, Simon, opinions come and go
He sees Simon looks worried
To be honest; my ideas, my writing, they haven't always been received well or even calmly
They're upsetting
'm a controversial man
He walks around the bathroom, gesticulating
You see, what 'm doing is too radical
Too uncompromising
It'll take time for people to see its value
It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or maybe just
(stops) recommendation from me might do you as much harm as it does good
Simon patiently absorbs all this, then walks through the kitchen and looks across at the 'Confession' notebooks
Henry, why can't  read the 'Confession'
Because certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character
-- Simon talks with Fay as she eats her lunch
Simon, wake up
The guy's in a dream world
He's afraid that his reputation will prevent people from giving my work an honest chance
His reputation as what
As a writer
Gimme a break
He's kinda like in exile
Marginalized on account of his ideas
If he's such a great big fat genius, why doesn't he write books
Like you do
He has
He's written a book
It's almost completed
He's been working on it for years
It's just not published
Yeah,  bet
It's probably disgusting
(defensively) It's a quite serious and difficult piece of work, apparently
Have you read it
No
Not yet
Soon
Certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character
Yeah, well, what ever
Listen, Simon, forget Henry
Go straight up to this Angus James character yourself and make him read your poem
She gets up to go
She's wearing a smart outfit
'm gunna apply for a job at the one- hour photo joint and then go over to the Mall to see about that job in the bank
Make sure Mom takes her pills
See ya
-- Mary is sitting, brooding in front of the , which displays only static white noise
She turns it off with the remote and sits in silence for a moment
She gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where Fay's computer sits
She goes over and reaches up above the fridge, opening the cabinet containing Simon's notebooks
She hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her hands, as if to begin reading
But then she puts them back
She walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, before slowly sitting down and opening it
She lifts her hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making sure no one is there
But, finally, she turns back and begins playing
She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with rusty accomplishment
At one time she was probably quite good
She plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved by the music
But then she stops, pauses, and looks behind her
Simon is standing in the kitchen
He has been deeply affected by her playing
Please don't stop
She stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and closes the piano
She returns to the couch and switches on the
Simon comes closer
He sits
That was nice what you were playing
Yes, it was nice
But it was unremarkable
Simon waits
Eventually
Does that matter
(looking right at him) Yes
It does
She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs
She slams her bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch
He thinks
Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen
He takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet above the refrigerator and goes to the door
He pauses, clutches the poem and goes out
-- Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls into the station
Excited and determined, he gets on
-- Simon travels to New York City
He finds an envelope on the floor to put the poem in
'  -- Mary wakes up and sits on the edge of the bed, feeling regretful about her tone of voice with Simon
-- Moments later
Mary comes down into the kitchen and listens
Simon
No answer
She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes down Simon's notebook
But doesn't
She grabs her pills and is about to take them
But then she stops
She puts them down and goes to the cabinet
She takes down Simon's notebooks and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and begins to read
-- Simon enters a big, posh lobby and checks the registry
-- Moments later
Simon comes out of the elevator and enters the reception area of James Midriff and Sutton Publishing
He walks hesitantly up to the receptionist, a bright and spirited young woman named Laura
Hi, 'll take that
Simon steps back defensively
Aren't you the messenger
No
Are you here to fix the plumbing
'm here to see Mr
Angus James
(amused) Are you
'm not a plumber
Or a messenger was once a garbage man
But now 'm a poet
Laura steps back, cocks her head and removes her designer eye-wear
-- Same time
Angus is at a big table with two other men, Steve and Barry
The book, as we know it, Angus, will be a thing of the past within the next few years
Novels, articles, newspapers will all be downloaded on to our personal computers anyway
So you're telling me to get out of the publishing business
No
But we've got to re-invent the publishing business for the electronic age
Laura knocks
Yes, Laura
'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, but
Angus, there's a particularly wound-up young garbage man out here who seems to have written a poem long poem
And  recall how, at last month's meeting, you stressed the need for us to be on the look-out for more marginalized verse from unestablished quarters of the American scene
Did  say that
Steve and Barry nod
Yeah
You did
Twice
Well,
Make an appointment, Laura
Sometime next month
Right-e-o
And she's gone
(returning) So, anyway, how is the digital revolution going to help me sell books
-- Simon looks disappointed
Why can't  see him now
(sincerely) Because he's a very important man and, well, you're not
Simon just looks down at his shoes
Laura touches his arm and reassures him
Be reasonable
He looks up, pauses, then
Why
-- Same time
don't think people are going to prefer reading books on television, Steve
It won't be television
It'll be interactive
Angus, look, we have a number of charts here
In every home in America the  will be where the  used to be
And it'll be a direct connection to all forms of media
An unprecedented transformation of American social life
We'll all become better informed, more literate, increasingly productive, and
Well, and, like said, we have a number of charts
Laura re-enters
Sorry to disturb you again, gentlemen, but
Angus, 'd like to call security for this one
Though, before do,  just wanted to ask just how marginal the as yet undiscovered voice of American poetry should be
(thinking) Pretty damn marginal, 'd think
Down right controversial, probably
How's he strike you
He's been denounced by his local Board of Education
Oh,  read about him in the paper
Hangs out in a delicatessen somewhere and writes pornography
-- Moments later
Angus comes out to the water cooler and glares at Simon as he gets a drink
Hello, and why do you think  should take valuable time out of my busy schedule to read
He grabs the envelope and sees no title
This
Simon is stumped
He looks over at Laura, who purses her lips and tilts her head
He twists a button on his shirt, thinking, then returns to Angus
Because it's a masterpiece
Really
Yes
(to Laura) Are you hearing this
He's adorable
wouldn't want to waste your time
'm sure you wouldn't and  appreciate you being so straightforward
Thank you
assume you can take straightforward criticism
Simon looks over at Laura
Just say 'Yes'
(looking back) Maybe
Get him a coffee, Laura
Have a seat, Mr Grim
Hold my calls for the next half hour
What about Steve
He doesn't drink coffee
Steve, do you drink coffee
(off) Angus, listen to me
-- Henry paces back and forth
With the fingers of one hand pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in concentration, he dictates to Amy, who is sitting at a table with her laptop computer, typing his every word
In the infinite amplitude of his love, God wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist together in one cosmos
Amy types away, fascinated by Henry's intelligence
In an instantaneous calculation made in eternity, God computes the best possible world and creates it
Fine
This 'decision' by God is uncontingent and eternal rather than temporally or ontologically sequential
Stops, zeroing in on his point
How do you spell that
What
Ontologically
--
Don't you have some kinda spell-check on that thing
Never mind
It is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good
The intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain, so to speak
He smokes, drinks, paces some more
Amy waits with bated breath, devastated by his obscure profundity
He comes back and sits beside her, reaching his conclusion
The good of freewill must entail real choices for sin
She gazes at his profile, in love
Henry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently
She leans over close and whispers in his ear
He turns and looks at her, alarmed
Listen, Amy, back off
'm on parole
You feel the same way
can tell can see it when you look at me
Henry jumps up and looks around, paranoid
He keeps his voice down and points at her
Hey
don't look at you
Yes you do
In the street
In the parking lot yesterday
That night on the highway
look at a lot of people that way
Disappointed, Amy turns away and sulks
You think 'm stupid
Henry sees she's genuinely upset and feels bad
He sits back down and lays his hand on hers
No, as a matter of fact,  think you're a real bright kid and  like that about you
(looks up, pouts) You do
Now Henry tries to scare her away
He leers at her
like it so much 've got half a mind to do perverse things to you
Right here
Right now
Things you might just learn to like
She just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries to imagine this
She takes her laptop and leaves, confused and blushing
Henry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself
-- Angus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at Simon as they walk down the hall
This is really quite unbelievably bad, my friend
mean, 'm all for experimentation and 've made a career out of a healthy disregard for convention, but
Look, this is profoundly irrelevant material
This is only my opinion
But it's an opinion  value highly
Goodnight, Laura
Call Norton Press
We're still on for tomorrow
Simon looks pale as Angus strides towards the elevator
've been wrong before as a publisher
But  refuse to admit 've ever been wrong as a reader
You have talent, admit
You have an innate sense of the musicality of language
good ear, maybe
But you do nothing significant with it
And this twisted reasoning that poses as
conviction or insight, it's
well, it's embarrassing
They reach the elevator and stop
Simon tries to catch his breath
Why did you bring this thing to me, anyway
(weakly) friend of mine spoke of you
He said you had a lot of integrity
Yes, well, of course,  do
But 'm not crazy, am
Who is this person
Do  know him
Simon hesitates, almost decides against it, but then
Henry Fool
Angus looks back at him
Simon waits
Angus looks aside, thinks, then shakes his head
Never heard of him
Simon just looks at him blankly, confused
The doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator
He's gone
Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet
He is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath
His poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor
(off) remember Henry
Simon doesn't register this right away
But then he looks up and over at the receptionist
Laura stands and comes around her desk
She pauses, seeing his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem
Handing it to him, she explains
He used to be the janitor here
He just stares at her, demolished
/  -- Later
Simon dumps his poem in a trash can, pauses, then enters the subway
-- Henry is leaning on the counter, flipping through pornographic magazines and smoking
(off) Henry, put those magazines back
'm just looking at the pictures
It's not good for you
Henry flips through pages and nods, impressed
learn so much from these magazines, Mr Deng
refuse to discriminate between modes of knowing
And you can't smoke in here anymore
Henry looks up, outraged
Why not
It's the law
Henry throws his cigarette to the floor, steps on it and returns to his magazine
This place is losing all its charm, Mr Deng
Business is good
The kids, they hang out all day and drink coffee, talk about art and read poetry
Henry shakes his head in dismay and studies a centerfold
It's just a fad, Mr Deng
These kids today, they're just slaves to fashion
-- Same time
Fay comes in, hot and tired from walking around in high heels
Anybody home
Mom
She stands on the stairs and hears the water running in the bathroom
Ma, that you
No answer
She discovers she's out of cigarettes
-- Henry is leaning on the counter with a six-pack of beer, pleading with Mr Deng
Come on, Mr Deng
How much do  owe you
Twenty-five dollars
That can't be right
And so what
My credit's good
Warren comes in
Henry
Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of bucks  can borrow
Warren reaches for his wallet
Listen, Henry,  wanna remind you to vote this Thursday
Ah, yes, of course
When noble minds shrink from the task of leadership scoundrels will rush in to fill the void
(takes cash) Thanks
It's every American's right blessing
Yet another opportunity to save America from itself
Henry pays Mr Deng for his beer
'  -- Moments later
Fay bangs on the door
Hey, Henry, you in there
Gimme a cigarette
No answer
She tries the door
It's open
She hesitates
Henry
She goes quietly in
-- Moments later
Henry steps out of the store and stops when he sees Amy standing there, pouting
He looks away and sighs
Amy picks at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip
Henry
Henry smokes
Yeah
What kind of
Well,  mean
What kind of
perverse things would you do to me
It's more than he can stand
He holds his head
Take a powder, cupcake
No, really
Evaporate
Crushed, she breaks out in tears and flees
-- Same time
Simon comes in, furious and throws open the fridge
He finds nothing to eat or drink
He slams the door, then hears the water running in the bathroom upstairs
He stops and listens
The bathroom door; the water heard running steadily
Simon turns away then sees
The poem notebooks face down on the table
He thinks
The bathroom door; the water heard running
'  -- Moments later
Henry comes into his house, hot and bothered, cradling his six-pack
But he stops, listens, then steps through the kitchen towards the living-room
He stops in the entrance and sees
Fay on the floor of the living-room, reading his 'Confession', her mouth hung open in an astonished ''
He drops his six-pack and
She spins around, caught in the act
Henry stands in the doorway, pent up, sweating and with perverse things on his mind
Fay, her hands palm down on the floor behind her, bites her lip, coquettishly
Henry looks her over like she was something good to eat
She feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side with a breathless little shudder
He steps nearer, stands over her and she looks up at him
-- Same time
Simon climbs the stairs to the bathroom
'  -- Same time
Henry and Fay kissing passionately
-- Same time
Simon knocks on the bathroom door
'  -- Same time
Henry and Fay groping and shoving one another as they stagger from room to room
-- Same time
Simon bangs on the bathroom door
'  -- Same time
Fay falls to the couch
-- Same time
Simon crashes through the door and finds
Mary, kneeling over the edge of the tub, her wrists slit and the blood running down the drain, the shower raining down over her back
Simon looks on in horror
'  -- Same time
Henry tears open his trousers
-- Same time
Simon lifts Mary from the bathtub
'  -- Same time
Henry and Fay clutch and grind and heave
-- Same time
Simon drags his mother from the bathroom and down the stairs
'  -- Same time
Henry and Fay are making mad, passionate love, oblivious to the world around them
-- Same time
Simon drags Mary through the house
'  -- Same time
Henry and Fay fuck
-- Same time
Simon drags Mary out the kitchen door and into the yard, looking desperately for help
He reaches the street, her limp body hanging grotesquely before him, and looks helplessly up and down the block
: -- Simon, Henry, Mr Deng, Fay, Gnoc and Bunuel stand with Father Hawkes at the grave
Let us pray
Lord, grant that peace be within reach for our friend, Mary
May the pain and confusion she endured on earth be fought through in the after life, so that she may enter the Kingdom of Heaven and live in the light of God
Amen
He sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop carnations at the grave
Simon and Fay remain there looking down at the coffin
Henry waits for them a few yards away, wishing he could help, but feeling out of place
-- Simon is back working on the garbage truck
He collects garbage and throws it in the truck as Henry, who is just along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and pulls the lever whenever Simon tells him to
So  was a janitor
So what
But Angus James said he didn't even know you
Henry shrugs and qualifies
Well,  mean, we weren't like bosom buddies or anything
But we used to talk sometimes
In the elevator
In the morning
He said he liked my ideas
Being a janitor's a good job if you're a writer
Especially the night shift; all that time to think and develop my ideas
Do it
Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed
Anyway, he hated my poem
Well, what the hell does he know
He wouldn't know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg
To hell with him
He's not the only publisher in the world
But nobody likes it
(smokes) It's true
prophet is seldom heeded in his own land
Remember that
Do it
Henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something in amongst the garbage
Hey, look, treasure
Henry steps down and leans over into the garbage
Simon joins him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray piece of machinery
What is this
Brass maybe
Some kinda copper
It's a ring
Jewelry
think it's a gasket
fitting from off of that old refrigerator over there
Henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and Simon jumps on the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away
Henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops when he sees Pearl age seven
'  -- Henry comes up the street with Pearl age seven on his back
He walks into Vicky's yard and finds Warren lifting weights in the garage
Hey, Warren,  found Pearl wandering around by the garbage dump
He lost
Who lost
Warren rests
He sits up on the bench and takes a toke off the joint he has waiting
Congressman Feer
(realizing) Oh
Well, you know
Somebody's gotta lose
What's the fucking use
You make sacrifices
You try to be a decent human being
Try to contribute something meaningful to society
And what happens
They lose to a bunch of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups
don't give a shit anymore
People deserve what they get
Henry pauses, then leads Pearl age seven towards the house
Warren lies back down and continues his lifting
'  -- Moments later
Henry knocks on the door as he enters
Vicky
No answer
He comes in and finds her sitting on the couch with a drink
She's got a black eye
What happened to you
He's a good man, Henry
Nobody's perfect
guess not
He's terribly disappointed
found Pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet
Pearl comes over and stands beside her mother
Thanks
She gets scared
And you don't
Vicky caresses Pearl's hair, then drinks and looks over at Henry
love him
-- Moments later
Bunuel is waiting when Henry walks in and steps up to the beer cooler
(alarmed) Where's the beer
No more beer
Coffee
Espresso
Cappuccino
Cafe au lait
Carrot juice
Herbal tea
Henry looks at the man, disgusted, then falls in to a seat and motions to Gnoc, who is now the waitress
double espresso and a jelly donut, Gnoc
(to Bunuel) You mind paying
My credit's no good here anymore, apparently
(nods amiably) Did you go to the employment agency today, Henry
No, but it's
Simon's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck
Listen, 'm a little concerned about your friend
Simon
Seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in the library
Get outta here
When
'm not sure
It couldn't have been Simon
It almost certainly is
He mentions you
Look
He unfolds a print-out of the letter
Henry reads and Bunuel leans over, pointing out
'Her figure makes me violent
want to somehow break her
But tenderly
How is this possible
Ask Henry
' Henry thinks this over, gulps back some espresso and nods his approval
Then
Bunuel, this is obviously a love letter
(taking it back) We've had complaints
Where did you get it
She posted it on the Internet
Oh, the slut
She was trying to warn other girls about a potential rapist
(smokes) Is all this true about the Internet
About how you can get pornography on it
Well, yeah, sure
It's a big problem
You can send dirty pictures and everything
On the Internet
Yeah
Henry is impressed
No kiddin'
Bunuel gets up to go
See you on Thursday, Henry
(thinking) Sure
See you
(calls the waitress) Gnoc, gimme one of these double espressos to go, will ya
He is having ideas
-- Moments later
Fay, still dressed in black, is tapping away on the keys to the computer, surfing the Internet, as Henry appears at the kitchen door, gripping his tall double espresso
Hello, Fay
Go away
You gotta get outta the house, Fay
You can't blame yourself for not being here
You did all you could for her
She turns and glares at him
Is there something you want
Henry stops, pauses, looks away
Then
You got the Internet on that contraption
(resumes typing) Yeah
So what
He changes the subject again, preoccupied and continues tenderly
Look Fay, about, you know, between us -- what happened
don't wanna talk about it, Henry
He sighs and drinks his coffee, then looks back at her
Type a part of Simon's poem onto the Internet
(stops) What
Go ahead
No
Why not
Because
Come on, Fay
It's a great idea
don't know if he would want us to do that
Sure he would
Just the first ten verses
Fay is tempted
don't know
He'll thank you for it later
Frowning, she reconsiders
She gets up and takes the notebooks from the cabinet above the fridge
She flips through the pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer attitude
Henry
But he's gone
It's as if he has vanished into thin air
She sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the Internet
-- Moments later
Henry comes back into the store, satisfied with himself
He finishes off his coffee, tosses away the cup and takes a pornographic magazine from the rack
He leans on the counter where Mr Deng is busy working and flips through the pages
Gimme another one of those tall double espressos, Mr Deng
Mr Deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine
You gunna buy that
'm just looking
Well then put it back
There's this fascinating story about a famous rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in their hotel room and inserted a live fish into her vagina
Mr Deng shakes his head and frowns
(explains) They say she had numerous orgasms
Henry, you need to do something with your life
Get a job, or something
mean, it wasn't the entire fish, it was just, you know, the nose
The nose of the fish
Mr Deng brings over the coffee
Henry is surprised to notice he is not riveted
You don't find that interesting
No
Henry closes the magazine and puts it back
Leaning on the counter, he sips his coffee and ponders
You ever wonder what it would be like to have sex with an animal, Mr Deng
That coffee is free
Just take it and get out of here
mean, some dogs are almost as big as people and often more attractive
Mr Deng just goes back to work, leaving Henry there at the counter thinking big thoughts
-- Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street and pauses in front of his house
He jumps down and the truck barrels away
'  -- Simon taps at the door
She looks over at him and he sees she's been crying
He comes into the room and she sits up on the edge of the bed
Did you see him
He came by this afternoon
Did you talk
No
He comes over and sits beside her
He thinks a moment, then
You've got to tell him, Fay
He thinks 'm a slut
And she starts crying again
Simon awkwardly touches her shoulder, then moves his hand away
Fay pulls herself together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom
, Moments later
Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano
He looks ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso
He is staring sickly at 'the ring'
Henry
Simon,  don't feel so good
What's wrong
feel all kinda clammy
And damp
Simon lifts the coffee container and smells it
How many of these did you have
Henry tries to remember
He squints
Seven
Simon puts the container down and sits at the table
Henry, we have to talk
Can  use your toilet
Fay's taking a shower
Henry grabs his stomach
He presses his hand against his chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring
How much you think  can get for this
He looks at Simon
(pauses) Henry, Fay's pregnant
Henry looks at him
Fay's pregnant with your child
Henry lets this sink in
He stands and the room tilts
White with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut
Moments later
Fay is in the shower as
Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and trousers
She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower curtain
He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet just in time to begin shitting his brains out
Fay crouches, terrified and disgusted, in the shower
Jesus, Henry
Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air
Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly
Finally, he's done
He hangs with his face out over his knees, sick, exhausted and in shock
Fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower
She creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned
Hey, Henry
You
He is destroyed, staring down at
The 'ring' he still holds in his hand
Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from him
He doesn't resist
She lifts it up and breathlessly admires it
Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words
Oh
Oh, Henry
And she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating and spent, on the toilet
-- month later
Mr Deng and Bunuel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into the church foyer
Once inside, he shakes them off and they stand back
He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out of his eyes
He paces back and forth like a caged animal, then stops, sees
Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon
She is beautiful
Henry calms down, deeply affected
Fay smiles down the aisle at him
Henry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and strides up the aisle
Also present at the ceremony are Vicky and Warren
Gnoc is maid of honor
-- Later
Henry holds Fay's hand and repeats after Father Hawkes
, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife
, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife
And do promise before God and these witnesses
And do promise before God and these witnesses
To be your loving and faithful husband
To be your loving and faithful husband
In plenty and in want
In plenty and in want
In joy and in sorrow
In joy and in sorrow
In sickness and in health
In sickness and in health
For as long as we both shall live
For as long as we both shall live
The gasket everyone is now mistaking for a ring is lifted high before the altar
Bless,  Lord, this ring, that he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in your peace and continue in your favor until their life's end
The gasket is placed on Fay's finger
Whom God has joined, let no man separate
The doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak and everyone turns from the altar to see
Amy enter
She steps in and stands there, alarmed, clutching a long scroll of fax paper
Oh, shit
Simon, do something
Simon walks down the aisle to see to Amy
The guests watch and wait
As Simon reaches her, Amy looks away from the altar and shows him the fax scroll
Look
He studies the fax and recognizes his poem
He grows concerned
Where did you get this
It's all over the Internet
Simon looks up the aisle at
Fay and Henry
They look away, caught
They're even talking about it on the news
Confused, Simon starts for the door, shoving the fax in his pocket
Fay steps down from the altar
Simon
Amy hurries along beside him
There's a guy from the radio station over at World of Donuts and a story in the newspaper about some kids burning down a school near Boston
-- Later that evening
The whole neighborhood is celebrating Fay's wedding
The music is loud
The people are drunk
The place is a shambles
big dance number is playing
Amidst all the festivities, though, Simon and Bunuel have the small  propped up on top of the fridge, following the evening news
(on ) It all started right here in Queens, Jim, at World of Donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and -- indeed -- the world
Fay leads the neighbors in the dance
(on ) This is outrageous
Measures must be taken
Have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet, and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer
Is this what we have come to
Not the transmission of our highest ideals, but a cynical, atheistic delirium
Henry and Fay dance, surrounded by the dancing neighbors
(on ) Poetry of this kind, and this poem in particular, is,  think, a worthy form of desperation; a digression on the extremes of human experience; of solitude, of community
It is perhaps alarming, even upsetting to some -- myself included -- but it must be allowed to exist
Henry throws an arm around Warren, who stands looking dejected in the doorway, and raises his glass to the happiness in the room
(on ) Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost
He did not mention Simon Grim by name, but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music, drugs and contemporary poetry
The  is switched off
It's later now
People are passed out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting around the table
Fay steps back from the , drains a glass of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding gown
She hugs Simon, who is deeply unsettled by the news of his growing infamy
God, Simon,  mean, like, you're a total fucking rock star
-- huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors, trying to get a peek at their hero, Simon Grim
Angus comes away from the window
He stands and regards Simon, who is sitting at a table tearing a napkin to shreds
'm willing to negotiate, Simon
know, it's just
You've had other offers
Well, yes
But
What
Why have you reconsidered
Because  think your writing will be tremendously successful
But you don't like it
It's growing on me
What made you change your mind
He points to the fans outside
Other people's responses
don't live in a vacuum, you know
Two months ago  didn't have the proof of your poem's appeal
Now  do
Simon thinks this over, but says nothing
Angus comes over and lays his hand on his shoulder
Consider my offer carefully
Get some professional advice
'll call you tomorrow
Simon nods
-- Moments later
Angus emerges and has to fight his way through the throng of excited adolescents
He reaches his limo and gets in
But he pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd
Simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and shouting for autographs
Angus shakes his head, impressed
-- Simon consults Father Hawkes
What were the terms
hundred thousand in cash up front
Royalties
seventy/thirty split
Well, that could be better
But it is a hundred thousand dollars up front
Guaranteed money
You could use that
So it's a good deal
Of course it's good
So  should take it
No
Try to get him up to a hundred and fifty thousand
-- Evening
Henry stalks along, all fired up
Simon tries his best to keep up with him
've let myself down, Simon
've let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity
How did get here
How did this happen to me
'm going to be somebody's father need time to think
To write
Time to finish my 'Confession'
can't work for a living
It's impossible
tried once
My genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet
He collapses extravagantly
This is how great men topple, Simon
Their hearts are in the right place too much of the time
They get sidetracked
Distracted
Oh
How could  have been so careless
Henry, please, let me read the 'Confession'
No
Not now
It's not done
'm all washed up
'm finished
Angus James is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy
He'll read your book and seriously consider publishing it
If  ask him to
'm certain
Henry glances back at his friend, digesting this
He thinks it over, then
Really
You really think so
Having finally got through to him, Simon comes forward, anxious to help Henry
'll insist he publish the 'Confession'
He paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the first time in his life displaying something like pride or arrogance
(adds) Or  won't let him publish my poem
Henry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence of increased self-esteem
He realizes the profundity of the gesture
You'd do that
You'd do that for me
Simon stares off into the distance
You saved my life
Henry is moved
He stands and comes forward
He grabs his friend by the shoulders and turns him around
Do you realize what you're saying
(pausing) owe you everything
Henry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and extends his hand
Simon smiles
Henry smiles
They shake hands
'  -- Simon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking off at
The stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'
/ -- Henry stands outside, watching his door
'  -- Simon lifts the first volume, opens it and begins reading
He sits
-- Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously
'  -- Simon strides the length of the living room, reading
He stops, frowns
'  -- Simon reads in front of the fire
/ -- Bunuel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks to himself
Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him
He looks at her, but says nothing
She sighs and goes back inside: turning off the lights
'  -- The next morning
Simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve as the morning sun streaks into the room
Finally, he finishes and slowly closes the book
He stands and crosses the room
Leaning against the wall, he removes his glasses and rubs his aching eyes
-- Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep on the back stoop
-- Simon stares into a glass of water
Fay sits ten feet away, waiting
Finally
It's really that bad
It's terrible
'  -- The 'Confession' lies on the big desk
Angus' hand comes down upon it
You've read this
Yes
And you want me to consider publishing it
Yes
As part of our deal
Yes
Simon, this book, it's
It's really quite bad
That's what you said about my poem
Angus pauses and figures
He changes the subject
'm offering you a very real expression of my faith in your writing
Two hundred thousand dollars and a sixty/forty split
But just exactly what is the nature of your faith in my writing
Look, Simon, you don't require my admiration
You require my experience as a publisher
And that experience leads me to believe your poem will make more money than any book of poetry ever published
In history
Virtually make you a household name within two years
You'll never have to work on a garbage truck again, assure you
Or do anything else for that matter
Whereas this 'Confession' by Henry Fool
He is at a loss for words
The most  can say for this is
The man is a scoundrel
He taught me everything  know
No
He encouraged all that was expressive in you to become manifest
He inspired you to act
He influenced your perception
Simon waits a while, staring at his shoes
How about if my advance is only a hundred thousand
It's not about money, Simon
We could split the royalties seventy/thirty
will not publish Henry Fool's 'Confession'
Simon sits and lets this sink in
Angus waits, then
Will you sign the contract
Simon continues looking out at the city
Angus waits, but there is no response
Finally, Simon turns, pauses and slowly crosses the room
He sits at the table and looks down at the contract
He signs
-- Fay is in labor
Henry helps her into her coat as they rush for the door
-- Moments later
Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking at Hawkes, Bunuel and Mr Deng
Gnoc runs out to get Fay
-- Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van
The van pulls out
-- Henry drives recklessly
Fay rolls around in the back
-- Fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall
She is gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her
-- Fay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her
She is scared
She looks over at
Henry, looking in through the window
He looks scared too
Fay is sedated by gas
Henry is taken away by the Nurse
Fay stares up at the ceiling
-- Henry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted
Simon comes running up the hall and finds him
It's late and no one is around
He sits down beside Henry and shakes him
Henry wakes
Simon
You're here
He sits up and Simon sits beside him
What happened
(coughs) It's a boy
And Fay
She's alright
Simon sits back, relieved
Then he remembers the rain-soaked shopping bag he has with him
He pulls out a couple of cans of beer and hands one to Henry
Thanks
They look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the coast is clear
Then they pop open the beers and toast
They drink
Then
How did it go
Simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room
He looks out of the window and gathers his strength
Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't like your 'Confession'
Henry looks at Simon blankly, then blinks and looks away
Ah
see
Well, what now
What do you mean
Did he suggest changes
Silence
Simon comes back and sits again
No
He didn't
mean, after all, there are things can do to make it more accessible
Accessible
can soften up some of the language and make it read easier
Take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang, so to speak
can change its mode
Make it more of a conventional novel instead
Simon just stares at him blankly, then sighs and shakes his head
No
Don't
(laughing) Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist appreciate your protectiveness, but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things
Simon comes over and lays his hand on Henry's shoulder
No
Really, Henry
Don't
What are you saying; that it doesn't merit revision
'm saying
Angus James didn't like it
He steps away and sits
Henry pauses, then approaches and leans down over him
Well, did you tell him what you think
What  think doesn't matter
Yes, it does
You've got to use your influence with him
gave it to him to read and he hated it
What more can  do
You can refuse to let him publish your poem
can't do that
You said you would
That was before  read your book
(hit hard) Oh
(looking up at him) signed the contract, Henry
Henry stands there a moment longer, then lowers himself into the nearest seat, weakened
Look, Henry, what did you expect
don't know
Honesty, perhaps
(indignantly) Look, if  had told you, when at first  read it, that  thought it was no good, what would you have done
would have respected your opinion
And insisted that there's no accounting for taste
Well, is there
Simon's words catch in his throat
He turns away, frustrated
don't know
didn't bring it to Angus because  thought it was good
brought it to Angus because you're my friend
(staggered) Oh how perfectly enormous of you, Simon
(explodes) Look, Henry,  did it
wrote wrote poetry because you told me to
worked
worked while you sat back and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow, stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas
Is that such a priority
Is that some sort of measure of a man's worth
To drag what's best in him out into the street so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick
(sits, tired) Maybe
Maybe it is
Henry just stares at him, stands, then turns on his heel and waves him off
You must be pretty impressed with yourself, huh
The all too obviously talented new man, the important new voice, the early clue to a new direction, or whatever, etc
, etc
, etc
popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd
You want to be liked more than you know, Simon Grim
You'd be nowhere without me and you know it
Simon hangs his head, destroyed
'm leaving
Henry is scared all of a sudden
But he puts on a defiant exterior
Yes
It's time you left
He stands, drinks and walks over to the window
saw you for what you were in the beginning, Simon
hold no grudge and 'm certain you will, in time, leave some serious and small dent in this world
(weakly) The world is full of shit
Henry take advantage of Simon's disillusionment and puts on a big show of secure wisdom
The world is full of shit
It's true
And you have to walk through it
That's your part
'm sorry
But you're no good at it
Perhaps 'm not
Perhaps  wasn't made to walk through shit
Go on now
Leave
Do what you're good at
Go
Simon sits there a moment, numb with grief
Henry, red in the face, stares at the floor
Suddenly, Simon stands and walks out
Henry looks up and watches him go
He can hardly believe it
He almost raises his voice and apologizes, but can't
He lowers his head again and covers his face with his hands, listening to Simon's footsteps receding through the halls
Simon walks on, away from us, down the hospital corridor
-- Seven years later
Fay bangs out of the kitchen door with her seven-year-old son Ned
Frazzled and overworked, she grips a loaded laundry basket to her side as she sits Ned down on the curb and points at him
Play
The kid sits still, obviously guilty of some unspeakable mischief, as Fay storms back into the house
He looks around, bored, then brightens up when he sees
Henry, coming up the street, hanging from the back of a garbage truck
-- Moments later
Henry enters with Ned on his back and the bartender, Patty, goes ballistic
Henry, what did  tell you about bringing the kid in here
Say hello to Patty, Ned
Hi
She suddenly becomes all soft and cuddly
How you doin', sweetie
You wanna Coke
He nods and Henry stands him on a stool at the bar
So what did you learn at school today, Ned
Anything
He shakes his head
Here, 'll teach you something
He hands Ned a cigarette and lights it for him
Ned takes a drag and coughs
Horrible, isn't it
Ned nods in agreement
It burns
See
That'll teach ya
Here, sip this
And he offers the kid his whiskey
-- Same time
Fay comes out of the house and looks for her son
Ned
She comes out to the street and looks around
Ned
'  -- Fay comes up looking for Ned and sees
Pearl, age fourteen, come out of Vicky's House
She is fourteen years old now
Warren steps out the door and grabs her by the arm
She shakes him off
He slaps her
She runs down the steps and glares back at him
(pointing at her) 'm warning you, Pearl
Pearl turns defiantly away and walks into the street
-- Same time
Henry is teaching Ned how to tip a topless dancer
dancer stands on the bar and stretches her garter as Ned slips a dollar bill in beneath it
That's it
That's it
Perfect
Some other guy down the bar is reading a newspaper
Hey, Fool, it's about your friend -- what's his name
Your brother-in- law
Henry looks over
The guy, Bill, shows him the article
What about him
(reading) The controversial and reclusive American poet Simon Grim has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature
The Swedish Academy, who will confer the award late next week, praised Mr Grim for works of great and difficult striving, for the rendering of the desperate, the ugly and the mundane in a language packed with our shared human frailties
God, they must be hard up for geniuses to pin medals on because, listen, gotta tell you, when  first met this guy he didn't even know what an iambic pentameter was
He's a fraud
Keep a lid on it, Bill, you're outta your league
Stir things up so as to stay in the newspapers
That's his racket
He's a great American poet, you dumb fuck
Poet, my ass
could puke all over a piece a loose leaf and be more profound than he is
Come over here and say that and 'll cripple ya in three different ways, you boozed-up Philistine
Henry
Henry and Ned crouch and quiver -- caught
Fay strides up to the bar and grabs the kid
Listen, you degenerate, 've had about enough of this
(smells Ned's breath) Ned, have you been drinking
The kid checks with Henry then looks back at Fay and nods
Fay looks at her husband, outraged
(explains) His throat hurt from smoking
Fay slaps him across the face -- hard -- and the place goes quiet
Henry shakes his head clear and she pokes him in the chest with her finger
Henry, don't come home tonight
'm warning you
Don't come home at all
Ever
And she storms out with the kid
Henry snaps his jaw back into place, then looks at Patty and Bill and shrugs
He knocks back his drink and motions for another
-- Later (evening)
Henry staggers out of the back door of the Inferno and comes across Mr Deng sitting against the wall of the store, watching the basketball game on a small
World of Donuts vibrates with loud music
Who's winning
Nobody
Henry gestures to World of Donuts
What's going on in there
We gotta have rock 'n' roll shows these days, Henry
The poetry readings just don't pay the bills no more
What did  tell you
It was just a fad
told you that
told everyone
Did you hear about Simon
It was on the news today
Yeah yeah yeah
So what
Nobel Prize
Anybody can get one of them these days
That's the problem, with this world, Mr Deng
Nobody's got any standards anymore
You seen Fay
You better sleep in my office tonight, Henry
She was very angry
You've gotta let her cool off
can't sleep in there with that racket
Suit yourself
Henry considers his options, then
-- The place is abandoned
Henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep on an old couch, finds Pearl age fourteen
She is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and scared; a troubled kid
What are you doing here, Pearl
You want some
(pauses) Some what
Pearl comes towards him
He is kneeling with his face at her crotch level when she reaches him
She holds out a bottle of cheap rot-gut wine
Realizing, he takes it and drinks
He winces
Shit
Pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying her underwear
Henry stands and searches for something to sit on
Come sit here
She pats the couch beside her
He comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits
He hands back the bottle
She drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames
That's what my dad always says
What
(dead) 'You want some
' Henry looks away, uncomfortable
She slides her gaze over to him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot
People say you were once in jail for having sex with a girl my age
That was a long time ago
He gets up and stands at the window
Pearl age fourteen watches him closely as she drinks, then
You want some
He looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder
Henry is sweating
You oughta get outta here, Pearl
was here first
Go home
You go home
Fine
And he starts to leave
But Pearl sits up
(scared) Wait
Henry stops and looks back at her
(hanging her head) can't go home
(concerned) Why not
He beat her up again
Henry holds his head, tries to sober up
He looks around the room, then focuses on the girl
Warren beat up your mom
Pearl stares at the floor
She glances over at him, then back down at the bottle gripped in her hands
She nods
Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself tentatively to the couch
Is she alright
She says nothing for a moment, then
(sadly) Do you think 'm pretty
Henry lifts his hand and covers his face
He looks up at the ceiling and sighs
He returns to Pearl
Does she need help
Pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh
Looking up at him, with tears rolling down her face, she suggests
'll suck your cock if you kill him for me
Henry jumps away from her and Pearl throws herself down on the couch, covering her face
'  -- Moments later
Henry barges in and starts searching for
Vicky
Vicky, it's Henry from across the street
Vicky
He runs through the house, checking the rooms
He throws open the door to the bedroom and finds
Vicky, sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking
She has a black eye and a swollen cheek
(taken back) Vicky
(standing) What do you think you're doing, you idiot
(off) Hey
Henry looks over and sees Warren stumble drunkenly out of the bathroom
What are you doing in my house
(to Vicky) It's about Pearl
Vicky looks troubled
She sits back down with a sigh
Mind your own business, Henry
(shoves him) Yeah, who the hell do you think you are, anyway
Henry falls back and looks at Vicky
She looks away
Henry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard shove
Warren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts into viciousness
He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where he hits the wall and collapses
As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs
Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor
Warren kicks him in the side of the head
Vicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears
Warren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees
Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety
Warren grabs his feet and drags him out
As he is dragged across the floor, Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it
He rolls over on his back as
Warren lunges down at him again and
Ah
Warren is stabbed in the heart
Henry can't believe it
Warren can't believe it
He stands there in the middle of the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of his chest
Henry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the back door and coughs up a few of his teeth
Vicky steps into the hall from her room and shudders
Warren sits at the table, stunned
He looks from the screwdriver to Vicky, then
Fuck
He falls to the floor
-- Henry staggers away, limping
He comes to the intersection at the end of the block and doesn't know which way to run
Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest
He runs towards the highway
-- Later
Fay is wired beyond belief
Trying to listen attentively, but still too overwhelmed to maintain her concentration
(off) It is true your husband served seven years in prison for statutory rape
Yes
It is
And when was that
That was
dunno
Fifteen
Sixteen years ago
And when were you married
We were married seven years ago
Were you aware at all of the victim's relationship with his daughter
Pardon me
The girl, the daughter, Pearl
She had been having sexual relations with her father
Fay is overwhelmed
didn't know that
No
Pearl claims she offered your husband sexual favors if he would kill her father
Fay just looks at him blankly, overwhelmed, confused
She starts to cry quietly
'm just repeating what she said, Mrs Fool
The victim's wife, Vicky, claims your husband broke into the house and forcefully entered her bedroom
Fay trembles and catches her breath trying to take this all in
cop hands her some tissues
She takes them and tries to concentrate on what the lawyer says
Fay,  know this isn't easy
But we need your help here
The girl claims she asked your husband to kill her father in exchange for, well,  guess the promise of sexual relations with her
-- Later
Fay staggers out into the noisy corridor and rests against the wall
Looking down the hall she sees
Pearl and Vicky, sitting in a blank, brightly lit room beyond a glass door
Fay comes closer and looks in at them
They don't see her
They stare at the floor before them, dazed and confused
-- Morning
Fay is lying on her bed with her coat still on, trying to think
Ned stands by the side of the bed, watching her
Mom
Yeah
Where's Dad
don't know, honey
Leave me alone a minute,  gotta think
He picks at the bedspread and looks at the ceiling, then
Mom
What
Is Dad in trouble
Yes, Ned, he is
He's in big trouble
Now just be quiet for two minutes
He walks around to the other side of the bed and waits a moment before
Mom
'm warning you, Ned
Mom, can  be a mailman when  grow up
Fay sits up, pauses and studies her son
Sure you can, honey
You can be anything you want
Ned is happy to hear this
He shuffles out of the room and Fay falls back on the bed
-- Moments later
Ned comes into the kitchen and digs through the drawers beneath the sink
He finds an envelope
He reads the return address: Chelsea Hotel, New York City
-- Ned approaches the subway station and climbs the stairs to the platform
-- Moments later
Ned runs up the stairs to the elevated platform just as a train pulls into the station
He runs down a few cars and hops in as the doors slide open
-- Ned rides the train to New York City
-- Twenty minutes later
He comes up out of the subway on to the street, looks around
-- He comes into the hotel and rings an annoying buzzer which brings out the concierge, who is in his little office, watching
Yeah, what do you want
My uncle
What's his name
Simon Grim
The concierge looks through his book as Ned waits
There ain't no one here by that name
Ned pulls the envelope from his pocket, unfolds it and shows it to the concierge
Room 423
The concierge studies the envelope and hands it back
This is post marked five years ago
Disappointed, Ned takes back the envelope and stands looking at his sneakers
What does he look like
(hopeless) don't know
Sorry, kid
Can't help ya
Ned steps away from the front desk and moves towards the door
But then he stops and looks back at
The concierge, sitting back in his office, returning his attention to the  set
The boy heads for the elevator
The concierge looks up and sees him
(jumping up) Hey
Ned checks his step and runs for the service stairs
The concierge goes after him
-- Moments later
Ned runs up the stairs, the concierge in pursuit
-- Moments later
Ned jumps out into the hall, narrowly escaping the clutches of the concierge, who falls to the floor
Ned runs up the hall, checking the room numbers as the concierge gets to his feet
He finds
Room 423
He knocks
The concierge strides up the hall towards him
Ned knocks again
The concierge bears down upon him
He knocks again and
The door opens a crack, held by its safety chain
female figure in silhouette is at the narrow gap
Ned looks from the door to the concierge approaching
The concierge arrives and reaches out for him, but the door opens wide and Ned dives in
423 -- Same time
The concierge stands in the hallway
The door swings shut in his face
Ned kneels on the floor of the hotel room, waiting to be smacked, or something
But when nothing happens, he opens his eyes and looks back over his shoulder at
Laura, the secretary from the publishing house
She is dressed for travel and has her coat hung over her arm, a suitcase in her hand
She smiles at him, then looks from the boy to someone across the room and
Ned follows her gaze to find
Simon, standing there before him, a suitcase in his hand as well
He looks down at Ned with a calm, intrigued expression
The boy looks up at him in awe
Simon steps forward, pauses, then
Get up off your knees
He does
-- taxi pulls up
Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out of the window
Promise me you'll be on that plane at seven, Simon
'll see you in Stockholm
They kiss
The taxi pulls away
Simon comes down beside Ned, takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear
The kid takes off
Simon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting there at the door
-- Gnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen
band is seen doing a sound check, inside
Bunuel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned
Simon gives Bunuel his passport
Bunuel nods and leaves
Hawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors
-- Moments later
Simon is lead down the stairs and stops
He looks on in horror at
Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak
Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages
Simon pauses, then comes closer
He reaches out and touches Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend
Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with his hand
Look, Simon, the world's a scary place
admit it
But it's not my fault
swear
Simon thinks about this and looks away
'm sorry, Henry
Don't be
You had things to do
So did you
Henry thinks about that, sighs and looks away
-- Fay packs up the many books of the 'Confession' into one of the old suitcases Henry first came to town with
She slams it shut
-- Ned runs along the street and stops at the police car
He points down the street with great urgency
The cops jump in their cars and take off
He then looks over at
Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase
-- Same time
Bunuel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts
Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport
Simon checks it and then looks up to see
Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside
Coming out into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on his own
He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with difficulty
Gotta light
Ned does
He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights his dad's cigarette
Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses
Finally
Take care of your mom and don't start trouble you can't finish
Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder
Then he stands before Fay and looks at his feet
With her arms folded across her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently and waits for his last line of crap
love you, Fay
(rolls her eyes) Yeah, well, tough
But then she looks at him and softens
He leans in and kisses her passionately on the mouth
Moments later, they all help Henry into Bunuel's car and Simon gets in behind the wheel
The doors slam shut and Simon steers the car slowly up the alley
Henry gazes out at Fay running along beside the car with the rest of the neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying
-- Simon pulls up at the curb and jumps out
He helps Henry climb out and together they enter the terminal
-- Moments later
Henry steps up
Passport and ticket, please
Henry hands them over
He glances back at
Simon, waiting
The clerk compares Henry to the picture in the passport, checks again, then
(recognizes) It's an honor to meet you, Mr Grim
Really
mean, God
Congratulations on the Nobel Prize
Thanks
know all your work by heart
It changed my life
Yeah, well
Look, thanks, but
Yes
Of course
She types something more into the computer, then looks up urgently
You'll have to hurry, sir
They're holding the plane for you on the runway
-- Moments later
Airline representatives come rushing up with walkie-talkies to meet Henry and Simon as they run through the terminal
#1 This way, please, this way
This way, Mr Grim
This way
Excuse me
As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal
(shoves him) Go on
Henry is ushered through security
They take his ticket and check his passport again
They take his suitcase and place it on the conveyor belt
He passes through the metal detector
They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands there with his hands outstretched, as
Simon waits and watches
The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint at
Simon, standing there
He steps forward anxiously
Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives are at his side
Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting
We have to hurry
They drag him away, but Henry looks back as
Simon stops and watches
-- Moments later
The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline representative runs straight for it, calling back over her shoulder to Henry
This way, Mr Grim
This way
Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his shoulder at
Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal
He stops and waits
Simon raises his hand in farewell and
Henry raises his in reply
Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent amongst the roar of the runway, says
(unheard) Run
And Henry understands
He lowers his hand, waits just a moment, then turns and looks out at
The airplane
The airline representative is shouting at him from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie- talkie
He glances back once more at Simon
Then
Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with every step he takes
