"" Screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan ,   - freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town
handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps
He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around

What  need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad

- Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard
The sign says -- The Newcomer goes in the gate
(
) Oh yeah, one other thing  need -- an angle
He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood
(
) was thinking -- if it weren't for bad luck,  wouldn't have any luck at all

) Can  help you
The Newcomer turns toward the door
Standing there, holding the screen open, is the
She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves

) Either my luck had just changed, or Fate just bought me another round of trouble

She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk
We can barely  her ,  : not very fancy

We haven't had a man around here for so long
(
) She kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking
The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window
The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around
It doesn't take long
His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward
He focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage

The next move was up to me

(softer) -- That's all the time we have
Sorry
(indicates his watch) next time
We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate
It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience
[The movie is now in
] His patient,  , looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating
Instead, he's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline
Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego
Follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford
have eighteen more minutes
don't want to hear any more today
Why not
Mr
Follett, do you trust me or don't you
Well,  don't know
only been seeing you -- Without trust, there's no point to any of this
You might as well not come
Now hold on,  didn't say  didn't want to come -- Good, then go
' - Lunch crowd
Mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called Mumford
He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out
The Proprietor is a woman around forty named , who talks to him as she works
You're early
it's not ready
What happened
My patient had to leave early
Who was that
She comes over to the register with an order
Mumford is am[
] her, likes her a lot
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily
think it's like
inquisitive
It was Henry Follett
(reacts) Man, you see him a lot
And it's very wrong to reveal it
Next you'll be saying what his problem is
What do you want to know
You're terrible
'm never telling you anything
Patron passes on the way out
Hey, Doc
how's it going
Fine, Vincent
how's yourself
How long you been in this town
Oh,  don't know
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long
(Mumford gives her a look) And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined
Lily,  don't think even you could know that -- Lily sees something out the window
Look at that guy
Mumford turns to look out the window
young man of about 30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars
He zips past the front of the restaurant
You know who that is, don't you
(Mumford does not) You really don't
That's Skip Skipperton, man
He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down
Oh, so that's him
The Panda Man
hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up
Back on track: So, what makes you so popular
What's your secret
(takes his bag to go) You like me
How come
Not sure
Let me think about it
Mumford is smiling as he goes out
Another Patron, , a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford cross the street
Lily can't stand this guy
That's the new psychiatrist
Psychologist
He's not medical
Probably thinks he's pretty smart
Lily gives him a look as she takes his money
'  - An overweight, teenage girl named   is on Mumford's couch
She fidgets as she talks and can't decide whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit up and face him
She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy handbag
so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"
and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed
But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra
And it's serious, immediate love
So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America
What do you mean, "in no time"
In maybe three or four issues
Weekly or monthly
Monthly
God, how shallow do you think Brad is
Why do  waste my time telling you this stuff
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa
Don't do that thing
(Mumford: what
) that shrink thing
It's a big part of the show
She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules
You really need to let people smoke in here, you know
It's perverse
What are they paying you to see me
Mumford indicates "nothing"
The school board doesn't pay you
What kind of deal is that
It's called pro bono
Pro boner
(he waits her out) Pro bono, huh
For whose good, supposedly
It's my bit for the community
Fuck the community
(he won't go for it) There was this article my friends and  read
It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed"
It was very fascinating
Where was this
Where
The New York Times
The first one was -- "he handles produce well
" Which we already knew
(an expression she uses) The point is, you have a lot of the signs
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa
Have women found you attractive
Mumford laughs
knew you wouldn't answer
've been thinking about what you said last time
How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions
How maybe  can't lose the weight, ever
(quietly) Which we already knew
That's not quite what  said -- It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say
and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something
Mumford waits
Well,  guess 'm just a dumb bitch, but how depressing is that moment -- the moment when you give up
,   - The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well
- Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle
: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford
He stares at it for several long moments
Then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light)
He twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about
After a beat, Mumford settles back and turns off the light
'  - The place is quietly busy with the regulars
Mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar
Right now he's sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper
, the man on the skateboard, comes in
Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here
Several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around
He's uncomfortable
He seems relieved when he spots Mumford and heads back there
Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting for his attention
Hi
Mumford looks up, smiles
Skip offers his hand
You're Doc Mumford
(Mumford nods) Skip Skipperton
How are you
Fine
Okay
Pretty good
've been hoping we'd meet
've heard a lot about you
Mumford waits, friendly
Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, glances around
Do you think we could
Can  buy you a drink
: [
] near the back
They've been at it a while, but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet
Skip keeps his voice down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him
"Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say --  guess a lot of dads say that -- but  did and it just took off
No kidding
Panda
Where'd that come from
Panda
've always liked giant pandas
've been to China and seen them in the wild
That's the kind of thing  can do if  want
now
can do pretty much anything want to do these days
Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought depresses him
He catches himself and snaps back -- So now we make 23% of the modems in the market, which is pretty good
Skip glances around, leans in, confidential
When  was growing up here, the town was about dead
The timber business was played out
Panda changed all that
Now, just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow
Which is kinda the problem
Mumford waits, watches
Skip gets uncomfortable
Would you like another beer
Nah
scotch
(brightens, like a kid) Far out
Single malt
(gets up) Can  pick it
Skip heads off to the bar
Mumford looks around
Everybody is watching
: The bar crowd has thinned
Both Mumford and Skip have had a few
In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the table
You want me
to be
your friend
Skip beams
Mumford leans forward in the same confidential way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in too
Mumford is almost whispering -- But that's not what's really going on
(Skip is excited) What's really going on is
you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for Panda Modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems
Skip confirms that's it
Can  ask you a personal question
Of course
That's exactly what want
Have you thought about getting a wife
Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "
", but also total frustration and failure
When Panda started to happen,  was dating women from New York, San Francisco,
They came out of the woodwork
Models, actresses, venture capitalists
These were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before  hit it
And you know what  discovered
discovered these girls did not love me for myself
The majority of them didn't even like me
But a lot of them would've gladly become Mrs
Skipperton for a while
Can you imagine that -- marrying someone just because they've got money
Mumford considers that
gotta pee
(he gets up, a little wobbly) Can  ask you something
This town is called Mumford
Been that way since
18
18-0
18-0
(finally remembers) thirteen
Right
(Mumford: if you say so) Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too
Is that the question
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town
Is that right
(Mumford shrugs) Far out
Skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes back and leans down toward Mumford
hope you don't think  want you to do this for free
Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean  won't pay you like a doctor
understand
have a lot of money
Do you know how much money 've got
Don't tell me, 'cause 'm not going to tell you what 've got
've got three big ones
'm impressed
couldn't make three million dollars if  lived three lifetimes
No, no
have three billion dollars
Skip stumbles off to take a leak
Mumford takes a moment to digest that
It's difficult
'  - Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant
Lionel is lying on the couch, talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority complex
Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity
so 'm watching Brokaw and they've got some astronomer, this little limey know-it-all, and he's telling how, with this Himball telescope, they've discovered there are maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were
And  guess that's supposed to make me feel small
'm supposed to feel insignificant
Is that the point
Because  can tell you it didn't
Mumfords eyes dart to look at -- on the bookshelf: 2:23 Lionel, since this is our first session together, maybe -- Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at Mumford
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- (Lionel waves that off and looks away) -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you
How 'bout you let me explain it my own way
As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- : still 2:23
Hold on it
Finally, it moves
Mumford's eyes dart toward his desk -- deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur stands   in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone
and in the dream, it's always the same,  wake up in my room from when was  kid in Ohio, and  realize this is the day of the big exam at school
Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off
He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold
The sound of '  begins to echo -- which is no problem for me, because remembered it was coming and 've attended every class, so 'm totally prepared
Then  see myself running down the hall at school
'   from Lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener
Mumford closes his eyes
We  : - boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway
['  has a ] (
) but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district -- (
) -- Go on
- Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed
(
) And even though  arrive a little bit early, everybody's already there
But the surprising part is -- : Everyone in the class, including the Teacher in the front, is naked
The Teacher holds out an exam toward Young Lionel
(
) -- 'm the only one who's prepared
: , '  - , a woman in her forties, sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings
There are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, woven carry-all
The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force
Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who is getting up from the couch in some confusion
-- you crazy
You can't do this
Sure  can, Lionel
'm a criminal lawyer -- you think like my clients
can't stand most of them
But  don't kick them out
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone
'm not going to charge you for this session, but  don't want to see you back here
Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign
He does spot Althea watching the show from the couch
Don't you at least have a back door can use
Come out this way
There's no shame in getting a little therapy
is there, Althea
Althea stands up, smiling
She thinks Mumford is the bee's knees
Not at all
It takes guts, Lionel
Lionel steams by them in a black mood
Maybe some of us don't need this crap
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope
Lionel bangs out the front door
Mumford motions Althea inside -- Jeez
what an asshole
Althea heads inside, giggling wildly
She can't get enough of this guy
'  - Althea is sobbing
Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch
She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying
Mumford settles back in his chair, patient
What do they want from me
(more sobbing) What have  done that's so wrong
(pulling it together) They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things
They do
Believe me
Everybody's got something
(looks at Mumford) Even you probably have things
Me more than most
Why are they ganging up against me
'm not sure
But  think they're worried about you
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy
He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course
He's always willing to pay
He's extremely generous
(a long beat) 'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me
How did they threaten you
They said if  didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more
(a beseeching look) What do you think about that
Good kids
Althea stares at him a long moment
She knows he's right
Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks
She grabs another Kleenex
In the midst of the torrent she tries to talk, but it's undecipherable: Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm
Hmm
Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face
said
you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday
Really
You think so
Yes
Jeremy will be home for the weekend
And you can meet the kids
Mumford considers, then nods his assent
'  - Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags
He's late
The modest houses are close together on this pretty street, which rises out of the main business district, seen beyond Mumford
- Mumford comes to the house where he lives
He heads down the driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment
The front yard is completely fenced
Lily, the owner of the restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the greenery of a lush garden
Her friendly dog, , sees Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him
How ya doin', Ainge
Evenin', Lily
Doc
(doesn't look up) Ainge
The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard
Mumford hurries up the stairs
'  - Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen counter
He goes directly to the table by his main chair and picks up the  remote
He switches it on and changes the channel
The opening segment of   is just beginning
It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack hosting
'  as he watches
Only when the whole show has been previewed does he seem to relax
He leaves the show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the bags
'   - Mumford is comparing different stepladders
, the sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but now -- Dr
Mumford
(doesn't really know him) Mr
Cook
Could you come with me please
Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the back
Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand
Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start
Finally -- know  shoulda come to your office
was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today
Uh-huh
It's my daughter Sofie
she's gotta problem
What's that
We're not sure
She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things
Some of 'em are callin' it -- (wants to get this right) -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it
Chronic Fatigue Symptom
Syndrome
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
That's it -- syndrome
So you know all about it
No
a little
There's a lot of debate about it
Yeah,  got that
Some people think it's all in their heads
(more intense) It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us
And 'm not sure that's the best thing, either
Why's that
Oh
a lot of things
Several different factors
Will you see her, Doctor Mumford
Sure
Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon
Cook nods, but looks worried
'm not sure she'll come
She's in a mood
Do you ever go to somebody's house
Generally that doesn't work out so well
It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change
Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves
But he's worried
- Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5- foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder
Folks greet him
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops
Hello, Lionel
You've got to have the right ladder for the job
You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble
You're right, as usual
See you
Mumford continues up the street
We   Lionel, who watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small medical building
'  - , a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, vanity hair, and  , a psychologist in her thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, listening
The remains of their take-out lunch is on the coffee table
They seem a little impatient with their as-yet- unseen visitor -- (
) completely inappropriate and highly unprofessional
Now  don't want to presume to tell you how to run your businesses -- -- practices
Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case -- -- Whatever
Six months ago, you two were the only games in town
The value of your
(mocking) "practices" could be seriously undermined by this bozo
town this size has only so many headcases to go around
What exactly would you have us do, Lionel
Protect your turf
Check this guy out
smell a rat,  tell you
Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel distasteful
Mr
Dillard, 'm sure Dr
Delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern
But  also know he'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health
We're not in some
widget business, trying to crush our competition
What the hell's a widget
'  - Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the stairs
moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone
He closes the door on us
'  - Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at Sheeler
What an asshole
(agrees) Ernest, what do you think
think he's got a point
So does she
- Idyllic
The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods
Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth
For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the wind, and the regular  of ball into glove
Finally -- This is great
This is exactly what  wanted
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with
You'd be surprised
Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends
They're busy
It's not as easy as you think
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here
Are they busier than you
Well, you know
that's the thing
Like  said, just about everybody in town works for me
And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you
It's like an order or something
And no one -- no one -- asks me
Mumford considers
So, would you say we're out here
let me think how to put this
Is your problem really that you're
lonely
Don't you like this
Hell yes,  like it
What's better than this
Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like
Okay then
(
) Have you got a lot of friends
("nope") Lily and  talk a bit
You know Lily, runs the coffee shop
No
've seen her
Good-looking woman
(agrees) She's probably ten years older than you
(
) Good-looking woman
Lives downstairs from me
She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge
(sparks to that) Really
'm the only person  know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans
Maybe Phoenix
Well, there's Lily
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays
Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the  and in the bigs
Amazing
Unbelievable
(
) And Lily named her dog after him
Far out
What kind of person do you have to be to do this
Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet seen
What
This -- : : The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, lush grounds behind the    , a brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park
Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black eyes and ears, round body
Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed
would've traded any of it to have made the Mumford High varsity
Mumford takes that in
So  guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours
He's my pharmacist
Yeah
(
) Guy's got some serious sex fantasies
Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he just throws the ball
Pretty good, too
Lots of detail
Nothing hard core
Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character
Uh-huh
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one
Nothing can live up to it
His wife got sick of it and left him
Took his kids with her
wondered what happened to her
Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable
Mumford seems oblivious, unusually talkative -- Of course, it's not that simple
There's something powerful going on there
We've got a lot of work to do
(announcer voice) It's hit to the warning track
For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a long fly ball
Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running and just barely catches it on the run
He pegs it back to Mumford
In these fantasies, Henry Follett is played by a handsome guy with biceps
Can you imagine that
Where your self-esteem has to be
(throws him the ball) Man, 'd just like to move the guy to the point where he gets to appear in his own fantasies
'  - Silence
Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit cigarette in her mouth
Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- and stands up, session over
Nessa quickly lights her cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands up too
She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for her, and goes out
Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it
' : As the door swings open, the first figure we see is Mr
Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door
He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter -- -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage
She regards Mumford with some resignation
Her father helps her out of the chair
Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford
Mumford, watching her
'  - Mr
Cook is gone
Sofie is sitting up on the couch, facing Mumford
She looks like she might pass out at any moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect
Feel free to lie down
Most people do
'd better not, 'll fall right to sleep
think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you
joke
Mumford smiles
What can you tell me about this
Oh, lord
It's almost too exhausting to tell you
(tiny smile, to herself) about my exhaustion
didn't really want to come
'm not hopeful right now
But  couldn't take the look on my dad's face
He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story
He's the opposite of me,  guess -- all stamina and resolve
It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch
When did you start to feel this way
About six months ago,  guess it is now
God, it seems like years
What a bore
'm embarrassed by it
Before this happened -- when 'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- thought it was a bunch of bullshit
She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a weak but magical sound
What
You think that now
You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you
(unconvincing) No
saw it
saw it in your eyes
Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right
She saw him clearly
That's okay
Maybe it is
My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head
" suppose that's true
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life
change of job, of living situation
a loss of some kind
No
but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final
That's not too suspicious, is it
But it wasn't like  was feeling bad about the divorce
Just the opposite
Hmm
Hmm
Is that a professional opinion
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting
Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out
Even if you don't think it's real
don't know what's real and what isn't
That's never been my strong suit
But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to
that's worth trying to fix
Maybe  can help you do that
What would you do
We
we would try several things
But  need to see you a lot
don't know
barely made it today
'll come to you
We'll try a little walking
Sofie suddenly looks defeated
We'll take it slow
You'll never feel you can't handle it
don't think  can afford it don't want my dad paying
We'll work it out
Sofie gives him a long look
You have the best answer for everything
(Mumford shrugs) You seem so
hopeful
Are you always this sunny
No one ever thought so
You must bring it out
Is it contagious
'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down
Maybe you'll catch it
Can  ask you something
(Mumford: of course) Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient
(he admits it) So what changed
Mumford just smiles
He doesn't want to tell her the truth -- everything
- taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the outskirts of town
,   - Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed house
The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked everywhere
Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks
If it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything can), it is here
Althea sounds very nervous, cheery
-- sorry everything's in such an uproar
Lots of big occasions coming up, and of course Christmas is only eight months away -- (giggles uncontrollably) --  don't know what's keeping Jeremy
You know he stays in the city three nights a week --  guess  explained that
(Mumford nods) know Katie's here, but 'm not so sure about Martin
'm making dinner myself tonight, so 'll have to leave you, 'm afraid
,   - They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a spectacular view of the surrounding countryside
There's an elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford toward
'm awful  know, but will you please help yourself
just got a new copper sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and 'm afraid it'll be the death of us all if  don't get back in there
She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door
Mumford gets a drink for himself, taking in the view
He sees something out there
' : Way in the distance, coming out of the woods and down toward the house is a teenage boy
(
) You're the doctor, aren't you
Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter has silently appeared
Her jeans and little tee-shirt are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her
Mumford nods
You must be Katie
People call me Doc
(motioning urgently) 'mere
Quick
c'mon
Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the porch
,   - Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance
Here too, the walls are lined with boxes
She tiptoes to one of two facing doors and waits for him
When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in closet
Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless move
Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing door, which she swings open freely -- : what was once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes
Mumford is taken aback
Katie points at packages and speaks in a hypnotic  -- Cuddledown

,   - Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, , Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up onto the porch
He's wearing an old black leather jacket with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All- Stars that are coming apart
In his hand, casually but properly held, is a
22 caliber rifle
He looks Mumford over
Is this him
(nods) showed him
(to Mumford) Do you get it now
This is no joke
Mumford takes them both in and nods
He understands
Suddenly, their manner changes, for the worse
What they can see that Mumford cannot is  , Althea's husband, who has come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late arrival
Hey, kids
Oh, hi
Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his hand
Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his Armani outfit cost $4200 all in
His tone: hearty and strained -- You must be Dr
Mumford of Mumford
Jeremy Brockett
Doc
Nice to meet you
Sorry 'm late
traffic was a motherfucker
Have another drink, 'll be back in five
Jeremy goes inside
Martin and Katie exchange a look with each other, then to Mumford
Martin goes inside
: ,   - Dinner is over
Jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two Cuban cigars
His casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit
He joins Mumford and Althea, who immediately gets up
'll be back
She goes inside
The men each have a snifter of cognac
Jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars -- think you'll like this
Know much about Cuban cigars
Nope
Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up
After exhaling a huge cloud of smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines
Makes the whole thing that much better
Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down
He gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to light up -- Just hold the flame a little bit below the end
that's it
now just turn it slowly as you draw
Mumford does as he's told
Jeremy lights his own cigar
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right
've had my moments
am
And 'm not ashamed of it
Nobody ever said on their death bed -- " treated myself too well
" thought it was -- Nobody ever said, " should have spent more time at the office
" Fill in the blank
don't mind the office
The point is, you only go 'round once
Like the Zens say -- Be here now
What do you do
Althea hasn't told you
(no) We've been talking about her, mostly
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture
We've got twenty-three people working there now
You've done well
The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self- satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare
His response includes their lavish immediate surroundings-- We've done
very well
You know anything about addiction, Doc
little
Well, 'm addicted to winning
say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score
(watches Mumford smoke) So what do you think
Tastes good
No
mean about Althea
About her
(makes a face) behavior
Do you think you can fix her up
What do you think's wrong with her
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her
Out of control
Probably from living out here in Mayberry
Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations
Mumford watches, fascinated by this guy
You're the doctor, what do you think
She seems very unhappy
Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh
" think we all knew that, professor
The question
the real -- (drawn out, stoned) -- quest-tio-nee
is
why
Mumford looks at him a long time
- Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500  whips around a curve
'  - Martin is driving Mumford back to town
But you know how to drive
Sure
Got a license
(yes) But no car
Don't need it
just got my license two weeks ago
You're good
been drivin' since  was twelve
That would explain it
Can you help Mom
'm trying
(intense) Got to
They drive in silence for a bit
Then -- Nessa Watkins
She comes to you, doesn't she
You're treating her, right
Mumford gives him a surprised look, then acknowledges it
What's wrong with her
Is she a friend of yours
No
sort of
Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys
She's blowin' them in the parking lot
Mumford knew that
person's got to hate themselves to act like that
Mumford regards Martin with respect, then turns to look out front
After a few moments -- Have you ever met a bigger shithead than my stepfather
- Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford gets out
Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we  the clicking  of his nails on the surface
Martin rubs the dog's head
Ainge
That's okay
Jeremy won't mind
Good dog
Ainge
The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily
Mumford waves as Martin pulls away
(to Ainge) Do we run into the street
No, didn't think so
(looks after Martin) Nice car
How's that place
It's a pretty piece of land
They walk up the block with the dog
And the Brocketts
Horror show
What'd you do tonight
It was insane here, man
'Hadda call in the National Guard
(he nods) Then  did my laundry
watched 20/20
And
Shocking
Did you know the government is wasteful
(Mumford reacts) You heard it here first
Oh, and being a supermodel
it's no walk in the park
Why do you watch
No gentleman caller, Doc
(they turn back) Not that  care
've had it with men
They're so fascinated by their own crap
Took me four years to get the last one out
Almost turned me into a dyke
These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed
Now that feels good
And you don't have to do all that
listening
Mumford laughs
Oops
sorry
guess that's the story of your life
'  - health information "library" website has been called up on Mumford's office computer
Right now it's beginning to spew information about " " -- Definitions, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnostic Measures, etc
Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly
His printer is churning out hard copies
,   - Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie
He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively
'm not making any promises
We'll turn back anytime you want
(seeing something) Oh boy
this should be interesting
Mumford looks out toward the street
woman in her fifties is turning into the front walk
She stares at them, unsmiling, as the two parties converge
She is
Hello, Mother
want you to meet Dr
Mumford
Mumford
like the town
(offering his hand) Yes
It's nice to meet you, Mrs
Cook
She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly
What's happening here
We're going for a walk
Do you think that's a good idea
Dr
Mumford does, yes
've put myself completely in his hands
For today, anyway
What kind of doctor are you
Ph
, psychologist
Oh
not a real doctor
That's right, the fake kind
Mrs
Cook is not amused
Sofie pulls on Mumford
We'd better go or 'm liable to bail on the whole thing
Mrs
Cook steps aside as they move up the walk
,     - Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block
In the background, Mrs
Cook watches for awhile before going inside
Mom's such a cutie
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me
She's not in a bad mood
She's like that all the time
(a beat) It doesn't bother me anymore
It's my dad and my brother  worry about
Maybe
but you're the one whose ass is dragging
(laughs) Is that the technical description of what 've got
Is she against you getting help
We don't discuss it
Something's bothering her
Oh, we've all disappointed her
Me, especially, but Dad, of course
She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much
It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"
Sofie suddenly seems to be fading
Please
forgive me
What
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult
If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things
All right
She looks at him, unsure if he's serious
It seems so corny
But she agrees
Okay then
Are you positive your mother's a bitch
(she laughs, surprised) Just kidding
You've got a funny idea of funny
(seems worried) 've offended you
No
Really
What would it take
She laughs again; surprised again
He's got her off balance makes a "rim shot" sound
Is this the treatment
Sorry
'm done
'Cause 'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach
They've come to the corner
He gestures to ask -- "shall we cross
" She considers for quite a while, gauging her strength, then, still on his arm, steps off the curb -- (absurdly unconvincing) Hey, 'Just do it
' as we : (
) want you to tell me all your symptoms
- They're dressed differently
Sofie seems more vigorous
'm embarrassed
The list is so long
Be specific
Well
'm tired all the time, obviously
always feel like taking a nap
But when  try to sleep, have trouble
(Mumford nods) My muscles ache
And my joints feel like an old person, or like did back when  used to work out too hard
What else
'  - Under the list of Signs and Symptoms: "Sore throat
" (
) Sore throat
(
) Uh-huh
: "Low grade fever
Painful lymph glands
Irritability
" (
) Low grade fever
- Sofie nods
Painful lymph glands
(yes) Forget fulness
irritability
depression
Yes, yes, and definitely yes
Also
get confused
Yeah, most people have that
It's confusing here
Where
Life
- Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest set of calisthenics ever devised
Now they're doing waist bends and arm waving
Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's got
don't know if  mentioned the headaches
Did you get headaches before this
(Sofie: yes) But you get more now
Or more severe
No, not really
They're about the same
My marriage was one long headache
So the headaches may not even be a part of this
She considers that, reluctantly agrees
can give myself a headache instantly
Is that like a party trick
All  have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time
Like 'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better
' But then 'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits
' Sofie's not sure how to take that
She looks away
There
've given myself a real whopper
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts
(Mumford laughs) So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage
Sometimes, yeah
pulling in two different directions at once
It makes tiny little tears in our fabric
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip
(  ' ) - The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel thrown over his shoulder
He goes into the bathroom off the second floor hall and begins to wash up
[Again, Follett's fantasy world is in  &
] (
) The town was a rube's heaven, but found work my first day out down at Old Man Sutter's gas station and diner
knew his stacked young wife was going to be a problem, but, hey, life is full of problems
Back at the boarding house,  was washing up when  heard a load of yellin' and -- , the Newcomer's : a nubile teenager, 17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother
Her dialogue distant and echoey: ' get off my case
You don't like any of my friends
(
) got my first look at the landlady's daughter
The '  looks up and sees the Newcomer watching her through the half-open bathroom door
She gives him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and goes into her room at that end of the hall
She bangs her door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot
The Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room
In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra
(
) Lucky for me, she was plenty upset but not too careful
Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip begins to curl
(
) Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- (
) Mr
Follett
(
) -- 'cause in that instant  saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and knew -- (
) Henry
Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, cutting off the Newcomer's view
He looks with surprise into his mirror -- it suddenly shatters
'  - Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward Mumford, agitated
What
Stop now
Why
'm paying for this
Not for this
Not me, you're not
(challenging) You find it distasteful, don't you
It doesn't matter how  feel about it
It's how you feel about it that matters
enjoy it
Does that make me some kind of pervert
Just because a man has a rich imaginative life -- You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination
No
You came because it's taking over
You're in its grip
never said that
Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel
Where's your wife, Henry
Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking
Where's your wife, Henry
Go to hell
(softer) didn't hear you
Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until -- We got divorced
(petulant) had to get rid of her
She couldn't satisfy me
(shouts, Follett jumps) What
Follett seems to shrink in size
They've been here before and he doesn't like it
(softly) was
never satisfied
(normal again) Now we're back on track
Again, Follett says something under his breath
What's that
(long beat) You are so mean
- Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion
He comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting for him, looking serious
Hey, Skip
Doc
know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday
That's all right
What's on your mind
Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail
How many sessions have we had now, Doc
(Mumford tries to remember) Six
And it's been good
like we were two buddies hanging out
Just shootin' the shit
Yep
They walk in silence for a while
This is really hard
Everything want to say is hard
- Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big rock, and settle down
The sun is falling over the town of Mumford
We're like friends, almost
who trust each other
He checks Mumford's reaction
Mumford nods, offers Skip water, who turns it down
Mumford takes a swig
want to tell you something, Doc, but before  do,  need to ask you a question
Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well,  haven't told anybody about this
It's the biggest secret 've got
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves
You're a shrink, Doc
Aren't supposed to be able to tell you everything
It's just a thought
Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below
That really relates to the thing want to ask you
've noticed that sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, when we're hanging out, throwin' the ball
or that time we went bowling
sometimes you'll like -- (gets it out fast --) -- tell me things about your other patients
Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it silently
Now Skip is even more nervous
Hey, maybe that's all right
don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or
ethics, so maybe there's something  missed
or something
You're concerned that maybe  can't be trusted with a secret
trust you
Definitely
No question
But, yeah, 'm a little concerned mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems
are you
Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment
That is correct, Skip
'm going to have to take a long look at that
The conversation seems to end there
Skip's not sure where to go next
Finally -- Yeah, well
what  was gonna tell you -- -- Skip
Knowing what you do about me -- Doc,  trust you
You've listened to me better than anybody
maybe ever
(leans in, intense) And this secret 've got,  can't stand it anymore
don't know if 'm some kind of -- Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly there's no one around
--  don't know if 'm a pervert or what
It's taken me this long to get where  can come out and say it can't back away now
can't spend another day not knowing if 'm nuts
Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself
All right, 'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as  can
(one last spasm of doubt) And you understand that this is a big secret
Just between us
(Mumford does) Okay
You know 've got this gift for certain kinds of
machines
You are Panda, monarch of modems
That's right
And you also know that even though  make 23% of the modems in the world
cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me
Okay
let's say that, for now
It's true, believe me
So
do you know what 've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years
Mr
Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It
How  spend my every solitary hour
Mumford shakes his head, "no
" Guess
(Mumford demurs) Go ahead, guess
(if he must) Jerking off
No
Although that's a good guess
No, what 've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- (leans in, whispering) -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional
sexual surrogate slash companion
Mumford tries to put that all together
Finally -- Slash what
Sexual surrogate
slash
companion
doll
No, Doc, not a doll
am Panda
'm talking about much, much more than a doll
The world has never seen what 'm talking about
except maybe in the movies
Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon
He looks back at Skip
How's it coming
You don't think 'm insane
("no") And that's your secret
(Skip: "yes") You meant -- like a trade secret
No, Doc, a private secret
It's perverted, it's pitiful
What am  -- Dr
Frankenstein
Aren't you repulsed
Sounds like kind of a good idea
(nonplussed) Really
Definitely
It's getting dark fast now
Mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier
He fits the straps carefully over his head
Skip, that's not much of a secret
(hurt) It's not
Oh, it's okay
It's just not something to be ashamed of
Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, 'd give it, say
a two
Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk
Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip
You want to know a secret
'll tell you a secret
Since it's just between us and all
Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically
The secret, Skip, is this --  am not now, nor have  ever been
a psychologist
At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford
But in the huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard right
Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets up
We'd better get going
Just follow my light
And, Skip, watch your step
' ,    - This porch is directly above Lily's porch
Mumford and Skip sit nursing beers
There's a cooler on the floor
Mumford's legs are propped up on the porch railing Who else knows
Just you
It's time you did some talkin', Dr
Mum -- Wait a minute
That is your name, isn't it
Mumford takes a drink of beer
Damn
What is your name
Doesn't matter
You can call me Doc
It matters to me
Mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do
" 've told you a lot of private stuff
can tell you anything else
What about everything
How did this happen
Mumford looks at Skip, considering
He takes a long pull from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle
Did you know that every species of mammal has found some way to drug, inebriate, or anestnetize itself
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock
Seems to be some natural urge
to get away for a while
(one more look at Skip) 've had it for as long as  can remember
The first place  wanted out of was home
we     , all '
We do not see him in the scenes
Instead, everyone else in the scene      , even if they're just ignoring him

We reach the back door and bang inside -- '   - The cramped interior is grimy and depressing

She glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly drunk
Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- which is opened roughly by ' , a coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work
But it's his scary scowl that impresses
His eyes take in his wife (and her drink) but he says nothing
He barely gives Mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and disappears into another room

My friends didn't like it much
It made them distrust me

) When  got a scholarship to go out of state to college,  was the first one in my extended family who'd gone beyond high school
At graduation, my folks looked like a normal, happy couple, which  guess they were about 10% of the time

' , a crazed, middle-class doper, has his stuff spread around and is settled in the midst of the chaos
He looks up at the arriving Mumford with a maniacal, stoned smile

The room is full of partying students
(
) All the other kids, in fact, seemed to know things  didn't
They were friendly enough, but in four years, never got over feeling that  had sneaked in
and was about to be exposed as the hillbilly and imposter actually was
,   - Funky decor, red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow
'  moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a sheet on the bed
He reaches out and lifts the edge to the Pretty Coed, now naked, giggling, her extended hand offering a tab of acid right up to camera
(
) The thing that always made those feelings go away was
fun
Fun was drugs, fun was sex, fun was aggressively doing nothing
The only problem  had with degenerate, self- destructive behavior was
couldn't get enough of it
- approaches camera and lays a fresh examination on the desk in front of Mumford
The problem is -- Mumford is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination paper keeps changing shape
(
) All that fun eventually had an impact on the work  was doing
figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all
'd straighten up when went out in the real world
- being dumped into Mumford's palm over a water fountain
They disappear toward camera as we dip down toward the stream of water

) didn't want to jump into my career right out of college
And since had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem

pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control
lots of jobs that started with the letter "p"
For some reason,  kept losing these jobs
(takes a swig of beer) The only mind-altering substance never had a problem with was alcohol
never got drunk
didn't like the feeling
But really, when you're as fucked up as  was
big deal
Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing facing Skip
Eventually, doing all these different jobs,  noticed something
For some reason, probably because  was too stoned to talk, everywhere  went -- /
-- We see various - from Mumford's jobs
The environments are radically different, but the activity is always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his heart out to camera

their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts

Everybody has a story, Skip
Sounds like you have several
What it felt like was
a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy
(Yul Brynner accent) et cetera
et cetera
Every time 'd leave a life, it felt good
Whatever problems  was having were suddenly gone

The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was
drugs
An  investigator with a drug problem
It wasn't the best situation

He always got his man, whether they deserved it or not
He was a "closer" and everybody admired that

) He'd make the case and the Collection guys would come in and clean up

They wrangle Gregory up the front steps
Gregory stumbles inside and Mumford retreats down the steps, his eyes still on the front door
Candy appears there and stares down at Mumford, who stops where he is
(
) Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that  fell in love with his wife
(
) Holy shit
,    - Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head, astounded
(announcer-like) "Get to know your therapist
" You were messed up, man
(dry) But look at me now
Hey, you've done good
Look at yourself
you've cleaned up, you've got a career -- Skip stops, remembers the truth, realizes
Mumford smiles
At least you pulled yourself out
Things got a lot worse
You and Candy

Candy finishes dressing across the room
She looks at camera, her face full of the pain of leaving

(
) The way the District Managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments
That meant the revenue officers had to use all their "collection tools" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out
The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not
Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over
It is a small furniture factory
Employees are eating their lunches on the loading dock

Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford
Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford to join them

Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years

Empty beer bottles are lined up on the porch railing
And so you did
Mumford nods
And the drugs
Harder than  thought
Took me three tries
But  was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along
After two bomb-outs,  found a place in the desert

(
) The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run by an order of monks -- but it worked
When  got out of there,  was just about broke
,    - Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door
which seemed perfect for starting something new
Be back
Mumford goes inside
Skip sits listening to the night
From downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he
Mumford comes back out
Somebody's taking a shower down there
That'd be Lily
wish  could live in the shower
'd take five a day if  had the time
went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain
And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day
Who'd you go with
(Skip: "alone") That's not good
How'd you do it
(Mumford is confused) The new you
You know how easy it is
kid can manage it if he wants a fake
You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's
The only variable is how much pride you take in the product
know it starts with a birth certificate
All new people start with that
- an elaborate graphics program is creating the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State of West Virginia"
(
) With desktop publishing, you don't have to deal with printers, supply houses, or pesky government agencies
Eventually you do have to get your hands on a typewriter
Ever seen one of those, Skip
As the border is completed, we   and : , with an electric Smith-Corona typewriter (late '50's vintage)
- of the keys hammering out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending physician
(
) (playing along) Is that like a mimeograph
What about the name
,    - Mumford looks at Skip
What about it
"Mumford"
mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to
Oh
You got it backwards
already had the name when  started looking for somewhere to settle
When  saw this town on a map,  thought maybe it was a sign
See
- The typewriter is just pounding out:   --- -
(
) Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's kindergarten class with me
He was killed with his parents in a wreck on their way back from a Steelers game
He was only six years old, which is a real plus, so there's a birth certificate if anyone checks -- but not much else
They died in Pennsylvania, so there's no death certificate in West Virginia
that's also good
, the new birth certificate, now filled out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby)
The paper has taken on an aged, sepia look
: The ones on top are lifted away
The bottom book is opened to reveal the birth certificate
It has been folded in an official way
Now Mumford unfolds it, then refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's starting to look old
(
) And a birth certificate is enough
(
) Everything flows from that, and what doesn't
can be easily purchased
of Mumford's
post office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas, license and accreditation to operate as a therapist
(
) Of course, my  training made it easier
Once you've done that, there's not much data you can't access and use any way you want
,    - In a free society, you are who you say you are
(smiling) People should remember that before they go around knocking this country
(he gets up) Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy
Skip looks upset
But you studied psychology, right
You did the training and just never got the degree
No
no training
(hopeful) Psych major
English Lit
Jeez, man
But you're good at it
understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind
That's all most people are looking to do
(shrugs) Mainly,  listen
He heads inside
Where ya going
've got a million questions
See you Thursday
regular time
Mumford goes inside
Skip nods, head spinning
- Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light
Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck
At each house, he consults the list in his hand, then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with varying success -- toward the front doors
The activity is tiring for her, but she's committed
so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains
(she tosses a paper, grunting) and this trip is everything it's cracked up to be
an open car, great views, the mountain air blowing through
We're sitting there, married for six years, and he says how he likes it better when  put my hair back
Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all her limited strength, missing the front porch badly
Mumford, who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first
That wasn't so good
Mumford snaps out of it
He goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch
As they continue -- You're doing great
don't know if 'm going to make it the whole way
It doesn't matter
Go on
Oh
this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his
Well,  was so
tired of it
(memories) Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me
'm just not getting it right
Can we rest for a second
She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, breathing hard
You're purposely making me talk while we do this
(Mumford nods) because you think this is good for me
(nods again) and you're a sadistic bastard
Yes
who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right
Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter
She laughs
They're playing with each other
That was really bad, wasn't it
Disgusting
And 'll bet you can interpret the whole thing It's pretty obvious to a trained professional
Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from his sack
He points to the next house
hate those dreams where everything means something
Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch
She turns to him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, she glances away, uncomfortable
Is that when you split up
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end
We went on for another year or so
Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house
So whose route is this
Brady Peck's
Fourteen years old
Lives next door
And he's where
In the capitol for Boy's Nation
Five days
Why
(heaves another paper) 'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this
How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old
You like it
It's all right
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning
And this is legitimate therapy
Therapy
Hell no,  just don't want to do it alone
'  - on slick, glossy magazine pages: each change of image is punctuated by the of the page being turned, like a gunshot
We're to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to  to Vanity Fair
And it doesn't matter
Whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful
The starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense
Finally -- (
) What is it, Nessa
The
(
) Isn't she amazing
That is such a wicked look
(
) What do you want me to see
(
) Just chill for a second
Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead
but gorgeous
Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch
At their feet is a mess of magazines
Nessa discards one and immediately starts flipping through a new one beneath it
She is very agitated
Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair
What are you doing
We're not done
just need to find the thing
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay
want to have the session
thought it would be cool if  could show you some of the things that interest me
But  guess you're not into it
which we already knew
What happened today
What are you talking about
Was it something that happened at school
(petulant) These appointments were not my idea, remember
True
Should we stop them
look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't use
Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed magazine on her chest
don't think you know what you're talking about
Uh-huh
This shrink school you went to
did you hear about it on an infomercial
Mumford waits
Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin
want to live in the world these people are in
No one ever says anything in there, have you noticed
So they're very cool
Like they're all really deep
It's when people start talking that everything goes to shit
Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back
There's this kid at school
Martin Brockett
He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares
You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me
Who appointed him my spiritual leader
If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a
22 rifle
And why's he spend all his time chasing after me
Probably thinks 'm gonna give him a hummer
Do you think that's what he wants
(after a beat) No
don't know what he wants
But know  don't like being watched
Nobody's ever paid any attention to what  did, and  liked it just fine
Where does he get off telling me disrespect myself
(a beat) Fuck him
Look in a mirror, bozo
' ,   - Mumford crosses the street from his office
huge bus with " " on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, a large group of elderly  , all of whom file neatly into Lily's Cafe
Lily stands on the sidewalk outside greeting them merrily
What's the deal
Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch
See you tomorrow
" They come through a few times each year
(greeting one cheerily) Hello, Mrs
Saito, good to see you again
(back to Mumford) It's a tour
Where am  supposed to eat
You're on your own today, honey
Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street
He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, then back out there
: Skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic
He has not noticed Mumford
(
) Hey, Skip
Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, barely checking the surrounding traffic
He is extraordinarily skillful
When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board- flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk
Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight
Doc
Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity
Lily,  want you to meet Skip
Skip, Lily
It's a pleasure to meet you
(flustered) Yeah
me you, too
was at your house
Oh
Upstairs, with Doc
Yeah, it's very nice
heard your shower
Skip can't believe what he just said
Neither can the other two, actually
Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast
Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has charmed her
Something's happening here
've seen you going by on your board, but  didn't realize -- you're so young
to be so
What
so rich
(gives him a look) so accomplished
may be young, but Doc can tell you, 'm very immature
He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery
They're all relieved
Then there's an awkward silence
Skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant
'd better get in there
That's a lot of people all at once
It's okay
They pre-order
There's a choice of three entrees
What are they
Lily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested
There's something about him
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise
Salad nicoise
love salad nicoise
(giggling) You do
Yeah
Well, come on in
She motions him in and starts to follow
Mumford makes a "what about me
" sound
Lily, grinning, just points to the sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk
(
) Dr
Mumford
Mumford turns to find Dr
Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby
It takes a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco
Finally, shaking hands -- Dr
Delbanco
It's nice to see you again
don't think you know Dr
Sheeler
She's the other therapist here in town
(shaking her hand) Of course
've heard great things about you
Thank you
You never got back to me
(Mumford doesn't understand) called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal
Kind of a professional welcome
Mumford makes a show of remembering
Forgive me, please
What a gracious thought
We must do that
When
Why don't  call you when 've got my calendar in front of me
What are you doing for lunch
Right now
The other two nod in unison
Mumford considers, trapped
- The town's upscale dining spot
Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler are in a red leather booth
Sheeler listens with rapt, admiring attention as Delbanco speaks -- annihilation anxieties engendered by bad experiences with a depriving mother
but no one can escape the fear of death
It is, as Henry James put it, "the worm at the core
" Try as we may to forget or ignore our mortality, James said -- (theatrically) -- "the skull will grin in at the banquet
" Mumford nods appreciatively
(He really is an extraordinary listener
) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious -- 've run on
Forgive me
We're here to talk about you
Are we
(covering) What Ernest means,  think, is we're very interested in other methodology
different kinds of training
We're great believers in learning from each other
've learned so much from Ern -- Dr
Delbanco
And  from Phyllis
(back to a previous thread) So
the University of Kentucky
Who runs the program down there
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum
Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo
think 've heard of him
a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he
Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant
It's possible
don't know about that
suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area
Lots of institutions
My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses
For a while  was chief therapist in a shopping mall
Had a little spot next to the yogurt place
Interesting approach
What was his name
Dorothy Fowler
Fantastic woman
She passed last year in a train wreck
Damned Amtrak
Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look
Sheeler adopts a "casual" tone -- trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and  don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences
found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing
Did you
Oh, yeah, very tough
But  guess that's good
to keep out the quacks
Which examiner did you have probably know him
Wallace Franklin
from Greensburg
dark look comes over Sheeler's face for a moment
That was a terrible thing
(agrees) don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport
(back on track) We're interested in any new therapies
How would you characterize your approach
My approach
Yes
your particular approach
don't have one really
Most of the time 'm faking it
See,  think there's not much that can be done about most problems
they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time  hear about them
The most can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got
If  can get a sense of that, well then, maybe
just maybe, can help them out a little
Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table
His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other
Finally -- see
'  - Althea Brockett
-- The argument had nothing to do with it
(
) understand
just want to know what the argument was about
(hates to say) had ordered some books
"The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written
" (
) Uh-huh
What are they
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick
those people
Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents
It's a magnificent set -- and only $33
50 per volume
Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6
99
(
) One hundred books
It's irrelevant
It had nothing to do with what happened
(
) What happened
Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford
She has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the only sign that she's not completely calm
We argued on Sunday
He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always
But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't
Didn't call either
Not till Saturday afternoon
You must have been concerned
It's happened before
(a beat) 'm shocked by how little 'm feeling
can't understand it
(a real question --) 'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't
Doubtful
What did he say
He said he wasn't coming back
He said it wasn't working for him any more
That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while
You know what  regret the most
'm sorry let him make the kids take his name
He was an acquirer
(off Mumford's look) He liked to acquire things
Mumford looks away
Althea realizes what he's thinking
You think that has something to do with my problem
Ordering all those things
It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting thought
Like  was on some kind of campaign to out-acquire him
(excited now, playing it out) If  was just an acquisition to him, and he lost interest once he had me -- She stops, shakes her head
That can't be it
It's too simple
And besides,  still like it
This morning  ordered a marble turtle cheese board from The Horchow Collection
(an odd look) Can  tell you something just awful
You know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who's got problems and say, "What she needs is a good shtupping
"
Mumford nods
Well, there may be something to that
Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, what difference does it make
(suddenly) Why do  feel elated
Am  in denial
You know what it feels like
She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast -- know my time's up, but 've got to get this out while 've got hold of it -- Take your time
(no slowing down) -- When  was in high school, the thing  wanted most, when  was stuck in class, the thing  was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass
That's all  wanted loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there
And that's how  feel right now
Like  have some giant, all- day hall pass
She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious
She stands up abruptly, flushed
My god, did it just get hot in here or what
She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse
She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body
for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, voluptuous figure
See you next time
'll probably be a basket case by then
She heads toward the door to the waiting room
Mumford indicates the back door
You can go out there if you like
(quoting Mumford) "There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc
She opens the door to the waiting room, startling Henry Follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still in hand
, '  - Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here
But that's secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy body framed in the doorway -- is having on him
She's been a customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the first time
All his libidinous buttons are being pushed
Althea breezes by, oblivious to his reaction
Hello, Mr
Follett
Have a good session
Bye, Doc
She goes out
Henry
But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has gone
,     - Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a Her informal uniform, and all the other details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif
As they head down the main corridor -- (
) Hey, Doc
Mumford looks that way
In the distance, Skip is descending from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of ramps designed for that purpose alone
None of the hustling Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of the sight
Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp with a spectacular stop
Thanks, Jennifer, 'll take him from here
The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside) leads Mumford into a side corridor
,    - Skip and Mumford move through a maze of hallways with progressively less foot traffic
've never brought anyone down here before
'm honored
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night  can't get out of my head
It's driving me batty -- (Mumford nods, waits) Why me
How did you know you could trust me
You're completely reliable
Skip is pleased
They approach a heavy steel door, the entrance to Skip's Workshop
sits at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area
Skip shouts down there -- It's just me, Dino
The old man nods, barely awake
Skip, 've got a problem and  need some advice
You want my advice
Far out
Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall
Some lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches
Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door
He hesitates, suddenly concerned -- hope nothing you're about to see will shake your faith in me
Mumford reassures him with a look
Skip pushes the door open far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind them
'  - Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace
What at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized
Many different disciplines interface here: : The first thing one notices -- some incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female
You half expect them to breathe
From there, a full wall of forms descends from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a huge variety of inflatable sex dolls
:  dizzying array of computers and screens, some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated motion
Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs
: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, limbs
Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia
- : All the machinery you need to make rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer designed
All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high- tech work surfaces
Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, picking up the odd item
Pretty creepy, huh
Are you totally disgusted
("no") Skip, you're a visionary
That can be a burden
This doesn't seem a little
perverse
There are a lot of lonely people in the world
Somebody's gonna figure this out someday
It's not going to be me
'm giving it up
Really
It's all your fault
In the last 48 hours, 've completely lost interest
What'd  do
Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face
Lily
Lily
(gets it) Skip, that's great
You and Lily
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet
Right now, of the two of us, 'm the only one in love
But 'm very stoked
Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by an array of limbs and sex toys
There's an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him
Doc, how  can be of help to you
Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button
The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place
It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical
Skip fumbles to turn it off
Sorry
Wow
Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford
'm here for you, Doc
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients
guess that makes sense
Yes, yes it does
Mumford sinks into silence
He begins to wander the room
You've fallen in love with one of your patients
Mumford nods
Skip is desperate to say something useful
Suddenly, he has an alarming thought
Doc
It's not me, is it
What
Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh
No, Skip, it's not you
But  like you a lot
Skip is relieved
He has another thought and brightens
Doc, what about this
You're not really a licensed psychologist
Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze
Skip realizes the ramifications of what he's just said
Hmm
guess that doesn't help see where you're going here
It's a mess
Yep
'  - Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler
This time, Delbanco is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa
Don't you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has recently died some exotic death
They're neither all recent nor exotic
But they're certainly dead
And yes, personally,  find it a bit odd
It could happen
What about his state certification exams
The records seem to be in order
Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear
What's easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers
For all you know he never even took the exams
That's true
don't know that it's all that easy
Doctor, correct me if 'm wrong, but it sounds to me like you've gone for this guy's story hook, line and bull- twaddle
You do seem much more disposed toward him than  understand, Ernest
Did miss something
(sharply) Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man
Are we listening to Lionel now
Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so humiliated for Lionel to witness it
Fighting tears and trying to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks to the door
Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up
Phyllis, 'm sorry
didn't mean to shout
No, Dr
Delbanco, it is  who am sorry
Sorry to have wasted your time with such
She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office
Delbanco is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the doctor least wants to see
'  - Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter
He watches Lily busily working the midday rush
She sees him grinning at her, but doesn't say anything for a while
Finally, blushing -- Stop it
He's a kid
'm old enough to be his
older sister
Mumford smiles, eats
,   - Mr
Cook opens the front door to Mumford
Dr
Mumford
Please, come in
Mumford comes in, reluctantly
Hello, Mr
Cook
was wondering if Sofie was around
Were you supposed to have a session
No
It's sort of spur of the moment
,   - Mumford follows Mr
Cook into the room
Mrs
Cook and Sofie's thirtyish brother, , are in there, watching television
Mrs
Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand, muting the  with a remote
Look who's here
Have you met Sofie's moth-- -- We've met
And our son, Ben
(vigorously shakes hands) This is a real honor, Doctor
Have a seat, will ya
Mumford continues to stand
Well, actually,  can't really
Do you think  could see Sofie
insist
've been wanting to meet you
Mumford sits
(icy) Sofie's not here
Mumford's surprised
Mr
Cook speaks with some pleasure
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner
First time in a long time she's been willing
friend
We owe that to you
She's perked up a lot since you started treating her
Mrs
Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting
What'd you want
There's something  think we need to talk about
What
Elizabeth
think we have a right
We certainly do not
Keep it zipped, Ben
Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue
Is there something we need to know, Dr
Mumford
Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them
Well
yes,  guess  should tell you
don't think 'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore
Mr
Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance
Mrs
Cook actually cheers up
Finally, some common sense
What do you mean
think you know what  mean
No,  really don't
think you do
Why don't you tell me
(very calm) Why don't you go to hell
It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it
Elizabeth, 'm tellin' you, stop this
(dismissive) You're telling me
That's rich
(standing up) 'd better go
Why can't you see Sofie
know the treatment's working
Mumford looks from Ben to Mr
Cook, who nods his agreement
Well
you see, the problem is -- -- the problem is you're a big fake
You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl
Mumford looks at Mrs
Cook and can't stifle a laugh
Wow
You're something
Take a hike, Dr
Quack
(ignoring her now) What is the problem, Doctor
Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs
Cook, even as he speaks to Mr
Cook
Problem
guess there is no problem
Uh, this friend of Sofie's, where'd he take her
It's she -- Roxy
Used to work with her
think they went over to The Lantern
(delighted) Oh, Roxy
Excellent
Roxy
Mrs
Cook looks at him sharply
She's heard what the other two have not
/ - Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and into an alley
As he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings, something catches his eye
'  :  young couple is embracing and talking intimately
As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett
Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign
Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall
Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen
, '  - There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open
When a   appears in there, Mumford raps on the metal screen
'  - Follett's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore
When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror
The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened
What is it
It's a thought  had
Should  open it now
Mumford seems hesitant, but nods
Follett takes out an Exacto knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him
Let me just say something here have no idea if this is going to help
What exactly is it supposed to do
You remember when  asked you about pornography -- --  find it degrading
Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on -- -- and you told me that
Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and,  think, getting in your way -- -- Which  don't necessarily agree
But you did come to me
Follett reacts
It's true, even if he keeps forgetting
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young
Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them
Anyway,  thought we could try an experiment
(indicating the box) And the experiment is in here
Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted
You know what
think this was a dumb idea
He starts to take hold of the box
just heard myself talking and realize 'm completely unqualified to be doing this
Let's forget the whole thing
Follett grabs the box back
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing want to know what's in here
(pulling on the box) There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you
'm embarrassed to have -- Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession
Loud -- Hey
agree with you that you don't know what you're talking about
That's what 've been saying all along
And can guarantee you that looking at the Lost Ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me
(quieting down) but if you think 'm going to let you walk out of here without seeing what's in this box, you don't know much about Henry
Follett
Mumford gives up
Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him
Now, with much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett carefully cuts open the package
is revealed as Follett opens the flaps
There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue: "  -- Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia
" Follett lifts away the wrapping -- There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, Dude
Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag Humor
Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc
Finally, two video tapes, both of Russ Meyer films:  and - We stay   the contents of the box as Follett's hands shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages
Very soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous businessmen
world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, and frustrated, neglected wives
In other words, exactly the erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies
'
He is transported, mesmerized, galvanized
In fact, at this moment, as the  , a tear is rolling down his cheek
He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford
The only thing that could wreck his mood now, is -- (
) Mr
Follett -- Follett jumps, startled from his revery
As the Young Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it
What
What the hell is so important can't have five minutes --
The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the room
It's her, sir
You told me to get you when she came to pick up her prescription
It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, his whole manner changes
He dismisses the Young Pharmacist with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to Mumford
Uh, sorry, 'm going to have to
(indicates box) really appreciate what you're trying to
uh,  can't thank you enough for
My pleasure
Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm
'll see you on
whatever
He hurries out
Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks down through the one-way mirror
: Follett hurries up behind the prescription counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy
Follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting
Althea is responsive
Follett motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private
He comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea something on the prescription bottle
Althea leans back against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in Follett's first fantasy
Mumford reacts, bemused
- Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail
Despite her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her
When  was in high school we used to come up here and make out
liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down
That's what  like
Which thing
Either one
Why'd you come to the house the other night
thought  had something to tell you
But it turned out  didn't
My brother said you were about to fire me
That's one way to put it
bet  know what changed your mind
(Mumford looks at her) My mother
She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me
thought only action movies had villains like that
Sofie gestures ahead
That's the cut-off, isn't it
(Mumford nods) know why you were going to quit seeing me
Mumford slows at this
Sofie heads off the trail into the woods
- Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock
Mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself
You feel like a fake, an imposter
Mumford looks up, sharply
as if maybe you don't know what you're doing
She puts a hand on his arm
Everybody feels that way sometimes
like we're not who we're supposed to be
But  have to tell you, Dr
Mumford -- He winces at her formality
-- you've been a tremendous help to me
Yeah
can't tell you how much  admire you
You have a wonderful way with people
And you're very insightful
feel like you've seen me clearly
never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was
You've made that possible for me
That's
good
Yes
And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who  was, just like Mother
The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is
don't know if -- You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great
've never had a man treat me this way
With you, feel really
listened to
(gives him a look) Can  tell you something
It's a little embarrassing, but  feel very unguarded with you
Of course
Thanks to this therapy,  now know what 'm looking for
need to find a man like you
(laughs) Not one who's treating me, of course
(full of resolve) And 'm going to do it, dammit
You've given me the confidence
Mumford is in agony
Sofie
that makes me very happy
'  - Nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette
There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her
mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded
said that to him,  said, "If you think 'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded
" What'd he say
(can't hide her pleasure) He said -- "Which we already knew
" Mumford laughs, delighted
What did he want you to do
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes
told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no
As you can see -- She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle finger, flipping the bird
Then he says stop smoking dope
No again
So then he says he doesn't want me getting together with any other guys
Mumford doesn't have to see her face to know how much pleasure this gives her, despite her hard-ass cover
What balls on this guy
What're we
(too geeky for her) going steady
Jesus
No again
(long pause) said 'd consider it
Nobody owns me
And the last thing was insane don't know what's wrong with him
No magazines
Really
don't know if  can quit
We're gonna try it together, like, you know,  or something
And  made him give up his
22
No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune
He agreed
(yes) He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy don't know how much longer  can put up with it
already got two arms and legs,  don't need another appendage
She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her cigarette as she stands up -- Oops
gotta go
She heads toward the waiting room
Mumford gestures to indicate the back door
She waves him off
He shakes his head -- no one wants to use the back anymore
Nessa opens the door to the waiting room
Martin Brockett is sitting there
He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying around, then stands up
She goes into his arms like maybe she's the puppy
He beams and looks at Mumford
Hiya, Doc
Martin
(pulling Nessa tighter) Did you straighten her out
Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows smoke in his face
How are you
Insane
Didn't ja hear
My family got five hundred times better
(turning Nessa) Let's go, Vanessa
Nessa gives Mumford an embarrassed, "ain't he corny
" look, but as they go out the door, she's never looked happier
(
) Doctor Mumford
Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, , rising from the chair behind the door
He's got a briefcase and a document in his hand
didn't see you there
Can  help you
My name's Gilroy
'm from the State Certification Board
He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't take it
It's all right, it won't bite you
Under civil code 1294
67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed
This is the notice
(takes the paper) Do you want to come in
(already leaving) No thanks
Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along
Mr
Gilroy -- Gilroy stops, outside door already open
What brought this on
'm not at liberty to say
Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint
We'll be in touch
He goes out
Mumford considers the paper in his hands, thoughts elsewhere
'  - half full of books and   other boxes, half-packed with Mumford's personal belongings -- he doesn't have a lot
On the bed, an open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in
We're across the room and out onto the porch, to  Mumford in his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky
Mumford      downstairs at Lily's
Then the    of a wet couple
(
) Far out
Mumford smiles
He gets up and goes inside, closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy
He goes to the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser
Right now, he's not going anywhere
'  - - of Ernest Delbanco
We can't tell where he is at first
As he speaks, we   to  him lying on Mumford's couch -- a patient
and when you said at lunch about everybody having "a secret life", something just snapped inside me knew  could no longer continue my relationship with Dr
Sheeler
It was tearing me up inside
And  know Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed from it
What had started as a genuine respect,  think, for each other's professional abilities, and became, over time, a personal attraction had somehow
migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship
Across the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no reaction
won't go into that today
Though, if we should continue these sessions, as  certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that  would like to look at
God knows, 've listened to enough people giving me the juicy -- (catches himself) At any rate,  just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me
just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow
How do you mean
This next is painful for Delbanco
Well
you see, when  broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring
What kind of doubts
About you
your background and your qualifications
'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board
Mumford digests this
see
And please, for whatever small way may have encouraged this, accept my apologies
(brightens) There is good news, though
What's that
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city
Which leaves you the only psychologist in town
Dr
Sheeler is leaving Mumford
'm sorry to hear that
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed
Unlike, must say, those of my wife
Mumford's head snaps up
He had no idea Delbanco was married
,   (  ' ) - We () are being pummelled by three behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's fantasy town
[In  &
] Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked   watches in horror from the backdoor of the building
We    The Newcomer yet
(
) Old Man Sutter's young bride had got me in hot water all right, and now was bein' dealt the beating of my life
If there'd just been two of those bastards it would have been a little closer
One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace
, then   : ,   - as the concerned Landlady, cleavage foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen Newcomer's face with a washcloth
Beyond her, near the half- open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing on her thumb
(
) The Landlady was good at quite a few things, but doctoring wasn't one of them
and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time
He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the manner of a fifties movie
(
) Lucky for me, one of the other boarders, the broad who lived downstairs in the front room
, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining
(
) was a nurse
As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern on her face
(
) and she had ways to make you feel better they didn't teach in nursing school
Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, '  - () Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch
Mumford's glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the end of the session
Follett snaps out of his revery and gets up
'm very happy for you, Henry
Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously
feel like we're making real progress here
Me too, Doc
And  can't tell you what that package meant to me -- Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture
Follett accepts and goes out the back door
Mumford is pleased someone still wants to use that door
Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers when he  the entry door to the waiting room
Not expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office door and opens it
Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock
She peers past him to see if he's alone
need to talk to you
Doctor
Can come in
Of course
Sofie sits on the couch
Mumford sits in his chair, facing her
Her voice is as strained as her manner
We haven't met in this office since that first time
This is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other
Mumford waits
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship
Is something wrong, Sofie
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr
Mumford
You're upset
How intuitive
That must take years of training right there
Maybe you can guess what has upset me
Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing through his mind
Finally, carefully -- Is it something you've heard about me
No, it is not something 've heard about you
It is someth-- (stops suddenly) Why
Is there something  should have heard about you
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind
Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she looks around frenetically for a moment
Then, indicating the couch -- May
Mumford gestures "of course
" Sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face
(It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us
) This seems to help Sofie a bit
All right
'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you
Um-huh
(tone still rough) First of all,  have been feeling much better lately
don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but feel a hundred per cent better than when  first came to you
'm glad
Given that, 'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
don't follow you
(sharply) 'm saying that since 'm doing so much better -- which  attribute to you -- 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings
(tentative) Okay
The point is this --  am not a blank page
did not just fall off the turnip truck
Do you know what mean
think so
know a little about psychology took three different courses in college
It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but  took them
And there was one concept  remember very well
What was that
Transference
Transference
Yes, and that is what  have got right now
have taken my feelings of gratitude
and relief
and transferred them onto
you
have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you
So that now  am under the delusion
(a deep breath) that  am in love with you
Mumford appears frozen in his chair
There is a heavy silence in the room
Sofie does not look back there
Hello
Hello
think you can understand why have some serious questions about your methods
mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that 'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks
She is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it
-- We had a paper route together, for godssake
Do you understand how might be a little resentful
Knowing that this so-called "love" 'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of
transference
Mumford doesn't know what to say
He's on the rack
Finally -- Yes
Silence
Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand
Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it
She will not meet his gaze
Maybe you ought to think about how you're going to fix this
And when you do
(suddenly losing her will) please get back to me
Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back
- Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into the driveway toward his stairs
Ainge leaps over the front yard fence
Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving
Hey, Ainge
Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the garden
Doc
(keeps walking) Lily
Doc
Mumford reluctantly stops
Lily comes up to the fence
don't want you to be mad at Skip
He told you
(yes) Skip and  wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you
That's a big deal
(dismisses it) You would have met in some shower eventually
want to give you something
Will you let me
Thanks, Lily,  don't need anything
Yes, you do, you damn well do
(can't fight) Okay
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing
That's it
That's what you're giving me
Clean up the mess
No matter what it takes
Mumford leans down to pet Ainge
What it might take is
doing time
Too bad
That's tough,  mean it
'm not unsympathetic
But Skip says you're in love
Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it
Then it's worth it
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead
Ainge jumps back over to her side
'll tell her tonight
Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs

, in State Police uniform, with a sadistic glint in his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by
The guy was obsessed
didn't always know where to draw the line
but would have trusted him with my wife -- er, my life -- (looks off camera, laughing) -- What'd  say
Both, actually
(gets serious again) can't say  was surprised, though, when he disappeared
Ragged telephoto shots of the Drug Rehab Center in the desert, low, innocuous adobe buildings
Who was this enigma
a courageous public servant or a debauched addict
Either way, his last known stop was here
isolated in the Arizona desert
taken in by an order of devoted monks
, a monk with a clerical collar, , is loading groceries into the back of a pick-up
He's being ambush interviewed
He's polite, but not cooperative
We don't talk about the people who've been our guests
but  can tell you this about our order -- we believe everybody has the right to start over
everybody deserves a second chance
Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway
And perhaps
that is exactly the chance the now-sober pilgrim took
on a blustery November day
walking away from the rehab center
never to be heard from again
'  : ' 'd like to know if he's alive
If he is,  just hope he's happy and his new life is
(not sure how to put it) well,  hope he's found what he was looking for
Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion
His sister's face  into a new snapshot of Mumford, dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the  on the show comes up
1-800 telephone number appears across the bottom of the frame
If you have any information about this man or know anything about his whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's Department in Cochise County, Arizona, or call this number
,    - Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of Mumford
(or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering light
- on the porch steps
Mumford runs into the shot
In fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of breath
He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the doorbell, and waits
Mrs
Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially sour look on her face
She speaks through the screen door
Well, look who's here
Good evening, Mrs
Cook
Just who is here, can you tell me
Could  see Sofie, please
No, you can not
wouldn't know who to say is calling
(
) Mother
Mrs
Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then hisses at Mumford -- could see right through you from the start, you imposter
know what you're after
knew it then and know it now
Sofie appears behind her mother
Mother
What do you think 'm after, Mrs
Cook
Sofie
It's so obvious
you're after my daughter
Well,  gotta say, Mrs
Cook, you're right about that
Both Sofie and Mrs
Cook are set back for a moment
Mrs
Cook recovers fastest -- It'll never happen
You're in big trouble, mister
(scary strong) Mother
go away
Mr
Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs
Cook by the arm and makes her vanish
Sofie and Mumford are left alone
She looks at him through the screen
guess you saw the show
Which show was that
Sofie
Part of it
We were watching "" until someone called
You probably got the idea
Sofie comes outside
She doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch
Do you know what a betrayal this is
Mumford knows
How violated  feel
You're not the only one
Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up
You feel violated
Not me
all my other my patients
smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
You deserve it
Mumford agrees
He watches her closely
should be irate
Mumford immediately perks up
Sofie tries to correct -- am irate
(grabbing at the thread) But
But nothing
'm mad as hell
This is a terrible thing you've done
know it
Please believe me,  know that
Mumford steps closer to her
But, there is one
mitigating factor want you to consider before you write me off
What
Will you think about it
don't know
Depends
'm in a bad mood
love you
More than 've ever loved anyone or anything in my life
She looks into his eyes
Oh
want to spend the rest of my life with you
but 'm not sure you feel the same way
She regards him for several moments, her mind racing
sort of do
Mumford feels joy
Now, finally, he takes her in his arms
but first, you have to tell me something
Anything
just ask
What is your name
As Mumford breaks into a huge grin,  : ,    - Mumford is at the defense table
Lionel is his lawyer
Sofie, Mr
Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail
(
) The defendant will rise
Mumford and Lionel stand up
(
) Sit down, Lionel
Lionel sits down, squelched again
We see   for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged
do
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people
there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing
Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr
Delbanco and Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, sits with the
People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing
and that you are who you say you are
Yes, your honor
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills
You understand that
Yes
Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone
But now he looks down the row
Althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size too small
She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs provocatively
Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them
Mr
White,  am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000
'm sorry, your honor
What
'm sorry you're frustrated
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr
White
No, sir
was empathizing
Sorry
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine
Three months in jail, three months house arrest
Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility
Case closed
This court is adjourned
The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out moves in to take custody of Mumford
Lionel stands up and leans in -- It's a country club
Don't worry about it
Thanks for your help, Lionel
Mumford turns to face the Cooks
Mr
Cook and Ben shake his hand like he's just won something
Lionel addresses them all with his usual self-satisfaction -- 'll have him out in half the time
on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace
You got off easy
Will you wait for me
We're only talking about six weeks
Will you be here
Of course
haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast
They kiss
The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we -- : - Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal restraint
lone    is up front, driving
There's a heavy security screen divider between front and back
Better make yourself comfortable
We got a three hour drive here
'm fine
You're the shrink, aren't you
No, not really
But you do therapy
Not any more
They ride along in silence
At peace, Mumford watches the town go by
Finally -- 'll tell you, Doc, the wife and , we got a little bit of a problem
Would you mind if  just ran it by you
The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view mirror, waiting hopefully
Mumford ponders the question a long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug
Go ahead
,    - The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford behind
