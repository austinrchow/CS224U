The Seventh Seal The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of wind blows across the colorless sea
The , Antonius Block, lies prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand
His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep
Nearby his squire  is snoring loudly
He has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees
His open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea
They are as thin and worn as their masters
The  has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips
rolls over to face the forest and the darkness
He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head
scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime
The  returns to the beach and falls on his knees
With his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers
His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently
His face is sad and bitter
He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish
The sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead
cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon
High up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings
Its cry is weird and restless
The ' large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies
Antonius Block turns around
Behind him stands a man in black
His face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak
Who are you
am Death
Have you come for me
have been walking by your side for a long time
That  know
Are you prepared
My body is frightened, but  am not
Well, there is no shame in that
The  has risen to his feet
He shivers
opens his cloak to place it around the ' shoulders
Wait a moment
That's what they all say
grant no reprieves
You play chess, don't you
gleam of interest kindles in ' eyes
How did you know that
have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads
Yes, in fact 'm quite a good chess player
But you can't be better than  am
The  rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard
He places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces
Why do you want to play chess with me
have my reasons
That is your privilege
The condition is that  may live as long as hold out against you
If  win, you will release me
Is it agreed
The  holds out his two fists to , who smiles at him suddenly
points to one of the ' hands; it contains a black pawn
You drew black
Very appropriate
Don't you think so
The  and  bend over the chessboard
After a moment of hesitation, Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn
moves, also using his king's pawn
The morning breeze has died down
The restless movement of the sea has ceased, the water is silent
The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens
The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space
The day is already scorchingly hot
The squire  is awakened by a kick in the rear
Opening his eyes, he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly
He scrambles to his feet, saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack
The  slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and up towards the road
He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire
soon overtakes him
(sings) Between a strumpet's legs to lie Is the life for which  sigh
He stops and looks at his master, but the  hasn't heard ' song, or he pretends that he hasn't
To give further vent to his irritation, sings even louder
(sings) Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level
finally gets the ' attention
He stops singing
The , his horse, ' own horse and  himself know all the songs by heart
The long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner
They ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon
Beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun
In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things
Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place
Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens
The  doesn't answer
Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun
black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders
The miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, wagging its tail
dismounts and approaches the sleeping man
addresses him politely
When he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake
He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back his hand
The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards
It is a corpse, staring at  with empty eye sockets and white teeth
remounts and overtakes his master
He takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight
Well, did he show you the way
Not exactly
What did he say
Nothing
Was he a mute
No, sir,  wouldn't say that
As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent
Oh
He was eloquent, all right
The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing
(sings) One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms
Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim
Must you sing
No
The  hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while
The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces
There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves
They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves
In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas
horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the ' horse
The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road
In his sleep,  the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance
He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon
The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of ' wife, , and their one-year-old son, , who are sleeping deeply and peacefully
Near them,  , an older man, snores loudly
crawls out of the wagon
There is still a spot of shade under the big trees
He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse
Good morning
Have you had breakfast
can't eat grass, worse luck
Can't you teach me how
We're a little hard up
People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country
He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them
Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen
Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face
The wind causes the trees to sway slightly
The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur
The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble
' face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears
With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head
The unseen bird continues to sing
Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, ' smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat
The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies
comes to life
He rushes into the wagon and shakes  awake
Mia, wake up
Wake up
Mia, 've just seen something
've got to tell you about it
(sits up, terrified) What is it
What's happened
Listen, 've had a vision
No, it wasn't a vision
It was real, absolutely real
Oh, so you've had a vision again
's voice is filled with gentle irony
shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders
But  did see her
Whom did you see
The Virgin Mary
can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor
She lowers her voice
Did you really see her
She was so close to me that  could have touched her
She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold
She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk
And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me
My eyes filled with tears and when  wiped them away, she had disappeared
And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth
Can you understand
What an imagination you have
You don't believe me
But it was real,  tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind
Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush
(embarrassed) Why must you keep bringing that up
And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails
Well, perhaps that time  made it up
(eagerly) did it just so that you would believe in my other visions
The real ones
The ones that didn't make up
(severely) You have to keep your visions under control
Otherwise people will think that you're a half-wit, which you're not
At least not yet -- as far as  know
But, come to think of it, 'm not so sure about that
(angry) didn't ask to have visions
can't help it if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company
(sits up) Haven't  told you once and for all that  need my morning's sleep
have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works
So now 'm telling you to shut up
His eyes are popping with rage
He turns over and continues snoring where he left off
and  decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon
They sit down on a crate
has  on her knees
He is naked and squirms vigorously
sits close to his wife
Slumped over, he still looks dazed and astonished
dry, hot wind blows from the sea
If we would only get some rain
Everything is burned to cinders
We won't have anything to eat this winter
(yawning) We'll get by
He says this smilingly, with a casual air
He stretches and laughs contentedly
want Mikael to have a better life than ours
Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick
What's that
To make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air
But that's impossible
Impossible for us -- but not for him
You're dreaming again
She yawns
The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass
does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders
've composed a song
made it up during the night when  couldn't sleep
Do you want to hear it
Sing it
'm very curious
have to sit up first
He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice
(sings) On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high
He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife
Mia
Are you asleep
It's a lovely song
haven't finished yet
heard it, but  think 'll sleep a little longer
You can sing the rest to me afterwards
All you do is sleep
is a bit offended and glances over at his son, , but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass
comes out from the wagon
He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor
In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask
Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor
If the priests didn't pay us so well, 'd say no thank you
Are you going to play Death
Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense
When are we supposed to do this play
At the saints' feast in Elsinore
We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not
Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy
People like it better, and, besides, it's more fun
Idiot
There's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies
is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband
And what part am  to play
You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the Soul of Man
That's a bad part, of course
Who makes the decisions around here
Who is the director of this company anyhow
, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically
Bear this in mind, you fool
Your life hangs by a thread
Your time is short
(in his usual voice) Are the women going to like me in this getup
Will  make a hit
No
feel as if  were dead already
He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously
sits, leaning forward
lies beside him on the grass
Jof
What is it
Sit still
Don't move
What do you mean
Don't say anything
'm as silent as a grave
Shh
love you
Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist
The dismounts and enters
After tying up the horses,  slowly follows him in
When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise
To the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished
Perched on a crude scaffolding is a  wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes
He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces
What is this supposed to represent
The Dance of Death
And that one is Death
Yes, he dances off with all of them
Why do you paint such nonsense
thought it would serve to remind people that they must die
Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier
Why should one always make people happy
It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while
Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting
Oh, they'll look
skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman
If you do scare them
They'll think
And if they think
They'll become still more scared
And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests
That's not my business
You're only painting your Dance of Death
'm only painting things as they are
Everyone else can do as he likes
Just think how some people will curse you
Maybe
But then 'll paint something amusing for them to look at
have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me
The plague
That sounds horrible
You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat
You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man 've painted over there
The  points with his brush
sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain
That looks terrible
It certainly does
He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere
Does that scare you
Scare
Me
You don't know me
What are the horrors you've painted over there
The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment
Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God
Do they really whip themselves
Yes, it's a terrible sight
crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by
Do you have any brandy
've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert
think  frightened you after all
sits down with the , who produces a jug of brandy
The  is kneeling before a small altar
It is dark and quiet around him
The air is cool and musty
Pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes
Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of anguish
On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being
The  hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it
The face of  appears behind the grille for an instant, but the  doesn't see him
want to talk to you as openly as  can, but my heart is empty
doesn't answer
The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face
see myself in it, and  am filled with fear and disgust
doesn't answer
Through my indifference to my fellow men, have isolated myself from their company
Now live in a world of phantoms
am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies
And yet you don't want to die
Yes,  do
What are you waiting for
want knowledge
You want guarantees
Call it whatever you like
Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses
Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles
doesn't answer
How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves
What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to
And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing
The  stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him
There is complete silence
Why can't  kill God within me
Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though  curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart
Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that  can't shake off
Do you hear me
Yes,  hear you
want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge
want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me
But He remains silent
call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there
Perhaps no one is there
Then life is an outrageous horror
No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness
Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life
But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness
When that day comes
In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God
You are worrying
Death visited me this morning
We are playing chess together
This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter
What matter is that
My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning
feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this
But will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed
Is that why you are playing chess with Death
He is a clever opponent, but up to now haven't lost a single man
How will you outwit Death in your game
use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered
In the next move 'll shatter one of his flanks
'll remember that
shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly
You've tricked and cheated me
But we'll meet again, and 'll find a way
(invisible) We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing
The  raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window
This is my hand
can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it
The sun is still high in the sky and , Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death
He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple
Meanwhile,  and the  have got drunk and are talking animatedly together
Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home
Do you understand, you little pictor
The Crusade
(drunk) Precisely
For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God
Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up
But what you said about the plague was horrible
It's worse than that
Ah, me
No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you
That's the truth
The rump behind you, the rump behind you there's a profound truth
paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself
This is squire Jns
He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls
His world is a Jnsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell
The  walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine
manages to set himself down from the scaffolding
Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks
Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken
Her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn't appear to be fully conscious
and the  stop and watch in silence
The soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected
The monk mumbles from a small book
One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman
holds his nose
That soup of yours has a hell of a stink
What is it good for
She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil One
He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall
And now she's in the stocks
She will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary
But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of us
(holding his nose) And you do that with this stinking mess
It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog
The Devil can't stand the smell
Neither can
walks over towards the horses
The  stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl
She is almost a child
Slowly she turns her eyes towards him
Have you seen the Devil
The  stops reading and raises his head
You must not talk to her
Can that be so dangerous
don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected
understand
He nods resignedly and walks away
The young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare
The sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road
The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire
The waterskin is empty and  looks for a well where he can fill it
They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage
As always, his movements are light and almost soundless
The door to the cottage is open
He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters
It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object
He looks down
Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground
At the sound of approaching steps,  quickly hides behind the door
man comes down a ladder from the loft
He is broad and thick-set
His eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy
His clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags
He carries a cloth sack
Looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag
Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger
At that moment a young woman comes through the door
She stops and stares at the stranger
Why do you look so surprised
steal from the dead
These days it's quite a lucrative enterprise
The  makes a movement as if to run away
You're thinking of running to the village and telling
That wouldn't serve any purpose
Each of us has to save his own skin
It's as simple as that
Don't touch me
Don't try to scream
There's no one around to hear you, neither God nor man
Slowly he closes the door behind the
The stuffy room is now in almost total darkness
But  becomes clearly visible
recognize you, although it's a long time since we met
Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde
You are Dr
Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis
smiles uneasily and looks around
Am  not right
The  stands immobile
You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better- class crusade to the Holy Land
looks around
You look uncomfortable
Do you have a stomach- ache
smiles anxiously
When  see you,  suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste
Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves
The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency
That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight
acted in good faith
But now you know better, don't you
Because now you have turned into a thief
more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels
Isn't that so
With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of ' hand, gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off
Suddenly the  screams
stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand
By all means
'm not bloodthirsty
He bends over
Don't beat me
don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor
But remember this: the next time we meet, 'll brand your face the way one does with thieves
(he rises) What  really came for is to get my waterskin filled
We have a deep well with cool, fresh water
Come, 'll show you
They walk out of the house
lies still for a few moments, then he rises slowly and looks around
When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals away
quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water
The  helps him
Jns is my name
am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds
'm kindest of all to young women
With them, there is no limit to my kindness
He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back
Almost immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the  on the cheek
Goodbye, my girl
could very well have raped you, but between you and me, 'm tired of that kind of love
It runs a little dry in the end
He laughs kindly and walks away from her
When he has walked a short distance he turns; the  is still there
Now that  think of it,  will need a housekeeper
Can you prepare good food
(the  nods) As far as  know, 'm still a married man, but have high hopes that my wife is dead by now
That's why  need a housekeeper
(the  doesn't answer but gets up) The devil with it
Come along and don't stand there staring
've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal
She begins walking towards him, her head bent
He doesn't wait for her but walks towards the , who patiently awaits his squire
The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province
The plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast
The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn
Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce
The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily
There are merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids
whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon
The  and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall
They drink beer and doze in the midday heat
The  from the deserted village sleeps at ' side
beats the drums,  blows the flute,  performs a gay and lively dance
They perspire under the hot white sun
When they have finished  comes forward and bows
Noble ladies and gentlemen,  thank you for your interest
Please remain standing for a little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me
and  have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage
They bow, to the public
Here is the husband
Here is the wife
If you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid
As  said,  play the lover and haven't entered yet
That's why 'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being
(he wipes the sweat from his forehead) It's damned hot
think we'll have a thunderstorm
He places his leg in front of  as if to trip him, raises 's skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains
is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl
His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red
He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself
In the meantime  and  play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim
suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl
woman stands there, stately in both height and volume
frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor
She suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn't quite fit
She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here
Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine
manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement
Standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows
The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat
At this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites
When he sees this look,  makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel
She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily
doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands
The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes
Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer
Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of  with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize
hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist
He lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear
His words seem to please her
She puts her arms around the actor's neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass
The small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks
stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand
pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage
Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail
Does she snore
May  point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore
think she should snore anyhow
This opinion causes mirth in the audience
becomes slightly confused and goes out of character, but  keeps her head and begins snoring
Night and moonlight now prevail
There snores --  mean sleeps -- my wife so frail
Jealous  am, as never before, hide myself behind this door
Faithful is she To her lover -- not me
He soon comes a-stealing To awaken her lusty feeling
shall now kill him dead For cuckolding me in my bed
There he comes in the moonlight, His white legs shining bright
Quiet as a mouse, here 'll lie, Tell him not that he's about to die
hides himself
immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to the left
Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my heart's delight
She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her
The mood in the yard in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the heat
Now a rapid change occurs
People who had been laughing and chattering fall silent
Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes
steps out in front of the curtain
His painted face bears an expression of horror
has risen with  in her arms
Some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to mutter half-forgotten prayers
All have turned their faces towards the white road
Now a shrill song is heard
It is frenzied, almost a scream
crucified Christ sways above the hilltop
The cross-bearers soon come into sight
They are Dominican monks, their hoods pulled down over their faces
More and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically
The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs
After the line of monks comes another procession
It is a column of men, boys, old men, women, girls, children
All of them have steel-edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling ecstatically
They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam
They have been seized by madness
They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost rhythmic outbursts
Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats
Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each other and help each other to intensify the scourging
Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn
The monks fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed tightly together
Their song never stops
The Christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd
It is not Christ triumphant, but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain
The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, suffering scorn and shame
The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road
They collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle
Their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun
large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red- brown from the sun
His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn
God has sentenced us to punishment
We shall all perish in the black death
You, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour
Death stands right behind you
can see how his crown gleams in the sun
His scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads
Which one of you shall he strike first
You there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall
And you, woman, who bloom with life and self- satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns
You back there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse
Do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced
Do you hear what  say
Do you hear the word
You have been sentenced, sentenced
The  falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful glance
Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face upwards
Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation
Don't turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ
He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a strong voice
The monks rise and join in the song
As if driven by some superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing and moaning
The procession continues
New members have joined the rear of the column; others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road
the squire drinks his beer
This damned ranting about doom
Is that food for the minds of modern people
Do they really expect us to take them seriously
The  grins tiredly
Yes, now you grin at me, my lord
But allow me to point out that 've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other
(yawns) Yes, yes
Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost -- all these 've accepted without too much emotion
He leans down over the  as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head
The  drinks his beer silently
(contentedly) My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns
My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy
Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying
The beer mug is empty
Sighing,  gets to his feet
The  follows him like a shadow
In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression
He stops  with a roar
What are you screaming about
am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire Jns
That's possible
Have you seen my wife
No,  haven't
But if  had seen her and she looked like you, 'd quickly forget that 'd seen her
Well, in that case you haven't seen her
Maybe she's run off
Do you know anything
know quite a lot, but not about your wife
Go to the inn
Maybe they can help you
The smith sighs sadly and goes inside
The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity
In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns on an iron spit
The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and perspiration
Yes, it's true
The plague is spreading along the west coast
People are dying like flies
Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, 've still got my whole stock unsold
They speak of the judgment day
And all these omens are terrible
Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head
The day of judgment
Imagine
It hasn't rained here for a month
We'll surely lose our crops
And people are acting crazy, 'd say
They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go
The day of judgment
Just think, just think
If it's as they say,  suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can
But there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of
(whispers) Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself
Judgment day
And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown
There are many who have purged themselves with fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell
This is the end, yes, it is
No one says it out loud, but all of us know that it's the end
And people are going mad from fear
So you're afraid too
Of course 'm afraid
The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open
It will be terrible to see
They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other
, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to , who is still dressed in his costume
Opposite him sits , leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily
rolls an armlet out on the table
Do you want this armlet
You can have it cheap
can't afford it
It's real silver
It's nice
But it's surely too expensive for me
Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife
Has she disappeared
They say she's run away
Has she deserted you
With an actor
An actor
If she's got such bad taste, then think you should let her go
You're right
My first thought, of course, was to kill her
Oh
But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do
'm also going to kill the actor
The actor
Of course, the one she eloped with
What has he done to deserve that
Are you stupid
The actor
Now  understand
There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor
You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre
And that turned out to be her misfortune
Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune
Isn't that true
Now  enters the discussion
He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil
Listen, you
You sit there and lie to the smith
liar
You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady
Are you an actor too
An actor
Me
wouldn't quite call myself that
We ought to kill you; it's only logical
(laughs) You're really funny
How strange -- you've turned pale
Have you anything on your conscience
You're funny
Don't you think he's funny
(to Plog) Oh, you don't
Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind
bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump
He gets up
(shouting) What have you done with my wife
The room becomes silent
looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape
He puts his hands on the table
Suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers
snatches away his hands and raises his head
He looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him
Do you want to hurt me
Why
Have  provoked someone, or got in the way
'll leave right now and never come back
looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense
Get up so everyone can hear you
Talk louder
Trembling,  rises
He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out
Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are
gets up on the table and stands on his head
hand pushes him forward so that he collapses on the floor
rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand
(shouts) What have you done with my wife
beats him so furiously that  flies across the table
leans over him
Don't lie there moaning
Get up and dance
don't want to
can't
Show us how you imitate a bear
can't play a bear
Let's see if you can't after all
prods  lightly with the knife point
gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death
He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently
gasps as if his lungs were about to burst
He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him
Up again
Be a good bear
haven't done any harm
haven't got the strength to play a bear any more
At that moment the door opens and  enters
sees his chance and steals out
intends to follow him, but suddenly stops
and  look at each other
Do you remember what  was going to do to you if we met again
steps back without speaking
'm a man who keeps his word
raises his knife and cuts  from forehead to cheek
staggers towards the wall
The hot day has become night
Singing and howling can be heard from the inn
In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers
Hidden in the grass and the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness
The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass
has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms
They play together and laugh happily
Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea
Not far from the wagon, the  sits crouched over his chess game
He lifts his head
The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child
The  gets up
sees him and smiles
She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the What's his name
Mikael
How old is he
Oh, he'll soon be two
He's big for his age
Do you think so
Yes,  guess he's rather big
She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt
When she sits down again, the  steps closer
You played some kind of show this afternoon
Did you think it was bad
You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming
You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now
Is that your husband
(laughs) Jonas
The other man is my husband
His name is Jof
Oh, that one
And now there's only him and me
We'll have to start doing tricks again and that's more trouble than it's worth
Do you do tricks also
We certainly do
And Jof is a very skillful juggler
Is Mikael going to be an acrobat
Jof wants him to be
But you don't
don't know
(smiling) Perhaps he'll become a knight
Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either
No, you don't look so happy
No
Are you tired
Yes
Why
have dull company
Do you mean your squire
No, not him
Who do you mean, then
Myself
understand
Do you, really
Yes,  understand rather well
have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can
Isn't that so
She nods energetically and the  smiles seriously
Now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder
Black figures flicker across the grass mound
Someone collapses, gets up and runs
It is
stretches out her arms and receives him
He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways
He kneels
holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done
How are you
What is it
Does it hurt
What can  do
Have they been cruel to you
She runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's dirty, bloody face
Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges
Blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise  seems unhurt
Ouch, it hurts
Why did you have to go there
And of course you drank
's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger
She pats him a little harder than necessary
Ouch
didn't drink anything
Then  suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with
People don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies
swear to you that  didn't say a word about angels
You were, of course, busy singing and dancing
You can never stop being an actor
People also become angry at that, and you know it
doesn't answer but searches for the armlet
He holds it up in front of with an injured expression
Look what  bought for you
You couldn't afford it
(angry) But  got it anyhow
The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight
now pulls it across her wrist
They look at it in silence, and their faces soften
They look at each other, touch each other's hands
puts his head against ' shoulder and sighs
Oh, how they beat me
Why didn't you beat them back
only become frightened and angry
never get a chance to hit back
can get angry, you know that
roared like a lion
Were they frightened
No, they just laughed
Their son  crawls over to them
lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him
gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at
Do you notice how good he smells
And he is so compact to hold
You're a sturdy one
real acrobat's body
He lifts  up and holds him by the legs
looks up suddenly, remembering the knight's presence
Yes, this is my husband, Jof
Good evening
Good evening
becomes a little embarrassed and rises
All three of them look at one another silently
have just told your wife that you have a splendid son
He'll bring great joy to you
Yes, he's fine
They become silent again
Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia
Thank you,  don't want anything
(housewifely) picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon
And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow
that we were allowed to milk
So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor
Please be seated and 'll bring the food
They sit down
disappears with
Where are you going next
Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore
wouldn't advise you to go there
Why not, if  may ask
The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south
It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands
Really
Well, sometimes life is a little hard
May  suggest
( looks at him, surprised) that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like
Or go along the east coast
You'll probably be safer there
has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon
wish you good appetite
humbly thank you
These are wild strawberries from the forest have never seen such large ones
They grow up there on the hillside
Notice how they smell
She points with a spoon and smiles
The  nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought
eats heartily
Your suggestion is good, but  must think it over
It might be wise to have company going through the forest
It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits
That's what 've heard
(staunchly) Yes, 'd say that it's not a bad idea, but have to think about it
Now that Skat has left, am responsible for the troupe
After all, have become director of the whole company
(mimics) After all,  have become director of the whole company
comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the points with her spoon
Do you want some strawberries
This man saved my life
Sit down, my friend, and let us be together
(stretches herself) Oh, how nice this is
For a short while
Nearly always
One day is like another
There is nothing strange about that
The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold
But spring is best of all
have written a poem about the spring
Perhaps you'd like to hear it
'll run and get my lyre
He sprints towards the wagon
Not now, Jof
Our guests may not be amused by your songs
(politely) By all means
write little songs myself
For example,  know a very funny song about a wanton fish which  doubt that you've heard yet
The  looks at him
You'll not get to hear it either
There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and don't want to upset anyone
'm a sensitive soul
has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody
yawns and lies down
People are troubled by so much
It's always better when one is two
Have you no one of your own
Yes,  think  had someone
And what is she doing now
don't know
You look so solemn
Was she your beloved
We were newly married and we played together
We laughed a great deal
wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears
We went hunting together and at night we danced
The house was full of life
Do you want some more strawberries
(shakes his head) Faith is a torment, did you know that
It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call
don't understand what you mean
Everything 've said seems meaningless and unreal while  sit here with you and your husband
How unimportant it all becomes suddenly
He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times
Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling
Now you don't look so solemn
shall remember this moment
The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk, your faces in the evening light
Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre
'll try to remember what we have talked about
'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk
He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky
And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me
He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest
continues to play on his lyre
stretches out on the grass
The  picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach
It is quiet and deserted; the sea is still
have been waiting for you
Pardon me
was detained for a few moments
Because  revealed my tactics to you, 'm in retreat
It's your move
Why do you look so satisfied
That's my secret
Of course
Now  take your knight
You did the right thing
Have you tricked me
Of course
You fell right in the trap
Check
What are you laughing at
Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead
You're rather arrogant
Our game amuses me
It's your move
Hurry up
'm a little pressed for time
understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game
It takes time
is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board
The smiles
Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest
Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son
Why do you ask
Oh, no reason at all
The  suddenly stops smiling
looks at him scornfully
Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn
There is the ,  and the ,  and  in their wagon
Their son, , is already asleep
is still missing
goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer
The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner
At one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands
His expression is very sad
Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob
It is , the smith, who sits there and whimpers
God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith
Good evening
Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness
Yes, yes, look at the smith
He moans like a rabbit
If  were in your boots, 'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way
pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side
Are you married
hundred times and more
can't keep count of all my wives any longer
But it's often that way when you're a traveling man
can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else 've had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn't impossible
Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them
So, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing
Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a mother-in-law
And then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead
nods delightedly
He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's voice
Why don't you kiss me good night
(in the same way) Why don't you sing a song for me
Why don't you love me the way you did when we first met
Why don't you look at my new slip
You only turn your back and snore
Oh hell
Oh hell
And now she's gone
Rejoice
(furious) 'll snip their noses with pliers, 'll bash in their chests with a small hammer, 'll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge
begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow
looks at him with interest
Look how he howls again
Maybe  love her
So, maybe you love her
Then, you poor misguided ham shank, 'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around
Yes, but it hurts anyway
Of course
Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love
But you almost always get over it
No, no, not me
Yes, you too
There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while
Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose
It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any
If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection
You're happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel
Believe
Who said that  believed it
But love to give good advice
If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one, because after all  really am an educated man
gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands
becomes very unhappy and grabs his belt
Listen, Jns
May  go with you through the forest
'm so lonely and don't want to go home because everyone will laugh at me
Only if you don't whimper all the time, because in that case we'll all have to avoid you
gets up and embraces
Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk towards the door
When they come out in the yard,  immediately catches sight of them, becomes angry and yells a warning to
Jns
Watch out
That one wants to fight all the time
He's not quite sane
Yes, but now he's just sniveling
steps up to , who blanches with fear
offers his hand
'm really sorry if  hurt you
But  have such a hell of a temper, you know
Shake hands
gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and squeezed
While  tries to straighten out his fingers,  is seized by great good will and opens his arms
Come in my arms, little brother
Thank you, thank you, perhaps later
But now we're really in a hurry
climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse
The small company is on its way towards the forest and the night
It is dark in the forest
First comes the  on his large horse
Then  and  follow, sitting close to each other in the juggler's wagon
holds her son in her arms
follows them with his heavily laden horse
He has the smith in tow
The sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep
The footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing -- yet it is quiet
Then the moon sails out of the clouds
The forest suddenly becomes alive with the night's unreality
The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of the beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow
The wanderers stop
Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding
Their faces are pale and unreal in the floating light
It is very quiet
Now the moon has come out of the clouds
That's good
Now we can see the road better
don't like the moon tonight
The trees stand so still
That's because there's no wind
guess he means that they stand very still
It's completely quiet
If one could hear a fox at least
Or an owl
Or a human voice besides one's own
They say it's dangerous to remain standing in moonlight
Suddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest road, a ghostlike cart emerges
It is the  being taken to the place where she will be burned
Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, carrying their lances on their backs
The girl sits in the cart, bound with iron chains around her throat and arms
She stares fixedly into the moonlight
black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his head
Where are you going
To the place of execution
Yes, now  can see
It's the girl who has done it with the Black One
The witch
The  nods sourly
Hesitantly, the travelers follow
The  guides his horse over to the side of the cart
The  seems to be half-conscious, but her eyes are wide open
see that they have hurt your hands
The ' pale, childish face turns towards the  and she shakes her head
have a potion that will stop your pain
She shakes her head again
Why do you burn her at this time of night
People have so few diversions these days
Saints preserve us, be quiet
It's said that she brings the Devil with her wherever she goes
You are eight brave men, then
Well, we've been paid
And this is a volunteer job
The  speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the
(to the ) What's your name
My name is Tyan, my lord
How old are you
Fourteen, my lord
And is it true that you have been in league with the Devil
nods quietly and looks away
Now they arrive at the parish border
At the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads
The pyre has already been stacked in the center of the forest clearing
The travelers remain there, hesitant and curious
The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams
They nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder
will be bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry
The sound of the hammering echoes through the forest
The  has dismounted and walks closer to the cart
Again he tries to catch ' eyes, touches her very lightly as if to waken her
Slowly she turns her face towards him
They say that you have been in league with the Devil
Why do you ask
Not out of curiosity, but for very personal reasons
too want to meet him
Why
want to ask him about God
He, if anyone, must know
You can see him anytime
How
You must do as  tell you
The  grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles whiten
leans forward and joins her gaze with his
Look into my eyes
The  meets her gaze
They stare at each other for a long time
What do you see
Do you see him
see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear
But nothing else
He falls silent
The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in the forest
No one, nothing, no one
(shakes his head) No
Can't you see him behind your back
(looks around) No, there is no one there
But he is with me everywhere
only have to stretch out my hand and  can feel his hand
He is with me now too
The fire won't hurt me
He will protect me from everything evil
Has he told you this
know it
Has he said it
know it,  know it
You must see him somewhere, you must
The priests had no difficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers
They are so afraid of him that they don't even dare touch me
The sounds of the hammers stops
The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted in the moss
They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron moans weakly, as if she were far away
Why have you crushed her hands
(surly) We didn't do it
Who did
Ask the monk
The soldiers pull the iron and the chains
' shaven head sways, gleaming in the moonlight
Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound emerges
They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and the stake
The  turns to the , who remains seated in the cart
What have you done with the child
turns around and looks at him
Don't you ever stop asking questions
No, 'll never stop
The soldiers chain  to the rungs of the ladder
She submits resignedly, moans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position
When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre
The steps up and leans over her
For a moment  thought of killing the soldiers, but it would do no good
She's nearly dead already
One of the soldiers approaches
Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and sweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill
've told you to be careful
Don't go too close to her
The  doesn't heed this warning
He cups his hand, fills it with water from the skin and gives it to
Then he gives her a potion
Take this and it will stop the pain
Smoke billows down over them and they begin to cough
The soldiers step forward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree
hangs there motionlessly, her eyes wide open
The  straightens up and stands immobile
is behind him, his voice nearly choked with rage
What does she see
Can you tell me
(shakes his head) She feels no more pain
You don't answer my question
Who watches over that child
Is it the angels, or God, or the Devil, or only the emptiness
Emptiness, my lord
This cannot be
Look at her eyes, my lord
Her poor brain has just made a discovery
Emptiness under the moon
No
We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our sides, because we see what she sees, and our terror and hers are the same
(an outburst) That poor little child
can't stand it, can't stand it
His voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away
The  mounts his horse
The travelers depart from the crossroads
finally closes her eyes
The forest is now very dark
The road winds between the trees
The wagon squeaks and rattles over stones and roots
bird suddenly shrieks
lifts his head and wakes up
He has been asleep with his arms around 's shoulders
The  is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks
His silence makes him seem almost unreal
and  are slightly drunk and support each other
Suddenly  has to sit down
He puts his hands over his face and howls piteously
Oh, now it came over me again
Don't scream
What came over you
My wife, damn it
She is so beautiful
She is so beautiful that she can't be described without the accompaniment of a lyre
Now it starts again
Her smile is like brandy
Her eyes like blackberries
searches for beautiful words
He gestures gropingly with his large hands
(sighs) Get up, you tear-drenched pig
We'll lose the others
Yes, of course, of course
Her nose is like a little pink potato; her behind is like a juicy pear -- yes, the whole woman is like a strawberry patch
can see her in front of me, with arms like wonderful cucumbers
Saints almighty, stop
You're a very bad poet, despite the fact that you're drunk
And your vegetable garden bores me
They walk across an open meadow
Here it is a little brighter and the moon shimmers behind a thin sky
Suddenly  points a large finger towards the edge of the forest
Look there
Do you see something
There, over there
don't see anything
Hang on to something, my friends
The hour is near
Who is that at the edge of the forest if not my own dearly beloved, with actor attached
The two lovers discover  and it's too late
They cannot retreat immediately takes to his heels
chases him, swinging his sledge and bellowing like a wild boar
For a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and bushes in the gray gloom of the forest
The duel begins to look senseless, because both of them are equally frightened
The travelers silently observe this confused performance
screams once in a while, more out of duty than out of impulse
(panting) You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven scurvy bitches, if  were in your lousy rags would be stricken with such eternal shame about my breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in short, about my whole body -- that  would immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing self
(angry) Watch out, you perfumed slob, that  don't fart on you and immediately blow you down to the actor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and recite monologues to each other until the dust comes out of the Devil's ears
Then  throws herself around her husband's neck
Forgive me, dear little husband, 'll never do it again
am so sorry and you can't imagine how terribly that man over there betrayed me
'll kill him anyway
Yes, do that, just kill him
He isn't even a human being
Hell, he's an actor
He is only a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a jug
Just kill him
sobs with excitement and sorrow
looks around, a little confused
uses this opportunity
He pulls out a dagger and places the point against his breast
She's right
Just kill me
If you thought that was going to apologize for being what  am, you are mistaken
Look how sickening he is
How he makes a fool of himself, how he puts on an act
Dear Plog, kill him
My friends, you have only to push, and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality
An absolutely tangible corpse
Do something then
Kill him
(embarrassed) He has to fight me, otherwise  can't kill him
Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged shred
Idiot, your day is short
You'll have to irritate me a little more to get me as angry as before
looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes towards the night sky
forgive all of you
Pray for me sometimes
sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground
The travelers stand confused
rushes forward and begins to pull at ' hands
Oh dear, dear,  didn't mean it that way
Look, there's no life left in him
was beginning to like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too spiteful
leans over his colleague
He's dead, totally, enormously dead
In fact, 've never seen such a dead actor
Come on, let's go
This is nothing to mourn over
He has only himself to blame
And  have to be married to her
We must go on
lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast
The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on the other side of the meadow
When  is sure that no one can see him, he sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast
It is a stage dagger with a blade that pushes into the handle
laughs to himself
Now that was a good scene
'm really a good actor
After all, why shouldn't  be a little pleased with myself
But where shall  go
'll wait until it becomes light and then 'll find the easiest way out of the forest
'll climb up a tree for the time being so that no bears, wolves or ghosts can get at me
He soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage
He sits down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch
(yawns) Tomorrow 'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll go to the saints' feast in Elsinore
We'll make lots of money there
(yawns) Now, 'll sing a little song to myself: (sings) am a little bird Who sings whate'er he will, And when  am in danger fling out a pissing trill As in the carnal thrill
(speaks) It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight
(sings) The terrible night doesn't frighten me
He interrupts himself and listens
The sound of industrious sawing is heard through the silence
Workmen in the forest
Oh, well
(sings) The terrible night doesn't frighten me
(speaks) Hey, what the devil
it's my tree they're cutting down
He peers through the foliage
Below him stands a dark figure diligently sawing away at the base of the tree
becomes frightened and angry
Hey, you
Do you hear me, you tricky bastard
What are you doing with my tree
The sawing continues without a pause
becomes more frightened
Can't you at least answer me
Politeness costs so little
Who are you
straightens his back and squints up at him
cries out in terror
'm sawing down your tree because your time is up
It won't do
haven't got time
So you haven't got time
No,  have my performance
Then it's canceled because of death
My contract
Your contract is terminated
My children, my family
Shame on you, Skat
Yes, 'm ashamed
begins to saw again
The tree creaks
Isn't there any way to get off
Aren't there any special rules for actors
No, not in this case
No loopholes, no exceptions
saws
Perhaps you'll take a bribe
saws
Help
saws
Help
Help
The tree falls
The forest becomes silent again
Night and then dawn
The travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss
They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the wind in the tree tops
Here the forest is wild and impenetrable
Huge boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants
fallen tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow
,  and their child have sat down apart from the others
They look at the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and unstable
The  sits bent over his chess game
cries quietly behind ' back
lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens
Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket
'm so frightened
We feel that something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what
Maybe it's the day of judgment
The day of judgment
Now, something moves behind the fallen tree
There is a rustling sound and a moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal
Everyone listens intently, all faces turned towards the sound
voice comes out of the darkness
Do you have some water
' perspiring face soon becomes visible
He disappears in the darkness, but his voice is heard again
Can't you give me a little water
(pause) have the plague
Don't come here
If you do 'll slit your throat
Keep to the other side of the tree
'm afraid of death
No one answers
There is complete silence
gasps heavily for air
The dry leaves rustle with his movements
don't want to die
don't want to
No one answers
' face appears suddenly at the base of the tree
His eyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam
Can't you have pity on me
Help me
At least talk to me
No one answers
The trees sigh
begins to cry
am going to die
What will happen to me
Can no one console me
Haven't you any compassion
Can't you see that
His words are choked off by a gurgling sound
He disappears in the darkness behind the fallen tree
It becomes quiet for a few moments
(whispers) Can't anyone
only a little water
Suddenly the  gets up with a quick movement, snatches ' water bag and runs a few steps
grabs her and holds her fast
It's no use
It's no use
know that it's no use
It's meaningless
It's totally meaningless
tell you that it's meaningless
Can't you hear that 'm consoling you
Help me, help me
No one answers, no one moves
' sobs are dry and convulsive, like a frightened child's
His sudden scream is cut off in the middle
Then it becomes quiet
The  sinks down and hides her face in her hands
places his hand on her shoulder
16 The  is no longer alone
has come to him and he raises his hand
Shall we play our game to the end
Your move
raises his hand and strikes the ' queen
Antonius Block looks at Now  take your queen
didn't notice that
The  leans over the game
The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, which seem to have a life of their own
has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens
Then he sees the and  together
He becomes very frightened and awakens
Mia
Yes, what is it
see something terrible
Something  almost can't talk about
What do you see
The knight is sitting over there playing chess
Yes,  can see that too and  don't think it's so terrible
But do you see who he's playing with
He is alone
You mustn't frighten me this way
No, no, he isn't alone
Who is it, then
Death
He is sitting there playing chess with Death himself
You mustn't say that
We must try to escape
One can't do that
We must try
They are so occupied with their game that if we move very quietly, they won't notice us
gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear
She stares fixedly at the and the chess game
She holds her son in her arms
Now  returns
have harnessed the horse
The wagon is standing near the big tree
You go first and 'll follow you with the packs
See that Mikael doesn't wake up
does what  has told her
At the same moment, the  looks up from his game
It is your move, Antonius Block
The  remains silent
He sees  go through the moonlight towards the wagon
bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance
Have you lost interest in our game
The ' eyes become alarmed
looks at him intently
Lost interest
On the contrary
You seem anxious
Are you hiding anything
Nothing escapes you -- or does it
Nothing escapes me
No one escapes from me
It's true that 'm worried
He pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his coat
He looks up at
've forgotten how the pieces stood
(laughs contentedly) But  have not forgotten
You can't get away that easily
leans over the board and rearranges the pieces
The  looks past him towards the road
has just climbed up on the wagon
takes the horse by the bridle and leads it down the road
notices nothing; he is completely occupied with reconstructing the game
Now  see something interesting
What do you see
You are mated on the next move, Antonius Block
That's true
Did you enjoy your reprieve
Yes,  did
'm happy to hear that
Now 'll be leaving you
When we meet again, you and your companions' time will be up
And you will divulge your secrets
have no secrets
So you know nothing
have nothing to tell
The  wants to answer, but  is already gone
murmur is heard in the tree tops
Dawn comes, a flickering light without life, making the forest seem threatening and evil
drives over the twisting road
sits beside him
What a strange light
guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with dawn
No, it's something else
Something terrible
Do you hear the roar in the forest
It's probably rain
No, it isn't rain
He has seen us and he's following us
He has overtaken us; he's coming towards us
Not yet, Mia
In any case, not yet
'm so afraid
'm so afraid
The wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks
Now the horse stops with his ears flat against his head
The forest sighs and stirs ponderously
Get into the wagon, Mia
Crawl in quickly
We'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us
They crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child
It is the Angel of Death that's passing over us, Mia
It's the Angel of Death
The Angel of Death, and he's very big
Do you feel how cold it is
'm freezing
'm terribly cold
She shivers as if she had a fever
They pull the blankets over them and lie closely together
The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind
The roar outside is like a giant bellowing
The castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn
Now the storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and abutments
The sky darkens; it is almost like night
Antonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle
But it seems deserted
They walk from room to room
There is only emptiness and quiet echoes
Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily
Suddenly the  stands face to face with his wife
They look at each other quietly
heard from people who came from the crusade that you were on your way home
've been waiting for you here
All the others have fled from the plague
The  is silent
He looks at her
Don't you recognize me any more
The  nods, silent
You also have changed
She walks closer and looks searchingly into his face
The smile lingers in her eyes and she touches his hand lightly
Now  can see that it's you
Somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy who went away so many years ago
It's over now and 'm a little tired
see that you're tired
Over there stand my friends
Ask them in
They will break the fast with us
They all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the walls
Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book
"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour
And  saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets
And another
" Three mighty knocks sound on the large portal
interrupts her reading and looks up from the book
rises quickly and goes to open the door
"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up
" Now the rain becomes quiet
There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence in the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over the ceiling and the walls
Everyone listens tensely to the stillness
"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and a third part of the sea became blood
" Steps are heard on the stairs
returns and sits down silently at his place but does not continue to eat
Was someone there
No, my lord
saw no one
lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book
"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood
" They all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them through the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand close together
Good morning, noble lord
am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you courteously to my house
am a smith by profession and rather good at my trade, if  say so myself
My wife Lisa -- curtsy for the great lord, Lisa
She's a little difficult to handle once in a while and we had a little spat, so to speak, but no worse than most people
The  hides his face in his hands
From our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord
Have mercy on us because we are small and frightened and ignorant
(bitterly) In the darkness where You are supposed to be, where all of us probably are
In the darkness You will find no one to listen to Your cries or be touched by Your sufferings
Wash Your tears and mirror Yourself in Your indifference
God, You who are somewhere, who must be somewhere, have mercy upon us
could have given you an herb to purge you of your worries about eternity
Now it seems to be too late
But in any case, feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still roll your eyes and move your toes
Quiet, quiet
shall be silent, but under protest
(on her knees) It is the end
and  sit close together and listen to the rain tapping lightly on the wagon canvas, a sound which diminishes until finally there are only single drops
They crawl out of their hiding place
The wagon stands on a height above a slope, protected by an enormous tree
They look across ridges, forests, the wide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the clouds
stretches his arms and legs
dries the wagon seat and sits down next to her husband
crawls between ' knees
lone bird tests its voice after the storm
The trees and bushes drip
From the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind
points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like silver needles over the horizon
see them, Mia
see them
Over there against the dark, stormy sky
They are all there
The smith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and Jns and Skat
And Death, the severe master, invites them to dance
He tells them to hold each other's hands and then they must tread the dance in a long row
And first goes the master with his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles at the end with his lyre
They dance away from the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the dark lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their cheeks
He is silent
He lowers his hand
His son, , has listened to his words
Now, he crawls up to  and sits down in her lap
(smiling) You with your visions and dreams
