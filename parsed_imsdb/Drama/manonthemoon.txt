Man on the Moon Man on the Moon (1999) by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski
: - Standing in a nonexistent set is  , looking a bit nervous
Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness
His hair is slicked-down, and he wears the " " costume from the Andy Kaufman special
Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar
(  ) Hallo
am Andy
Welcoom to my movie
(beat; he gets upset) hoped the story of my life would be nice
but it turned out terrible
It is all
Tings are mixed up
real people  knew play different people
So  broke into Universal and cut out the junk
Now it's much shorter
In fact, this is the end of the movie
So tanks for comink
Bye-bye
Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling starts to play
roll
Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience
Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music
He does that as many times as the credits require
Finally,
And then--a sly smile
He leans in
and
(  ) Okay
Just my friends are left wanted to get rid of those other people
they would have laughed in the wrong places
(beat) was only kidding about the movie
it's actually
It shows everything
from me as a little boy until my death -- (his eyes pop; he covers his mouth) Oops
wasn't supposed to talk about that
Oh
Eh, uh, we better just begin
It starts back in Great Neck, Long Island
Andy turns to a primitive 16mm  and turns it on
He smiles at the flickering light
Oh, yes
remember it well
We   the white light
It fills our frame, blazing whiter, whiter
: - 1957 - image slowly becomes
Great Neck, 1957
An upper-class Jewish neighborhood
In the street, crewcut  play t-ball, laughing and shouting
fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and , 40, gets out
Still in his suit, he's a well- meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible
Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game
At bat is his son , 6, a natural charmer
Michael swings -- crack
-- and hits a solid single
Stanley smiles
That's my boy
Good swingin', kiddo
(warm beat; then a look) Hey -- Michael
where's your brother
He's inside
Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black
He frowns angrily, then snatches his briefcase and marches in
,  - 1957 - Baby  is crying
Mom , 35, quickly peels carrots, trying to get dinner made
Stanley marches past
Is he in his room
Of course he's in his room
(aggravated) All his "friends" are in there
Stanley glowers
He huffs upstairs
,  - 1957 - Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door
We hear little Andy doing
(
) (as  ) But professor, why are the monsters growing so big
(now as ) It's something in the jungle water
need to crack the secret code
Stanley rolls his eyes
He opens the door
, '  - 1957 - revealing , 8, performing for the wall
Andy is happy and enthusiastic
as long as he's acting
(as ) Maybe  should talk to the natives
(as dancing ) Shoom boom boo ba
Shoom boom boo ba -- Andy
(startled) Oh
The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted
awkward
Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son
Andy, this has to stop
Our house isn't a television station
There is not a camera in that wall
Andy glances over at the wall
Hmm
(cont'd) (trying to cope) Son
listen to me
It isn't healthy
You should be outside, playing sports
But 've got a sports show
Championship wrestling, at five
(he blows his top) You know that's not what  meant
Look, 'm gonna put my foot down
No more playing alone
You wanna perform, you  have an audience
(he points at the wall) -but  have them
No
That is  an audience
That is
An audience is people made of flesh
They -- live and breathe
Got it
Andy thinks, considering his options
Then, he nods
: ,   - 1957 - Baby Carol sits in her crib
Andy's hands suddenly  her out
, '  - 1957 - Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor
She dutifully sits there, deadpan
Andy returns to the center of the room
He resumes his show
(as ) And now, boys and girls
It's time for
Fun House
(he makes an ) Hi, everybody
Are you ready for a singalong
'll say the animal, and you make his sound
Okay
Okay
(he starts to ) "Oh, the cow goes
" Carol stares, unblinking
Then -- Moo
(he smiles, pleased) "And the dog goes
" "And the cat says
" : - 1975 - on , now
26-years-old, still performing the song
- It's a small, hip New York nightclub
"And the bird says
" "And the lion goes
" "And that's the way it goes
" (he grins) Thank you
Goodbye
Andy waves and bows
There's faint scattered applause
Andy sighs
An irritated  steps onstage
He shoots Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike
The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies and Gentlemen
In the b
g
, Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets, conga drums, a phonograph
it all goes into a big bulky case
: - 1975 - The club is empty
At the bar, the manager cleans up
Andy eagerly comes over
Offstage, his presence is soft, placid -- his voice barely above a whisper
So, Mr
Besserman, same slot tomorrow
(awkward) Eh,  dunno
Andy
'm
thinkin' of letting you go
You're firing me
(beat) You don't even pay me
Look --  don't wanna seem insulting
But
your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs
puppets
playing records
stunned beat
Andy is hurt
What do you want
"Take my wife, please"
Sure
Comedy
Make jokes about the traffic
Do impressions
Maybe a little blue material
don't swear
--  don't do what everyone else does
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'
Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel
" Andy stares, disheartened
(cont'd) 'm sorry
You're finished here
An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying
The manager is dumbfounded
He doesn't know what to do
Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks
The manager is confused -- totally disoriented
Shamed, Andy covers his face, then runs out
Silence
The manager stares after him
having no idea what just happened
- 1975 - Sobbing Andy bursts out the door
He steps onto the sidewalk -- and
Just like that
Andy lifts his big case and starts walking
Andy shakes his head angrily
He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an unsavory New York neighborhood
But then appear
silently approaching
Andy stops uncertainly -- debating whether to turn around
But in that second -- the thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly
#1 Give us your wallet
Andy stares fearfully
An anxious moment
He thinks
considering his options
Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick
(  ) -- doo not unterstand
#1 Give us your money
(  ) What
What mooney
Abu daboo do not have mooney
The thugs glance at each other
(  ) (cont'd) Pleaze
just move to America yezterday
do not know
#1 What's in the case
(  ) Eeet, eet is just perzonal trifles from my homeland -- #2 Shut up
Gimme that thing
The guy snatches the case
He impulsively  the lock
and clothes, congas and records fall out
The thugs are dismayed
#1 Goddamn immigrants
#2 This guy's pathetic
Let's go
Harsh glances
They angrily turn and leave
Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things off the street
He shouts after the guys: (  ) Tank you veddy much
: - 1975 - The Improv, the biggest comedy club around
People are lined up, waiting
The man strides up --  , a Hollywood talent manager
George is old school: Bronx accent, shmooze and a hug
but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming
sees him, grins, and waves George in
,  - 1975 - The bar is packed with  and
few turn and smile -- "George
"  "Hey, George
"  George takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the
,  - 1975 - Where the show's in progress
Owner   sees George and gives him a bear-hug
Then he hustles George to a table
George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention
Up there is a
So 'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present:  pre- paid funeral
The mortician asked me if  wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated
said, "Make it all three
'm not takin' any chances
" (the crowd ) Thank you
Good night
The comic waves and exits
George politely claps
jumps in with an upbeat show tune
We think there's a break
when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage
He is in character as Foreign Man
Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights
He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs
The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is
Andy tentatively grabs the mike
The stagefright is agony
(  ) Now
Now
(looking around) Tank you veddy much
am very happy to be here
tink -- this is a very beautiful place
But one ting  do not like is too much traffic
Tonight  had to come from, eh, and the freeway, it was so much traffic
It took me an hour and a half to get here
Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline
Silence
The crowd is baffled
(  ) (cont'd) But -- talking about the terrible things: My wife
Take my wife, please take her
Yikes
few
Andy gestures, as if they got the joke
(  ) (cont'd) No really,  am only foolink love my wife very much
But she don't know how to cook
You know, one time, she make a steak and mashed potato
Ehh, and the night before, she make spaghetti and meatballs
Her cooking is so bad
is terrible
People are embarrassed
Some avert their eyes
couple hipsters laugh mockingly
George leans forward
Andy wipes the sweat from his brow
(  ) (cont'd) Right now,  would like to do for you some imitations
So first, would like to imitate Archie Bunker
(no change in his voice) "You stupid, everybody ees stupid
Ehh, get, get out of my chair Meathead
go in the, eh, Dingbat get into the kitchen, making the food
Ehh, everybody ees stupid don't like nobody, ees so stupid
" Tank you veddy much
(pleased, he proudly bows) Now  would like to imitate Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States
(no change in his voice) "Hello,  am Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States
" Some people  and walk out
few giggle, getting into the groove
George is intrigued
(  ) (cont'd) And now
would like to imitate the Elvis Presley
woman  caustically
Andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us
He presses "Play" on a
and the   2001 starts playing
House lights dim dramatically
With a flourish, Andy pulls tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones
He removes his pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket
He combs his hair
Then he brushes his hair
Then he combs his hair some more
Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins around
He is
-
The crowd is blown away
Vegas Elvis   suddenly blasts
Andy/Elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow
Then he goes stage right and takes a bow
Then he returns stage left for another bow
Music
( ) Thank you very much
Wow
Flabbergasted, people
This man is Elvis
Suddenly -- " " guitar kicks in
( ) (cont'd) () "Warden threw a party In the county jail
Prison band was there And they  to
" - He is astonished
George cannot quite figure out what's going on
but he wants in
He waves Budd over
Budd leans down, and George
Pst
What's the story with this guy
think he's Lithuanian
None of us can understand him
George nods admiringly
He does a hell of an Elvis
: ,  - 1975 - Andy is packing up his things
He very methodically folds each item of clothing, then checks the creases
George strolls up
Hey,  really enjoyed your set
(  ) Tank you veddy much
So  understand you're from Lithuania
(  ) No
Caspiar
George is puzzled
Caspiar
haven't heard of that
(  ) It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea
(beat) It sunk
Oh
Hm
'm uh, sorry
(beat) Well, look, 'm probably out of my mind -- but  think you're very interesting
If you ever need representation
we should talk
George hands him a
Andy reads it -- then his eyes pop
He  the accent
Mr
Shapiro, it's an honor
George realizes it's all been an act
He laughs heartily
Caspiar, huh
: - Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals
Andy and George sit together, trying to get a sense of each other
You see,  want to be the biggest star in the world
George is surprised at this hubris
People love
comedians
'm not a comedian
have no talent
(he shrugs) 'm a song-and-dance man
George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant hanging from Andy's nostril
George cringes
He doesn't know what to say
waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's -- seaweed, beans, stringy paste
George frowns
Andy beams
(cont'd) Mmm
particularly recommend the Lotus root
Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands
Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes
Sprouts in piles
George peers at the bizarre food behavior
You show a lot of promise
but
my concern is  don't know where to book you
You're not a stand-up
your act doesn't exactly translate to films
help me
where do you see yourself
(bright) 've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall
George is unsure if that's a joke
Yeah, ha-ha
That's funny
Andy dips his silverware in the water glass
Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin
George stares, perplexed
He looks back up -- and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils
Huh
See,  don't want easy laughs
Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent prayer
George raises an eyebrow
Andy snaps his head back up
(cont'd) want gut reactions
want that audience to go through an experience
They love me
They hate me
They walk out -- it's all Andy triumphantly eats a bean
George peers, unable to take the booger anymore
He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose
Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box
(cont'd) After 'm famous,  can sell these as "Worn by Andy Kaufman
" And at that
George is won over
He smiles broadly
You're insane
(then sincere) But -- you might also be brilliant
Alright, Andy
let's do it
George warmly extends his hand
Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand
The men shake
moment of supreme importance
- The glitz strip of Los Angeles
Money
Beauty
/ - Real working showbiz offices
No glamour at all
It looks more like an insurance agency
George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig
You'll be on the road
get some exposure
, a  shouts out
(
) Tony Clifton on the phone
Who
(
) He says he's an associate of Andy Kaufman's
Oh
(back to the phone) Sammy, think about it
gotta go
(he punches a line) Hello
George Shapiro here
On the phone, a ,    blares
(
) Uh, yeah
Is this
(beat) Er, yes
Speaking
(
) "Speaking"
Reeking, seeking, creaking
Freaking
George is baffled
Can  help you with something
(
) Yeah
You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you
(stunned) Who is this
(
) You -- you know damn straight who it is
Tony Clifton
name to respect
name to fear
(beat) Beer
Gear
Deer
Ear
Look
don't know what your problem is
(
) Kaufman's a lying bastard
If you sign him, 'll
Clifton hangs up
George is bewildered
,  - The light is magical
Soothing  music plays
Andy and fifteen other   sit on mats in a semi- circle
Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating
Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian At his feet is the class teacher,  , a teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice
Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes
You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert
The students all open their eyes
Do any thoughts come
#1 My mind is clear
feel great
Good
#2 All the tension is gone from my body
The Yogi's eyes go to Andy
Andy smiles sweetly
want to thank you, your Holiness
My heart is radiating with pure energy
The Yogi nods kindly
You always had a good heart
But 'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline
Yes
got me focused
In fact, my manager got me a  gig
It's just some new show with no budget, but 'm still excited
Oh
The Yogi peers intently
Are you at peace with your family
Um, yes
haven't fought with them, since  started here
Goals are important
stopped drinking
gave up drugs
And 'm meditating three hours a day
It's the center of my life
We are all impressed
Andy smiles beatifically
This means a lot
Okay
Anyone else --
Oh, wait
have a question
(beat; working up his nerve) Is there
is there a secret to being funny
Huh
The Yogi thinks hard
squinching up his face
Then
he finally speaks
Yes
Silence
: - An  sits, waiting for the commercial to end
tweak lights
get ready
Sitting in  seats are Andy's
Stanley and Janice are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's
They're all anxious
still can't believe my brother's gonna be on
hope he doesn't get nervous
What's the difference
This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it
The commercial ends, and the "" sign blinks
The crowd
An "  " sign lights up
Welcome back to Saturday Night Live
And now, as a special treat on our first show
musical guest The  orchestra starts the intro into a song
Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone
When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth
Instead he looks around -- frightened
The band stops
and starts again
Andy remains mute
The Band stops again
,  - The  producer,  , looks worried
What's happening to him
- At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it loudly
The   " " plays -- but Andy just blankly stands there
He's purposefully doing nothing
(
) "Although we are in danger, We never despair, Because we know where there is danger He is there
" The audience is puzzled
The Kaufmans are alarmed
,  - Lorne Michaels is panicked
Oh my God, he's doing nothing
It's dead air
- (
) "We're not worrying at all
We're just listening for his call
" Then  -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly (
) (cont'd) "Here  come to save the day
" Shocked, the crowd  with
Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression
(
) (cont'd) "That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way
" The audience  with glee
The tune , and the audience
Delighted, Andy grins and bows
The Kaufmans clap the hardest
Stanley locks eyes with Andy
and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all
: / - George jumps from his desk
Andy is walking in
Andy, c'mon
Thanks for flyin' out here
The stewardess let me keep my headphones
That's
terrific
But  got something better
This is
(giddy; milking the moment) You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on
a Andy's smile drops
He freezes up
Sitcom
And this is a
It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows
It takes place in a taxi stand
And you're gonna be the Fonzie
(confused) 'm -- Fonzie
The Fonzie
The crazy breakout character
The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes
(soft) George,  hate sitcoms
, you ain't heard the best part
has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- (he checks his notes) "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic
Long pause
Then -- Andy responds
No
"No"
"No" to which part
No to the whole thing
None of it sounds good
George is flummoxed
Andy
this is every comedian's dream
told you, 'm not a comedian
And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter
(shocked) -but, this is classy
they did Bob Newha-- 'm not interested
want to create my own material
Beat
George glares
You have to do it
refuse
(he explodes) , you arrogant putz
've been in this business for twenty years
know
If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never,  see another one like it again
Long pause
Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion
Then Andy gets up and looks around the office
He stares at the awards
the gold records
emblems of success and experience
Andy thinks -- then nods
Okay
Fine, 'll do it
(beat) But  have a few terms
(relieved) Of course
That's what negotiations are for
Andy starts to write on a piece of paper
(cont'd) What are you doing
Writing down my terms
George watches patiently
Andy clicks his pen, done
George smiles and takes the list
He scans it
then his face gets totally befuddled
Are you makin' fun of me --
This is
(blas) Those are my terms
They're
Jesus
(he points at one item) mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"
Who is this
He's a Vegas entertainer
used to do impressions of him
We sorta
got in a fight over that
George gets a look
This Clifton called me up
He's a loon
He  you
Nah, he just talks tough
But  owe him one
Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern
(cont'd) If 'm the new Fonz
's just gonna have to give me what  want
(a sarcastic ) Heyyyyyy
George winces
He stares at the list
-  - George sits across a conference table from three He stoically reads the men his demands
Mr
Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes
(beat) Mr
Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming
(beat) Mr
Kaufman won't rehearse
(beat) Mr
Kaufman gets his own network Special
The execs are stupefied
Finally -- George delivers the clincher
(cont'd) And Taxi must guarantee two guest appearances to
Tony Clifton
Tony Clifton
#1 Who is he
(solemn) don't know
Long pause
The execs stare at George like he's lost his mind
(cont'd) But Andy says he's fabulous
(awkward) He also says, these are the terms
The execs' leader,  , shudders hopelessly
#2 Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else
George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No
Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns
(cont'd) George, we don't book phantom performers
The deal's off
/ - throws his attach case on the desk, then slumps into his chair
He picks up the phone and dials
Andy
(
) Hi George
Eh, hi, Andy
Look, this Tony Clifton
is he performing anywhere
(
) Of course
(beat) But only on Monday nights
That's alright
Where
' - Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise guys, and cigarette smoke
The Maitre'd guides George to a booth
small  fills the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room
The lights dim
speaks
(
) And now, Mama Roma's is proud to present International Singing Sensation
a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined
George is skeptical
(
) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr
Entertainment
The  starts a drum roll
Patrons hits the entrance area
and nobody enters
The spot is waiting
waiting
still waiting
until the drum roll slows down and stops
The announcer  again
(
) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect for Mr
Clifton's vocal demands, could everyone please extinguish your cigarettes and cigars
The crowd  angrily -- then irritably complies
One thrusts his cigar into a water glass
Goddamn,  paid five dollars for this
(
) And now
man who needs no introduction
The band starts playing lounge standard ""
And then, obnoxious   swaggers out
Tony has a rubbery face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly, and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping
Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a cigarette
He blows smoke rings at them
Heh-heh
How ya all doin'
The crowd is furious
Fuck you
People light back up and start talking
Tony ignores the ruckus
He starts , pinched and off-key
(singing) "Volare
Whoa, whoa
Cantare, Whoa whoa whoa whoa
" George winces
He's horrible
(cont'd) (singing) " got the wings of your love, got the wings of a dove
got the
uh
(forgetting the words) the chicken wings from Eh, Kentucky Fried
" The band is lost
(cont'd) Oh
Whoop do doo, Whoop de di, Stick a needle in your eye
The band gives up and stops
(cont'd) Eh, the hell with that song
One person
Most
(cont'd) So how ya doin'
(leering) How ya doin' over here
How ya doin' over there
(he approaches a ) How's that pasta carbonara
Leave me alone
Okay
(he spins around) So, you havin' a good time, sir
Tony approaches a    sitting at the bar
Tony thrusts his mike at the guy
Sure
What's your name
Bob
(he reacts as if this is enormously funny) "Bob"
Bob bob bob
(beat) Bob what
Bob Gorsky
"Gorsky"
What is that, Polish
(meek) Yes
Tony gets indignant
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor
Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant
(timid) It's my name
hate them Polish jokes
People are embarrassed
(cont'd) do a clean show
Like,  wouldn't do that one
oh, you know it
"What do you call a pretty girl in Poland"
(he giggles stupidly) -- a tourist
See, that's  what 'm talkin' about
(enraged) Here
' give you a little humor
Tony snatches Bob's water glass and   over his head
George is appalled
The crowd is aghast
Bob is wet
People
Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the building
(cont'd) And stay out, Fatso
The room erupts, outraged
George covers his face, looking ill
Suddenly, Tony snaps at him
And
wanna see you backstage
George is rattled
',  - The kitchen staff is working
George wanders around
then finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the employees' table
Aggravated, George aggressively steps up
Alright, 'm here
What do you want
Tony puts down his fork
He pauses
slowly turns around
and is Andy
George
His eyes bulge
Andy smiles innocently
He gestures to an empty seat
Are you hungry
George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a heart attack
His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a chair and sits
George glances down
Lying alongside the food is Tony's rubber face
- don't understand this act
(in jolly spirits) It's good old-fashioned entertainment
Everyone loves a villain
Yeah
Well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated
Beat -- then Bob strolls over
His real name is
Hey Andy, good show
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda
Bob and  have been buddies for years
George gapes
On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof, and conniving
He and Andy grin naughtily at each other
That was a really hot house
So your name's not Gorsky
Don't believe everything you hear
George thinks about this -- then laughs
: -  - Maynard and the  suits sit at the table, mesmerized
George is confidentially whispering to them
This has to stay in the room
but here's the thing: Andy is Tony
And Tony is Andy
They'll deny it up and down, but  swear to God, they're the same person
(with urgency) It's smart business
You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one
Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically
beat, and then he cracks a smile
- 1 a
m
in the supermarket
Just a few people linger
including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame
Andy stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians
Andy is oblivious to all around him
In the b
g
, George suddenly enters
He looks around the market, then spots Andy
He feverishly runs up
Andy
(still playing the game) What's up
George grins crazily, ecstatically
Andy
They agreed to it all
They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you
(beat) You're getting
Whoa
Andy looks up, astonished
His space station , but he doesn't notice
He turns to George
and slowly smiles sweetly
Genuinely
Well thank you very much
: - The first week of "
"  The  rehearses on the Taxi set
watch from the bleachers
(The actual  scene will be determined
)   , , and   read their lines
Then
a bored  - reads Latka's line
The cast glances around
Tony Danza loses his temper
Man, this is bullshit
(he marches up to the ) Where's Kaufman
Why isn't he here
One producer stands
This is tightly-wound
You'll see him on Friday when we shoot
Now run the lines with Rodney
An angry beat
The actors resume
- The  is filtering in
They fill the studio bleachers
,  - Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms
'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in
No,  hear Andy arrived
Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room
Judd is surprised
, '   - Andy is meditating
He's tranquil, at total inner peace
Silence -- until a little clock radio
Andy snaps his eyes open
He exhales a few calm breaths, then sits upright
Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips it open, and removes a
Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader
- Bleachers are full
They're now filming  (the same scene as earlier)
On cue, Andy enters as  -- wide- eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls
Andy is hilarious
The crowd  with laughter
- In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments
He's beloved
The applause grows louder, louder,
,  - curtain calls
The whole cast takes bows, then runs offstage
Everyone is grinning -- except Andy
He soberly strolls up to Zmuda
'm gonna quit
What
Each show is worse than the next
Are you nuts
40 million people watch you every week
So
What do they know
Absolutely nothing
That's the beauty
(he lowers his voice) It's credibility
You make them love you
and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads
Hmm
Andy raises an eyebrow
: '  -  - The power office of Maynard Smith, the powerful  exec
He shouts into a phone
don't care
Travolta signed a contract, he's a Sweathog for life
Oh yeah
Just try to sue us
He  up
His  peeks her head in
Sir, they're having a problem down on the Kaufman Special
They say he's not following the
technical requirements
Maynard is baffled
"Technical"
" " ,   - Andy is in a booth, arguing with a
Zmuda watches and eats a banana
It's my show
Now make it roll
Maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as he walks around Little Wendy meditating in front of a ring of candles
Andy,  hear fabulous things about the Special
(a delicate pause) Eh,  understand we've hit a teeny speedbump
(harried) Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold
He wants the picture to roll
Maynard doesn't exactly understand
Show me
The technician pushes a button
- Andy's image briefly appears
(-) And now
in her television debut, the incredible Chubby Rosalie
At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the screen, until it disappears into a blur of static
(happy) It'll be great
The viewer will think their  is broken
They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the , but they won't be able to fix it
Maynard stares at the monitor
The totally indecipherable picture still rolls
glum pause
Andy
we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair
They might change the channel
But it's funny
It's a practical joke
They'll get frustrated
Andy beams giddily
Maynard gazes dully, struggling to reason
Andy
uhh
this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program
But it's only for thirty seconds
Beat
Five
Twenty
Ten
Deal
Both men quickly extend their hands and shake
Maynard nods and leaves
Beat
Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his palm
walks over
He has a huge
Mr
Kaufman, do you want your mail
Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas
'  - Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the Maharishi
Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with He happily chats on the phone
Yes, it's Andy Kaufman
Really
got your fan letter
So you like the show
Your letter said  was silly
Did you think was too silly
Oh good
'm glad
Andy holds a letter which has a '  stapled to it
He is very nervous
(cont'd) It was real nice of you to send your picture, Mimi
'Cause you knew what  looked like
and now, know what you look like
Andy flips the letter over
He glances at the return address
(cont'd) So, um
San Bernardino
(beat) That's just a couple hours away, isn't it
,  - The sun is setting
In an ugly shopping district, Andy walks along with sexy, wholesome
so after  finish junior college, 'll go to work for my dad's accounting firm
Unless, decide to live with my friend Valerie, but she wants to move to Anaheim, and  don't want to do that
disinterested beat
Oh
Another beat
(cont'd) So do you wanna wrestle
Excuse me --
Do you wanna wrestle
It's a good way of breaking the ice
(pause) That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together
Mimi is bewildered, and offended
What are you talking about
We just met an hour ago
(calm) No no no, it's not sex
mean -- it can lead to sex
but really, it's just wrestling
don't wanna talk about it
An awkward silence
They continue walking
She points up
(cont'd) The sunset is really beautiful
What do you mean
(a bit offput) mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant
love this time of day
(he shrugs dully) 've never understood that
It's just
getting dark
(pause) But  like you
Hey
Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and
- Fear
She shivers, then hoarsely speaks
think  wanna go home
: -  - George screens Andy's  Special for Maynard and his team
The network execs look constipated
- Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody
( ) You know
was once in your gallery
was just sitting there and  wanted to touch you
was kind of depressed because  could see what everyone was like, and was wondering if, now, maybe could
touch you
Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping
-- are horrified
( ) (cont'd) Howdy, 've been watching you ever since  was a little boy
(choked up, nervous) You're the first friend from television ever had
always wanted to meet you
and now
finally am
#2 This is  funny
#3 (ominous) "Artsy Fartsy shit"
(worried at this response) No
eh, the Special isn't all like this
just wait
it will be hysterical
At that moment, the picture turns to
Maynard scowls
Christ
We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs
Maynard angrily jumps and  on the
,
George winces -- then mutters awkwardly
No, um
it's part of the snow
An awful beat
Maynard is embarrassed
Finally -- he explodes
Tell Kaufman we will  air this program
'  - delicatessen
Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables
He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food
Two gesture from a booth
1 Excuse me, could  please have more coffee
Yeah, yeah, in a sec'
(he lugs the dishes to the kitchen) That was decaf, right
The guy nods
Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring
1 You know, you look just like Andy Kaufman
Yeah,  get that all the time
Andy hurries off
The guy's buddy leans in, whispering
2 'm telling you, it's him
1 You wanna bet
If that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee
Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds
He is sweating
In the b
g
, George enters the restaurant
He sees Andy, sits at a table and
Hey
Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake
Andy turns
They stare down each other
(cont'd) Andy, this is ridiculous
Take off that apron
(infuriated) 'd rather work here, than at There's no lying in a restaurant
They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook
Andy hurries off with a water pitcher
George chases him
Look, 'm sorry
They're assholes
But we work in a creative business
You can't predict what people are gonna like -- The  reason  did Taxi was so could have my own Special
(trying to calm him) Tell you what
'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around
see if somebody wants to buy it -- (bitter) Yeah, we can have a garage sale
"Hey look,  got a floor lamp and a network  Special for only fifty cents
" glum moment
Andy fills water glasses
(cont'd) How long is left on my Taxi contract
You signed for five years -- (awkward) So four years, seven months
(he looks up) Okay
'll go back
But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka
They're gettin' Tony
: &   - marquee says " &  -  " Inside, a  of  surges
- Andy is walking onstage
The excited  swells
He's a gigantic presence to these people
Andy smiles and bows
Thank you
It's great to be here
We're going to have a very nice time
We'll sing some songs -- Andy reacts, perturbed
He struggles to stay composed
Uh, we'll play with puppets -- Andy scowls
Then -- he loses it
Excuse me one moment
Andy angrily hurries offstage
,  - Zmuda is with the congas and props
Andy runs up
Give me the book
(startled) No
Andy, don't do it -- They're asking for it
Andy fiercely  a small book from Zmuda
Zmuda cringes
- Andy strides back out
He gazes at the crowd
Since you're such a special audience
'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me

And though  dabble in clowning, do find it so boorish
So
American
(beat) prefer the fine arts
Henceforth, tonight,  'd like to grace you with a reading of the greatest novel ever written
(he holds up the book) "The Great Gatsby", by
Scott Fitzgerald
Heh
The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad confused murmur
() (he cracks open the book) Chapter One
(he starts ) "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that 've been turning over in my mind ever since
'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages you've had
'" There's a little
Is he really gonna read this
() (cont'd) "He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and  understood that he meant a great deal more than that
" Suddenly, somebody from the audience screams: The audience  approvingly
Andy stops reading and looks at the student
He smiles
( ) Tank you veddy much
The audience  enthusiastically
Andy waits until the applause dies and goes back to the book
() "When  came back from the East last autumn,  felt that  wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;  wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart
" People start
Andy looks up
() (cont'd) Please, let's keep it down
We have a long way to go
(he resumes reading) "Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction - Gatsby, who represented everything for which have an unaffected scorn
" The crowd is incredulous
- () Chapter Two
The crowd is horribly bored
,  - The clock says 11:30
The  glares at Zmuda
Is he ever going to stop
(dour) Sure
When he reaches "The End
" - People are streaming out
Maybe fifty are left
Andy realizes this -- but is committed
He must continue
() "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party
Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness
" weak  feebly shouts: Do Latka
Andy looks up, shocked
Insulted, he "blows his temper
" () Look
don't have to tolerate this impoliteness
Forget it -- 'm gonna stop the show
He slams the book shut
People
Andy starts to storm off -- then turns
() (cont'd) No, no, 'm only fooling
The audience
() (cont'd) 'll tell you what
Would you rather have me continue reading or would you like to hear the phonograph record
The audience  for the record
Andy smiles, puts the needle on and to everyone's horror more "Gatsby" comes out
(-  ) "His presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer
" : - There are six people left in the audience
Andy reads on
() "Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther
And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
" Andy somberly shuts the book
() (cont'd) The End
moment of quiet personal euphoria
Andy looks enraptured, the man who has just climbed Everest
pause -- but no applause
It's dead silence
Andy looks out
and realizes the few audience members are asleep
Andy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage
In the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair
- Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily
They drag the suitcase containing the props
They walk slowly towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted
Nobody likes anarchy more than me
but this is science fiction
Andy nods uncomprehendingly
Let's get some breakfast
: / - George is yelling at Andy and Zmuda
They are seated on his couch, heads bowed in shame
What kind of show was this
(angrily reading off a ) There were three-hundred walkouts
The promoter wants a refund
Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper
'm sorry, George
You're   you're sorry
(turning on Zmuda) And you -- you're the road manager
You should be watchin' out for him
(a guilty sigh) We might have lost our focus
George paces furiously
When you play the Midwest and South, you '
It's not postmodern -- it's rude
(beat) If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse
You give 'em Elvis
But George,  like to push the boundaries
And that's great
But do it in and New York
There you experiment
Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage
don't care
Hmm
Andy thinks
How long would they let me sleep
don't know
(he composes himself and lowers his voice to a hush) Andy
you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain
The audience
or yourself
- He doesn't know the answer
: /,  - Andy is manically washing his hands
Using liquid soap from the dispenser, then rubbing his hands under the water
Then more liquid soap
More rubbing
Then more liquid soap
/ - George sighs at Zmuda
'm worried about Andy
His stress level is affecting his work
(he thinks) Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon
Maybe that'll chill him out
Bob, Andy needs to
See if you can get him away from all this
Take him to Hawaii, or Bali
Find something special
Something nice
Zmuda mulls this over
: ,  - tattered sign says "Welcome to the
"  The world-famous whorehouse sits behind a barb-wire fence
Dusty connected trailers sit in the sand
idles out front
Zmuda and a scared Andy sit inside
dunno about this
(worried) What will my mother think
She'll say, "Now my son is a man
" It's so dirty
Nah
The girls sponge off between johns
Andy nods
Okay
- The reception room -- wood paneling and black-lite posters
Music is playing
Twenty deadpan  are lined up
Andy, nervous as a high school kid, points at one
then another
then the first
Which one
Beat -- then Andy becomes , with a monocle and stiff walk
() vill haf both
vill haf dat fraulein
unt
the vun vith the big strudels
The two chosen girls take Andy's hands and lead him off
He reaches the door -- then gives Zmuda a nervous look
Zmuda smiles reassuringly
Andy gulps, and goes in
Beat
Zmuda turns to the older, jaded
This is a big day
It's my friend's first time with a prostitute
(mocking) What're you talking about
Andy comes here almost every weekend
Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied
You're talking about
Andy
Oh, he doesn't always call himself that
Sometimes he's Tony, and wears a tux
Disbelief -- then Zmuda  sharply
He's been conned
,  - Andy and the two hookers are
They grapple and roll around, all three of them in their underwear
Suddenly Andy flips the girls over and pins them with his arms
Breathing hard, he stares down
You let me win
(she giggles sexily) What if we did
Andy grins and leans down
Hey
If  give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to  and help me destroy a  show
: ,   - The Taxi cast sits irritably around a big table, holding scripts
Ed Weinberger enters
Where is he
He just arrived
He's an hour late
Look, 'm told this Clifton guy is a little eccentric
You're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week
Suddenly -- the door  open
Tony bounds in, filthy drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag
Taxi
Laxy
Just the factsy, Maxie
Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi
Right, girls
Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts
Tony feels them up, and they
The cast stares in horror
(cont'd) Eh, why the blue faces
You musta read the script
(he chuckles) Well, don't worry
Your pal Tony stayed up all night, writin' some fixes on it
(he pulls out some ) added me a musical number, cut out Judd Hirsch, and changed the location to Mardi Gras
Ed's expression goes ashen
: - An attempted rehearsal
Tony is tap-dancing on top of a car hood
He does a "fancy" move, and his booze bottle suddenly flies away and  against the wall
The cast watches, pissed and bored
And now, the new theme song
(he starts ) "Oh yes, we drive a taxi, And we're havin' fun
Yeah, we work together, And we get the freakin' job done
" ,   - Beleaguered Ed sits with George
George, we've lost two days
Filming is on Friday
We  to let him go
(worried) 'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this
So we'll go downstairs and tell him
He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set
George shakes his head
But that's Tony down there
That's not Andy
Trust me, it's like "Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises
Ed glares
Well whoever the fuck that is, 'm firing him
(he sighs) Okay
But we'll have to warn Andy first
think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert
Heh
Ed raises his eyebrows
: ,   - George is on the phone
Ed hovers
( ) Hi, Diane, this is George
'm trying to reach Andy up in San Francisco
(a stilted pause) Yeah, 'll wait
Ed glances down at the stage
and suddenly Tony is no longer there
He's magically vanished
Beat
George turns on the , then
Andy's happy voice pops on the line
(
) Hi, George
Good to hear from you
Hi, Andy
How's the weather up there
(
) Oh, you know the Bay Area
Always foggy
Ed looks totally off-balance
George winks at him
'm here with Ed over at Taxi
There's been some trouble with Tony
(
) Oh no
Did he get hurt
No, no, Andy, nothing like that
(nervous beat) But
Tony's not fitting in
His style of performance is too
burlesque
: , '   - Tony is on the phone
Little Wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea
He looks up, insulted
( ) "Burlesque"
: ,   - Andy, 'm calling you up like this because  have the utmost respect for your artistry
But --  need your permission to fire him
(
) Oh dear
(upset) George, this is gonna kill Tony
He's waited his whole life for this break
There'll be other shots
Andy,  have to do it
He's a terrible actor
Andy thinks about this
(
) guess  understand
But Ed -- please
let him down gentle
Yes, Andy,  will
Andy hangs up
relieved Ed turns to George
(cont'd) Thank you
: - Tony  insanely
' '
Ed is stupefied
The cast stands nervously behind him
We had a deal
don't know what yer talkin' about
You musta talked to someone else -- Yeah
talked to Andy Kaufman
don't know nothin' about no Kaufman
He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation
Been usin' my good name, to get places
Ed is livid
He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning eyes piercing through the rubber features
Get off my stage
You're fired
'm gonna take you to the
Suddenly --
Ed looks over
has a camera
Who're
'm from the  Times
We're doing a little puff piece on Mr
Clifton
(beat) Mr
Kaufman arranged it
- George enters
He looks down at the growing debacle, and winces
Uh-oh
- Enraged, Ed blows up
Security
Escort this man off the lot
- Studio   run over
They  Tony
Stop
Tony scuffles
The camera
(cont'd) '
- George stares at this mess
and starts giggling
- Two guards drag Tony to the door
(cont'd) You'll be
One day 'm gonna this town
Tony  and gets removed
Dead silence
Then -- don't want those pictures getting out
(to the reporter) This is a closed set
You'll have to give me the film in that camera
The Guard reaches for the camera
An uncertain moment
until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere
'll take care of this
Zmuda takes the camera
He casually starts to make his way for the exit
when Ed suddenly
Wait -- he's one of
Zmuda gasps
Two guards go running for him
Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape
The guards chase
Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera into George's arms
The guards whip by, oblivious
George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties
He sweatily peers at the timebomb in his hands
And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket
He bolts for the door and feverishly scampers out
- George runs for his life
He knocks aside a rack of costumes and serpentines between people
At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming
Stop
You wouldn't do this to Wayne Newton -- The guards toss Tony out the gate
He lands in a heap
In the b
g
, George crazily flies by
He gets out the exit
,    - George doubles over, trying to catch his breath
He glances down
and Tony is lying next to him
Little Wendy and Zmuda run up, out of breath
They all look at each other
There's a moment of understanding
Hey
Good hustlin'
George slowly smiles
- Ed storms in, insanely angry
That asshole
That (he  the door behind him) We had a fuckin' deal, and Ed is seething
His  timidly speaks
Um, Ed
you have a phone call -- '
Well, um
it's Andy Kaufman
Heh
Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone
then slowly picks it up
Yeah
long pause
then Andy's voice calmly speaks
(
) You were brilliant
flabbergasted beat
Huh
(
) You were in the moment
You became a producer losing his mind
(sincerely joyful) It was the best improv 've ever seen
- He thinks intently about this
And then
amazingly, a magnificent smiles comes over his face
Well -- thank you
Pause
(
) Okay
See you next week
Andy hangs up
Ed just sits there, astounded
: - Andy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a booth, laughing and celebrating
They eagerly read the Times
- The headline says "
"  Below is a  of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set
They all
This is great
It makes Tony  - - three-dimensional
It's very good for his career
Zmuda reads one paragraph
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman
And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy
" (he chortles) Boy, they totally fell for it
'm only acting crazy
Hmm
few awkward glances
Then -- Andy grins at his meal
(cont'd) Boy, this is tasty
(he shouts to a ) Hey, can  please have some more seaweed
: '  - slick , sitting in a crowded office full of head shots
He's on the phone
He's reading the  Times story
Mr
Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe
We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom
: / - George on the phone
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos
The audiences don't work well for him
(
) Oh
Disappointed beat
The booker thinks
(
) (cont'd) What about Tony Clifton
(startled) Really
You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe
(
) (being tricky) Eh, sure
We're trying to expand our audience base -- and  know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman
George winces
Look --  gotta be clear with you
Tony Clifton is  Andy Kaufman
(
) Yeah, yeah, yeah
know
(he  merrily) Wink wink
Nudge nudge
(frustrated) No, 'm serious
If you book Tony, do
(
) ( harder) 'll take my chances
George rolls his eyes in annoyance
Finally, he shrugs
Fine, be my guest
Book him
: - George is driving in his convertible
Suddenly, something catches his eye -- and in shock he  the brakes
Three cars behind him  crazily, trying not to hit each other
George is oblivious
He's staring up at a
The : It says "'  , & " George is flabbergasted
,  - George is shouting into a payphone
Gene, you misunderstood
You're not getting  of them
(upset) It's physically impossible
(
) Why's that
You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman -- Yeah,   what  said
But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen
(
) Sure it is
Tony called me himself
He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's
They're both going on tonight, believe me
George is stupefied
He looks at his watch
: - Magnificent ' dominates the skyline
The marquee blares "
"  George screeches up in a rental car
He jumps out and runs inside
'  - The showroom is packed
It hums with curiosity clean off the dinner tables
George rushes in and is seated in a far booth, with some
He overhears a heated conversation between a   and his
You're not listenin'
It's a simple concept
You're making no sense
How can they be the same person --
Trust me
You'll never see them on stage at the same time
The onstage  hits a fanfare
Sharp meet at the foot of the stage
Suddenly -- Tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph
Thunderous
Tony beams
The music stops
George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of this
Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits
The   slowly drops -- but not entirely
Tony waits, and waits, and waits
until suddenly he turns towards the audience and Everybody looks up, alarmed
The general murmur almost dies
Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people
As they quiet down
Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms
The  lift their instruments
Silence is total -- except for the clank of china
Waiters are serving coffee
Tony spins back around, livid
(cont'd) , , People signal "shh"
The waiters realize Tony's addressing them, and they stare back in disbelief
This is their job
(cont'd) Yeah
Yeah
'm talkin' to And you better freeze, or 'll get your asses fired
Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze
The waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror
Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms
Again, the musicians lift their instruments
In anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about
Audience members start whispering
Tony hears this -- and drops his arms and head in despair
The musicians lower their instruments
Tony waits for absolute silence
Only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again
They do
And then at that precise moment -- somebody  a spoon
Tony jolts, as if hit by a current
He drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look
Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits
And waits
And waits
The man at George's table  to his wife
He's never gonna start
Kaufman thinks this is funny
(beat) We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start
George grins stupidly
The silence is now deafening
Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms
Slowly
the musicians get their instruments ready
Tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something
anything
to disturb the silence
In vain
Somebody
The whole scene repeats itself
Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence
Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable), he begins to move
Tony pivots around, looks at the audience
And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum
Tony starts  hysterically
The audience's reaction is mixed: Some people
Some
Some ask perplexed questions
Some
Some even
Tony is very happy
He turns to the orchestra, raises his baton -- and commences the downbeat
The
hits the wings
and then
George's jaw drops
You see
told you
They're not the same person
The whole audience
Life is back to normal
Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a prepared row of congas
He starts to play
Tony Clifton grabs the microphone
Thank you
Thank you
wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra
He had a nice little success with it
but forgot to thank me on the album
He starts to  " Gotta Be Me"
George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is
(cont'd) "Whether 'm right Or whether 'm wrong Whether  find a place in this world Or never belong
gotta be me
gotta be me
What else can  be, but what  am
" Tony's singing is awful
Andy happily accompanies on congas
The audience doesn't know what to think
Tony's  reaches the end
aggressive and off-key
(cont'd) Let's bring it on home -- (he hits his screeching ) "
" The  ends with a brassy punch
The crowd responds with : ',  - George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms
He turns and finds a door marked ""
Next to it is a door marked ""
George stares
He thinks, then opens the "" door
Andy is inside alone, gathering his things
He's pleasantly surprised to see George
George doesn't enter
He goes to the "" door
Andy follows
George opens the mystery door
', '   - and inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda
George starts hyperventilating
Shaking, he tries to sit himself down
Andy enters, beaming
George is amazed
You're so proud
You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad,  got an
" But wasn't it funny
"Funny"
dunno
But "intriguing"
"mindboggling"
perhaps "headache-inducing"
sure
(softening) Like, that moment, when you both came onstage
Andy excitedly jumps up and down
Uh-huh
See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders
They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman
"  But that spoils it
So , Tony denying being me is the truth
Tony's not me
But maybe he is
The audience will never know
(giddy) They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually 'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and 'm right
George is dazed
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe
(dry) You
and you
Sure
But  think it's kickass
Now  get to be Tony
get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head
(he turns serious) But what's the
How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world
Hmm
Andy contemplates this
George
'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them
But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire,  don't know what else to do
(thoughtful) 'Cause 've always got to be one step ahead of them
But  feel you're extending this philosophy to real life
It's obsessive
Nothing's ever on the level anymore
perplexed beat
George, it never was
(pause) Didn't you know that
: '  - Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder, on the cover of a magazine
Magazines are everywhere
Body- building
Women's
Wrestling
is sifting through them
Zmuda watches, worried
Look at this
An evil Russian
Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty
Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy
What is this, World War Two
You know,  always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler
No offense, pal, but  just don't think you're built for it
These he- men'll kick your ass
They're huge
Andy's face drops
He realizes Zmuda's right
Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiance on the cover
He slowly lifts it up, intrigued
Maybe 'll pick on someone smaller than me
- on Andy and Merv Griffin
Andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear
He is shouting like a wrestler
And  vow to continue wrestling until  am  , in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat
(nonplussed) By a woman
Yes
(emphatic) 'm doing this because  feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling
Even if they train with weights
it requires a certain mental ability -- (a clumsy pause) And, uh --  just don't feel they have that
The audience  uncomfortably
Andy laughs and backpedals
(cont'd) No no
Women are superior in many ways
When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men
believe that
An appalled silence
Merv winces
Some people start
We can tell Andy is pleased
(cont'd) But when it comes to wrestling, forget it
If there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here
'll shut my mouth and pay her 500 dollars
Merv baitingly turns to the crowd
Any
volunteers
All the ' hands angrily shoot up
We move through the crowd, finally picking out
a feisty woman,
She mutters, half hateful, half laughing -- wanna kill that jerk
: - Andy and Lynne stand in the ring
She scornfully watches him preen about
Zmuda is in a referee's uniform
( ) Will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling
Lynne extends her hand
Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely refuses and struts away
The crowd
It's the bell
The match begins
Lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience
Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over
She's down
Andy has trained for this
Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official
Lynne struggles and slithers away
She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down
People
His torso hits the mat
But suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair
Her head snaps back
The crowd is
Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning
Andy nods, and they separate
They do a little dance around the ring, Lynne looking for a hole
Suddenly, Andy spins her into a Half-Nelson
Her arms are pinned
They struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach
One
Two
Three
And
It's
Andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd
'm the winner
've got the (he points at his head) Now baby, don't fight nature
Get back in the kitchen where you belong
Lynne glares
Out of the blue, and old starts playing
chicken  to the music, and Andy lip- syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the ring
,  - Lynne is escorted by a
Lynne is dazed
The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap
Here's your complimentary photo with Merv
Here's your Turtle Wax -- don't need Turtle Wax
Every guest of Merv gets it
And here's your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster
Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off
She passes Andy, who sees her and grins
Gosh, you scored
Look at all those goodies
Buzz off
Go patronize somebody else
Lynne coldly hurries away
Andy chases after her
Hey,  hope you didn't take that stuff  said seriously
It was just part of the show
(eager to impress) It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd
Oh
So you were just pretending to be an asshole
Andy nods, pleased
It's what 'm good at
Lynne stares -- then begrudgingly cracks a smile
: '  - Jumbo-sized   work out, sweating and groaning
In a corner, Andy lifts huge barbells
George stares, pained
Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail
Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't  hate mail
That means it was a success
woke up the audience -- like punk rock
(he hands him a ) Here, take this
No, 'm not gonna take it
If take it 'll break my back
He crosses his arms
Andy frowns and lowers the weight
(cont'd) Buddyboy, they detest you
Next time you make an appearance, women are gonna picket
They're having a laugh
You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody
That's because they've only seen it once
But 'll do it again, and again, and
(a maniacal grin) They'll catch on
: : 1 - Andy throws a   to the ground
2 - Andy squeezes a   in a headlock
3 to  20 - Andy throws an   from the ring
He then proudly waves a phony plastic belt over his head

The crowd  in disgust

Two tickets jump out of the machine

Andy smiles
(cont'd) 'mon
We'll go for a walk

She throws down her ticket and runs after him

Why did you call me
The last person  ever expected to get a call from was you

You were impressed with something
It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television
Andy is shocked
Oh
Uh,  hope  didn't offend you

charged moment
Andy's eyes widen
His speech gets faster
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married
(incredulous) Do  wanna go to Memphis and get married
Yes
Beat
Why Memphis
(he ) Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world
'll go in the ring, and 'll announce that will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me
Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and 'll let you win
Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson
right there on the show
What do you say
Whoa
Lynne stares into his eyes
And all this will be for real
(a soft smile) If you want
: - ,  - The arena is filled with furious Ladies in hair nets
Men clutching beer cans
This is a rougher crowd than we've seen before
Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe
He's screaming at them
(screaming) (more ) Show some respect
want when  speak
People  louder and throw debris
Andy is pleased
(cont'd) If any woman can defeat me,  will pay her 1000 dollars
Then 'll shave my head bald
And then as a bonus -- that lucky lady will get to marry me
Screeching  and
Down front
Lynne jumps up
Look here, Andy Kaufman
'll take you on --
The mob  harshly
Ooo, the little lady's upset
Well say -- get back in the kitchen
("outraged") No
get in the kitchen
'm gonna make you dry my dishes
The crowd
Lynne grins and starts to climb in the ring
Andy's eyes are ablaze
But suddenly -- an oversized Southern  jumps in and snatches the mike away
This woman's a
She's nothing but Kaufman's girlfriend
Andy and Lynne are startled
-that's not true -- It's a set-up
And  won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix
The crowd angrily starts to
Lynne whispers to Andy
Andy
who is that
'm Jerry Lawler, the  of Memphis wrestling
(this gets ) So if Kaufman wants to tangle, 've brought a real wrestler
She's trained and she's
Kaufman, do you think you can handle At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands --
The coliseum  with excitement
People  their seats
The roar is deafening
Lawler gleams cockily
Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned
: -  - The bell rings
Foxy comes out, ready to brawl
But Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock
He nonchalantly peels off his robe
Foxy dances around impatiently
Andy casually removes a towel from his neck
People
Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch
People  so furiously they're red-faced
Andy is tormenting them
jumps up
Are you scared
Andy sneers
He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over
and commences a
Absurdly, he spins his arms around and around, daring Foxy to get near him
She rolls her eyes and waits
The  jumps out of the way
minute has counted down
Finally, Andy stops -- and the real wrestling begins
Foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke-hold
The crowd , relieved
Lawler motions signals
Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away
Andy is intrigued
She's coming to play
Andy gestures to the Ref and points
The Ref looks away -- and Andy Foxy
The crowd furiously
The Ref spins around, and Andy shrugs innocence
He then runs at Foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes
She bounces off, stumbles back - - and Andy drops to his knees
She trips over him and hits the mat
Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her
The Ref counts:  One
Two
Three
It's over
But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely
Jerry Lawler yells from the corner
Alright, you won
Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken
grows
Louder
More emotional
Jerry, help her
Get in there
Do something
Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts Andy off
Lawler angrily  Andy down
Andy is flabbergasted
-what are you
don't fight men
Lawler snickers and walks away
Completely overreacting, Andy grabs the mike
(cont'd) 'm gonna
(he starts berserkly) Let me tell you something, Lawler
am not a hick -- 'm a national star
And  ' like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring
never agreed to wrestle you
So you know what 'm gonna do
(seething) 'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent you've got
This was assault and battery
In a court of law, 'm gonna kick your Southern- fried rump
Lawler snatches the mike and bellows
Well  got news for you, Andy Kaufman
Wrestling is a serious sport to me
don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and  hate anyone insultin' the South
So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court
or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for Andy watches, fuming
He is
He -- can't get away with this
(to Lawler) You think 'm
Andy grabs back the mike
He sticks his face in shocked Lawler's
(cont'd) (sarcastic ) You wanna "wraaastle" me
You wanna "" me
Okay, Lawler -- let's rumble
Yeah, 've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you
In fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee
" (back to his regular voice, he points at his head) 'm from Hollywood
have the brains
That's how  win
And Mr
Lawler, 'm gonna make you cry "Mama
" Andy bears his teeth
Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing at him
run in and separate the angry men
- ,  - We hear  from the main event above
Andy and Lynne hurry along
She is disgruntled
He swaggers arrogantly, still in his fighting outfit
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble
(he jokingly impersonates a drunk) can shtop whenever  want
She's unamused
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop
(he drops the act) -'m sorry
got caught up in the action
She shoots him a stern look
'm warning you, Kaufman:  One morning you're gonna wake up
and your head's gonna be shaved
Andy laughs
: / - George stares glumly at Andy
Andy is quite cheerful -- eating a big piece of chocolate cake
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore
Where's that sweet guy who used to do (he  Mighty Mouse) "Here  come to save the day
"
(long beat) Please, enough with the wrestling
You've lost touch with reality
(ingenuous) What, you don't think  can beat him
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion
He'll kill you
(very disapproving) First, you piss-off women
Then you piss-off the South
Then you get killed
(dry) And  did the bookings
Andy shrugs, lacking a response
He eats more cake
(cont'd) Andy, look
there's a job  want you to take -- guest-hosting the show "Fridays
"  It's not so hot
but this is a great opportunity for you
The show's live, they'll give you carte blanche, and you can get back to the business of making people laugh
Andy gets a strange gleam
He only heard one thing
You said -- live

In a corner,  is arguing with director
'm not comfortable with the last sketch
' do drug humor
Andy, it'll be fine
It's what we're known for

And  don't enjoy making light of them

Andy storms off

The crowd  rowdily

He whispers
Afterwards, 'll take you backstage

The girl smiles excitedly
The  is on a French restaurant set
sits at a table with actor  and actress
Another actress, , tiptoes back over,  stupidly, playing stoned
"Gee, restaurants are amazing, aren't they
All these strangers sitting around
stuffing dead animals in their faces
It's just incredible
" She  more
The other three play baffled
"If you say so
" "Excuse me, 'll be right back

He said he's coming back
: - Actors read the menus
Suddenly Andy returns, a strange grin on his face
He's swaying on his feet
The audience :  "Yeah

He has a strange hesitancy
"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--" Suddenly he
The actors glance up
Andy purses his lips, fretting
An endless pause
Uh-oh
Andy won't finish the line
The cast looks around worriedly
Live  is beaming out
Finally, Melanie covers
You okay, honey
Something wrong, Carl

Andy shakes his head
The crowd laughs nervously

,   - The   and his crew are bewildered
They flip through script pages
Shit
What's he doing
But Maynard raises a calm hand
It's okay
Stay with it
- Silence
Andy is torn up inside
(whispering to Andy) Just read the cue cards
(he shakes his head) can't play stoned
feel really stupid
More silence
The actors are trapped and upset
You feel stupid
What about us
The tension is awful
Unsure beat -- then fed-up Richards jumps up and storms off the set
hesitantly pans, confused what to do
Mary is lost
She continues giggling, "stoned
" Richards returns
with the
Irked, he dumps them over Andy's head

They laugh and joyously kid each other
In the audience, Michael is
Oh my God --
All the commotion stops
The audience doesn't know whether to laugh or boo
The actors are flabbergasted -- then furious

Suddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming
People watch curiously
Andy seems discombobulated
Maynard shouts out to assembled
Excuse me

The audience  and  wildly
The actors stare in disbelief

(shaken) But
won't
Because what you saw was
,   - Maynard looks like he's gonna faint
Cue the commercial
( ) These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials

And

Andy prances into the ring
He takes the mike
Before we begin this event,  just wanna say a few things to you foul people

He's just engaging a passive audience
Andy reaches in his pocket and removes
a bar of
People, this is a bar of soap
Does it look familiar to you
If you wet it, it'll clean your hands
Stanley's eyes bulge
The crowd is enraged -- rumblings of imminent violence
Andy smiles helpfully

That's the bell
Andy strikes a threatening pose
Lawler takes a step forward -- and Andy instantly, cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring
Andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain: 'm smarter
(
) And Kaufman's left the ring
Lawler's waiting for him to return
(to Zmuda) Is this a strategy
Lawler disparagingly frowns
The  checks his watch
Andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his rival
then slowly climbs in -- Until the second Lawler moves
Then Andy leaps back out
(
) And Kaufman's left the ring again
He doesn't seem interested in actually making contact with his opponent
Andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain
He smirks at various spectators
until he finds himself face- to-face with -- his parents
An unexpected moment
Andy's finger frozen on his brain
Janice shakes her head despairingly
Andy, please
Let's go home
Cameras
The paparazzi love these moments
Don't worry, Mom

Beat -- then Andy gets  in the head with a cup
People
Disoriented, Andy returns to the ringside
Lawler is losing his patience
Hey
Did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass
Andy paces around, unsure of his next move
(cont'd) Look
if you get in here, 'll give you a free headlock
Lawler leans down and offers his neck
Andy peers skeptically
People
Andy looks at waiting Lawler
then tentatively climbs in
As promised, Lawler doesn't move
So Andy crosses over and grabs Lawler's head
Andy grins triumphantly
He squeezes his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment
Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over
Andy on his back
(
) It's a side suplex
Andy lies on the mat, unmoving

(beat) It didn't hurt at all
It was just a yoga move
tucked my head in
Deadpan, Andy sits up
Total silence
Stanley stares
then a  comes over him
Andrew --
For all we knew, you were
Look at your mother -- she's still shaking
But that's it
needed you to believe
Our family will be in the newspapers
People will look, and they'll be touched
Because your emotions were honest
Stanley has a blank expression
But Janice starts to cry
Andy,  love you
love you, whatever you do
She hugs Andy tightly
Andy is genuinely shocked
He looks at his quivering mother
and then his voice softens, truly remorseful
Geez, 'm sorry
Maybe  shouldn't have put you through all that
(quiet) Well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: Anything that happens to me
-  - crowd of reporters parts
They make way for Andy, who is carried out on the stretcher and loaded into a waiting He is "unconscious
" Cameras  and
The ambulance speeds away, siren '  - Andy sits watching an   examining a number of x- rays clipped to light panels
don't see any injury to your neck, Mr
Kaufman
Are you sure
Positive
But my neck hurts
and  have a slight cough
It's probably just a strained muscle
(intent) Doctor,  think  need a neck brace
The Doctor gives up
If it makes you happy
: Andy in the ring, Andy outside the ring, on the floor, with his frightened parents, in a neck brace, on the stretcher, etc
'  - George, Zmuda and Andy are looking through hundreds of clippings from the newspapers
(reading aloud) "
has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis
His parents are at his bedside
Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"
It's a rave
Boy, if  ever fake my death, they'll really miss me
It's working for Elvis
(sarcastic) Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback
(he sees an article and winces) God, listen to this
"It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual
" Wow, you can't  this kind of publicity
George rolls his eyes
George, let's not drop the ball on this
've made some kind of cosmic career move
Somebody  outside
Andy jumps up, puts on his neck brace, and transforms himself into a shuffling invalid drags in an enormous basket of flowers and goodies
Andy takes the card
It reads "Andy, we're all praying for you
Your friends at Taxi
" Andy chuckles
- George is eating with the Saturday Night Live Producer, Lorne Michaels
They're eating lunch in an outdoor cafe
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice
(he takes a careful beat) wanted to talk to you about booking Andy on "Saturday Night Live
" Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably
He chooses his words
George --  don't know if Andy works for our show anymore
That wrestling stuff
is such a turnoff
We agree completely
(tactfully begging) Andy has to reconnect with his core audience
So  got him on Letterman tonight
He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans
Lorne Michaels mulls this over
That's smart
He's very sincere
(quietly emphatic) And he needs your show
Beat
Lorne Michaels nods
Okay
It'd be good to have the old Andy back
: - Andy and Jerry Lawler are on  ' show
Andy is pallid, hair shaggy, in a neckbrace and tweed jacket
Husky Lawler wears loud red pants and gold chains
Andy speaks timidly, seeming a bit dazed and regretful
apologize for all the wrestling 've ever done
'm sorry for all the abuse 've ever given
(soft) was just playing bad guy wrestler
That's not me
it's just a role
But Jerry took it personally
Lawler and Letterman are unimpressed
You said some pretty inflammatory things
He thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not
(to Andy) Did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital
The crowd
Angst flickers on Andy's sweaty face
He stammers
-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- You're a wimp
(upset) My father said  should've gotten a lawyer --
Then your father's a wimp
(losing it) And you're just poor white trash
Lawler's had enough
Enraged, he wildly stands and Andy
Andy crashes over and falls from his chair
He's on the floor
Dead silence
Everyone is astonished
They're all slack-jawed
Even
Trying to cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a
Andy jumps up, crazed

Lawler freezes in his seat
Letterman hides behind his desk
Andy storms over, out-of-control

An unsure moment
Dave glances at Lawler
Until, Andy stumbles back in
He tries to calm himself
(cont'd) am sorry
am sorry to use those words on television
apologize
'm sorry
(demented) But  -- you're a Andy slams Dave's desk
Dave jerks nervously
Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup
Uh-oh
Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and  it on Lawler
Lawler jumps, burned
runs in
Andy screams and hurtles away
He slams open the stage door and barrels out of sight
: '  - Lorne Michaels is watching this at home
He gapes in disbelief
Jesus Christ
: - stands on stage, speaking into camera
The show's going out live
Hi
Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea
(beat) Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman's a comic genius
But others disagree
they say he's just not funny anymore
(beat) So we're putting the decision up to you
Please call up and vote
To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618
To him, call
/ - Tight on Andy, staring at the  Times
small headline says "     '  '" He is bothered
This is bad
only got 28 percent
'm like McGovern in '72
George sighs
And this wasn't "Merv
"  This was the hippest audience on television
(grim) They've turned on you
At that
we reveal that   is sitting next to Andy
But only the back of his head is visible
(cont'd) It's like you two guys wanted to destroy Andy's career
Upsetting all those people
putting out that toxic venom
(helpless) What did you  would happen
(guilty) We were just trying to push the envelope -- You're
There is no envelope anymore
(beat) It hurts me to say this
but there's only one solution -- (pained) don't want you two to ever work together again
We
And the other person is
He feels bad
'm sorry
We thought it was funny
Jer', it's not your fault
You were terrific
(sad) But maybe George is right
That's fine
But  wouldn't have traded it for anything
(poignant) Because for one brief, shining moment
the world thought that wrestling was real
Andy gulps emotionally
We'll stay in touch
Next time 'm in Memphis, 'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake
Alright, buddy
(choked up) Stay good
Andy and Jerry hug
touching beat
until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam
Maybe  can turn it into a bit can go back on the show, and say it was rigged
Demand a recount
Andy
You don't get it
(somber) They don't want you back
Andy's face drops
,  - The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought few    mill around
,  - , sitting in the Lotus position, are listening to a teacher
The teacher is Andy
Open your eyes
close your eyes
open your eyes
close your eyes
open your eyes
close your eyes
Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are blinking their eyes faster and faster
The door opens
The Yogi sticks his head in
Excuse me, Andy
Yes, your Holiness
The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room
,  - Andy steps out
This is very difficult for me to say
but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat
(surprised) Why
attend every year
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to
But we feel that perhaps
you and the program have grown apart philosophically
Andy is stunned
"Philosophically"
(he sighs) The wrestling
the sexist remarks
the foul language
these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual
(beat) It seems you have no respect for anything
Andy is stupefied
He doesn't know how to respond
Of course  do
The Yogi shakes his head
Andy can't believe it
He looks around -- men in turbans staring at him
Andy cracks
Please
You've  to let me take the classes
It's how  keep myself It is apparently not working
So
All  wanna do is (pained) Andy, don't raise your voice
We don't wish your presence here
Andy is broken
He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy down the corridor, peering helplessly
Beaten, Andy waves goodbye to her
Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too
: '  - Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed
Covers pulled up to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life
Suddenly -
It's the doorbell
Andy ignores this
Beat
Another -
Then Go away
(
) It's me
Oh, it's open
The door opens
Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice cream
brought you Haagen Dazs
Chocolate
(mournful) don't deserve Haagen Daz
'm a horrible person
Andy, you're not horrible
You're just
complicated
You don't know the real me
Andy
there is no real you
- An astonished silence
And then
he slowly smiles
You're probably right
They both giggle
Andy studies her
looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes
Pause
Do you wanna move in together
Lynne smiles slyly
She leans down and kisses him
: - moving van outside a funky 60's house
carry boxes in
,   - Andy sits disoriented in the living room
Movers bustle around him
Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls -- and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself
In the b
g
, Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out
Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll
He smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases
Suddenly a phone on the floor
He grins
Hey
Our first phone call
(he scrambles for the phone) Hello
(
) Andy
it's me
've got some crummy news
(long beat) Taxi's been canceled
Silence
Andy has no response
(
) (cont'd) Do you want me to come over
Talk about it
Um
no
Uh, 'm sorta busy right now
Thanks
We'll get together next week
Andy hangs up
He just sits there
confused
unsure how to react
Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd
He goes over to the mirror
On the back of his neck
is an inflamed red pimple
Andy grimaces
(cont'd) Yuck
,  - Very late -- a clock says 1:15
is onstage, performing to the  audience members left
In back walks
Andy
Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner
Budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug
Andy points at the stage and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods
,  - Budd is onstage
And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards
The star of Taxi -- here in person, Andy Kaufman
The sparse crowd
Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles up
Actually, Budd, you're wrong found out today that Taxi's been canceled
The crowd  sadly
Andy blinks
(cont'd) Yeah, that's how  felt too
though  don't know why
'Cause for years, all  wanted to do was get off that show
(quiet, very confessional) But now that nobody will hire me, and nobody thinks 'm funny guess it was probably a pretty good job
One guy  sharply
Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues
(cont'd) Not to mention that my wife has left me
And she took the kids
(he sighs) don't know what 'm gonna do with myself
My options are sorta limited
(beat) This morning,  noticed 've got a cyst, or some kind of boil, on the back of my neck
It's really disgusting
Look
Andy turns
The red lump is bigger, grosser
The crowd , revolted
(cont'd) So  was thinking, since 'm sort of a quasi-celebrity, that  could charge people to touch it
(candid) Does anybody want to pay a buck to touch my cyst
couple stoners  and
Andy , then frowns
(cont'd) 'm serious
pause
then a few curious people walk up to the stage
The first taker is a
She starts to reach for the cyst -- when Andy stops her
(cont'd) No, no, you gotta pay first
She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse
: ,  - sweeps up
Budd counts money in the cash register
Andy shuffles out of the showroom
He waves some bills
made six bucks
That's good money
Budd stares sadly
This is a comedy club -- not a medical sideshow
(trying to be kind) If you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and pull yourself together
Come back and do the material that people love: Do the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy
Andy, you gotta snap out of this funk
If you can -- 'll give you the headline spot tomorrow
Andy thinks
The wheels are spinning
: - George is driving down Melrose, listening to the radio
He glances at the passing marquee -- then does a doubletake
It says "  - 9
" ,  - Puzzled George hurries inside
greet him: "Hey George
"  "George, you got a second
"  George distractedly waves and moves through
At the showroom door, he finds Budd
Hey, what's going on here
George, you won't believe it got Andy to do all the old material
(grinning) And he's killin' them
Inside, there's
George's eyes widen
Piqued, he goes in
,  - And it's packed
Andy is onstage, playing struggling, lovable Foreign Man
(  ) but one ting  do not like is too much traffic
Tonight  had to come on de freeway, and it was so much traffic
(giggling) It took me an hour and a half to get here
Foreign Man chuckles pathetically
The crowd
Andy's rockin'
(  ) (cont'd) But talking about the terrible things: My wife
Take my -- "Take my wife, please take her
" (  ) -take my wife, please take her
The rhythm is thrown
couple laughs
flustered pause
Andy glances down, then continues
(  ) (cont'd) No really,  am only foolink love my wife very much
But she don't know how to cook -- "Her cooking is so bad, is terrible
" (  ) -her cooking
(Andy stumbles uncomfortably) Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible
The laughs are weaker
The act is getting wrecked
- George grimaces
Who the hell's doing this
Angry, George hurries down front, looking for the loud jerk
He scans the tables
and it's Zmuda
(  ) (cont'd) But right now -- ( ) "But right now  would like to do for you some imitations
First, the Archie Bunker
" Andy freezes up
The audience is embarrassed
frazzled confusion, then Andy drops the accent
He glares at Zmuda
Sir, do you have a problem
( ) Yeah, my problem is you're tired
Andy winces
,  was asked to do this material - ( ) Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap
Kaufman, people are sick of you
The wrestling
the hoaxes
(defensive) Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- ( ) Who gives a shit
It's not funny
- is dumbfounded
(to himself) Why
Andy, why
used to think you were original
was very original
Yeah, exactly -- "was"
But now, you're creatively bankrupt
(he gleams cruelly) In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he  me to do this tonight
'm a plant
It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine
(back to Andy) Isn't that true
Andy shudders
The audience averts their eyes
painful silence
"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed
- Andy and George walk sadly down the street
There is a horrible gloom over them
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks
So  was just giving 'em what they want
(sadly) Andy, they don't think you suck
They've just
lost a reason to love you
The guys stop walking
George gently speaks
(cont'd) You've gotta make the public embrace you again
You have to win back their sympathy
He nods
'll come up with something
: ,  - The telephone wakes up Lynne in the new bedroom
She looks over -- Andy's not there
She looks at the clock and it's 4:30 am
She picks up the phone
Andy
Where are you
've been worried sick
Where do you want to meet
Okay, 'll call them
Lynne's baffled
' - Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about
Andy sits with bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George
Zmuda admires the menu
Look at that Grand Slam
Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes -- $2
99
How do they do it
They get you on the coffee
(irritable) Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here
All heads turn
long pause
Then -- Andy stiffly speaks
have cancer
Beat
Zmuda nods
Hey, that's good
We can make that play
(spitballing) And we'll really drag it out
You get better, you get worse
you die
It's in terrible taste
want nothing to do with this
Pause
Lynne is puzzled
Andy, are you serious
(grinning) Serious like a heart attack
Hey, maybe  can push you around in some goofy wheelchair
Andy softly shakes his head
No, it's true
have lung cancer
That's ridiculous
You don't even smoke
(emphatic) --  got some freaky rare kind
It's called large-celled carcinoma
Lynne's eyes tear up
She hugs onto Andy
Jesus, Andy
Can they cure it
They don't know
they've gotta run more tests
(starting to cry) Have you told your family
No,
Not yet
feel bad -- 've jerked 'em around so many times
George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other
Hmm
Confused, George leans in to Andy
Andy
you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true
Andy gulps
George -- it's true
'  - George confronts Zmuda
If  find out you're behind this, 'll kill you
What are ya '
was the one saying  didn't believe it
Exactly
That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up
- Andy is doing laundry
He empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug
Then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns
Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it
Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked
She stares in frustration at Andy's behavior
How can you be so casual
(he shrugs) Even if 'm dying --  still need clean socks
You're
Okay
You're probably right
He keeps working
Lynne loses it
God, you're so detached
Lynne storms out
Andy finishes his socks
Satisfied
he turns on the
: It's "Lassie
"  Little  is laid-up in bed, with a broken leg
Suddenly  runs in, holding a book
Lassie places the book on his lap
The boy smiles gratefully
( ) Thank you, girl
You're my best friend
Timmy warmly embraces the dog
- is terribly touched
Tears start rolling down his face
Genuine sobbing
Terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks
Andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone
He dials a long number
(on phone) Dad
: ,   - lies under the machine
It bombards his body with powerful radiation
, '  - The whole Kaufman family is gathered
Stanley, Janice, Michael and Carol listen to a   in a white coat
The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs
We've initiated an aggressive radiation program
see if we can eradicate the affected cells
(his  goes off) Excuse me
'll be right back
The doctor leaves
somber silence -- and then Janice bursts into tears
Stanley hugs her tightly
Carol watches the doctor with great hostility
His old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention
He leaves, and she frowns
What a crock
(angered) How dare you make light of this
Dad,  cried when he broke his neck
He's not gettin' me again -- (impassioned) Jesus
He's got lung cancer
standoff moment
Carol loses it
See, that's exactly it
He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke
That makes it weird
If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick
"  So he chose lung cancer, because he  us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real
" (trying to convince herself) Of course it's real
We're in a hospital
Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai
It's a showbiz hospital
Andy's studio friends probably run this place
He plans these things out
He takes over, hires actors
(beat) Personally,  didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing
Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes
(excited) Yeah
He didn't have doctor shoes
moment of total silence
All four of them look at each other
Is there
a glimmer of hope
We all know he's talked about faking his own death
Sure -- but what if he isn't
(sad; poignant) My son could be dying
and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera
: - George pulls up in his convertible
He jumps out
He walks to the door and starts to knock -- when suddenly it creeps open
It's Lynne, putting her finger to her lips: Shh
,   - The house is dark
Lynne leads George into the shrouded living room
and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position, concentrating
In front is a -  in a purple robe
- want you to visualize
Visualize big, healthy white cells in your body
Now visualize little cancer cells
Now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells
see them
see the white cells
In the corner -- George stares
He's fighting his skepticism
: ,   - The drapes are open
Sunlight streams in
Andy hugs the teacher goodbye, and the man leaves
George has been waiting in back
What was that all about
It's visualization therapy
He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease
Long beat
He's an actor
remember him in "The In-Laws
" Ah
Andy's eyes widen
His wheels are spinning fast
Uh, yes
that's true
But he's also ordained in holistic medicine
- He glares, stewing
George is fed up
- An unspoken tension
Then suddenly, he breaks down
(cont'd) George, what am  supposed to do
'm sick, and 'm tryin' to get better
but everyone's lookin' at me funny
Even you come to my home and act like 'm puttin' on a skit
You must take a little pleasure in it
Of course
(beat) But that doesn't mean  don't need everyone's support
can't be surrounded by negative energy
George shakes his head
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create
You are the  of negative energy
(thrown) -yeah
Well, then it has to stop
Because if these bad vibes get out
then everyone will be talkin' about how sick  am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- 'm dead
Andy struggles to remain composed
George sighs
So how can  help you
wanna go back to work and put on a happy show
(bright-eyed) The best show anybody's ever seen
Do you wanna tour the clubs
No clubs
wanna reach the
(beat) Carnegie Hall
George gently smiles
: - meeting at the National Enquirer
#1 'm working on a great cover story: 've got a guy in the lab at Cedars
He says Andy Kaufman is dying of lung cancer
Beat
The room
What bullshit
No
No more Kaufman stories
He's burned us too many times
#2 Yeah, he's definitely not dying
He's playing Carnegie Hall next month
The Reporter frowns
#1 Jesus
Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt
- 16mm  runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the wall
Smiling fake  and  dance, the cowgirls straddling hobby horses
They all
"'ve got spurs That jingle-jangle jingle
" Andy, George and Zmuda watch
Andy's face is enthralled like a kid
This is great
The crowd's gonna love this
(giddy; thinking) Hey
do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive
dunno
If they were, they'd be pushin' 80
Well, call
It'd be cool to get one on the show
(excited) want the evening to build and build
It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down
And you say, "Santa, what am gettin' for Christmas
"  And he says, "Cancer
" No
None of that want this show to be positive
That's great
but this show's gonna cost a fortune
Even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand
Andy smiles
don't care about the money just want the show to deliver
So who's gonna pay for it
Tony Clifton
(beat) You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money
Then he'll borrow it
know Tony better than you do
Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it
Pause
George considers this -- then slowly nods
Okay, Andy
Will do
: - Andy silently sits
The doctor and two  administer a chemo drip into Andy's body
He stares at the needle in his arm
The chemo begins
: - dressy    pushes into Carnegie Hall
The marquee says "
" - The show is on
Andy effusively  his conga drum and nonsense words to "Allouette, Gentille Alloutte
" Abbu daba, abi abbu daba
Abbu daba, abu dabu do
(to the crowd) Abbu dabbu da ba do
Everyone repeats
In the audience, George sings along too
ba du ba ti la ma na go
(grinning) Abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi tabu la
The crowd hopelessly breaks out
laughs along
They're all having a good time
- The corny "Jingle Jangle Cowboy"  is playing on a big screen
It finishes
Beaming Andy grabs the mike
Ladies and Gentlemen
'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould
Crazed
Frail  , 75, comes onstage
(cont'd) It's such an honor to have you here
(squinting into the lights) Andy
this is so overwhelming
Well, it's gettin' even better
'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses
Do you -- do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"
Eleanor starts to protest -- but Andy hands her the She blushes
Andy turns away, goes to the band, and starts conducting
They begin to  " "  Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles
Andy gets excited and conducts
Eleanor is sweating
She dances faster
Andy impatiently   the
Eleanor desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up
when suddenly she grabs her heart
Eleanor stops -- and collapses
She's down
horrified  from the crowd
The band stops playing
run on from backstage
One checks her heart
She's not moving
Zmuda runs out, horrified
Is there a doctor in the house
The crowd is stunned silent
Pause -- then one man stands
It's Michael
Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the aisle, and goes on stage
Michael checks her pulse and loosens her blouse
He presses Eleanor's chest, trying to restart her heart
But then -- he shakes his head sadly
She's dead
The crowd  sadly
Michael covers Eleanor with a jacket
,  - Andy watches, pleased
Suddenly, he  harshly
Andy drinks some water
Pause
then he puts on a goofy Indian headdress and runs back out
- Eleanor lies dead
Andy skips over and starts doing an Indian war dance around her body
The crowd is baffled
Andy , he
and then Eleanor starts to rise
He  triumphantly
She lives, like Frankenstein reborn
The crowd , surprised and giggling
Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive
Huge
(
) Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir
Rear curtains part, and the    belts out the "Hallelujah Chorus"
It's spectacular
The crowd goes nuts
(cont'd) Oh my gosh, it's the Rockettes
Yes indeed,    rush in from the sides, legs kicking high
The crowd
(cont'd) Girls and Boys, it's Santa Claus
Snow start falling, and     drops from above
The crowd screams with excitement
It's unbelievable
They leap to a standing ovation
In front are Stanley and Janice
They start crying
Beaming Andy embraces Eleanor
Then he takes the mike
(cont'd) And it's not over yet
'Cause 'm taking you all out to Milk and Cookies
The crowd laughs
(cont'd) 'm serious
- thousand people file out -- and - are parked up and down Fifth Avenue
The crowd is
Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance
He's the Pied Piper
Single file
Don't rush
There's enough cookies for everyone
- The schoolbuses pull up to a school
The disoriented passengers step out, not sure what to expect
,  - The audience crowds inside
and    in hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies
It's remarkable
At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne
Andy's face is pure joy
He watches all the adults munching on their cookies, everyone giddy at the silliness of it all
Andy smiles beautifully
He squeezes Lynne's hand, then whispers
don't want this to ever end
- stucco   sits in the middle of the rocky desert
- room with soft lighting and billowing curtains
New Age is laying crystals upon Andy's body
Andy
His hat is off, revealing he's bald
Now we'll place a blue crystal
Very high vibrations
It's wonderful for it's healing powers
(spellbound) Okay
Let's try two of those
and one of the pink ones
- Zmuda stands with a swarmy
Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping
know
(beat) The cancer's terminal
Yes
That wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in
(irked) Look, personally,  think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit
But if it makes Andy happy, that's all that matters
The man purses his lips
'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be "that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died
" (beat) 'm going to have to ask you to leave
Zmuda is speechless
, '  - Zmuda angrily packs Andy's bags
Zmuda is seething
But Andy is strangely calm and unaffected
It's okay, Bob
It wasn't really working
(a gentle smile) We'll find something better
,  - Lynne and Little Wendy are cooking Andy lunch
Lynne mashes up strange unidentifiable plant products
What is this stuff
It's all macrobiotic
Millet, burdock root, kelp
Andy says it'll purify him
Suddenly -- a
(
) What is that crap
Looks like somethin' my dog would puke up
The women turn
It's Andy -- dressed as Tony Clifton
spooked moment
Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there
but Andy is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude
How 'bout me and you dolls go get some  food:  French fries and a Porterhouse steak
(not sure what to say) Andy
Little Wendy's eyes pop:  Oh no she broke the rule
Tony gets very indignant
ain't Andy
'm Tony
Andy's sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick
The doctor says he's a goner
(rousing himself) But Tony's built like a mule
Andy asked me to be his pallbearer
'll do it for him
'm getting stronger and stronger
Here, watch this
Tony picks up a  and starts lifting it:  Up, down, up, down
Worried, the women rush to stop him
They take the chair
Stop it
'mon, put that down
Yeah, you're right
We better get movin'
We don't wanna miss Happy Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's you can drink for $4
99
Tony jauntily turns to exit
He gestures to the ladies
(cont'd) Let's go
(he starts "New York, New York") "These vagabond blues, Are washin' away
'll make a brand new start of it
" Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses
He clutches himself in pain
Andy
Shocked, they run over
Tony lies huddled on the ground
He mutters sadly, defeatedly
Dammit
: - The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills
Andy and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out
Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight
He is a shadow of himself
can't move my arm
(awkwardly) You've got good days and bad days
Andy softly sighs
My hair is coming out
(whispers) Yeah
George silently pats Andy
Andy's energy is sapped, but he forces himself to be upbeat
've got an idea for a new  show for me to star in
It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where  can goof off with the kids
You know, puppets, magic tricks
George is choked up
He goes along with it
(long pause) think we can sell that
Silence
George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm
Andy smiles gratefully
Hey
thanks for always backin' me
George clenches Andy's hand
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work
Ehhh, you know those guys
If he had his way, 'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day
(beat) And anyway, 've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer
(startled) Really
Yeah
He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing
He rubs you and sucks the disease right out
Andy beams
George stares sadly
The Philippines
dunno
Andy
he sounds like one of your characters
- His voice gets hushed
No
this guy's special
(very sincere) He performs miracles
George doesn't know how to respond
Andy looks up pleadingly
(cont'd) He's my last chance
: ,  - Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city
Suddenly, a rattletrap   lurches out of the sky
It hits a dirt runway
Dust flies
Chickens squawk and run
,  - Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city
Andy stares in amazement
,  - They reach a brick building
sign says "," with an eye over a triangle
,  - hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms
Money is handed over
Andy's clothes are stripped off
They're thrown in a locker
,  - large white tiled room
Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid Andy, his limp body unmoving
Andy looks up
and there's a
Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand
They have a look of desperation and reverence
At the head of the line is   at his work station: bench, a sink, and  with clean towels
crawls onto the bench
Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching
Pause, then he removes some He flings them into a bucket
The woman cries out
Andy gasps
The woman is helped away
Jun turns to wash his hands
An attendant gives him a towel to dry with
Then a   crawls up
Andy rolls closer
He stares at all this with fear
Nervousness
Hope
Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head
He concentrates, searching
then pulls out some
He flings them into a bucket
The man shakes
He is helped away
Andy is wide-eyed
He gets closer
closer
More patients
More bloody guts
More sobbing
Andy's excitement builds
Then -- he reaches the front
moment
Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief
They are overcome
It feels like they're saying goodbye
Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss
Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly
Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair
They help him up to the bench
Andy lies down
Fluorescent lights buzz overhead
He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient
Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle
Jun turns
An attendant gives him a towel to dry off
Andy relaxes, readying for it all
He glances at Jun's hands
Jun hands back the towel -- and under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines
Jun discreetly palms it
He's a fake
- moment of stunned disbelief
He is shocked
Outraged
Disappointed
Flabbergasted
The faith is meaningless
The joke is cosmic
The con man has been conned
Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce
and he starts to It's sidesplittingly funny
Andy , and , and , like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks
His face flushes with color
Life sparkles in his eyes
Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse
This is the best gag of them all
: - Andy lies in peace in a casket
He has died
His expression is pleasantly bland
Almost Latka-like
But his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it almost looks like a mask
We slowly widen
The casket is surrounded by beautiful flowers
We
and high above
is a
On the  is a projection of Andy, silently staring at us
There's a gentle smile on his face
It's the image from the opening of this film
' : The chapel is filled with
All are in black
Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock
Andy's family is huddled
Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying
George gives Zmuda a hug
Little Wendy comes over
and they comfort each other
Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays cast,  followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger, Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on
And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions
They stare up at the
( ) Well
My show is over
did my best, and  just want to say, until we meet again
please remember: (he begins to ) "In this friendly, friendly world
With each day so full of joy
Why should any heart be lonely
" Some gathered people tentatively join in the
( ) (cont'd) So everybody
Put your arm around the person next to you, even if you don't like that person
Come on
(he resumes ) "The world is such a wonderful place, To wander through, When you've got someone to love, To wander along with you
With the sky so full of stars, And the river so full of songs, Every heart should be so thankful, Thankful for this friendly, friendly world
" The curtain behind the coffin  and the casket with Andy's body slowly slides into the
The curtain closes
The
And all goes silent
Some people cry
Some begin to leave
Most of them are just staying, numbed
George and Zmuda whisper
It's a perfect Kaufman audience
Yeah
They don't know whether to be sad, or angry
The Taxi cast are flustered
Why are people leaving
The curtain's gonna open
Andy's gonna come out
know it
Sure, the body was just made of wax
(a very long beat) Wasn't it
Silence
They look to the front
The closed curtain wafts
then settles motionless
: /  - slowly appears:  "   " On Sunset,   come riding along on skateboards
Suddenly they reach --
Traffic on Sunset is jammed
limousines jockey to squeeze by
Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes pop
#2 Oh my
(stupefied) That's the freakiest thing 've ever seen
Look
He points
His friend turns -- and gasps
- The marquee says " :
" #1 Man, we were right
He's not dead
#2 He's just been lyin' low for a year
Hysterical, the guys race up to the club
But outside, there's a ,
People are screaming
Police have barricades
Everybody cries to get in
- It's packed
Every square inch is filled with glittery Hollywood VIPs
People make chit-chat
but there is a squeamish excitement in the air
brooding unease
Nobody knows what to expect
Suddenly -- the lights go black

) Ladies and Gentlemen
Please put your hands together for
Tony Clifton
The   2001 starts playing
", , -"
small  appears -- on a peach tuxedo
The light grows bigger, bigger
the tension magnifying
people gasping
our view widening
until Tony Clifton is revealed onstage
It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response
The crowd has no idea what to do
Tony smirks
How ya doin'
Dead silence
Tony struts downstage
He waves to the crowd
(cont'd) How you doin' back there
(to the front rows) How you doin' up here
Still no response
Until -- a lone reckless
Andy
Whoa
The crowd rustles nervously
Tony grimaces
Don't know nothin' about no Andy
Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my coattails

One, two, anda one two three four
The  kicks in with disco anthem "
"  Tony starts  the schmaltzy opening: (cont'd) "First  was afraid was petrified
Kept thinkin'  could never live Without you at my side
" (he wipes away a pretend tear) "Were you the one that tried to Hurt me with goodbye
Did you think 'd crumble
Did you think 'd lay down and Die
" We  the room full of enthralled spectators
At a front table are George and Lynne
Tony attacks the chorus
(cont'd) "Oh no not
As long as  know how to love, know 'll simply stay alive
" In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling
frowning
intrigued
confused
until we settle on a man in the very last row
Bob Zmuda
Enjoying the show more than anyone
(cont'd) "'ve got all my life to live 've got all my life to give

Zmuda grins and  proudly
