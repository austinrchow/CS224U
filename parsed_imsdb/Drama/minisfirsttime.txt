' Written by Nick Guthe : The face of  "" , 18, watching something
She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes
She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth
Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl
-                     (
) know what you're thinking
Don't bullshit me, because  do
You're -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, 'm begging you
'll gouge -         out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now
'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my -         mouth until  suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story
We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood
Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded
She's wearing a "" -shirt and jean shorts
(
) (') Well, relax
no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school
promise
:
"When Animals Attack" is on
In a series of quick cuts: zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant
sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead
pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm
An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull
(
) Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started

Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images
We now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed Studio City hillside home
- -
and their   are milling around, dancing and chatting as   spins tunes
(
) suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday
Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and halter top
She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, , 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other - (
) See,  was blessed with a terrific mom
Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me
Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks
The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday
(
) few days before the party, overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper
Nothing says " love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face
Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing
(
) And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party
in my bed
Mini's friend , a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over
She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini, almost challenging her
, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his imagination
() 3
: (
) That guy
Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot  producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out
Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable
Yo, bee-ach
Yo, birthday bee-ach
Is it on
Oh, it's on
That's my girl
Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low
-
Kayla instructs some  to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room
The caterers look confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey, starting to wheel the cake down the long hall
- The cake emerges from the hallway
The caterers begin singing "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage
As Diane comes storming over, we switch to
(
) See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences
"Firsts" is what call them
As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on Diane's face grows stronger with every step
() 4
: (
) (') Somewhere around fourteen, when had my first
rhymes with duck, realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many "firsts" into it as possible
We switch back to real time
What the hell are you doing
said wait until- (looking around) She's not even here, you morons
' face turns white
But, but her friend said-- Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind we see    rises out of it like Venus on the half shell
' : collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping looks, and her friends are in stitches
Some are even waving dollar bills (
) (') That was definitely a first, but more importantly, it was the first time  really understood my potential
And that's when it all started
Mini leans over and gives her  mom a big hug
(') (doing her best Donna Reed) Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday ever
5
'  - Mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head, having just taken a shower
She removes the towel to reveal she's just changed her hair color to
(
) That little stunt got me grounded for a week, but it was worth it
: Mini blow drying her hair
(
) (') See,  just don't understand people who live their lives as one big routine
: Mini evenly spreading the base to her make-up
(
) (') They're basically saying "'m not worthy of a unique experience on this earth
"
Well, sorry, but am
: Mini applying blush to her cheeks
(
) (') The law of firsts has served me well, because it's liberated me from the usual pathetic, repetitive concerns of high school
: Mini applying eye liner
(
) (') simply don't care if 'm popular, because if  did, then 'd be constantly stressing about whether my clothes are cool enough, or if Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know it yet" quarterback, is gonna call
6
'   - Mini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful looks from some of the more aggressive boys
They approach a group of
(whispering, worried) Oh, God, it's Troy
Just keep walking and don't look at him
, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job
Yo, Kayla,  got some more of what you were looking for Saturday night
(
) Ahh
The joys of the American educational system
Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops to address Troy and his posse
(') (suddenly brightening) Actually, Troy,  think you confused her with that senile, toothless grandmother of yours
"Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks concerned his ambush has backfired
Yo, Mini, why don't you use that mouth for something useful and suck my dick
More students start to gather, overhearing them
Actually, now that you mention it, can't think of anything 'd rather do than suck your dick
() 7
: Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her declaration
Well, it's all for you, babe
Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye
Really
(daring her) If you can fit it all in
The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is riveted by the exchange
Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his fly
(') Hey, what the
(grabbing his belt buckle) 'm going to suck your dick, Troy, you said  could
Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his belt
Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but then giggles start to erupt
Yo, this ain't funny
No, Troy,  want to suck your dick right now
Jesus, Mini, come on, get off
(screaming) No, Troy
You said  could, now come on
She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his pants
The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't believe their eyes
() 8
: (2) Let's see it
Come on,  want to suck your throbbing member right now
Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the hall as the mob laughs at him
Kayla looks at her gratefully and smiles
: Mini applying frosty hot pink lipstick, making her lips as full as possible
(
) Mini
Mini looks towards the door, deciding to ignore her mother
(
) (screaming) Mini turns towards the sound
Diane comes storming in
When  call you,  expect you to answer
(flatly) Sorry
Don't patronize me
(sugar sweet) Sorry
If you're trying to get me to call you a spoiled little ungrateful bitch, you're out of luck, because won't give you the satisfaction
() 9
: Thanks, mommy
Diane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where her mother's buttons are
(') What do you want
'm going out and  need you to wait for the delivery from the liquor store
They'll be here by nine
Fine
Diane gives Mini the once over, lingering on her mini-skirt
Diane winces at the outfit
Just thought you should know, that makes your thighs look fat
(deadpan) Gosh, you're right, mom, 'm such a cow
(
) It's a freakin' miracle 'm not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks
Have fun, don't do anything wouldn't
Diane turns and leaves
(over her shoulder) Well, that doesn't leave much
(under her breath) Cunt
Mini turns back to the mirror
10
'  - Mini pulls on a pair of thigh-high stockings, as a lit cigarette hangs from her mouth
(
) My mother moved out to  from Ohio when she was twenty to become an actress
Even though she was a total flatliner, somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps
without screwing anyone
-
Mini walks along the corridor in a pair of "fuck me" pumps, as the doorbell is heard ringing
(
) When she gets really sauced, she'll pop the tapes in and make me watch, then 'll threaten to call the suicide hotline
She continues through the living room towards the door, hiking her mini skirt up a little
(
) (') After a few years, she got desperate and spread 'em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn
She got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn't be on the show, unless she hoovered me out
She reaches the front the door
(
) (') Excuse me for one sec
She opens the door to reveal a delivery boy,  20's, with six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart
(nervously excited) Hey, Mini, how you doin'
You're late
11
-
Mini watches as Jimmy carefully lifts one case after another on to the counter
(
) She was gonna do it, too, at least that what's she told me when she was feeling particularly loving
But then she heard rumors the show wasn't gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child support beat thirteen weeks on "Skin Tight", so  got to stick around
Bad choice
Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the kitchen
-
Mini mixes herself a large Sapphire martini
(
) Anyway, what Mom didn't count on was the prick having a heart attack and croaking a year after  was born
She pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in
(
) When she tried to collect on his estate, she found out he'd owed the government two point five in back taxes
- 1993
Diane walks down the steps to a waiting Porsche, with a ,     behind the wheel
() 12
: (
) Now, if she had been smart, she would've set her sights a little lower and gone after a guy who would've worshipped the ground she walked on and wouldn't care that she already had a kid
: Diane getting into the car
She turns to the driver and gives him a flirty smile
'   , but just as smiling back at her
(
) But not mom, she was gonna bag another elephant if it meant gobbling every knob from Hollywood to the Palisades
As the car pulls away, we see an 8    watch from an upstairs window of the building
- Mini sits watching  as Diane walks in with , his hands all over her
Diane looks surprised and pissed to see Mini still up
Jesus Chr--Mini, why aren't you in bed
Mini just stares at her, then shifts her penetrating gaze to #3
He looks unnerved by Mini
#3 thought you said we'd be-- Don't worry, Larry, she's going to bed, right now
Aren't you
'   - Mini lies awake as the #3's brains out waft through the thin walls
13
'  -
Mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as emerges from Diane's bedroom, he's tucking his shirt in
He looks a little startled to see her up
#4 Oh
Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom , uh, had a good time
Oh,  will
Like some coffee for the road
The guy looks at her a little surprised, then smiles
#4 Sure
thanks, kid
: Mini watching the    from the curb
In her hand, she holds a bottle of   -
: #4 driving down the freeway, drinking coffee from a paper cup
Suddenly, a look of absolute dread overcomes him
'  -
Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking disheveled
She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen table eating her cereal
Do you want to live in this shit hole your whole life
Mini just stares at her
Then stay in your fucking room until they leave
Got it
Mini says nothing
Suddenly, Diane picks up a from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head
Mini ducks as it  behind her on the wall
14
: 18 (
) So it pretty much went on like that until
(
) Mini
Diane
'm home
(
) Five years ago, when she met Martin
Mini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps
(
) (') It was a win-win
- Mini, Diane and  , 45, a trim executive in an Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate cocktail party
Martin, a man who understands, in his world, style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd effortlessly
(
) He didn't want kids, but needed a ready-made family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings
We finally got out of Reseda
: Mini at the bar, stealing the drink of a   who has turned her back on it, to make a point to her
(
) (') It was great for about a year
: Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a off to the side
Martin stiffens as he watches in   her tongue slip into his mouth
(
) (') Then he figured out what he had married
by then it was too late
15
- Martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door
(breezing past him) You're home early
(
) (') First time in three months he's walked in before Letterman
He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now 'm thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or
found a new pin
Yeah
uh
(searching) dinner with a client got canceled
(
) Bingo
Tough day
About the same
They head back into the living room
Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists
Someone's got to make the payments on your Beemer
(
) He's a partner at a public relations firm, which is ironic because  can't remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together
or had relations
He plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer out of his breast pocket
() 16
: Is your mother around
No, she went to a party off Beachwood
She was in one of her "happy moods", so  doubt she'll be sleeping here
Oh
(innocently) If you were thinking of inviting a guest over
(measured) wasn't, but thanks for the concern
You're going out on a school night
Yeah
Martin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind clearly elsewhere
Mmm
Is your homework done
Haven't even cracked a book
(not listening) Mmm
' -
Mini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick, compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms
(
) Considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed, you've got to admire his resolve
He could've left her years ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won't give in
17
-
Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive
Martin's  500   and Mini's  Z3 convertible sit in the open garage
(
) Their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm
Mini gets into her
- The  drives down the street, weaving in and out of traffic (
) As  said, the rule of firsts guides my life
Once you've gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for
- Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows
(
) thought it would be a goof if put a photo ad in one of those 25 cent "outcall" massage newspapers they sell around town
But  just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail
So  went to an escort service, and when they found out  was 18, they told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night
if  was up to it
She passes   soliciting cars that have slowed down for a peek
(
) (') Would you look at them
One of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look
() 18
: (
) (') It's pathetic
mean, she's got to be, what
At least twenty eight
In dog years
(pausing) Oh, wait, that would make her four
She arrives in front of the
- Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and knocks
She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an answer
The door opens and a    opens the door
He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way
He could be a serial killer or
-
Mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door, as the man sheepishly follows her
(
) My first night as a call girl was a serious let down
It turns out both guys were in town for the "Promise Keepers" convention
She reaches the door
He opens it and points to the room across from his
Mini walks across and knocks
(
) The first one got so excited didn't even get a chance to get my panties off before he creamed himself
in a denim shirt opens it
-
The heavier man is on his knees, weeping as he hugs Mini around the waist
(
) And the other said  looked so much like his niece, he started whimpering and praying for forgiveness
She rolls her eyes in frustration
19
- Mini drives home, suddenly a  is heard and she sees the of a cop car behind her
Mini pulls over looking pissed
(
) Time to bat the eye lashes
The cop car pulls up behind her and a gets out, approaching the car
Mini looks in her mirror, with a sly smile
The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down at her, clearly attracted to her
- is parked with its lights off
- is lying on the seat with her legs spread, as Mini goes down on her
The woman is clutching the steering wheel with her left hand and the seat with her right, hanging on for dear life as Mini rocks her world
(
) This
Are you kidding
My first woman and my first cop
It would've been perfect if she hadn't wanted to cuddle afterwards
'  -
Mini unlocks the door and walks in to find Diane passed out, face-up on the sofa in a loosely-tied bathrobe
At the sound of the door, Diane looks up
(slurring) Oh
wha- what are you doing here
ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her insightful question
Mini sighs and heads for the bedroom
Did you have fun, dear
Yeah,  turned two tricks and went down on a dyke cop
() 20
: Thass nice
Mini heads down the hallway
(
) God, what's gotten into her
She was almost warm and fuzzy
' -
Mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks
- lies passed out on her bed
His body hair is thick and matted
His genitals are covered by her pillow, which he cradles like a teddy bear
Mini's jaw tightens slowly
- Mini walks through the lobby past   sitting at the bar, chatting up     in their mid twenties
(
) After that night, things really picked up
The men's eyes instinctively follow Mini, as their dates exchange a glance of annoyance
(
) My one rule which the agency wasn't too happy about was, of course, only firsts, no repeat customers
- This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school student, past a
(
) But believe me, they didn't have too much trouble honoring that request
- Mini is led in by a  who presents Mini to one of the sitting behind a large oak desk
() 21
: (
) 'd make house calls to offices at lunch hour and we'd say  was someone's niece or cousin in town on vacation
The man stands up and greets her like she's family, and then quickly shuts the door
- Mini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a cheerleaders uniform
(
) And then when football season started, Saturday through Monday
- in a football jersey opens the door to find Mini waving her pom poms with a Texas sized grin on her face
(
) was busier than Domino's
/
- Mini drives into the garage
(
) Then one Thursday night  get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so "wifey" doesn't find the motel bills on the gold card statements
They say 'm just his type
young
- Mini walks quickly through the lobby
(
) They tell me he's not big on the chit-chat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for
-
Mini knocks on the door
() 22
: (
) It's open
- The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time
Mini opens the door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees
, her stepfather, sitting up in bed
She quickly turns away before he sees her face
Hello
(
) Can you fucking believe it
Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking
She absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time
Uh
hi, (quickly adopting a southern accent) Sorry, 'm Mlate
Don't worry about it
Mind if  freshen up
Sure
Mini ducks into the bathroom
- Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself in the mirror
She's almost white from the shock
She looks down at the counter
(
) My own dad
My first thought was "how sick is he
" But then started thinking
'm one to talk, and
well
() 23
: Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer
(
) Why not
mean, he isn't my real dad
and talk about a first
The more  thought about it
wicked glint dances across her eyes
(
) the more turned on  got
Then thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed,  could do her strange guy in this bed
(
) Everything alright in there
(still in her southern accent) Just peachy
Listen, Sugar, would you mind turning the lights off, 'm kinda new to all this and a little shy
(
) No, that's fine, but can we get this show on the road
Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's tail
- Martin turns the light off next to the bed
little bit of light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the blinds
After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in a bra and panties
Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed, letting her hair fall over her face
Martin tries to pull her hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully shaking her head "no"
She reaches down and touches him through the sheet
He looks up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down
He reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet
What did you have in mind tonight
() 24
: The deluxe
Oh, so you want complete access
(voice quivering) yes
You do know that's extra
He nods
Just so we're clear
Now, close your eyes
Martin furrows his brow, disappointed
Come on
He obeys
Now just keep them shut for a while
Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her
She starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply
She looks up at his expectant face, intoxicated with her power
Her mouth starts to move down his chest
Martin lets out a small, almost self-conscious gasp
: -
It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets, post coitus in the "spoons" position
Martin has a dreamy, satisfied look on his face
Mini smiles to herself
(
) can't believe  pulled that off
Keeping my face hidden actually wasn't that hard, and he pretty much let me do whatever  wanted
25
-
Mini is getting dressed
(
) And you know what
He was damn good
don't why Mom is throwing the cat all over town, when she can have this every night
-
The room still dark, Mini emerges from the bathroom, dressed
(searching) that was
you were really good
(southern accent) Thanks, Sugar
'd like to see you again, but
uh
never got your name
Even in the dark, he looks a little embarrassed
Mini smiles
Ginger
Ginger,  won't forget
/
'  - Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement
(
) literally couldn't feel the ground under my feet
first to top all firsts
knew 'd tell him one day, but  wanted to savor it for a while
She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse
Her eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them
Suddenly, she realizes they aren't there
She freezes
() 26
: (
) Ginger
You forgot your
Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards her, carrying her jacket
He stops, the realization setting in
Jacket
Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant smile to spread across her mouth
(
) Here's to immediate gratification
Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth
(whispering) You were great
Martin just stares straight ahead, numb
After another moment he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the street below
' :  few cars rush by on the street below
It appears to be about a three or four story drop
He looks back at Mini
He starts to lift a leg over the railing
Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is,  don't think that's a risk you can afford to take
Martin looks down at the street for another moment
(
) God, what a drama queen
Don't let this little act fool you
He'd never let mom get all his money
He glances back at her, looking tortured
() 27
: (2) (
) This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter
ah ha
Contemplate suicide
artin backs away from the railing
(
) Now that's thinking outside the box
-
Martin and Mini sit at a booth
Martin stirs his coffee looking shell shocked
Mini devours a plate of Belgian waffles covered with whipped cream
(
) We spent the next few hours just sitting there
don't think we said three words
think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the sweetest nights  ever spent with a guy
-
Mini drives home with the top down
(
) He told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again
told him that was fine
- Mini sits at the table eating cereal
Martin enters, looking a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance
(
) Suddenly, he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework
Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math problems
() 28
: (
) Kiddo
Mini looks up at him, raising her eyebrows
'd be happy to help you with it, if you need
Actually, 'm thinking about starting a 401K plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund
Martin looks down uncomfortably
- Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table is open as well
Martin looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly blitzed, checks his watch and stands up
'  - Mini lies in bed under the covers, reading
The door to her room opens
She looks at the clock
It reads: 12:15am
Martin enters
(
) It took exactly one week
'  - The lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under the covers
(
) In the beginning,  was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then  realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less
To be perfectly honest
loved it
Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug
It reminded me of when  was young and brought guys home after school
29
'  - Mini and Martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed- over glass shower door
(
) At first, we were very discreet, only doing it when Joan Crawford wasn't home or was completely comatose
'  - Mini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they both stare at the ceiling
Martin looks over at her and they share a conspiratorial smile
(
) Then we got bolder, doing it before she would pass out
think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope
- Mini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that leads to Mini's bedroom
Diane is watching  with a martini glass in her hand
(
) One night we did it before "Entertainment Tonight" ended
: Them under the covers, but this time the lights in her room are on (
) We even almost got caught
(
) Mini
Mini and Martin stop at the sound of her voice, they look at each other, realizing Diane's right outside
(startled) Yeah
() 30
: Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the covers
Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils
She appears truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even noticed someone else in the bed
God, 've told you a thousand times to knock
Have you seen Martin
think he was in his study a half hour ago
Uh
can't say that  have
Well,  assume he's gone out, so 've invited Ricardo over for a
cocktail
You know how children make him uneasy, so 'd appreciate if you and
(pointing to Martin under the sheet) your friend could either stay in here or use the back door when he arrives
For a moment, Mini can't believe her mother appears to have no problem with there being a man in her bed
Oh
sure, no problem
Diane shuts the door
Okay, she's gone
Martin pokes his head out of the covers
The two of them share a smile, not believing their luck
They start to laugh and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume where they left off
(
) Looking back, that may have been the moment we fell in love
31
'       - Mini tries on a cocktail dress, as Martin looks on, giving his approval
(
) We became inseparable
'  - Mini sits at the pool side table, as Martin helps her with her homework (
) Mom thought it was cute how we had suddenly grown so close, and thought it was wonderful how Martin had taken an interest in my education
From inside the house, Diane is seen lighting a cigarette, looking out at them and smiling
: Mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which indicates how well endowed he is
She jots down an arrow next to the words "actual size"
Martin blushes, averting his eyes
- The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight, as   refreshes their wine
(
) Now that we were spending time together,  actually started to find out what Martin was like for the first time
Martin tells her something and they both crack up
(
) He wasn't the drip  thought he was
- The two walk hand in hand, stopping to watch the drum rhythm circle filled with   and   moving to the throbbing beat
() 32
: (
) He was funny, charming, sweet and even a little shy
Mini jumps into the circle, dancing along with the other revelers
Martin is content to watch, until she runs to the edge of the circle and pulls him in
Reluctantly, he begins to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself
-  -
Mini and Martin walk close together, but not the way couples do
(
) Being seen in public was no sweat, as long as we didn't act like a couple
- Martin's Mercedes snakes through an "s" curve, as the lights of the city twinkle in the background
(
) This went on for two months, before we had the talk we both knew was coming
The car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook areas with a view of the city
- Martin pulls up the parking break and turns to her
So
So
don't want to have to sneak around in my own house
Well,  don't think telling her is such a hot idea
() 33
: mean,  don't want to live under the same roof with her
: You can't leave, she'll get half
Martin exhales, knowing she's right
Can  ask how the hell you married her without a pre-nup
Her
(sighing) She wasn't as bad an actress as you think
Well, there is another option
, ,
There is
Her eyes harden as she looks out at the city
But it will take some planning
and some resolve
Martin's eyes suddenly widen
Wait, you don't mean- Kill her
She lets the word linger, as the rain beats down steadily
No, of course not, she is my mother
Good
() 34
: But 've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill- Ill
Unstable, unpredictable, irrational
dangerous to the safety of her husband
her child
She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs
Martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right
Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious
He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips It would be for her own good
The only truly caring action we could take
As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife
You did it for the well being of your daughter
The selfless act of a devoted parent
The sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips
Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented
She responds in kind, tilting her head
And corroborated by friends and people outside the family
public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt
() 35
: (2) No, that would be useful
Their lips are now almost touching
And we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country
With lots of fresh air
It will be a much better life for her
Much
Unable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each other's clothes
- The car rocks gently back and forth in the rain, as another car whizzes by, spray flying up behind it as it disappears around a curve
'  - Mini wakes up with a look of pure joy, ready to face the world
(
) awoke the next morning, as excited as  could remember
Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this would take determination
-
Mini swims on her back in the pool, a lit cigarette dangling between her lips
(
) Stamina
- Mini and Martin sit together, eating breakfast
() 36
: (
) And imagination
Diane storms through the living room in the background, passing out of sight, behind the door frame
(
) decided to start simply
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
(
) Part one, violent mood swings- slash-uncontrollable rages
Cushions from the living room couch fly past the door frame
Fucking shit
Where are they
Mini stirs her coffee innocently
Diane again can be seen through the door, this time throwing magazines and papers off the coffee table
'm gonna be late
It took me three weeks to get an appointment with Anton
(
) Anton Michelle, masseuse to the stars and reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town
Rumor has it, he's pouring the pork to every rich wife between Malibu and Pasadena
He must be incredible if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this early
and now 'm gonna miss it because  can't find my fucking car keys
Martin and Mini exchange a smirk
She turns towards them, eyes ablaze
could use a little help in here
Martin looks up from his morning paper as cheerful as can be
() 37
: (2) Coming, honey
- Mini and Martin walk in to see Diane on all fours, looking under one of the sofas
Her panties are blatantly visible from under her mini-skirt
Mini and Martin exchange a smirk
Diane, sugar, do you remember where you put them when you came home last night
Yeah, in the fucking bowl by the fucking door where  always fucking put them
Well, uh, you were kinda out of it last night
No,  wasn't
had one drink with Marie, one
Uh, are you sure
You did seem a bit tipsy
Yes, 'm sure, you dickless wonder
iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a desk near the front door
(under her breath) Now don't you listen to her, you are not a dickless wonder
Martin tries not to let on how much he's enjoying this
Completely frustrated, Diane stops looking and heads for the "key" bowl by the door
Mini, 'm taking your car
Martin, take her to school
Diane grabs a set of keys
() 38
: Diane,  have a meeting with Chapman, he's our biggest client-- (opening the door) Tell him it's an emergency
She slams the door behind her
Mini looks at Martin with a sly grin then removes a cell phone from her pocket and dials a number
As she waits for an answer, she twirls ' around her finger
(
) Now, here comes the really fun part
realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit  could do a passable job imitating
(mimicking Diane) Hello, Anton
It's Diane Tannen, know it's late notice, but 'm going to have to cancel our appointment
What
No, of course, realize 'll still have to pay
yes, something came up
""    -
, 30, the very muscular "it boy" masseuse is furiously fucking  , a similarly hyper- aerobicized wife, on his massage table
He's bent her over the table and is taking her from behind when, suddenly, the door flies open
They both look up to see
with a stunned expression
Anton
But
Jeanette
Uh
hi, Diane
(french accent) But, Mrs
Tannen, you call and cancel zee session thirty meenutes ago What
No,  didn't
() 39
: Yes,  spoke to you myself, you say sometheeng come up
Diane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing
Jeanette, you knew  had an appointment today, did you pretend- (flustered) No, ,
Anton called me and told me he had a cancellation
Yes,  call her after you call me
Jeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around herself
Why, you sneaky little bitch
Suddenly, Diane  for Jeanette, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her off the table
Jeannette shrieks as Anton struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart
'   - Diane sits at the table with her arm in a sling
Martin cuts her meat for her, as Mini pours her some red wine
(
) Needless to say, word of the 'incident de Anton spread quickly through the community
Do you think she'll press charges
Are you kidding
She should get twenty to life
When  told Margo and Penny about her little stunt, they both said they'd have ripped her eyes out
She'll be lucky if anyone speaks to her again
Martin holds up a forkful of food
() 40
: Here comes the choo-choo
Diane grabs the fork with her good hand
For god's sake,  didn't break both hands
Jeez,  still can't believe you broke your hand on her face
It's so Linda Hamilton
(slugging some wine) hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed
- : The store's owner, , 50, picking up the osa Angelica, this is Carlos
(
) Hello, Carlos, it's Diane Tannen calling
Ah, si, Senora Tannen, como esta
(
) (annoyed) Uh, Carlos
english, comprende
(taken aback) Okay
(
) 'm going to need a delivery to the house
'  - ""    is being inflated on the front lawn by a , as   warm up next to it, tossing clubs between them
() 41
: (
) Phase two: wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state
from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as unload their cargo
It appears that they have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica and  line the driveway
Mini stands outside next to Carlos, sucking on a lollipop
Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers
Your mother said you are having a big party
(innocently) know, can you believe all this
Just then, Diane's Jaguar pulls into the driveway
She looks at the trucks, her expression souring
She stops the car and flies out
Carlos, what the hell is going on
Senora Tannen, the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party
Ordered,  didn't order anything
Who told you to bring these here
(flustered) But, but, Senora, you did, you called me,  talked to you
No, you didn't
Si, you said you were having a party, don't you remember
() () 42
: (2)      (') You were very excited, saying you were going to have the most wonderful party and invite everyone you knew and it had to be just perfect
Perfect, that's what you said Mom, is that what you were talking about yesterday
What
Well, it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine
You mumbled something about a party before you took a nap
No,  did not
(wincing) Mom, you did
The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol
But, but
only slept for-- (to Carlos) am so sorry
Listen, we'll pay, don't worry
Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes pulls up
Diane turns around to see his car and a look of dread strikes her
Oh, god
(
) Right on cue
Let's see how convincing he is
Martin gets out of the car, surveying the damage
look of pure indignant outrage overcomes him and it's impossible to tell this is an act
() 43
: (3) What is going on
Carlos, what the fuck are all these flowers doing here
(
) Oooh, now  see why he makes the big bucks
Senor Tannen, we-- Uh, Martin, ,
Diane, did you order all this
Mom, go inside, just go, 'll handle him
(trying to calm him) It's under control, Dad
Please, let's not make a scene
: -Mini opens the front door to find    from pull up
(
) Over the next few days, whenever Mom had passed out from too much drinky-drinky
-The door opens again as   holding a full length mink coat stands before her with a big smile on his face
(
) 'd pull out her wallet
-  dangling the keys to a which is parked behind him in the driveway
(
) and reach out and touch someone
-   hauling a 30   behind it pulls up in front of the house
() 44
: (4) (
) It's really remarkable what you can order with a Platinum card these days
'  - strung out Diane sits on the couch, smoking and nursing a Vodka tonic
rings and Diane reacts like a dog in a thunderstorm, a jolt of fear coursing through her body
(
) Talk about easy
After a week of my version of the home shopping network, the doorbell might as well have been a canon
Diane gets up and walks unsteadily towards the front door
'   - Mini and Kayla sit in a history class, looking dreamily at their teacher,  , 25, an earnest young preppy in the middle of a lecture
(
) At this point, dear old mummy was so spooked,  was actually afraid she might stop drinking
So needed a back up plan, to keep her
off-balance
As we see from a closer examination of the facts, Abraham Lincoln's decision to
Bishop's voice fades out as he continues to speak
(
) Now, here's someone 'd like to make sit, roll over and then toss me his snausage
But today
priorities are priorities
Mini raises her hand
Mr
Bishop, can  go to the little girls room
() 45
: Of course, Mini
- Mini walks down the empty corridor
' -
The  ,  , 55 and very Aryan, enters the empty bathroom and walks into a stall
(
) The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush named Helga Hauptfuhrer, or "der Fuhrer" as she was affectionately known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip
- Hauptfuhrer sits down and takes a bottle of vodka out of her nurses coat
(
) exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day
She takes a long slug
'  - Mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet with a paper clip
She quickly looks through the bottles
(
) Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store
Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label
:   indicating "" and the dosage
Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptfuhrer enters
() 46
: (
) Thank god for the quack who invented  and the lazy parents willing to let "Der Fuhrer" keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed
'  - Mini stands at the counter, making her mom
She's cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender
(
) My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded
Actually, she started drinking more
She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder
She pours that into the blender and puts the lid on
(
) Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick-me-up
She turns on the blender
'  -
Diane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry
(annoyed) Mini
asked you for that drink ten minutes ago
Mini walks in, carrying the margarita
Put it on the counter
You're welcome
Diane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita
() 47
: Mmm
this is really good
What's in it, Sweetie
(
) The first time in my life she calls me "sweetie" and 've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys
Oh, this and that
- The party is chock full of   and their decidedly less attractive
Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered
My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face
The two women recoil
was the best thing that ever happened to me
(
) Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public
feel fantastic, just fabulous mean,  feel like  could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy
He did that, right
Boy, 'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen,  would've let him stick his javelin in me any day
Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between
#1 So  looked each and every juror in the eye- () 48
: (spinning around) want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries
#1 Uh
'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty
" or "sidebar
" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations
Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other
was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of "Bikini Girl" and my line was "'ll have another," it was with "Isaac" at the pool bar
had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my  card, so  guess it was worth it
he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance
#2 Uh,  think  could use a refill
#1 Me too, (to Diane) please, excuse us
They head towards the bar and Diane follows
The two women she turned away from shake their heads at the spectacle
But, but we were talking about juries and Isaac and, and that drag queen  broke my face on and
The two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them
She finally realizes they aren't stopping
She grabs the first man by the shoulder, pissed
Hey
() 49
: (2) The party stops
Everyone is staring at Diane as the music continues to play
She looks around the room at the disapproving eyes, panic setting in
-
Diane is led away by Martin and Mini, as other partygoers watch the sad scene
They both struggle to keep Diane from stumbling
(slurring) And then  told him that  had been an extra on Hello Larry and Mike Farrell had tried to-- MacLean Stevenson
What
MacLean Stevenson played "Larry
" Right, that's what  said
and then MacKenzie Phillips tried to slip me the tongue
-
Diane lies passed out on the bed as Mini and Martin watch her sleep
Listen, great job, but you need to give me more warning
was at dinner with Chapman, and it's the second time 've had to re- schedule
'm sorry, but it was a golden opportunity
You always said you can't pay enough for good publicity
- Mini and Martin peruse the aisles
() 50
: (
) At this point, with all those witnesses, Martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away
hey stop in front of a wall of tools: hand axes, hammers and saws
Mini selects a large hand axe
(
) My feeling was that until they were ready to weld the door to her padded cell shut
: Mini picking out two black ski masks, two pairs of black goggles and two black sweatsuits
(
) there was more work to be done
- Diane walks through the mall aimlessly
She wears a wrinkled, mis-buttoned pink blouse
Her eyes are hollow, her cheeks sunken
few  throw her a concerned glance as they pass
(
) Final phase: Complete psychotic breakdown
, disguised in a hat and sunglasses, leans on the railing from the next level up, watching her mother
- Mini slides into a table next to
Hey, boys
The two guys exchange a glance
Cute girls like Mini clearly don't "hey, boys" them
Wanna have a little fun
- Diane looks at some clothes
Her cell phone goes off and she answers it
() 51
: Hello
(
) (breathy, threatening) Diane
Yes
The breathing increases, getting deeper and more menacing
Hello
What do you want
(
) can see you
Can you see me
(alarmed) Who is this
(
) Do you feel safe
(looking around) Who is this
(
) You didn't answer the question
Mini and the two skatepunks giggle with glee at the terror they're inflicting
She looks around, scanning
Nothing seems out of the ordinary This isn't funny
'm hanging up
(
) wouldn't do that
If this is some kind of joke
(
) assure you, 'm no joke
May say that pink blouse is very fetching
() 52
: (2) Panicked, she heads for an exit
look at her with concern
(
) Diane, your car is the other way
(menacing) Now answer my question
Do you feel safe
whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around
'm hanging up
(
) (very calm) Hang up and you're dead
(falling apart) Why are you doing this
(
) Can you see me
She scans the crowd frantically, then starts walking towards a '   for help
(
) Pick me out something sexy
Leave me alone
(
) (very calm) But 'm so close to you
She stops, frozen in fear
Just then, the second comes up behind her, brushing into her
She jerks away from him
(screeching) Get away
within ear shot turns around, including #2 Take it easy, lady, what the hell's your problem
() 53
: (3) The skatepunk walks away
and    watch with amusement from an upper level as    moves towards her
(
) Peek a boo
'm coming for you
but that guard can't help you
Maybe you should make a run for that Gold Jag you drive home to Mira Loma Lane
(whimpering) How do you know where  live
(
) know everything about you
No
(
) Maam
Diane spins around to find    standing behind her
#1 'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall
We'll walk you to your car
No
can't leave, he knows where live
#1 Maam, you're going to have to leave
Did you hear me
He knows where live
#1 Who knows
She hands him the phone
() 54
: Him
The security guard puts the phone to his ear
The sound of a hang up is heard
He nods to his partner, as he removes a walkie talkie
#1 (into walkie talkie) Yeah, this is Franklin, we've got a code 7, get an  unit over here
The two guards grab her
She drops the phone and starts scratching at one guard's face
The other pepper sprays her, as she falls down, howling
What are you doing
#1 Sorry, Maam, this is for your own protection
The phone is like a jolt of electricity through her body
Diane kicks and punches at the guards
It's him
Answer it
Answer it
He said he was gonna kill me
The guards finally tackle her, getting handcuffs on
He, he knows where  live
watch for a moment and lose interest, writing her off as just another  kook
watches from the upper level, quite satisfied
'  -
Diane lies in bed, half awake, watching
scotch and soda rests in her hand
(
) After her performance at the mall, 'm sure she would have qualified as "committable"
But that wasn't enough,  wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away
() 55
: Mini pokes her head in the door of the room
Mom, we're going to get some dinner
Do you want us to bring you back something
You're leaving
Both of you
(
) For the last three days she hasn't left the house
Why don't we just order in
Mom, we can't stay in here forever
Do you want to come with us
Diane considers the question by looking at her face in the bed side mirror
It's still puffy and blotchy from the pepper spray
Mom
She looks up at Mini
(
) Ah
vanity, the most predictable of sins
can't
You two go
Okay
-
It is dark and quiet, as the evening dew rises on the lawn
'  -
Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed , waking her up
She stares at it for a moment, trying to decide if she should answer it
On the forth ring, she answers
() 56
: Hello
rings in her ear
She hangs up the phone second later it  again
She waits two rings and then answers
Again a
Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the phone, waiting
Something small hits the window across the room
Startled, she turns her head towards it
' : Through the window, in the distance by the hedges a    is visible, wearing a ski mask and goggles
In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming, sharp kitchen knife
She can't believe her eyes
: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up, indicating that he's going to cut her throat
Eyes wild with panic, Diane picks up the phone and dials 911
The phone dials and she waits
Please, please, oh god
She looks back out the window:    walks out of the bushes and heads towards the house
(
) You have reached 911, if this is an emergency, please remain on the line
Oh god, oh god
Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of the room, leaving the phone off the hook
- Diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps down to the living room
She goes straight for the phone on the end table next to the couch
She picks it up
(
) Please continue to hold, your call will be answered
() 57
: She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: outside the living room window, but this one holds a
She turns around to look out the window
raises the axe slowly
No
no
help
Help
She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try
Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room
- Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked
She clicks the lock shut, just as    with the knife appears in the door frame
Oh, God
Help
Someone
Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles
(softly ) No, please, no
She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it
The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure violently tugs at the handle
Help
Someone please, help me
- She runs back in, checking
It's clear
She decides to check the front door
She runs over and looks out the peep hole
: It appears clear
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on
: everything looks good
() 58
: She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open
She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates
Just then, from behind the gate, steps the It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the house
Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her
She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating
She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears
Please God, please God
please
She looks around the room, searching for options
Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees     standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen
Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom
The knife wielding figure follows behind her
She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder
She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door
- Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out
She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom standing silently, staring back at her
iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears
She looks up again at  : It's empty
The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs
: puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle
(
) Our work finished
'    -
Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of beef put in front of them
(
) We rewarded ourselves on a job well done
59
'  -
Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom
(
) And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old
Mom, we're home
Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate
They reach the door to the bathroom
It's still closed
Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there
Honey
You okay
Honey
Mom
Martin tries the door
Diane still appears to be leaning against it
He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches
Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door
She appears drugged
They lay her flat and try to wake her up
Diane, it's us, wake up
Mini slaps her hard across the face
(feigning concern) Wake up, Mommy
Mini
Killjoy
Martin lightly taps Diane's cheeks
Diane, come on, come on
() 60
: Mini looks up at the counter lies open next to the sink
Martin
e looks up and immediately sees the bottle
picked that prescription up three days ago
It was probably more than half full
The two of them look at each other, studying each other's reaction
Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make the first move
(eerily calm) suppose we should call an ambulance
The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's wrist again
Her pulse is almost gone
Do you really think they can save her
don't know
She'll only try it again
You know she will
She will if we keep this torture up
Martin looks down at Diane
(suddenly with resolve) This is wrong, call an ambulance
() 61
: (2) Hold on, who are we to say her choice was wrong
She put those pills in her mouth
Mini-- Don't "Mini" me, you've been bankrolling my little project from day one
We both agreed murder was out
'd hardly call it murder, if anything, we're just helping to fulfill her last wish
She wouldn't have taken the pills if we hadn't- (urgently) Mini, for gods sake, she still has a pulse
So do people in comas
It's just a matter of time- Mini, we- Look, you can drop the indignant outrage, because if you really cared, you'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now
She's got him and he knows it
(softening) Can't we just admit how lucky we are
It's the perfect alibi, she put the drugs in her system
What
Just leave her here
() 62
: (3) Exactly
don't know
Can you think of one person she knows who would say she's sane at this point
This is just the natural, sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life
artin ponders the choice
We're this close from being free
let's just let nature take its course
-
Mini and Martin sit watching a game show called Absolutely Positive
And so we passed the time watching my favorite show
: comes out on stage to the applause of the audience
Welcome to "Absolutely Positive
" The show where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure they're
He puts a hand to his ear, encouraging the studio audience
Absolutely Positive
That's right
We send them out on one last date with someone other than their fiance, so they can be sure they're really ready to make that lifelong commitment
() 63
: (
) Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my birthday, produces it and it's so twisted, 'm surprised didn't think of it
On the screen, the host introduces  , who nervously walk out to the studio applause
(
) Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up
The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiances
Then the   are brought out to sit on either side of the couple
Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking than the engaged couple
-
Mini checks Diane's pulse
(
) And we waited some more
-
Martin sits on the couch
He looks up as Mini comes in from the bathroom, shaking her head "no", indicating she's not dead yet
-
Mini checks Diane's pulse again
(
) Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last act of free will
- The 11 'clock news is starting, as Mini impatiently looks towards the hallway leading to the bathroom
(
) Finally, it was time to do the only humane thing
Mini stands up
() 64
: Come on, let's go
What
It's time to speed this up
Speed this up
We can't wait anymore, our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour
We can say that after dinner we went to a movie, but if she hasn't croaked by midnight, you can forget about this
Martin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the implications of "speed this up"
No, 'm sorry, this is going somewhere 'm not prepared to go
Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in hate to break it to you, but wherever you "weren't prepared to go"
the hypocrite express just rolled into the station
Martin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth of his actions
What are you suggesting
Well,  thought we'd disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons
Martin recoils
Kidding
God, you've lost your sense of humor
Don't worry, it'll be painless
() 65
: (2) Martin takes a deep breath, considering his options
'   -
Mini goes through her mother's clothes, as Diane lies crumpled in a heap on the floor
Martin looks on impatiently
(
) To be honest,  think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this
And as my first assisted suicide,  was going to make it flawless Come on, we don't have time
Look, if we're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven
(off his confusion) The gas chamber
(exasperated) Martin, please,  can't explain everything
Mini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length mirror
: Mini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front of her vanity mirror
Martin holds Diane's head still
don't think this is a good idea
Have you lost your mind, "Mr
Public Relations"
What's the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out
(waits for his answer) "How did she look"
Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is "fabulous"
66
- The door to the dark garage opens and Mini turns on a light
Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his shoulder, struggles through the doorway
' -
Mini props Diane up in the driver's seat and begins touching up the make-up
She ties a silk scarf around Diane's neck, ever so elegantly
Satisfied, she turns the ignition key and lowers all the power windows in the car
She looks up at Martin
Well, if you've got anything to say to her, now would be the time
Could you just pretend to have a little remorse
- Mini and Martin walk through the door to the garage and close it behind them
The hum of the car engine can he heard through the wall
- Diane sits in the driver's seat, as    spews fumes into the sealed garage
-
The garage door is open and Diane's body is visible on the garage floor as Martin and Mini kneel beside her
The wail of an ambulance siren is heard as it pulls up in front, cutting the engine
Mini comes running outside in tears
Help us, please
My mom,  think she's dead
-
try to revive Diane, having laid her out on the floor of the garage
Mini sobs hysterically, as Martin hugs her
Mommy, wake up
() 67
: It's okay, sweetheart, everything's going to be okay
Mr
Tannen,  think you should take your daughter in the house
Oh, please, don't let her die
-
Two   are parked outside as Diane's body, now wrapped in a body bag, is being wheeled into the ambulance
" " are standing at the gates to the house, interested to see what's happened
-
One of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in the background, as Martin continues to comfort Mini
, 30, with a slightly weary look, walks in the front door wearing an off-the-rack grey suit and barber shop haircut
Mr
Tannen
Martin looks up
Yes
'm Detective Bill Garson,
Yes
'm sorry to be here right now, but whenever there's an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to rule out homicide
(clearly surprised) Oh
uh
right
It's really just a formality
() 68
: (exploding) My mother just killed herself
They haven't even taken her away yet
What's wrong with you
Mini, please
He's just doing his job
Tell him to leave
This is outrageous
(to Garson) Could we do this another time
Of course we-- Thank you
Mini looks at Martin, relieved
But  do need to ask just a few simple questions before  go
Didn't you hear him
He said-- (sharply) Mini, it's okay
just go lie down for a moment
-
Martin stands in the garage with Garson, going over what happened
So after dinner and the movie, we came home at around 11:30 and found her in the garage
turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust
() 69
: What about trying to revive your wife
Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question
Of course, we did that too, but couldn't feel a pulse
Mini took a course at school in  and tried that, but
(taking a breath) it didn't work
So your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call
Yes
May  ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state
We never thought she'd do anything like
this
After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and  just needed a break
It's been a very stressful time
Of course
So this was your wife's car
Yes
Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in
What
Was it in the garage when you left
() 70
: (2) (a little flustered) Is, is that important
Just trying to reconstruct what happened
Oh, well
after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage
And no one drove it during those three days
No, Mini and  have our own cars
We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab
Crime lab
Oh, okay
Again, purely routine
Sure
Have you found a note yet
(confused) 'm sorry
Garson's eyes flicker for a split second
suicide note
The deceased usually leaves one
Oh
right, no
not yet
But we haven't really looked
() 71
: (3) Mind if  take a look around
Martin hesitates for just a split second
No
of course not
' -
Mini and Martin whisper together
Who cares if we didn't leave a note
Just relax
But they said it's-- So what
He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead
(remembering something) Oh, shit
What
The sweatsuits and goggles
already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans
(exhaling) Good
Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we're free
-   - Martin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort
() 72
: (
) After the funeral,  felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time
-
artin tips the   on the way out and the moment the door closes, Mini jumps into his arms
(
) Martin agreed and let me pick the place
chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that's where Dudley Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten
- Martin spreads sun tan lotion on Mini's back
(
) figured sugar daddy/younger woman would be old news down there
few other  /  couples lounge near them, mixed among more traditional pairings
/  - play a sexy Mexican ballad as Mini, wearing a thin sundress, dances very close with Martin
(
) could feel that Martin had let the whole thing with the cops go
It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago
- Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair
They both stare up at the stars
The gentle breaking of waves further adds to the tranquility of the evening
You know, 've been thinking that might enjoy working in your office this summer
() 73
: Really
Sure, if you want
want
She moves to kiss him
(
) Martin, Mini
Is that you
Martin and Mini look up to see  , their producer neighbor, peering at them in the dark
He has an arm wrapped around the waist of    who is clearly Playmate material
(
) swear  thought Martin was going to wet himself
Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent father/daughter closeness
(extremely tense) Oh
hi, Mike, what, what are you doing here
udell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter they were lying
Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little &, and  suddenly realized  hadn't taken a vacation in god knows when
Jennifer, this is my neighbor Martin Tannen and his daughter, Mini
Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand
She looks equally uncomfortable
'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met
You look so familiar
Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile
don't think so
() 74
: (2) (
) And the icing is that Jennifer works for the same escort service that  did
Now this is rich
wanted you both to know how sorry am for your loss
(
) Our loss
He just lost six or seven freebies a year
If there's anything  can do
(to Mini) for either of you
(
) Yikes, now that Mom's out of the way,  guess 'm fair game
don't hesitate to ask
Remember 'm just right across the fence
The meaning is not lost on Martin
(measured) Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it
-
Martin paces back and forth as Mini sits on the bed
His neck muscles bulge with frustration
Why did you tell him
was just being friendly,  had no idea he'd decide to come here
He knows
He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows
doubt he even knows where his trash cans are
() () 75
:             (') You're overreacting
It's just coincidence
Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us together
It was dark,  sat up before he saw anything No, he knows
It was like he was toying with us
Just relax, what is he going to do
Go home and tell everyone we're a couple
We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers
Martin stops and looks at her, surprised
Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward
His face turns a little red
'm not jealous or anything,  just think it's funny
Talk about six degrees of penetration
Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed
You realize he could blackmail us
If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine
Martin, please, calm down
Trust me, nothing is going to happen
Her words don't appear to have calmed him
76
- Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy
From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini
(
) The next few days were a laugh riot
Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously
Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth
He instinctively pulls back
(
) Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father
Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them
Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference
'   - Mini and Martin sit watching
Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive
Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes channels
Mini looks very annoyed
(
) We returned home and things didn't get much better
: Mini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror: -Catholic School girl
(
) What little sex we were having    was getting dull
-Cheerleader
(
) Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed
-Naughty Nurse
() 77
: (
) was bored
became concerned that in my world of firsts  had achieved my greatest first
-French Maid
(
) at too young an age
-Marilyn Monroe in the sequined dress she sang to  in
(singing breathily) "Happy birthday, Mr
President" (
) As for school, well,  was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death
Mini looks towards the hallway
-
Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress
Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down
Mini hides her surprise well
(
) Uh oh
Yes
Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, don't know if you remember me
Drogues, my last name is Drogues
And "yes",  remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm
(ignoring her dig) So, Mr
Tannen is your stepfather
() 78
: Nice work, McGruff
Again,  am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible
What do you want
need to ask you a few more questions about your mother's death Sure, come on in
- Mini leads him in
(
) know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation
could feel something tingle deep inside
Mini and Garson take a seat
Mini lights a cigarette
Garson looks over her outfit again
It's a little early for the prom, isn't it
girl can dream, can't she
Perfectly legal
So, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report
Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust
Is it that important
() 79
: Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods
Her choices seemed, don't know how to put it
improvisational
Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her
She clearly put some thought into that outfit
Clearly
But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out
doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them
suppose you're right
Also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12
It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer
Really
Any idea why she'd call 911
(
) Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing 've done in a while, but even  know when the rush isn't worth the risk
Look,  think you should come back when my father's around
He'll be upset  let a stranger in the house think you're safe with me
() 80
: (2) Even so, he won't be happy
Not a problem, will he be home tonight
'  - Martin is on the phone
And you let him in
- Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone, while sucking on a red popsicle
played it cool, it would've looked worse to be defensive
Mini looks across the yard to see
looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home
He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting
His eyes are locked on hers
(
) Well, when's he coming over
Tonight
(
) Tonight
've got a dinner with Chapman
've already cancelled-- (frustrated) Damn it
Why didn't you call me
allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze, revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers
He's in good shape for a man his age
(annoyed) Hey,  didn't know you had plans
Mini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her bikini top
() 81
: (
) Listen, 'll be home early so we can get the story straight
Okay
Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth
- Martin and Mini sit across from Garson
Martin appears cool and relaxed, a scotch in his hand
really appreciate you taking the time to help us out
There's just a few loose ends we want to tie up
Absolutely
What would you like to know
Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report
He starts leafing through papers
There appears to be some question as to the time of death
You said you went to dinner and a movie- Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do  need my lawyer here
Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation
Mr
Tannen, 'd really like to just finish this up, 've got real homicides that need attention
How about if  just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip
That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad
mean, let's just get this over with
() 82
: Martin looks at Mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second
Fair enough
Terrific
now, the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system
Mini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad
wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin
Neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it
Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, 'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription
know, but it's an odd drug to be taking
It's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them
But in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated
Again, Detective,  really can't say why she was taking these drugs
Fair enough
Mr
Tannen, were you and your wife close
No
we led, for the most part, separate lives
We had decided to stay together for Mini
() 83
: (2) (
) oh
sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit of the child
Excellent
see
Listen, Detective Garson,  must admit  don't see the relevance of these questions
Diane was an extremely disturbed person
Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst
Yes, but what 'm still unclear about is her time of death
Well, that makes two of us
Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening
(looking at his notes) After dinner you saw a movie that night
That's right
(
) Start time 9 o'clock
What did you see
That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore
(
) Running time 115 minutes
Ahh
My buddy told me the end is crazy
() 84
: (3) (
) For god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it
Yeah, he slides down Washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him
Dad
Don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet
Martin turns to Mini, giving her a fatherly smile
Another demerit
Mini rolls her eyes at Garson
That's okay
Where did you see it
The Galleria
(
) Drive time 17 minutes
And you got home at
(
) Precisely
11:30
(
) With 12 minutes of previews
You didn't think we'd forget the previews
Now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night
No, that about wraps it up for now
() 85
: (4) For now
Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up
We've told you everything we know wish  could be more definitive
Well, 'm telling you the next time you have a question, it had better be because you're charging us- Us
Martin momentarily freezes
'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives
(standing) Thanks again for your time
-
Mini sits in a chair as Martin paces
What the hell was  thinking, letting you talk me into this
It's probably just routine stuff
That was not routine, my dear
Nice use of the word "us", by the way
Sorry, it just slipped out
() 86
: If  had a nickel for every time heard that- (sharply) Okay
Look, just chill, 'm sure this will blow over in a few days
Chill
Believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out
You do understand they could go for the death penalty
He's probably just trying to spook us
Hello
They don't try and spook you unless they think you did it
It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't
(seething) Well, if it was such a great plan, why am  cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide
Mini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside
'll see you later
Where are you going
Out
87
- The club is packed with    gyrating to the pulsating beat
Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively with a
(
) Would he follow
His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other
As she straddles him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in ecstasy
As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room
stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen
(
) Was there any question
Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not
Martin watches as Mini leans in and in   gives her partner a deep, long kiss
looks ill
'  - Mini's car pulls into the driveway
She gets out, looking rumpled
-
Mini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a bathrobe
He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee
Mini opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking a big slug
phone call would have been appreciated at some point
was worried
(
) Worried that refugee from a
Lo video rode me `til the tires fell off
() 88
: Uh
Martin, 'm not sure you're aware, but at this point you can't be my dad and my lover
Where  go and how late  stay out is my business
wasn't saying that as a dad
(very sincere) Before your mother and
grew apart,  would worry if she was out late
Well, that's sweet, but 'm not her and  can assure you  won't end up passed out in some greaseball's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles
(cold, smooth) nless  choose to
What the hell's gotten into you just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me
Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else
(
) kind of have to admire this
He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists
Haven't you ever been in a relationship
The questions hangs in the air
Mini looks down, almost ashamed
My god, you haven't
She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up
Congratulations
(sniffling) you're my first
() 89
: (2) He comes over and gives her a very sweet hug
Oh, angel
(
) And 'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, "Free Tibet"
- Martin rides up in the elevator with other
His eyes look tired from staying up all night
(
) Fake tears aside
he actually was my first relationship
Which, in itself, was significant, because had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts,  would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms
'  - He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: ", ,  & "
(
) And  was willing to give him the chance to be that person
He reaches his desk, where his  , , is waiting with an envelope
(
) if he could just hold it together
Morning, Lois
Mr
Tannen, this just arrived for you
She hands him a manila envelope marked " - "
He takes it from her and walks into his office, sitting down
He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy photo of: () 90
: The caption reads: "    "
(
) That's when things started to get interesting
Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes
He examines
There is a   , but no return address
'  -
Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell
Lois,  need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting
(listening) know
Tell him
tell him it's an unavoidable emergency
- Martin stands at the front desk, talking to
What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are
When it's paid cash, we only keep records on packages, not envelopes
- Martin walks outside, frustrated
His cell goes off and he answers it
Yeah
(
) Mr
Tannen,  just spoke to Mr
Chapman
he told me to tell you that he's going to be seeking a new firm to handle his company's needs
Martin's jaw tightens
() 91
: Thank you, Lois
Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building: Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control
'  -
Martin walks into the office to find his partners, and   waiting for him
Martin looks surprised and concerned
Steve
Charlie
What, what are you doing in town
Why didn't you tell me you were coming-- We just heard about Chapman
not that it matters
We can't afford to lose any more clients
The color drains from Martin's face
Jesus, guys, my wife just committed suicide
No one's saying this isn't a difficult time for you, but whatever's been distracting you started long before that
There's just no way to sugarcoat this
you're a liability we can't afford anymore
Martin sits very still, his world crumbling around him
Fifteen years
we've been-- () 92
: (curtly) We'll be asking all our clients who they would prefer to stay with, and of course, you'll have an equal shot to make your case with them
Martin continues to stare off into space, reeling
'  -
Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen
The veins in his neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead
Suddenly, he starts pounding on the steering wheel
Fucking shit
Fucking shit
Fucking shit
Just then, he looks over to the next car
three year old in the back seat holds up her ""   to show him
:      ' - Through a ' : Rudell is seen through the window talking on the phone, unaware he's being watched
(
) Look at that smug prick
He's fucking with me and  will not be fucked with
'  - Martin and Mini stand in the dark kitchen, as Martin peers out the window through binoculars at  across the yard
What are you gonna do
Martin goes to a drawer and removes the   they bought at Williams Sonoma
'm gonna go over there and tell him to back off or he's gonna get hurt
() 93
: Are you crazy
We're not even positive it's him
My god, the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office
He was the only person at the resort who knew who we were
He could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him, then they'd really start investigating us
It's just one photo and you can't even really tell if it's me
That son of bitch just cost me the firm  worked fifteen years to build
Well, if you start waving that thing around, he's gonna cost you a lot more than that
-
Mini lies awake, looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and shifting in bed
(
) Martin didn't sleep at all that night and made damn well sure didn't either
'  - Mini walks up the long driveway
(
) With Mommy Dearest out of the way, decided to take the matter of Rudell into my own hands
knew Martin wouldn't approve, but at this point
action had to be taken
She arrives at the front door and rings the bell
() 94
: (
) would catch him off guard, disorient him and then kill him
The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush bathrobe
(
) with kindness
Hi, Mr
Rudell, 'm sorry to bother you
Not at all, as  said down in Mexico
(slightly lascivious) anything for a neighbor
May  come in
'    - Eighteen foot ceilings frame the room, garishly decorated with very modern, modular furniture
Rudell leads Mini in
Wow,  haven't been here since you redecorated
It was just finished
'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed
know she'd approve
If you don't mind me asking,
how are you doing
It's been hard, but  guess 've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now
You're absolutely- () 95
: Positive
Mini giggles, almost embarrassed
(chuckling) Well, that too, but "correct" was the word  was thinking of
Do you like the show
Oh, god, it's my favorite
love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together
could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant
contestant
Really
Sure, those dates are really quite harmless
You just spend an evening with the person
We prep you on what to say before the show
It sounds like fun
Rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her
Mini, keenly aware, blushes
Anyway, what's on your mind
Well, um
this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately
No, is everything okay
Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and  together
() 96
: (2) Together
It indicated that we were
know this sounds crazy, but
a couple
couple
You and Martin
Hmmm mean, certainly older men and younger women are an (searching again) accepted part of society, but for someone to do that, well
it's just tasteless
Exactly, so we're just trying to figure who Rit could be
Hmm,  haven't noticed anyone at all
Out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together
Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything
mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step- father
Of course
'  -
Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini flirts shamelessly with him
(
) Much to my surprise,  was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage
'   -
Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers
He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair
() 97
: (
) knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time
'   -
Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio
He stands behind her, wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the swing
(
) And the one undeniable fact  had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life
'  -
Rudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip cream
(
) than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to
He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose
Mini reaches over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean
Rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes
(
) Frankly, 'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there
'   -
Mini walks out, skipping down the path, singing "The Candy Man" to herself
"Who can take tomorrow
Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can" () 98
: (
) left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon, had turned Rudell into a trout on a line
and he'd follow me anywhere tugged the pole
(singing) "The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
" '   - Mini walks down the corridor with Kayla
(
) The photos stopped coming and although Martin was freaking out about his business, things were returning to normal
even decided to return to school
They approach , the football player she humiliated earlier
Mini raises two fingers to her mouth in a "", simulating cunnilingus, taunting Troy
His friends laugh and he wilts, pretending he didn't see her
-
Mini and Kayla walk in with other students
Her teacher, Warren Bishop, comes over to her immediately
Mini, 've got a message for you to go to the principal's office right away
'  -
Mini is led in by  , as Detective Garson sits in a chair next to   , 50
(
) Then things got interesting again
Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the appropriate concerned tone
() 99
: Detective Garson, is everything all right
:
black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's hallways is seen
(
) Mini, this tape was shot a week before your mother's death
The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse Hauptfuhrer walks out
(
) The next day, the school nurse reported two bottles of Ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet
few seconds later, Mini is seen entering the nurse's office, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw her
, then fast forwards
Mini is seen leaving the office, stuffing something in her pocket
- and  sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner, as Garson puts down the remote and looks at Mini
Principal Andrews is not pleased
We've lifted two prints from the door and the inside of the medicine cabinet
They don't match the nurse
Mini, is there something you'd like to say to Detective Garson
Mini eyes remain calm
Can we see the tape of the Der Fuhrer sucking down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have cameras in the bathroom stalls
() 100
: Young lady, stealing anything, especially prescription drugs is a serious matter
Mini looks at Andrews, her eyes suddenly starting to tear up
You got me, okay
But what was supposed to do
What do you mean
(suddenly hysterical) She
She said if  didn't, she was
was gonna-- Who
Another student
My mother
She made me steal them for her
didn't want to, but she said she was going to send me to boarding school in Canada if didn't Canada
(sobbing) The Yukon territories
Are you happy, now
You got me
Oh my lord,  had know idea, she was-- An addict
Detective Garson knew
We told him, and now what
The whole school's gonna know
Mini hides her face in her hands
She's dead, my mommy's dead
Can't we just leave her be
() 101
: (2) Andrews casts a harsh glance at a frustrated Garson
Detective Garson,  assume, there won't be a need to press charges against Ms
Drogues
Mini holds out her wrists to Garson
(sniffling) You gonna cuff me, Copper
Garson looks at Mini, clearly not convinced of her innocence
She's free to go
'   - Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby
and    approach him
Martin looks a little unnerved to see them
Ah, Mr
Tannen, we were just coming up to see you
Have you got a minute
Detective,  told you no more questions without my lawyer
think you'd better call him
-
Martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, , an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair
Garson sits across from them
There's a small discrepancy that can't quite figure out and  was hoping you might be able to explain it
suppose  can try
() 102
: The final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills
She wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her
Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update- Martin, easy
'm sorry, but this is harassment
See, here's what  needed to ask you
The gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used
And
Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her
An unconscious person can't turn on a car, right
Detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point
Well, here's where  get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas
Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay
So, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours
Is there
He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer
() 103
: (2) So,  guess what 'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car
Martin, don't say anything
Now, Mr
Tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but 've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship
Again, Detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse
'd like Mr
Tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, 'd be careful
The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town
Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn, whispers back
Does this mean he's offering Mr
Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter
Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for his answer
It's a strong possibility
But he wants Mr
Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't
No manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing
Martin's eyes shift slightly
104
- Garson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and her lawyer,  , who doesn't look nearly as confident as Martin's lawyer
It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick
Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve
(nervously) Uh
Miss Drogues, as your lawyer- Don't wet your pants,  know when to shut up and swallow
Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin
my tongue
Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation
Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin
So you want me to say it was his idea
If it was his idea, give me one reason you should take the fall
(
) At that moment  knew we had him
If he was trying to get me to rat on Martin, he didn't have enough to charge either one of us
() 105
: So if  tell the jury it was his idea and  was scared for my life, because he said he'd kill me if ever told anyone, then  walk
Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair, just a bit
Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching
She looks around the room, weighing her options
Pelham attempts to whisper something in her ear
She waves him off
Sorry, sport, but 'll take my chances
'  -
Mini and Martin drive home together
There is an icy chill between them, as Martin looks over at Mini
never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm
Not a second
hope you know that
Oh,  knew
knew
Good
You realize, we've got to rely on each other
Who else do we have
Exactly
We're almost home free
My lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell
've only got one concern now
What
Rudell
If a jury knew we were a couple, we've both got a motive and that changes everything
Mini puts her hand on Martin's, reassuringly
() 106
: Baby, don't worry about him, he's just jealous 'cause you've still got rockin' abs and a better hairline
Martin looks over at her, softening
Even if he did send that picture, what does it prove
Nothing
- Mini walks through the mall
(
) For all of Martin's talk of relying on each other
follows about a hundred yards behind
(
) Garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of distrust
turns around and Martin ducks into a boutique
- Mini walks out of a movie theater, with Kayla and
(
) Our relationship had turned into what some might call
few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing dark glasses and a hat
He follows them
(
) unhealthy
- Mini sits in front of the , watching a commercial
She is wearing the same "Fuct" -shirt she wore when we first met her
Her eyes are filled with anticipation
(
) Something had to give, and ironically enough, it was the night was making my television debut
() () 107
:             (') had asked Martin to be home by eight for a big surprise
Martin walks in the front door with his briefcase
Oh, hey, come and watch
You're missing me, 'm on
What
Why
Hurry up, the commercial's almost over
Martin walks over
:
Absolutely Positive
Comes back on and we see that  and are sitting on either side of this show's Mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better looking than the engaged couple, both of whom have a midwestern wholesomeness
'  turns white
turns to the camera
Welcome back to Absolutely Positive
Now it's time to hear how the date between Jason and Mini ended
You
You went on- Yeah,  thought it'd be a gas
now shhh
: Jason, you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation
() 108
: (a bit nervous) Well, since Becky and  have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how would react
You know, whether there'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision
So, after dinner, what happened
Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew
'm not really a good dancer, but  said "yes
" (hurt) We never go dancing
Jason smiles at her uncomfortably
So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer
Well, he's a damn quick learner, and not just at dancing
shoots a look at Mini Martin, for god's sake, that was their line
You think  talk like that
: Oh, really
So there was some other teacher-student stuff going on
(uncomfortable) Uh, no, not really- () 109
: (2) Oh, come on, what about when we went back to your place
You what
,  don't know what she's talking about
Come on, don't be bashful
He put on some soft music and- No
This isn't true, why are you- We started kissing and- Jason
(to Mini) Shut up
But, Jay-Jay, it was really special
(to the host) He loves to be called "Jay-Jay"
You, you
Let me tell you, Becky, you're in for a wild ride from this Bronco
: staring at Mini
() 110
: (3) Did, did you
(
) You slept with her
God, Martin, it was a one time thing
He was a virgin, how could say "no"
Believe me, she'll thank me after their wedding night
You had me come home early to- Don't be jealous
It won't happen again
It was just a goof
Martin stands there, speechless, while   : dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her
Suddenly, she runs off stage
picks up the remote and hits "mute"
Rudell
He let you go on
Yeah,  thought it would be fun wasn't really supposed to, you know, "go all the way" but- can't believe you
th-that couple, you ruined their relationship
Excuse me, but the show is called Absolutely Positive for a reason
Clearly, the only thing Jason was positive about was- You're a sick little twist, you know that
Well, what does that make you
() 111
: (4) (heading outside) need some air
Oh, by the way, some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something
It's on the desk
Martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked " "
He opens it to find
8x11  of him and Mini kissing passionately on the beach in Mexico
This time there is no question as to the nature of their relationship
Scrawled across the bottom in black marker is: ", '    "
Martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting in
What is it
Martin slowly holds it up for her to see
Oh, my god
(very evenly) think it's time  had a little chat with our neighbor No, this is exactly what he wants
What if he's working with Garson
Then he can't blackmail me
Wait here, 'll be right back
Martin heads for the back door
No, please, don't do this
Let me go with you
said wait here
Mini jumps up and runs over to him, grabbing his wrist
() 112
: (5) Don't do this, we can leave tonight
We'll drive to Mexico
Martin looks up at her
He'll never leave us alone, you realize that
No
Let me talk to him, he promised me he wouldn't hurt us
He did
When
few days ago
You saw him
went to try and find out what he knew
spent the afternoon with him- You
spen- was doing it for us
figured he wouldn't turn us in if
If you
If  made him think  was
interested
wave of nausea washes over Martin's face
And was he
Mini nods
Please tell me you didn't
() 113
: (6) Mini hesitates
No
Martin looks unconvinced
just made him think  would, so he wouldn't turn us in
When Animals Attack comes on the  in the background
(sarcastically) Thank you,  appreciate your restraint
Fuck you
'd think you'd be a little more appreciative
Who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid
Huh
Who was that selfless act for
Oh, like you're such a martyr for being faithful
It shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter
Don't lecture me about fidelity
Your mother was cheating within six months of the " do's"
He heads for the door again
Now, if you'll excuse me
Mini grabs him again, desperate
Please-- Look, 'm sorry,  really am, but this isn't the answer
Martin grabs her wrist, forcefully
() 114
: (7) You're hurting me
(through his teeth) Calm down or 'll snap it in two, do you hear me
Mini nods her head
Now,  want you to wait here for me
Do you understand
Mini nods again
(softly) Please don't do this
He lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard
Mini watches him go
'  -
Martin stands outside and rings the bell
The door opens and Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas
He looks Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's "Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background
Martin, what a surprise, how are you
Just watched Mini on your show
Ahh
was tonight the night
We taped that two weeks ago
Let me tell you,  have girls audition all the time for me and
(enjoying this) She was fucking incredible
Rudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction
natural, huh
() 115
: Like a duck to water
and totally willing to take direction
Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife in him
wish all the girls  worked with had her
how can  put this
Need to please
You son of a bitch
Martin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him staggering backwards inside
(
) "Let's take it nice and easy
" '   - Mini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone
She looks out   at the fight beginning in Rudell's house
(frantic) Yes, hello, you've got to send a police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane right away
My father's gone crazy, think he's going to hurt our neighbor
yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry
'   - Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar
Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face
(
) "Hey, baby, what's your hurry
Relax, don't you worry
" Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him
Rudell crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces
Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table
() 116
: He rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it
Martin crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him
Martin grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him
The two men grapple on the floor
Where are they
Huh
What are you talk- Don't fuck with me
The negatives
What
'    - Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio
Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green
(
) "The problem now of course is, to simply hold your horses
" Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs
Martin catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes
Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another
(
) "To rush would be a crime
" Rudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after another
You son of a bitch
How's that feel
You like that
You thought you could have my wife and my daughter too
(
) "`Cause nice and easy does it, nice and easy does it
" Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head around so he can look him in the eye
In the distance a is heard getting closer
() 117
: Sorry, pal, she's mine
Diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas, but not her
Not her
Martin smashes his face into the patio
Rudell lets out a moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs don't obey him
Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising it with both hands above his head for a final swing
Now tell me where they are or swear to god, 'll crack your head open
(
) Martin, don't
He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks, standing ten feet away
The  suddenly stop
Go look for the negatives
No
This is insane
We need the negatives
He raises the club again
Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm before it comes down
You're gonna kill him
He tries to pull the club away
What are you doing
He'll tell everyone
(
) Freeze, police
Martin turns around to see    with their guns drawn
Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his face covered in blood
He looks at his own blood-soaked clothes, the reality hitting him
() 118
: (2) Drop the club and put your hands up
Martin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second officer
The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him on the ground
Thank God
Thank God, you came
Mini, you called them
How could you call them
Mini buries her face in the officer's chest
He's
he's crazy,  told him not to
told him to stop
(
) "Nice and easy does it
every time
" : - Mini emerges from the station with her lawyer as a throng of jostle for a photo
(
) Needless to say, my appearance on Absolutely Positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town
: Mini at Martin's trial sitting in the front row
(
) The trial was quick
Once Mom's affair with Rudell came out, the realized he had a motive and a slam dunk
, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye towards Martin and then reads the verdict
Guilty
() 119
: Martin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs behind him
(
) Since, Rudell was in a coma, the issue of my relationship with Martin was moot
Martin realized trying to pin anything on me would probably get him the chair
- Martin, wearing an   , is led into a van by a
(
) At his sentencing  begged for leniency
He got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life for mom's death
'  - Mini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn, snapping photos
Dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up next to the front door
(
) The outpouring of support was amazing
hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door
She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other bags full
- The sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes convertible with the top down
(
) Martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since  was eighteen, was allowed to live by myself
She turns down another road at a sign reading " , 5 "
120
- Mini and Martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier
There are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy
'm sorry  forgot to bring that book you wanted
It's okay, Myou can mail it
Are you okay
You look like you haven't showered in days
(disturbed) Well
uh
you have to be careful about sh-
So how's school
(excited) You'll never guess what happened
What
was voted valedictorian
But don't you have to be- The best student
know
But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss
(smiling sadly) wonder how the real valedictorian feels
Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor
() 121
: Is Rudell out of his coma yet
don't know, why
Why
(taken aback) Mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures
(nonchalant) Oh
wouldn't worry about that
But if the
got those pictures, you could- 'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them
He looks suddenly very worried
Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet
Because 've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that
Help us
They know people on the outside we could
pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you
Oh, gosh, that's so romantic
It's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but 'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet
What
() 122
: (2) Mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines Martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo
Oh
wow, like  thought you were just playing along `cause 'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know
Martin furrows his brow, confused
Rudell didn't send those pictures
He suddenly becomes very still, as Mini's lips curl in a thin smile
You remember, Aurelio
Martin looks at her blankly
Our cabana boy from Mexico
Suddenly, it hits him
He looks almost nauseous
What a sweetie,  thought  might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough
His knuckles tighten around the phone
You
you
It was pretty clear Garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us
It just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering
Martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black
Oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first
you know 'm right
The veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone
() 123
: (3) (suddenly switching gears) Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question,  thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex
Martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths
They don't tap these lines, do they
(looking around) think  might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing
you ready
Guard
No
Are you sure
won't be able to come back for a few weeks
(mock jealous) Wait, have you met someone in here
Guard
Why, you old dog
knew you wouldn't be single in here for long
appears behind Martin's stall
Guard
She did it
She just admitted it
It was her idea
guess this means  could start dating around too
Don't let her leave
She's guilty
Get the warden
Okay, that's enough
() 124
: (4) The guard moves to take the phone from him
Martin clutches it to his head
You bitch
You little whore
(starting to cry) Daddy, why are you saying those things
The guard struggles to rip the phone away, but Martin holds on for dear life
'm gonna kill you
Do you hear me, you little bitch
(sobbing) Daddy, stop
love you
Don't say that
love you
Finally, the guard smashes Martin with a billy club, sending him sprawling on the floor
Martin screams behind the glass, but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him away by his feet
- in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as  sit in the audience, fanning themselves with programs
Mini stands at the dais, addressing the class
(
) As many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult
don't know how would have gotten through it without all of you
really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that  stand before you today, as the first straight "" student in school history voted Valedictorian
go up from the rowdier students
(') () () 125
: Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and  want to wish him a speedy recovery
spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall
polite smattering of applause is heard
While  may not have excelled in the classroom,  think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call "life", have taught me a few lessons that 'd like to share with my fellow graduates
Her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen
Follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go
Trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine
Principal Andrews nods in approval
But as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents
Don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love
few  look almost surprised to hear positive things said about them
(voice breaking) And  mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service
Really do it
Whenever you can
(holding back tears) () () 126
: (2)      (') know  did, and  just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech  could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here
in front of all of you
Thank you and good luck
Mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as moves quickly to console her
(
) (') Like  promised, no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular, no Shakespeare shoved up your ass
'   give her a standing ovation
few become misty-eyed
(
) (') And in case you're feeling guilty about having no one to identify with but me, relax
looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden sunlight
(
) (') There's a first time for everything
