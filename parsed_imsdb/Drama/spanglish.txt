-   -   -        1 shape fills the lower portion of the screen
It is a man's back
a perfect back
good dark color, slim, muscular
a song
if you understood the words you would hear love confronted and considered in a very specific way
We are in a Mexico City suburb
The day is hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the first indication that we are in slow motion
Perfect red fingernails come into view
and now a woman's hand goes beautifully to work
part sensual back scratch, part massage
The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down -- and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down his upper body
: Full titles, minute after minute of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30 minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and rub, the man making sounds of pleasure
The hand is getting tired
Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work
The unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as The new hand, wearing a wedding ring, goes to work then it too stops to rest
the man says something in Spanish
important for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue
She replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty laugh, that her hands are tired
We understand
The man tells her to continue
She continues, the rub now desultory and resentful
She stops for another rest
The man wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view for the first time
She says, in Spanish, with no particular anger, "you said you would never push me around again
If you do,  will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you want
" (: All Spanish dialogue will be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish speaking
working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc
) For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue
Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in Spanish
This is no longer a massage we envy
This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of their marriage

/   -                    2 Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road
We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word, 2
"Cristina
" When the man protests her stopping she indicates they should both run and meet their daughter
He waves her off
Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room

-                                       3 As , six years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down
She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to pull out an English book which she displays with pride
Now she steps down from the bus and, as she walks  , narration begins
The voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see
To Princeton University's Director of Admissions: In considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself
And, as a clever high school graduate,  of course realize the subtext of this essay about who  am and why  want to enter Princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me
have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a Latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty,  am as good as in if  simply do the dance and work in a word like "bipolarization" every so often
And while  love dances -- this dance of self is one  am afraid to master

-  '  -                    4 drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's
As mother and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man getting out
He nods in another direction calling our attention to a police car parked off the street
The woman does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her father
The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the child has
this is one supportive mom
again she is disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially when the child seems briefly hurt
The woman's husband looks from the window and sees the ominous man coming
The woman now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so she does not see what is transpiring
For my mother, that afternoon eleven years ago was a watershed not because of my father's () 3
(cont'd) imprisonment but because it was my first day at school
5
/ '  -                  5 This room is directly across from the husband's room
The woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches
The man gives her husband some money
all the time the woman is chattering to distract the girl
Looking off --the woman grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money
The undercover cop begins shouting orders
The woman raises her voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles her daughter
There was never any pretense that the gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own
She ignored all her needs and was alive only for me
It was terrific
(a long beat) At the time
As she watches her daughter chew a cookie
Her daughter begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a glow we have not yet seen
And all the while she eyes the action in the next room
Her husband makes a break for the window
The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot
The woman moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her daughter, making much over the kid's new school books
It is an impressive charade
-
And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing, she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the shot
The woman asks her daughter what she learned today
the daughter says she was taught a little English
Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front door where other police await
Her daughter starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her
brandishing the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something

As she clears her throat and says directly into camera
Hi
The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the back of a police car
(Note: Mexican police   duck the perpetrator's head
they just allow the concussion
) It seems the mother will save her child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her father as the car pulls away
The child is stricken
tear starts to form in her eye
Her mother acts quickly
We are about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of will
the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in Spanish
Una lagrima
sola una sola
Haz la mejor possible
"One tear
only one
so make it a good one
" This was my mother's instruction to me
Baffled by the edict
Holding up one finger
That's it
one tear
she means it
As she complies
one great tear forming and falling
Her mother's thumb wipes it away
But now her eyes well with more tears
her mother gestures she must have strength and resolve
and so she does
a toss of her pretty little head
the eyes clear

her dress changing as the days change while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the hall
My mother dealt with our considerable problems of survival by talking
Always she discovered her own best thoughts by sifting through her own words
The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has just solved something and makes a note

'  -       -        10 Each night my mother promised me a wonderful life
Each night looked for a new expressive way to tell my mother how much  loved her
The child is ardent
clutching at her heart

The mother is enormously nervous with the prospect of flight
She sits, the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap, mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug
(to girl) How you doing
(accented English) Hi
How are you
am fine

As they taxi
(to mother) Are you her mother, sister

The mother says, "solo espanol"---"only Spanish
" The daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent flight
Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for their safety
As the plane continues to taxi
We  the mother's prayer in Spanish
She then nudges her daughter
who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same prayer

My mother's prayer for us, which she made me repeat exactly, represented a stunning look into our future

He glances over
this is not lechery, it is art appreciation
an errant but decent man awed by the creature he is drawn to
My mother had redefined her own passions
Blaming herself for the father she gave me, she would never again be lured by a man's rough edges
She had decided that goodness would be her catnip
As she feels him looking at her and turns
With some affection and regret, she shakes her head, "no
" As he mouths the word "ouch

Latin flavored music suddenly gives way to a Texas country harmonica riff

The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant lights

the mother studying a slip of paper
fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime
The child fascinated by all
At the time,  was oblivious to my mother's anguish
She loved and lived to talk
Now, as if by a witch's spell, words were no longer her bridge but her barrier
In a very real sense she feared she had left herself behind
The mother sees something
Joy returns

She begins walking the street asking passers-by for directions in Spanish and is answered

she beams with relief
So far so very, very good

a wedding reception is in progress - -
Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep, explosive smile
music plays and we focus on Cristina, now nearing 12 years of age
dancing with her mother and some other smaller children
The mother eyes the muscular back of a Great Looking Man
who turns, and quickly oozes quality sex appeal
She is turned on
They talk in Spanish
him saying something hushed like, " have been afraid to talk to you
need oxygen when  look at you
" She indicates the six children she is dancing with and offers to include him in some ring around the rosey dance
He indicates the magic of just the two of them
She quickly leads her little flock away
reed-thin     is staring at them
at first the mother thinks this is adorable
the child eyeing her as if he were a man
she indicates he should join the rest of the children for a dance
As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is interested in
Before the mom can do anything about it, he asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts
Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed
the first time held by a male, the first time held close, the first sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male eyes which utterly confuses Cristina
He begins to grind his hips into his dancing partner
Not confused
It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car
only this time the thing to do is scare the car
10
She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts him and throws him to the sidelines
Then pats him on the head maternally and goes back to Cristina
Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene
That quickly it was clear she could no longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night
The following morning she did something about it

they walk past a perfect country club fairway
Grand trees from either side meet each other high over the road

, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt
She is a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific" variety
She is flanked by her mother, , 60, who is drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year old overweight daughter,
who is reading, her grandmother idly holding her hand
In the immediate area more rolls of sod wait to be laid
As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the pool
as they start out
Boink
three stooges retro
those French doors were not open after all
Monica hits first
The women at the pool react
Deborah and Bernice running
Evelyn momentarily attempts to join the rush
she half rises and then thinks better of it
too late in the day for sudden movements
Gee whiz in heaven
How are you
Please

Shut up, Deborah
Now you got it, Mom

Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the kitchen
She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can experience
Here, take these
(second thought) Was that strange to give you money
just felt badly that
It's okay
She pockets the cash

As the group arrives at the outdoor table
Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking hands, nodding, indicating a seat
each simple act a test which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then some
simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her belt
In the background workers roll out sod, the yard becoming more beautiful even as we look
She is my niece
She and her daughter live in the apartment manage
Yolanda, who worked for you, lived there before she went back home
That's how  heard about the job
So who am  interviewing
Her
(forcefully) You're gorgeous
On our gal
as she, not understanding the word, smiles and nods
(translating sotto) Vistosos
Our gal thrown
Not knowing how now to react
She doesn't mean it as a compliment
It's more of an accusation
13
This is my daughter Bernice and this is my mother, Evelyn Norwich
(rising) Excuse me
Glad you're okay
(then to other Latina) Good luck
Our gal smiles back in appreciation
No, stay
this involves you
wouldn't want some kid around for my interview
You understand, Mom
(to Bernice) Strength of character
empathy
big heart
taste for futility - God love you
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass
(then to Bernice) Stop
It's just a conversation - not an interview
Please sit
(to visitors) Don't you want to get out of the sun
She indicates a shaded seat
Deborah is protected by hat, umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine
Underneath Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt emotions
at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable
(  ) (') You guys want some lemonade
(they demur) Let's just talk
have two children
My husband works nights
he's a chef and has his own place
Do you work

(') it was downsized to zip
Okay have two children
like the house to be like me in that 'm very loose and meticulous at the same time
It's all about first names and closeness here but  care about the place, you know
It's what they used to call homemaker
The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look
Which Deborah sees and understands
(') (to Monica) 'm not leaving time for you to translate
Monica says, in Spanish, "this woman is very strange
The only thing  understand is she has two kids
" Deborah leans into Monica
Face to face, tender but unblinking
(') Too bad for you that it just never occurred to you to check on how much Spanish  know
(a solid beat of humiliation then) 'm sorry what  say about you
don't hold it against her
Mom
don't speak any Spanish
But 'm not an idiot -  talk for an hour and you say two words
What did you say
Monica squirms - unusual for her
(') Never mind
You got your nose bopped
got my feelings hurt
Onward
As Monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is for the: (as Deborah continues talking) will major in linguistics and make sociology my sub- concentration
Because it has been my experience that the barriers of () 15
(cont'd) language are more than we dare admit
That, as much as we translate, finally we will never understand each other
My mother's name, for example, beautiful in Spanish, becomes leaden and awful when pronounced by a non-Latin
(  ) What's your name
Llamo
One of my five Spanish words
Flor Moreno
She pronounces Flor in the Latin way
lots of 's with a curling of the tongue sound at the end
Flor
She pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk on

Deborah is beginning to feel criticized
she takes a beat
eyes everyone with some hostility
(directly to Flor) Is there some school of the ear 'm flunking out of right now
Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name
Monica warns Flor to leave it rest
since Deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed
(') What did she say
She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to Deborah
(translating) She says
If you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it
that it's hard for Americans
She says it's great that you try so hard
Many people wouldn't bother
(an emotional pronouncement/her greatest accolade) She gets me
She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile
17
(') You want some lemonade
Take some lemonade
She pours some for Flor and Monica
Then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort: (') Florrrrr
It is perfect
Flor grins at Deborah's victory
claps her hands together
(a Spanish word) Sublime
Deborah feels relief
free for a moment from the dark corridors of self-criticism
She is lighter, prettier, innocent
Wholly and completely attractive
Whew, dense but stubborn, right
Thanks
(an important declaration) What you just did with me is just what kids need
patience and encouragement
Alright, money
Bernice rises like a shot to take off
Goodbye, really
(to Flor) Look forward to seeing you
As she leaves
(absently to Bernie) Love you
(then with not a monoseconds break) the job is six days a week, seven to seven
the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you like
Monica translates
Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness, ducks the question
saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say
" (') No
This is an important question
if you ask for too little it means you don't value 18
yourself
too much and you're taking advantage
(after Monica translates) So
Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it
(extremely heavy accent) One thousand dollars
Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs
others join
Deborah now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her face and shaking her head
As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh, flash four fingers to Flor
Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they should go for six
(firmly) Six hundred dollars
Flor shoots her a look of fear
a tense beat
Welcome to the family
Deborah kisses her
sort of on the mouth
In the midst of Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss

Deborah is wearing a party dress
They are rolling out the last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully manicured backyard
It is hard manual labor involving physical strength
The female caterers are complaining that it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred
(to catering women) We can do it
Come on
She falls over the roll
getting filthy
but it gives and they gain momentum
one of the catering women falling down, one losing pace
Deborah,however, gains the upper hand
Yet, even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself
(') (great exertion) Why
do
care
so
much
about
And now she wins
the cylinder of grass rolls all the way out and she jumps on the seam in victory
She is dirty, spent and triumphant
the components for a solid sexual experience
and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half- heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off
She looks with mother's pride at the lawn
Then sees John
(') Can you believe they left without finishing
As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her grin
half laugh
He loves the dame
20
() (') Looks great, huh
You're not looking
was getting a kick looking at you look at it
Not the answer she wanted
better get dressed again in case anybody's just a half hour late
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or so
all details thought about and done to a ""
This is the outdoor lighting nobody nails
the twinkling of a half acre
the path to the pool like a runway to heaven
As she looks at it all she has a wistful moment
(') (a replenishing sigh) Okay
We're okay here
(then) Why can't everything be like sod
There's no wait, no dung, nothing you have to do right and yet it's perfect
It covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty
then, the miracle, if you just give it time, it roots and you can't tell it from the real thing
(a look to her husband) No reaction
Nothing to say
Huh
Oh sure
, uh
Well, no, don't have anything particular to say
Oh, John why don't you just take out a knife and kill me all together
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit
How'd you get there
Hey, wait a minute
Deb
stop
come on
(she turns) 'd like to figure this one out
What would have been the great thing for me to say after you said the sod sentence
Really
21
That's actually a good question
There you go
surprise sometimes
would have liked, if after compared the sod to life, if you had said, "Exactly
" She turns to leave
Yeah
But to say that and mean it 'd have to think the same way you do
(some sense of mischief) It's worth a try
had something else to tell you
it'll come to me

-                  36 Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant, Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing beside her, bounces with energy and joy
Could we have a table for two, please
Flor says something to her in Spanish
the daughter waves it off and when the mother persists, she translates
(') We're celebrating
Smoking or non-smoking
Before her daughter can translate
Dancing
The hostess laughs
They are seated at the two ends of a banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting and "scootches" closely together
Cristina picks up a menu and points to the prices
Wow, expensive
22
Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a week
then looks at the prices and does a take
The hostess returns --- Cristina points to the menu
(') This is just for the starter
Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places her hand over the prices in the menu
Uh-huh
And those men would like to buy you a drink
The daughter translates
the hostess points out the early 30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen
Flor addresses the men who are several tables away
Cristina moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to translate
(to men) This is very embarrassing but-- "what's wrong with you
'm with my daughter for God's sake
" Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh
Cristina relishes getting back to ordering from the menu
in a moment that is a bit noteworthy
(') And  would like to begin with the Jumbo Shrimp

enjoying the canyon
as she walks the mile plus from the bus stop to work
one of a straggly line of domestics
Deborah jogs into view
Hi, Flor
See you up there
Deborah runs past
She is clearly upset
She is also more than a stay-in-shape jogger
She is an athletic woman fueled by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety
This makes her seriously quick
She is highly aware of passing everybody
She needs to pass everybody
Her voice trails behind her as she announces to all as she approaches
"left, please," "left," "left

, age 9
23
Okay
think  about getting up
You don't have to get up yet but are you thinking seriously about it
Yes
Okay
39

39 Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with the filling and the last cooking process
Some great idea which will have us making a mental note to try it at home
40
-   -                        40 John opens Georgie's door again
Now
Yes
actual up
Georgie gets up
Morning, Dad
Yeah, good morning
You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of what happened
John pauses
aware his answer will have repercussions but integrity wins
No, Georgie, 'm not
Are you mad at me
Uh
okay, no
41
-   -                     41 As Flor enters from outside
Morning, good to see you
24
Morning
Good too
She notices the French Toast
Try some
She demurs
Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula, indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she does
One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open at this kid's ability to make something mundane special
Bernice laughs
(') Thanks
Her mother enters on her way upstairs
She is thoughtful, tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her current demon
She greets Flor and then shakes her head, making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker
Tough day
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b
g
, a named  approaches Flor from behind with a ball in its mouth
Flor is checking out the kitchen
what's in each drawer, etc
Deborah is impressed by the self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice
had an idea for a breakthrough in French toast so  made breakfast don't want to be teased about it
No sarcasm
No tough love
Just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction
Right
mean ol' me
can't play right now
have to do something about your brother
had an idea for a recipe
When has that happened
got up early to do this
At least taste it, for God's sakes
She does
Oh, it's good
oh God, it's rich -- Oh God, it's good
25
(sudden alarm) By the way, you could do without this
The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at her mother
But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her daughter because her attention has been diverted so that Deborah        as the teenager, distraught, moves from the room
( ) (') Never do fetch
Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout stopped her in mid-sentence
(') mean it,
Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst
(') 'm not mad
'm thinking of you
This is me being nice
Then using her hands to demonstrate
(') Just no taking ball from dog
(broadly) Trust me on that one
Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball
(') You and me
We are fine
Just a tip
(she gives her waist a little squeeze) Girlfriends
(Flor is totally confused) Could you make some coffee
Cafe
Yes
Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised
42
-  -   -         42 Deb in the shower
you have never seen so many shampoos, conditioners and bath balms
never seen so huge a sponge
such fluffy towels
26
Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth
There is a fireplace in the bathroom
The only significance of this being that these people have a fireplace in their bathroom
The woman who made it all happen is putting in a contact lens
She is upset
We see that she has one blue eye and one brown
This isn't an argument, honey
Yes
Yes it is
So stop being so maniacally calm
(emphatically) No
it's not
Because  understand your side
can't be wrong about that too
This is a fight
We're having a fight
Yo,  feel anger
Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one blue
She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back to the sink
(') Can  have a moment
John exits into the

-   -                   43 As John awaits his wife
a beat and she enters with two blue eyes
Even though she is attempting reason and self-control her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to borderline yelling
Okay
Let's get someplace here
44
-  -                          44 As Flor works methodically - orienting herself
she is able to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume registers on her a bit - basically she remains blithe
Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where everything is
45
-   -                   45 : You, mister, are crazy making can't take this calm thing you've 27
started doing
It's like this is your way of letting me know there's something deeply wrong with me because 'm not calm
(calmly) Let's not go all over the place
Can't we
(shouted burst) If you're going to talk to me please have the decency to raise your voice
(a beat then sudden urgency and change of tone) Let's make a break for it
What are you talking about
He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large but tentative step away from the spot where he was standing
then additional faster steps
He gestures with enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the room
She eyes him suspiciously
Just for a second
She walks to him
he puts an arm around her shoulder
And gestures back to where they were standing
He talks in an almost hushed, conspiratorial voice
(') We don't have to be those people
Nobody's watching
They've been masquerading as us for a while here
'll distract them - you make a break for it and 'll meet you outside
You're ridiculing me because  care about this
(firmly) No
'm not
mean this
let's get away from those two in case they're as miserable as they look
28
(urging
like a Southern coach) Come on, baby
He is looking at her with wit and conviction
trying to squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love
Deborah looks up at him
intimacy of a different sort
Let me ask you a question
let me change the subject
Forget for a moment that you won't support me with Georgie
(reasonably) Well,  don't think
She makes a noise of frustration to stop him
It   works
John is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct   but he is "man" enough for his jaw to set
to pause for a   beat as he looks her straight in the eye
And walks back to   the spot they occupied previously
(') Go ahead
Here's the question
It's been on my mind more and more
Do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me
(genuinely puzzled) What
Why would
(on her exasperated look) Why would anyone do something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up
(unconvinced/distant) Okay
He hates that look of isolation on her face
He needs to make her feel better
Deb, since high school we've been able to read each other
take advantage of it
The answer to the question is,"absolutely not
" Now take a look and tell me if you believe me
29
She looks at him
with a finger motion he directs her gaze to his eyes
on '
Open, smiling, trusting
Trying to get a laugh out of her
'
Studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted
don't
believe you
think you just want me to feel badly about myself
Sorry, honey
46
-  -                             46 John enters - not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water container and fills a cup
He is shaken
(to himself) Great God in heaven save me
Boy meets girl
Hi
He turns with a start to see Flor smiling at him
Gorgeous squared
His first word is inadvertent
Whoa
whoa
didn't know Deborah had found someone
You work here
You're going to help with the house and kids
Solo espanol
You work here and you don't speak any English at all
The sound of feet on the stairs
Deborah and Georgie enter
All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and press two for Spanish
(even before she enters) Flor
John
(to John enunciating the name) This is Flor
30
(pronouncing it perfectly) Hi, Flor
Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along
(') (to Deborah) Look, 'll take Georgie to school
No
'm doing it
show Flor the ropes
Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and come with her
47
-  -                            47 The biggest, baddest,
there is some subtle custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom
Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with Flor
Fuckin' hombres, huh
She sniffles
Flor nods uncertainly
small voice from the back seat
Georgie
just didn't want to sing last night
' (hurt) Yeah
Well you said you would
You said you wanted to
asked you five times
Then when  have the whole party paying attention you refused
As she puts the car in gear
Georgie sings insanely well
But he's just two lines into an old blues standard: It doesn't do any good now, Georgie
She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid- song
Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a divider between parent and child
But Deborah is calling for her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen
a Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting
" 31
(') 've programmed it for Spanish
Look, it will take you anywhere and then back home
If you figured out how to make coffee on that thing it's all downhill
The    talks about imminent left turns
Flor is thrown by the amount of oddness
All the while Georgie is singing his little heart out in the back seat
Flor,amused by the boy, suppresses a smile
maybe the first time in her life she's had to suppress joy
But Deborah never misses anything
( ) (') This is stop gap
You, kiddo, you're going to have to learn English
48
-                    48 John cooking
the theory that nobody's sexier than when they are seen doing what they do best applies here
In the John's number two, , the Sous Chef, being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and , who spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection for John
At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of art and cloddishness
the hands blur with expertise
but he keeps dropping items
each time a Latin kitchen worker, , 20, dives on the spillage
At one point they bump
Sorry
(sharply to Alex) Not the best place to stand, fella
(to Alex) No
It's me
You're the new helper, huh
didn't mean to
No
no
it's okay
It's me being bugged
Two people head for John almost simultaneously
, an arty looking woman in her late 50's
wild, scraggly gray hair, enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'
You are going to be so happy
The Maitre ' enters
32
' have something very important to tell you
John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman who promised happiness
She hefts her ice chest up on the counter
Perfect cod this is John -- John, perfect cod
Best one 've seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes ago
The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a writer, the right brush stroke for an artist
You get it
Knockout
(to Alex) You want to learn something
You want to pack it away
The kid nods
he picks up the fish
(') Cradle it
Put it in the cooler but not on its side
In the same position it swims
(important added thought) And check the ice pack
make sure it can drain away
if it can't the chlorine can hurt the flesh
Do all that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you
and that's a solid start
First day and you already did something perfect
(smiling) Yes,  understand
' Please
Now
Oh, sorry
forgot
He whispers in John's ear
(') Damn
"ohhhh damn
" What, buddy, what
33
Victor spotted a food critic
From
The New York Times
'll bet they sent her out just for us
(hands John a slip) Here's what she ordered
Look, if you're nervous take a walk
don't need a walk
'll walk with you
know a breathing thing
What do you think 'm worried about
how 'll cook
That's not the problem
(looks at slip/then to Alex) The lady wants fish
Get the fish
He starts to prepare for cooking
(') worked in a kitchen once in New York that got four stars
It was like a line formed for the chance to become an asshole
People's accents changed
The heart went out of the place
You understand
No
(w/barely understated passion) agree with everything you've said
admire you for your feelings
hope to adopt them as my own
As he works
Let's be clear here
this is that sequence that either kicks out or doesn't
no food channel
no simple knife stuff
something casually brilliant
meticulous
smart and gifted as he prepares the critic's meal
34
He is talking quickly
almost to himself
don't know what to root for
the thought of one star makes me nauseous
but with four there's no place to go but, "Oh my God, they took away a star
" (musing) Three
three and a half
That's what you want
No
Wrong
Three and a half you feel disappointed that you just missed out on four
You know what you want
Three and a quarter
(a eureka moment) That would be perfect
(getting off on it) It would mean you're good
but you're not good enough to feel disappointed that you just missed out on excellent
but nothing truly bad happened, you still got your three and a quarter stars
Which encourages you to try and improve
And you still get enough respect so that you can get good people to work with you
Business is good but not crazy
You're right there underneath the radar where you get to mind your own business
That's a solid life
He tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing
(') (with professional honesty and some regret) Aw, man
this is amazing
No three and a quarter here

49 Evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is talking to Bernice in the kitchen also including Flor though she is only catching a word here or there
Well, 'm in the vitamin section and this little hip hop girl
what's her name
Grammys - adorable -- big voice
subtle phrasing
oh, she's famous
the kids know her
oh - little blue shoes
darn me
Flor looks concerned over Evelyn's displeasure with herself, a fact picked up by the older woman
It is actually a small 35
but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the lush and the Latina
(') God Bless the language barrier, it keeps you from being bored with me
Spoken to directly like this, Flor is confused
(') Anyway, she said, "aren't you Evelyn Wright
" First of all, that she recognized me from the old covers and then she
Oh, please her name
it makes the story so much better
She said, (genuinely stirred) "Whenever  think everything is
" (aside) Pardon my French
pardon her French (back to quote) "a mother hmmmhmmm
put on one of your records
" Awwww
How sweet
Evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second
Flor reacts
Bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand
Flor smiles
Just such a lovely thing to come from the blue
Deborah enters, carrying a load of packages
With lightning speed, her eye picks out
the glass her mother is drinking from
Oh, Mother
It's not even noon
(defensively) It's almost two o'clock
God, where is this day going
Flor could you come with me
Grandma, tell Mom what happened
(very deliberately) No
36
Deborah leads the way out
but Flor stops before following her out to give Evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation
50
'  -                            50 John is in Bernie's room - helping her with her homework
They lay at right angles to each other
He is testing her
This is going to work
don't know anything
Free your mind
the president whose policies many consider responsible for the Great Depression
don't know
Name a vacuum cleaner
Okay
Yes
thanks
And this vacuum whooshed all this money out of everyone's pockets
Got it
no longer know nothing
And Hoover was followed in office by
'm just drawing blanks
'm embarrassed
It's my own fault spent my time on math, which 'm lucky if  don't flunk anyway and
The guy we are looking for is not a ruse
What's ruse mean
Phony
So this president was not a ruse
He was the real thing
37
(she looks at him blankly) Ruse
(enjoying her father's absurdity) Rusevelt
If 'd ever heard of the word before - that would lock it in
It's so stupid it might work anyway
Deborah enters followed by Flor
They are carrying several boxes of clothes
Surprise new clothes
Bernie gasps
As she looks at a sweater
What'd  do right
Warehouse sale
Bernice tries on the sweater over her -shirt
and mirth ends
The sweater is tight
Bernice picks up a blouse and then skirt and checks the size
As they are      as each catches on and is dumbfounded
Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to deflect such trauma
But so be it, as, though mightily stung: Thanks, mom
'm glad you didn't get here a little earlier or else wouldn't be able to tell you that your gift is a ruse
Please, excuse me
She exits to her bathroom
51
-                                 51 Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly down the stairs
John pissed
Deborah feeling the futility of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it
38
She's right between the two sizes
thought about it
what am supposed to do encourage her
what is it
-
Or motivate her to get herself in shape
Flor tries to slide by
Something surreptitious in her behavior
Deborah suddenly turns to Flor
(') Flor
She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture
Flor does not waver
just meets her eyes
Me puedo ir
go
can go
(a bit nonplussed) Sure
Go
'll drive you to the bus stop
And that fast they are gone
52
-  -                            52 As John gets in his seat
then sees Flor approaching the door and hops out to open her door
apologizing as he goes
Sorry
'm cracking
As he moves back to his side of the vehicle
(') (a shout) Shiiiiiiit
Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement
53
'  -
53 As they drive down the canyon
He is wildly frustrated
Even if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us
(') am running out of excuses for the lady of the house
Flor doesn't understand his words
yet fully agrees
But then John takes rein of his emotions
39
(') But you know, you gotta watch out for the times you think you're absolutely right
But, man, Bernice has finals tomorrow
She didn't need this one
And just that look on her face when she got the gifts-- (now his voice cracks; he grows wet-eyed) --like for a second she thought all her problems with her mother had been solved
Flor is flabbergasted
she peeks to see if he is actually crying
At first her heart is touched by John but then there is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the macho meter can read that low
He looks at her and she faces front quickly
My mother did not understand her male boss
His heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her
But they were starkly different
Privacy and dignity were the same word to my mother
Naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his child's hurt she had no idea how to process the event
Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the canyon
Flor takes the opportunity to bolt
Gracias
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is still rolling a bit
What are you doing
Let me take you all the way
Reluctantly she re-enters the car
It rolls another ten feet to her bus stop and she gets out again
(') How weird was this ride
Sorry
No es nada
He doesn't quite know what that means
indicates same in a little helpless gesture
40
54
-
54 As Flor is dropped off
the goodbye awkward
The job was taxing her
She had no template for confusion let alone frustration
While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few yards
and then back
and waves off the looks from her colleagues - many of whom are overweight
many of them adorable
All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor unsuccessfully try to shake off her day
55
'
-                                   55 As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter
distraught and distracted
She walks immediately to the refrigerator and takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk
she cuts a huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled daughter
in Spanish riding her on being too thin
the daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure
It was so unusual for my mother to ask my help that  realized immediately she was losing her battle to be uninvolved with the Claskys
Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English
Try it on
Flor asks again in Spanish
trying to find a precise phrase
The nuance important to her
(') Please try it on
Flor knows the word "please"
it's not what she wants
what she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is not a request
or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring
Her daughter works on the problem
(') Just try it on
(thickly accented) Just try it on
(small accent) Just try it on
41
(improvement each time) Just try it on
just try it on
She's got it
Our culture embraces fullness in a woman
You, the women of the admissions committee, as intelligent as you are, have no idea how casual and complete such acceptance is back home, in the land of the size 16 bikini

-   - -                   56 Flor is the only one waiting
An empty bus stops and she gets on

-    -   -       57 As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd
, overtake and pass two men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops
As she strides purposefully up the street
This is one of the cultural differences between us which  wish to explore academically at Princeton
American women, believe, actually feel the same as Hispanic women about weight
58
-                    58 The house asleep
Flor walks carefully up the steps
a desire for the comfort of fullness
59
'  -                            59 Bernie asleep on the bed
Kleenex abounds
the solid sleep earned by a few hours of sobbing
She looks touchingly pretty and decidedly round
Flor looks for, finds and carries out the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter
And, when that desire is suppressed for style and deprivation allowed to rule
42
60

Left

They turn and look confused at Deborah who is so far behind them she has no need to pass
They turn away
Deborah struggles to turn it on and does so
huffing to just behind them where she utters one more strained: (') Left
And then passes
dieting, exercising American women become afraid of everything associated with being curvaceous, such as wantonness, lustfulness, sex, food, motherhood
all that is good in life

having put the altered clothes back in place
Bernie's alarm clock rings
She wakes and sees Flor
Hey
buenas dias, Flor
Flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are beautiful
(') (ruefully) Yes
Well, taste she has
Bernie starts her morning routine
her back to us when: (damn good English) Just try it on
43
Bernie, though her back is to us, does a "take" then turns grinning
Hey
When did you learn to
(cutting her off) Just try it on
Too tight
it doesn't fit
Flor clearly doesn't understand
Just try it on
Hey
Flor extends a blouse and skirt
(') Just
Okay
'll show you
She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on, muttering pessimistically before she does so (
) (') Lovely way to start the day
World's most trim Mexican learns her first sentence and uses it to watch me grrrrunt my way into
And then
silence
Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing the clothes which fit like a glove
Flor beams
then laughs at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and looks into the mirror
To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on
nods approval and leaves
The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice
she picks up another shirt
checks the size tag and then studies it a bit
As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the buttons have previously been

Bernie enters
She is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with one word
Hey
Flor turns
Bernie moves to embrace her

He looks apprehensive
From the den comes the sound of singing
it stops him from going out the front door as he turns to check it out

-
65 John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes
They are singing an old song
something like " " - something preposterous for a nine year-old boy
but you can't knock the quality of the voices
world class
They see him and stop
Every time he has a nightmare, teach him one of my old songs
That way the nightmares have a purpose
But  don't have to sing it for anyone
Right
You're clear on that
How many did you sell of this song
(embarrassed in front of John) He likes to know that stuff
(to Georgie) She was huge
45
Seventy-six thousand
which is great for a jazz album
They resume harmonizing
As John leaves, the song lyric making some comment on: 66
-                                       66 As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate
Chum proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick up the New York Times
John's body chemistry launches a surprise attack
anxiety and dread
He takes his newspaper to a wire bench in the front driveway
He finds the section
opens to the page
and just like that his life changes forevermore

Georgie is going up the stairs
Flor putting out breakfast food

He holds up a card
He says he'll give me any three silvers for him
don't know
This is the one you started with
You really want to give up your first card
Note: this is an involved discussion on both their parts
in John thinks it is trivial
know
that's why  needed you
this is your favorite
think he'd go higher
But it's not numbers
it's
They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of exultation
69
-                                           69 Flor and Evelyn jolted
they exit to follow the sound

70
'  -                                   70 As they enter holding the paper
She has been smacked in the heart by gleeful and prideful emotions
It is disorienting for her to experience the rush of pleasure
For God's sake
why did you
,
Why aren't  screaming
'm getting there
just the stunned thing has to get dealt with
(reading from newspaper) John Clasky, who at 25 made his mark on the New York restaurant scene when  lived up to and survived its silly name, has re- emerged as a young and confident veteran taking chances with his combinations in so subtle a manner
" If he gave me six
(catching her excitement) Wait a minute, your sister's talking
Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about John
and so she studies him a bit
"
beginning with the succession of appetizers, each one with its own stunning and fully realized agenda, is constantly yet casually daring
" (emotional and earnest aside) Ah, Dad
this is so great
(to others) Now here's the thing
She tears up
Evelyn rubs Bernie's back
looks at Flor and taps her heart
Flor indicates she should leave and does
Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and moment
John is taken with his daughter's delivery
48
(') "Eating at this perfect smaller, passionate restaurant inspires one's own abandonment of caution
To wit: John Clasky is the best chef in the United States
" (genuinely enthusiastic) Look how great you read it
(massive irony) Perfect, Dad
Evelyn and Bernice hug him
John
John
Oh, my God you even look different to me
What are you talking about
wonder what mom will do
71
-                                 71 Deborah is ripping John's clothes off
buttons fly
shreds of cloth
John is laughing - happy
What is this
don't know
She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion
(') Oooohhch
72
-
72 Flor walks to the news stand - as if to buy something -- changes her mind and    only to   - where she reads to the dealer from a note
(heavily accented) New York Times
73
'
-
73 Cristina, standing, translating the review into Spanish for her mother
as she comes to the last sentence
49
Wow
"John Clasky es el mejor chef en Los Estados Unidos
(easily) Ah, bravo
74
-
74 The Claskys are engaged in sex
John's brief sounds are exuberant
they shift position so that Deborah is on top Suddenly her smile fades - she hits the skids
Oh, damn it --- what am  going to do
Everything seems so surely pointless
This
And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's climax
then, in a relatively small voice
' Okay here
okay there
good, good, good
She falls off him
an arm across her eyes, lying on her back down the bed from him
Puzzling over what just happened
a few false starts forming his thought
then finally
hesitantly
Hey, Deb
(from the vortex of depression) Yeah
He scoots to her side
You know,  guess  got used to you getting a little blue after intercourse
But
Something else  do wrong
She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom
50
You've gotta stop walking away
(turning) If  stay,  will say awful things to you that  might not even mean
You pick
See ya
She exits to the bathroom
75
'  -
75 Very upset as he drives
Then comes to the red light at the end of the street and sees Flor walking with others
An awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they acknowledge each other
the light remains red
she confers with another woman
(to woman) Yo leI la crItica buena
The woman tells Flor how to say it in English
(') (parroting woman) read your good review
He nods
still the light doesn't change
(') It's nice
The light changes
Not so far
How you doing
The light has changed - cars are beeping
she is about to let him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer
do fine
He nods and drives off
76
-                                      76 As he enters
the phone is going off the hook
As he passes the maitre d's desk
Their conversation is strangely hushed and very, very quick
51
Should  stop answering
We're booked for two months solid
No, no, no, no, no
want to keep some walk-in business
want this to stay neighborhood
Impossible
There would be riots
You should hear the desperation in their voices
Best day of my life
We'll serve a full menu at the bar then
Then where do  put the people waiting for a table
It won't work
Do this for me
There's no way
Do this for me or 'll set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face
Huh
Yeah
you're right
that was an unusual way for me to make myself understood
But you'll do the bar thing
Yes, of course, John
77
-                      77 need to talk to you
Ah, man
Okay
They walk into the cooling room
52
78
-   -                       78 Again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation sparked by John
What's up
What's wrong
've gotten a fantastic offer for my own place
Everybody wants to back me since the paper came out
What's your reaction
Honestly
Because 've had this very unusual reaction
Yeah
've had a hard on almost all day and it won't go away
Like 'm riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top whose leaning over
It's like every dream  ever had and some even  didn't have the balls to dream
So you're considering taking it
(he looks at him) Okay, here's the thing
can't lose you and still keep the hours 'm keeping
can't do my life unless  can hold onto you
(sudden thought) think  just gave you an incredible bargaining position
79
-                                79 As John and Deborah lay next to each other
So you gave away twenty percent of the restaurant without talking to me about it
Yeah
If  didn't do it - 'd have been coming home just to sleep
53
(trying to make livid more attractive) Remember the other day when you asked me the perfect response to something  said
'm asking you now
what would you like my response to be to your giving away twenty percent of the business without asking me
(with great enthusiasm) "You're ma man
" Okay
So that would be
My dream response from you, yes
(measured) 'm not quite there
Actually, just had this flash that the reason women in the old days used to faint was to avoid doing acts of violence against men
(a beat then) And  was all worried about figuring out the timing just to talk to you about renting a place for the summer
Well,  think you got your timing
80
-                                      80 man is parked at the gate in an open convertible
He is great looking
We  Deborah's excited voice over the gate speaker
Be right out
81
-
81 As Deborah calls behind her as she opens the door
(') Mom, you want to come
the realtor's here
Okay, see you later
She clicks the gate open and walks to the man
perfect 40 year old great looking surfer sort
Deborah does the very slightest of "takes" at his looks
As she gets in
54
(') Hi
'm Mike
there's one great rental that just came on
so we're starting at the top
As they pull away
82
-
82 Deborah's hair whips across her face
it's bothersome
'll never be one of those girls whose hair blows perfectly in a convertible
Move your seat forward
Puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges forward
(') little more
just
good
The Realtor uses his switches and raises his window a bit
her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the half windows in back
Deborah turns around checking out the odd tweaking and then faces forward
Her hair blows perfectly and beautifully behind her
Oh, you must be trouble
On his small laugh
83
-
83 As they move toward the house
seeing the beach beyond
(') Gorgeous, huh
Pretty, fabulous, beautiful
What word is the same in Spanish
Fabuloso
(taking it as a compliment) Thanks
55
84
-
84 As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter
They carry boxes of stuff
(') don't care if it's a rental
this place is getting a fixing
She leads Flor to a small bedroom
(') (to Flor with gestures) This will be yours
Flor doesn't understand
certainly doesn't want to
Did you ask her if she could live in
Come on
there's no buses from her to here
There's no question
Double come on
Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like the law vs
the bible then with heavy sarcasm
(') The Barrio - Carbon Beach
The Barrio - Carbon Beach
What to do
(to Flor) Don't worry
'm putting nicer stuff in here too
When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing, somewhat stupefied
Deborah takes her by the hand and leads her out
85
-   -                             85 As they move through a little courtyard area toward the street
You must learn English
Why won't she learn English
'm going to have to learn, "you must learn English," in Spanish
think Flor is perfect and we should do all we can to keep her from changing
Gee, you took the words right out of my mouthay
56
86
-                                                86 As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach - passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing someone's car in a driveway
Evelyn is many steps back
Oh, good
Do you speak English
Yes,  do
Would you translate for me
He looks at Flor
my God
Sure
forever
He speaks to her in Spanish
a lavish, poetic compliment
Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish
"Would you please just find out what she wants
" Evelyn joins them
Wait till  say something before you start in
(he looks at her) rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule
He translates along with Deborah's speech
Stricken
She turns to Deborah
No
Sorry
What
Why
Flor talks briefly in Spanish
She can't because of her daughter
You have a daughter
You have a whole daughter you haven't mentioned
How old
Twelve
57
(to Evelyn) It's a little crazy that  don't know that
The man translates
(') (to man) Don't translate asides
The man says in Spanish to Flor
"You work for her
"--Flor answers, "just tell her that  can't live here
" Deborah doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation
(') Hey
She can't live here
Her daughter
Okay
(beat then big decision) Her daughter can also live with us for the summer
The man tells Flor
she answers directly to Deborah
(big decision) No, sorry
Why
The man asks Flor who speaks in Spanish
don't know
She just doesn't want to
Will you please just tell me what she said
She said, " just don't want to
" If she didn't tell us about her child she has to have a deep sense of privacy
We can figure out how she can still live at home
Hell, don't mind driving her at night
58
Let's spare the world you on the roads
(to Flor) Well, what do we do
The Hispanic man translates the last sentence
Deborah and Flor stare at each other
Deborah's next words are somber and have enough body language to transcend the need for translation
the jig is up
(') (big decision) 'm sorry, my friend, this is what need
It's just for the summer don't want to lose you
But
Flor indicates there is no need to translate
beat
(enormous decision) Yo vivo aquI
She'll live here
The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to actually stumble as she looks back at him
then, before Deborah can admonish him
(') said, "God protect you from that boss
" 87

-                                87 As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant
Flor follows tight lipped - resolved
They each carry many clothes on wire hangers
group of girls on the balcony literally cheer Cristina on
(accented) -----------
Cristina grins hugely back at them

89 As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and waves
Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes never leave her
59
She gasps frequently This is awe as an active physical exercise
The dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter relationship as the   finds Flor becoming first blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over each new sight
(over this incidental dialogue) The first time one sees natural beauty which is owned by others confounds the senses
had never imagined the word "money" could be associated with anything but the anxiety of not having enough didn't know God had a toy store for the rich

-   -                   91 Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to  in the manner of people trying to excite dogs
Who wants to go swimming
Yes, who wants to go swimming
The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same way
Evelyn has a drink in hand
(') (to grandmother) Who wants to go swimming
Huh
Not now
But  promise 'll go in the summer after next
John enters the scene
You want to go swimming
Oh yeah, you're off
What do you think, wet suits
60
Wet suits are for wimps
Yeah, you're right
let me get mine
Georgie laughs
(to Dad) You're good

Flor behind her daughter

As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house
As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter her home, haloed by the sun
Again, Flor less distinct in the background
Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and emits a small, prescient moan
(to Flor) Look at this child
Flor, you could make a fortune at surrogate pregnancy
Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what Deborah said
Que
Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother
Hi
'm John
It's good to see you
(to Flor indicating Cristina) Great
(to Cristina) Hi
This is my daughter, Bernice
'm Deborah
And out there
are Georgie and
61
As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has almost reached them
'm so glad to meet you
'm a fan of your mother's
'm Cristina
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top which is half tucked in
(kidding around but right on) No comparisons, please, no comparisons
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self- deprecation
Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish
My mother says it's best if we get out of the way and put our things away
Have you ever been to the beach here
've never been anyplace but Mexico and Texas
before today
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up
it is filled with beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards
Here's the most important place in the house
grab this stuff whenever you want
(delighted) Thank you
thank you so much
Very little accent
(suspiciously) Que
(to Flor) Sin acento
62
Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with, nods
(') (to Deborah) Thank you
there's an
total fluency class where they work you pretty hard at sounding American
Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a word
Cristina
Right
Settle in
Thank you
am thrilled to be here

'  -                                  93 Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual brilliance
Flor is tense
distraught

John and Georgie in the waves
body surfing
they get to shore
John sees the two females
dashing in the water in their bathing suits
He remains hidden in a very shallow wave as they run in
then once they are in he starts taking off his wet suit hurriedly
As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment

hey
hey
What are you doing up
Cristina looks around -- then up
Oh, hi
so beautiful

Would you believe  had to talk my husband into this

Yes

She picks it up
Dear Flor, 64
decided to steal your daughter for a bit
, With great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go through her daughter's things
finding her backpack and extracting a Spanish/English dictionary
As her finger points to: "Steal
robar" And then she flips some pages feverishly
Her finger indicating: "daughter
hija" 98

98 (') Stop thanking me
love having the company
It was an adventure which 'll remember
Your English is genius
Do you dream in Spanish or English
Just recently 've had a dream in English
What was it

uh, can't tell
This is so uncomfortable
You could have just said you didn't remember

Look who's sensational

She is pissed
What's wrong
She shows her the letter
Evelyn reads it and hands it back
She is about to offer something

John comes in from the beach with his kids
boogie boards
Evelyn hands him the letter

Aw, shit

No thank you

Hey, Flor
She turns

very sorry
He indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together
(') They should be back soon
Flor starts to cry
She sits in a chair
He sits not far from her
(') Hey, Flor
Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her alone
she turns from him
He walks to the wet bar and gets a bottle of water
pours some
Her crying soft in the 66

He walks to her, sits near her and offers her the glass of water which she takes
(') Deborah made a mistake understand how you feel
Do you understand me at all, generally
Is simpatico the word
He pats her on the back
She looks at him
Is he coming on
His kind eyes
This is real eye contact
two vaguely humiliated people finding real company for an instant
Without thought, she duplicates his gesture and pats his back
Simpatico, yes
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she is out of her chair
(This is as intimate as John has been with another woman since he was married
) He calls out to stop her
Un momento, huh
She stops and turns to him
(') 'm really sorry this is happening

All staring at her

Something bad happen
Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood
(') Cristina, tell your mother  just played around with your hair
she can put it back
no hurt feelings
Not right now

-- You can't just take someone else's
Nuh-uh, Mom
don't go there
or 'll go there and you know where "there" is
Evelyn stops on a dime
She leaves
Deborah crosses to Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm around her

Shoot me if  ever get that hard to deal with

Cristina enormously uncomfortable
-
The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words
Cristina winces with the words she records even while punctuating perfectly
You cannot take my child without my permission
And, if you had asked me  would not have given permission
Is this why you did not ask
Because you knew this
You have no rights over my private life
Reaching a decisive conclusion
If you have any disagreement with this,  no longer wish to work here
' This is awful news
For a decisive nod of affirmation
She adjusts her daughter's hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits

She actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note
What's this
Flor shakes the letter at her
69
Showing Cristina hidden but looking on
like a stage prompter in the wings
For you
From
Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own chest
(') You are not yourself
This was written in anger
You sleep on it and then if you still want me to have it -- fine
don't think you will once calm and rational thought returns
Just sleep on it

Cristina reveals herself and explains the situation to her mother

She didn't even want us to know she had a daughter - then, on the first day, you take the kid without asking
think that's
(starting to lose it) What
Insensitive
Elitist
Irresponsible
Perverse
Dizzy
(slow and emphatic) Dumb
She looks at him
He has been atypical
Her immediate emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt
Her words are slow
her voice ragged
When is anyone in this damn house or this damn life going to consider my feelings
just tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome
There's no reason to rake it over
let it go
and gave Flor the room to let it go
Which 'm sure she has
It's over
So get on board

She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing immediately in her way holding the letter
slept

As John passes through the room
am deeply and sincerely sorry to have upset you
Especially in light of the deep connection, as women,  believe us to have
(sotto to John) And to think  was worried about Flor living here with her kid

So here's the idea
want to make a serving platter for serving fish using sea glass like this
He holds out some sea glass
(') used to hunt for this stuff every free minute when  apprenticed in Italy
This is bits of broken glass that the ocean sand blasts over the years
great looking, huh
So you guys go hunting and 'll pay 50 cents for any piece, a dollar for anything as big as this and five dollars for any color that isn't brown, clear or green
Do we have to do this
(to Georgie) Oh, come on
Georgie and Bernice start off

Why don't you count it and
have
Many times
didn't sleep
counted
So what's the damage
total
Her eyes locked on his
(dead serious) It depends on whether you consider these four a color other than green, brown or clear
She takes them from her pocket
Well, this one is borderline
agree
Oh my God, you found a blue
Nobody finds a blue
You know how a blue happens
mean, before the ocean blasts it for 30-40 years
Somebody had to throw away an old Milk of Magnesia bottle
You know what Milk of Magnesia is
Unfortunately
He smiles broadly
The kid's a trip
He likes her
So how much for the whole deal
(unable to look at him) Eleven hundred and one dollar
He reacts
then
73
Okay
We'll finish dealing with it when  get home from work
She gasps

114 Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert
footsteps
She hears John enter
She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor
115
-
115 As she enters from the back room and sees that John is walking into the kitchen
Her eye goes to the hall table on which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it
116
-
116 John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will be late
He is disappointed
117
'  -  -                       117 Not aware of being observed
opens the envelope and takes out a thick wad of cash
almost swoons
as she goes about hiding it
she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity
Cristina
She turns
the wad of money in her hand
118
-                             118 The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his spirits
It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as a culinary genius
This is a snack we will remember and copy
John is approaching a perfect moment
and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest
119
-                              119 He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish voices approaching
He looks up
As they enter
Cristina translating her mother's words
My mother wishes me to represent exactly what she says, nothing else
74
And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her mother's emotion, sometimes including body language
It is not only a translation but a reenactment
May  talk to you
You mean your mother
Cristina nods
not comfortable breaking the rule of only speaking for her mother
She faces him, her back to Flor
(') (looking at Flor) Sure you can talk to me
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish
don't have to sleep first
What's wrong
Flor waves the money
Cristina waves an empty hand as she speaks for her mother
Did you give this money to my daughter
made this little deal
with all the kids to
(interrupting) Please
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now translates from the background
(') You don't tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones
what is the word for this
Sea glass
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him
75
No
not a name for the stones
a name for the act
what you did
As she spits out the word to her daughter
EngreIdo
As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear
Oh, no
engreIdo's going to be rough
Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to deliver the word
(briefly being herself) It's hard to translate
She takes half a beat
finds the word and now spits it out
Smug
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she translates for John had no idea it would amount to that kind of money
thought --- sort of tops fifty dollars
Fifty dollars is a lot of money
Okay
Right
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females look as he searches for the right thing to say
(') (sighing to himself) Ah, shit
That fast Cristina translates
Before Flor can react
John talks directly to Flor
quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten
76
(') 'm sorry
get why you are upset
It might not look it but am good at getting things
Doing something about it is something else
was going to talk to you before  actually gave her the money
but maybe  should have checked before  started the whole thing
(he smiles/they don't) know what it's like when you feel your kid is being messed with get the message
It won't happen again
It's late
'm sure we'd all like
Flor lets it out
her daughter hard pressed to keep up
To what
sleep
If this was small enough to be helped by some little apology,  would be a fool to bring it up
need to say more no matter what the result
need to be impolite
You leave someone else's child alone
It's simple, no
It is too easy for children to feel contradictions
It encourages questioning their parents
and that makes them less safe
Your wife takes her for rides and changes her hair
You give her money
Here
(this next sentence Cristina translates with alarm and adds her own question mark
) Take back the money
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching gaze
They begin to exit
but Flor turns inadvertently bumping into her daughter
Her voice softens
(') did not mean to be angry to you - only emotional
They turn to leave
John speaks with sudden volume and muscle
What about hypocritical
Cristina turns back
confused
her mother asks her for a translation and she complies
Flor then wearing the same confused expression
77
(') Yeah, you heard me
It's not like you didn't do the same thing
(hard on the translation) No
Oh, yes
So go lecture yourself
you won't need a translator for that one
mean what am  lately
recycling bin
just anyone dump in your garbage and hope  make something useful out of it
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and pointing a finger at her
(') Yes, you did the same thing
you think  didn't know about altering those outfits for Bernie
She tells me her stuff
So, am  missing something
Is there a real difference between that and what you are complaining about
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to translate
but doesn't get one
Instead her mother is a bit mortified and considerably humbled
the pie smack into the face
Sin diferencia
Yo interferI
No difference
interfered
Okay
'm still not sure  did the right thing keeping it to myself
It felt disloyal to Deborah
but my daughter really needed someone to be kind to her right then
so
so
am very embarrassed
You are very right
Hypocrisy
yes
78
(something strikes him, he softens, disoriented) 'll tell you, it's pretty wild to say something and have the other person just concede the point
'm dazed here
will leave whenever it is good for you and
No
no
come on, man
But how can  work for you after we talk like this
You can't quit even if you want to and you know why
No
Yes, you do
Flor is worried as John looks right at her
Is he coming on
(') Because then Cristina will blame herself for costing you the job
and that guilt
don't know if you know about guilt
Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one
Culpa, guilt, sI
We know
We are Catholics
(after her daughter's translation) Culpa, si
Por Dios, Si
(on her own) We know
(big nod) We know
John gestures that there is nothing to be done
Flor nods
79
So, welcome back
She smiles
gets up
extends her hand
they shake
Good night, Mr
Clasky
Good night As they exit
their backs to John, daughter following mother
Flor speaks to her daughter
(an aside) No te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi
Ahora tengo que aprender inglEs
(over her shoulder to John as they move) can't have you doing this for me
must learn English now
No, dije eso por ti - no por John
That translates to "No,  meant that for you, not John
" But Cristina does not translate the line
Nor
You have a wonderful mother

There is the sound of skittering paws as  approaches

But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away
John follows, weaving a bit

then starts when she sees John standing there
He cheers, seeing her predicament
81
When she speaks English, at this point, her words are halting
You gotta do something about Chum
Your arm's going to go
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of his way
Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball
Flor wearily throws it
(') Don't you sleep anymore
No
You get more if you keep at it
You're doing fantastic
Now  am like a three year-old
Your wife go out
She say where
No
(on his reaction) Sorry
Listen
just forgot she was going out
don't be a smart ass
(jolted by his own remark) Uh-oh
well, you and  communicate mostly in apologies anyway
'm sorry
should be whipped should be stoned- it's been a while -  meant to say,  think, don't be smart, don't be kind, don't be sensitive, don't be beautiful meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night Flor
that show you're watching is going to be a hit
" He staggers out
Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures Chum to join him
Chum is reluctant, but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of John in the den
He is younger and smiling
She studies the picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and purposefully goes back to her lessons

Well, your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while you're in class
Bernice nods
Then unconsciously moans

No
Just that  hate summer school
Why do you go then
(looks at her) 'm not sure  can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class
in this case math
and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math -- so they make you go to summer school
It helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission
What do you mean they failed

Oh
see
Forgive me,  don't have a real sense of humor

She is genuinely puzzled
And that thing is

a pleasure to meet you, Ms
Folsom

sharing their delight

've got to finish packing up
(no longer sure of herself or anything) just don't
Out of space this school wants her to go for free
We ran into the school head
They want diversity
Cristina knocked her out
had nothing to do with it
By the way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars
And early registration is tomorrow
It is too far from our home

Never, thank you

Yes, nuts
have no idea what to do
Such an important thing
Yeah
It's a good school
Tops
It's tops
So you like it

No
hate the damn school
But that's because they keep sending my daughter home anxiety-ridden, mostly over geometry
mean you "get" Bernice
In a decent world her school should let her know how great she is, right
Very right
So, don't ask me
'm worried about my own kid there
You don't have to worry about Bernice
Nothing is going to change that heart
He looks at her
Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about his daughter
It is odd
being this deeply touched before he knows what hit him
He makes little adjustments until the moment passes
Um
yeah
thanks

Hard to explain
"get" it

Deborah hands Cristina a locket
then, noting Flor's expression
(to Cristina) It's from  of us
Your mother too
(to Cristina) It's not from me

Deborah does a good-natured "" accepting Flor's reaction as if it where an eccentricity
As Cristina and Bernice board the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women, thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her daughter

Better pace yourself though

She looks off to see John's vehicle approaching
She brightens
Who doesn't see her
We can see his car's digital clock reading 11:30
As he drives past her
151
-
151 As John enters
Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to intercept him
(') John, better wait a minute
But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs
(concerned) What the hell's wrong
Nothing
In all futility, can urge you not to go up there
But he is already moving quickly up the stairs
As he turns at the top of the stairs       ' 98
(') (to herself) Denouement
152
-
152 John enters the room on the double
passes Deborah without knowing it
(she is partially obscured by the drape or some such)
As he passes
camera
she is a mess
goopy tear stains
seeing him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground
a sinner humbled by goodness
a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability
Deb
Deb
where are you
He is about to leave the room
she is about to let him but an instinct leads her astray once more
Here  am
Baby, what
"Baby
" Stay there, John
Sit down
suddenly get what  have to do
just have to get the guts
Is it absolutely necessary to make it this
this scary
can you just say it
Not so easy
(tender/ready for the big healing) Yeah
come on
it's me
We can talk
Do  ever hope so
've been seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and ended it tonight
At first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market
Then it was
what
Me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali
99
shock victim
he holds up a hand to stop her
Go -- hold on
hold on
'm missing what you're saying
You can't just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did
Just what did you hear
Well there was the crack in the planet
That was noisy
She looks at him
a solid beat
(') There's an actual noise in my head
no kidding
Briefly he does the noise
(slowly) met him about
John holds up a hand to stop her
he needs to gather himself to hear this
She waits
and waits
as he waits he grows flushed and stunned with dread
Finally a word
You
She takes that as a cue to start
met him
He puts up his hand
If you talk that fast
'll never hear you
there's a lot going through my mind
Have you said yet whether you slept with him
So far 've just been talking about a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know
Have you said yet whether you've had sex with someone else
Because really am missing most of your words
So help me out here
100
've been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to
(sincerely checking but wild) You still haven't said, right
Is this your way of
This is my way of
this is my way of asking you whether
He stops
staggering on the threshold of a diminished future
(') Oh man, once  ask it
give me a second
(several beats then some conversational good manners for keeping her waiting) 'm just trying to figure out whether there's any way to avoid knowing
no, damn (quickly closing this argument with himself) There's not
(to her) Okay, you're on
real short answer, huh
Have you had sex with another
know you're very angry
(considering/then repressed answer) Ahhhh
'm getting there, yes
(softly) John
(on his look) think if you let me tell you the full everything of this we'd be in a position to deal with it better
because eleven weeks ago when
101
You don't believe that  miss your words
get three or four tops
and then just see your mouth moving with nothing coming out and then  spin out and there's this noise
But there's no way to miss a "yes" or "no
" (blurts) Yes
(core simple/eight years old) Really
(this gets her) made up my mind that  would answer every question you had
'll answer anything and everything and more
(perplexed) What other questions could there be
Are you really that much nicer than me
Well, you don't set the bar real high
He get up and starts to exit
No
Please, please, please think if you listen to exactly what happened and then do whatever you need to
we'll
just let me tell you everything
The doorbell rings
it's quite late
Deborah wondering what's up
she looks out the window
(') Oh, it's just Flor
153
153 As Flor enters the Clasky House
102
154
-                               154 Flor sees Evelyn in the living room
What are you doing here
want Cristina
want to talk to Mrs
Clasky
want to quit
don't think you can do any of it right this minute
Oh, yes
Where's Cristina
155
-                                 155 Deborah can barely look at him
then, when  was driving back tonight after  ended the whole yuck thing
was feeling human
'm done with what's his name
a relief
and now it can be like it never happened and then thought that the only hope was that own that it did happen and that take my medicine here
because if 'm walking around with what  did and you don't know what did
there is a real limit to how close we can be
you're with me and 'm this person who has this bad secret and we aren't really on the same page ever again
so the reason took this chance in telling -- is because  want us to be good want us to be close
want to feel like you're not nuts to be in love with me
So what  think is we should talk till we pass out
Talk till we're so sick of each other that there's nothing left to do but take the first step out of hell
So please let's not leave this room until you've heard and said everything
please say, okay
She awaits his answer
He has heard barely a few words
What
103
John
've got to get out of here
because you keep talking
(as she starts to follow him) Stay put
She does
Just before he exits
You've got to say something
You are a terrible wife
He exits
156
'  -
156 Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor
they are looking at Cristina and her two friends sleeping together
don't think you want to wake her when you're this upset and the other kids are right there and
Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room
157
-                                157 As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the stairs just as Flor opens the front door
Where you going
'm leaving
have finally
Me too
'll drive you
No
Yes
come on
it's past midnight here
If you truly don't know why  say "no" let me at last say the reason
At least that will be a relief
Have you no idea that
104
Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's snout
Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball
As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it and returns
Look  have to get out of here right now
Go
John exits to driveway
Flor makes one last toss
these tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration
(') Goodbye, Chum
Another toss and Flor follows John out the door
No longer happy
He has lost his only easy mark
He stares at the closed door
the ball drops from his mouth to the floor
158
-
158 John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate
(as decisive as we've seen him) 'm taking you
(with anger) Why
Because if  don't -- 'll worry about you and  can't handle that right now, okay
Flor emits a crooning sound
Ahhhhh
(stunned and worried) never made that sound over a man before
105
Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the passenger door for her
very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in
she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up
She is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door
The frustration roiling in her
(') Please
Mandilon
Deborah watching them
Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous, soon-to-be ex-housekeeper
She trembles under the force of imminent justice
159
'  -                                  159 Two pissed-off people
jaws set
breathing labored
As the car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and explosive shout
(a quick and mighty vent) Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii
For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while
Yes
Exactly
Well put
Teach me that word sometime
can really use it
She nods
there is almost a moment of relaxation
then the anger fires an immediate need
She leans across the seat to deliver an urgent message to him
The words come out exponentially too forcefully
quit this job
His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her
quit this job
As he turns onto Sunset
106
That's the bus stop
'll take you home
No
Drop me at a bus
Oh, shut up and stop telling me what to do
Okay
then let's do something besides driving me home where my daughter isn't
Okay
we'll do something
And 'm supposed to figure out what because 'm a housekeeper and you don't have to think
Oh, don't do the class thing, man
You don't know where  come from
Alright,  know
But  can't be responsible no more for making sure nothing happens
That's another terrible job  quit
What are you talking about
take responsibility for anything within a block
You have nothing to worry about
That's my job
Excellent
So you're going to figure out what we do, right
Yes
Okay
Big man figure out
Stop there
She points to a mall
He looks at her and pulls in
107
160
-
160 As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store
John, sober faced, looks at Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline toward an Hispanic market
This could be where it hits him that he's on a date
If so
it's too late to duck
161
-
161 As Flor enters the market
She calls to the young shop girl as Marine medics for morphine
(') Maquillaje
: The shop girl directs her to the make-up counter where she starts shopping
lip gloss, blush, eye stuff
She starts applying it at the check out counter
162
-                              162 As she runs back to the car
163
'  -                                     163 As she enters, there is a fury to her which he almost matches
This is me when 'm not working
You have never seen me
Well, you look familiar
So, (parodying him) "man," where we heading
don't think  can handle public
Yes, no
lots of people right now is
know
You were going to figure this out
My place
108
164
'  -
164 As they enter the main restaurant
've never seen your place
Very perfect
He heads for the kitchen
'm going to cook, Beautiful
(on a dime correction) 'm going to cook beautifully
Hey
please
He turns
(') We both were not normal because we are angry and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not
am not
am glad to be with you
It feels comfortable to be with you
If  just left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin
You understand
Ummmmmmmmm
Yes
He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical expression, pats her on her back
She eyes him, almost critical about the lame extent of his aggression
He can't quite look at her
He pats her again
The pat is becoming a rub
he cups her back
slides his hand
she responds just a bit
(') think 'm inventing a horrible new way of making out
Not so horrible
His hand keeps going
he now hugs her to him even though they both still face front
like a loving couple on a walk to the market
His hand squeezes her shoulder
My hand is the only sane part of my body
every other part wants to jump off a cliff
109
(digging this/almost growing a sense of humor) If the other hand could cheer up, you could lift me up and carry me off
He laughs
He takes his hand from around her
It is a bit awkward
don't know how to handle that one
think  already broke my record for smooth
don't understand
It's me
'm not making sense
But can get you fed
He goes to the kitchen
She begins to explore a little
She goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a  player
She digs in her purse and takes out a
165
-                              165 As John starts cooking up a storm
there is some velocity to his cooking
he still seethes
Then reacts as Spanish Music starts to play
He clears his throat as if he must make a speech
Then does so again
some vocal spasm paying tribute to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels
166
-   -
166 Flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables
167
-
167 He is cooking
He is talking to himself
Nothing to be nervous about
You are not on a date
(calls out) Hey, Flor
'  (
) Yes, John
What are you doing
She enters the room
dancing a bit
110
Just lighting candles and picking music
(notices his cooking) Oooh
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet dangling
sings along a bit in Spanish
He is uncomfortable anew
The nervousness mounting
You want a drink
She considers the question totally
He is busy cooking
not realizing how weighty she considers his question
finally aware she has not answered and looks at her
(') Huh
She regards him levelly
then makes her decision
No
He gets out a bottle of vodka
(') , uh
don't think you should either
Then excuse me, because if  had the equipment 'd inject the vodka
He starts to pour
Wait
(he stops) think it is so important that we are each clear-headed
He looks at her
a beat
he puts the vodka away
Flor beams
we have not seen her smile like this for quite some time
(') It is very good that you did not ask, "why
" (quietly) Keep things real, right
(impressed) wouldn't have put it so well
111
168
-    -            168 They sit at a small table in the kitchen
finishing the greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man
will remember every taste
forever
Tell you the truth
wanted a shot at cooking for you
(shy/his heart) 'm very glad you liked it
It's something watching you
He looks up at her
she has not been seen like this for a very long time, if ever
lit up by a man
Well, if it's anything at your end imagine over here
scratch that
the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks
Don't be crazy
Tell me every detail
Okay, Flor, yes  will
They should name a gender after you
Looking at you doesn't do it
Staring is the only thing that makes sense
and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything
She squeals with laughter
He laughs a little himself and in so doing loses his courage
He looks down at his hands
shyness again belting him a good one
Still looking down
(') Look
forgive me
'm
It's just that you are drop-dead, crazy- gorgeous
so much so that  am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here
Soon, please
And now he looks at her
112
Utterly open
utterly optimistic
the half second before being swept away
(') Right now
immediately
we have to dance or kiss
He stands
She stands
He kids just a bit, clowning at weighing the two options and then: Her face
No contest
They kiss
You sure you're not Mexican
(smiling/he likes this) What do you mean
meant you talk like a Spanish song
You kiss like a Spanish fly
(on her confusion) Joking around
don't know what 'm talking about
Yes you do
She breaks and heads for the dining room
John has a moment to consider
He does not have his wits about him
a condition every bit as fearsome as liberating
169
-
169 As Flor rummages for another , enjoying every minute
She places the disk in the player and exits
170
170 As she returns
(') This song
You see what a good thing to tell you how you talk like a Mexican song
113
She begins to translate the lyrics
(') When  kiss you, entire oceans rush through my veins
(he is wildly uncomfortable) Gardens of flowers blossom in my body
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past the event
she shakes her head at him
driving the words -- pointing emphatically
she will not have her poetry laughed at
(') And you wander along my fertile soil, picking its ripe fruit nightingale undresses on my tongue
And under its wings
He laughs
She stops cold
Looks down
though just seconds long, this still constitutes the first depression of her life
'm sorry
don't know what  just took out of you but tell me how to get it back in there
'm sorry
Flor
'm sorry
The downcast eyes rise to see him
Then respect this
He looks at her
they kiss
It is a kiss without an author
God at the controls
They break
There is a beat then
Here's something  never asked anyone
Did nightingales undress on your tongue
Flor looks at him with enormous warmth
Her arms looped around his neck
aware of the music
Did they on yours
(a long beat of reflection/then sincere and surprised) Yeah
114
171
-                              171 Moving camera
the small house turned restaurant
little flickers of light
My mother never told me the details of her visit to the restaurant
But she often referred to it as the greatest conversation of her life
172
-
172 They are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa just inside the dining room
They are covered by a table cloth
They hold hands above the cover
each private but still somehow in contact
Oh, Johnny, why is everything so damn confusing
Culpa
Flor's pleasure zone is rocked
She smiles at his first Spanish word
She is wrestling with large feelings of pleasure and large ominous thoughts
(a beat) Is your mind racing
would say my mind has evaporated
but that there are remnants still standing waiting to fall
It feels pretty good
Like happy
Like happy
You think that will last
It's already gone
understand what you mean
don't understand what  mean
115
That it's getting late
That responsibilities have entered your brain
Don't hide that from me
And really, one large reason we are here is because you respect me as a mother and  respect you as a father
He is looking at her
she is disconcerted
You're a great and wild mother
You are a beautiful father
She looks at him
they kiss
tenderness
heat
intimacy
(') When Cristina was young,  would say  want to take any man who wants me to the park and  will tell whether  want him from the way he is with Cristina
wish you had been in the park then
(a beat) Any reaction
John considering and then the answer comes to him
Exactly
You know,  always think about when you
Oh, there's no point
talk too much
(a bit of emotion) because  don't know if we ever talk again
Hey, hey
How do you get there
Wait
Yes you do
Be honest
'm being honest
(indicates their bodies) Look at us -  think  call it honesty
116
What are we going to do -- go home, let our hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times
Make a tragedy out of us
She kisses him again
starts to cry
looks at him
emits a small cooing sound
(') Ahhhhhhh
(sudden energy) There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids
Please, are you ready to go
(urgently) No
'm not
No
(then) Stay put for a second
Stay here
Once our feet touch that floor, 'm going to get too many brain cells back
So don't be in such a hurry
That floor, Flor, is going to eat us alive
(she settles back/he is energized) So you think it was a mistake up to now
(she nods "yes") That's rough
She nods again
trying to gut things out
but as her foot touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him
The mistake
love it
173
-   -
173 Deborah's face is bleached from crying
the tear ducts of her now brown eyes are parched dry
Evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of Stone Canyon
In her current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at Promises
a shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped
Deborah's voice is scratchy when she speaks
Tell me again why  can't call him on the cell
Besides that he turned it off
Yes
117
Forty messages start to look needy
Mother, you're enjoying this
No
Definitely not in the way you think
(staggered) You are enjoying it
(rising/honest) am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter
am enjoying the fact that  really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything  say
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way
as if Evelyn were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself
(vulnerable) There's one thing 'd like to say to you about you and me
You don't have to
want to
Okay
(quite vulnerable and appealing) You were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that  am in this fix because of you
It is your fault
just needed
(gestures heart to heart) that moment for us
You have a solid point, dear
But right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you
118
There's a car coming
Evelyn moves to her
(') It's him
he's got to tell me everything
Evelyn shakes her head "no
" (') (wild-eyed) Yes
Do you know that right now you are your own worst enemy
that you can't trust one thought in your brain
Duh
Then trust me and only allow yourself to say one thing to him
One thing
"'m so glad you're back
" Huh
Yes
(babbling) But 've got to know whether he touched her - where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat --- what they said - who made the first move - how they left it -- if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me
(a wail) whether they held hands when they left
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs
119
Just those words  said
If you want a prayer of coming out of this
know you're right
But
But what
(a small voice) forgot the sentence you said should say
"'m so glad you're back
" Okay
do  have to wait here
No
he may not come up here
go to him
Why wouldn't he come up here
Just go
Do  need a little makeup
You need a hose but you don't have the time
It's fine that you look like that
It's genuine
You can use genuine
Thank you, mom
She takes a breath exits
174
174 She pauses at the top of the stairs
a breath
then unable to help herself runs down them at breakneck speed
175
175 John turning a light on when Deborah bursts into the room
120
'm so glad to see you (correcting self) that you're back
John looks up at her - not knowing what to say
he is thrown
His demeanor has changed
deeper
serious
It's late, Deborah
The wrong words start to form
she stops herself
Well,  just wanted to say
what said
She is on the stairway
he turns to go in the opposite direction
(') (way too loud) Uhhhh
He turns back to her
she stops herself from straying into untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to bed
(a beat then) can't sleep upstairs with you
Just can't for now
This rocks her
panicked she grabs at her life preserver
'm just so glad you're back
Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest of footings for them
He looks at her directly for the first time since she told him
Yeah
okay
She nods
then goes back up the stairs
176
-                                  176 Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands clear to let her enter
As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable - her breath racing
am literally choking on unsaid words
seriously
If this were a restaurant ten people would have their knuckles in my sternum
121
The fact that you didn't just make things worse should fill you with hope
In her current state, she has to process that one
and does
Her breath slows
177
'  -
177 The first time we've seen this room since Flor was working the sewing machine
John enters
He is down, longing and finality make for a brutal cocktail
He rubs his head and sits near the sewing machine
He glances over and sees Flor's Spanish/English dictionary
There is a knock on the door
Deb, 'm done tonight
don't think we can jam anything else in
' It's me, Dad
He springs from the bed and opens the door
What's up, honey
Just thought 'd check that you were back and okay and all
(feigning innocence) Because
Mom was crying for six hours straight and Grandma was in with her all that time mostly saying, "he'll be back
he'll be back
" 've got to get back to Georgie
just hate that you had that kind of a night
It's good for me to worry about something that really matters instead of the stupid stuff that's usually on my mind
Like
122
(a big grin) Surviving
You're fantastic, Bernie
love you
It's a slant
(pause then) Hey
know there's a lot you went through but  knew all along that Grandma was right about you coming back
mean totally knew it so wasn't that worried
But still
(some emotion out of hiding) really appreciate it, Dad
Thanks
Stop staring at me
what
You don't know what to say
Right
don't know what to say
Just what you taught me
You're welcome
You're welcome
They kiss

178 Flor purposefully walking up the hill
179
-
179 As Flor enters
walks through a few empty rooms
then once in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming in the pool
she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on interview day
180
-
180 Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool
Cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading
Hey, mom
Is it okay if we don't leave right away
The others call greetings
save Evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool
Flor is awkward
no idea how to handle this
so she goes direct
123
No
(as Cristina begins to protest) No
and we must say "goodbye
" don't work here anymore
She then talks Spanish to Cristina
admonishing her not to embarrass them
something about Flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity
but it is said with total calm
Do  have to get out
No, Georgie
Stay
think you are a wonderful boy
be good
like you are
There are no monsters
Thanks
thanks
Okay
Bernice climbs out of the pool
Meanwhile, a flabbergasted Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in Spanish
(severely to Georgie) can't believe you didn't get out
Flor said
(to Flor) don't want to get you wet
Get me wet
(rushing to hug her) Thanks
Bernice hugs her
Evelyn hugs Cristina
You
are
a
trip
(to Bernice) You're a beauty
Amazing girl
124
Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry
moans to herself over the display
Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice
Incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom window
Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as Flor ignores it
Bernice goes to embrace Cristina
My last chance to have some of you rub off on me
(Cristina doesn't understand) 'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse
(from her depths) How
And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but Flor manages
(to Cristina) Why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah
Flor flashes a look of thanks
'll be in front
Upset, Cristina runs off
She kisses Bernice
and walks toward the house
As she passes under the bedroom
Please come see me
And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck
Flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange ' It's okay, honey
we'll see each other at school
'm going to keep an eye on you
will
Flor enters the house
181
-
181 She stands waiting
walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms, wondering if John is there
Finally, as she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her things and meet her out front
Cristina, agitated, moves off to comply
then Deborah appears in the same spot
125
Please stick your head in here for a minute
Flor nods and starts up the stairs
182
-                                    182 Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside
then closes it
What's with avoiding me, am  this horrible person
As Flor just looks at her
(') know
It's a ridiculous question but sometimes 'm ridi
No
It's a good question
fine question
Complicated
(beat then) was just thinking to answer
Oh stop
Come on
Weren't we close
(like a shot) No
(truly hurt) Well, 'm very, very disappointed to hear that
It makes me feel like a fool
(compassion forces a crumb) We weren't close
but we were connected
in a bad way
(strangely soothed) You know something,  think we're saying the same thing
Look as long as we're doing closure
What did you and my husband, John, do last night
Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined
can only tell you what  did
126
That will be sufficient
(these are tender feelings) became sure of what an incredibly lucky woman you are and  must make myself not envy you which is hard
No, it's not hard
It's impossible
Now please
am exhausted
Same here - believe me
Deborah would hug
but it's only an eighth of a gesture because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to hurry as she goes
Cristina, apurate
183
-                                     183 As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she punches in the exit code
As it swings open to reveal John
184
-
184 As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her
was hanging out here waiting
Can't give you guys a lift
Flor shakes her head "no
" She looks away for a beat so the next thing she does is a considered action
She leans forward and kisses him on the lips
John looks at her
(') This is killer
(on her confusion) Incredibly hard
Yes, Cari
The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful of loot
(reading Flor) Let her have it
party favors
127
She nods
bites back some emotion and turns from him
Cristina
Goodbye, Mr
Clasky
am very sorry we will not see each other as frequently
She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on the back
Yes
They turn and begin walking down the street
- The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the background
As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in Spanish
The first minute we were alone, my mother told me that  would no longer go to the private school
No
No
You can't
won't be able to forgive you
It will be the end
won't let you
And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along with enormous dedication
Cristina dropping presents
picking them up
one of them left by the wayside
People noticing
Cristina's conduct violating tacit zoning laws
So we can see their faces in the struggle
185
185 As they wait
Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control herself
My mother changed our lives once more
This time because she saw in me, to her great alarm, a character flaw of some size
She has taught me to be a watch dog of my character, to control my ambition
am not quite there
128
One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives
186
-
186 Almost empty - it's Saturday
Mother and daughter sit together by the giant window in the center of the bus
Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak with stoic dignity
The girl is becoming less inconsolable and more in need of mothering
(') For that reason should you choose to grant me your scholarship my mother, at my request, will be relocating to the New York Metropolitan Area so that she can stay close during my time at Princeton
Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and wraps her in her arms
kisses her head
(') hope my essay has done her justice
love her with all my heart
