We see three faces in lamplight, looking down
They have been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes and disarranged clothing
One is a young gentlewoman with a sweet girlish face,  ; the second is an elderly , stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis- kers,

closes her eyes
can tell you now,  thought she wouldn't, () 've brought up two of them, but this is my wife's first, she isn't battle-scarred yet
Doctor
Will my girl be all right
0 Oh, by morning she'll be knocking down Captain Kellerfs fences again
Is there nothing we should do
() Put up stronger fencing, ha
Just let her get well, she knows how to do it better than we do
These things come and go in infants, never know why
Call it acute congestion of the stomach and brain
moves after the , we hear them off-camera; we see only ' face hovering over us, her hand adjust- ing the blanket
'll see you to your buggy, Doctor
() 1 ( ) 0 Main thing is the fever's gone
've never seen a baby, more vitality, that's the truth -- Their voices and footsteps fade
is bent lovingly over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play- ful with the baby's face
Hush
Don't you cry now, you've been trouble enough
Call it acute congestion, indeed,  don't see what's so cute about a con- gestion, just because it's yours
We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it
Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to -- Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come
(She screams) 2
standing lamp in hand watching the doctor's buggy recede in the night
Suddenly from the house behind him comes a knifing scream
wheels, the scream comes again and the  follows 's run with the lamp across the yard

runs into the house and up the dark stairs

bursts into the bedroom where  is screaming at the crib, her look intent on the baby and terrible
Katie, what's wrong
Look
() c o
w- u She makes a pass with her hand in the crib, at the baby's eyes
(Cont'd) She can't see
Look at her eyes
She takes the lamp from him, moves it before the child's face
She can't seel () Helen
Or hear
When  screamed she didn't blink
Not an eyelash -- Helen
Heleni She can't hear youl His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name;  almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry

The stairs in the Keller House
In the foreground we see the bannisters, in the background the wall
shadow
of the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old  appears on the wall, moving slowly
The two Negro children scamper past -- their excited laughter coming to us, in contrast to the mute
In , in the , ' little hands come into the frame, grasping the bannister rail

lookin`, down on lines of bed sheets hung up in the Keller yard to dry
It appears to be a kind of () 6 maze, the sheets blowing in the wind; and staggering among them is the figure of the child,  5 years old, reach- ing out, struggling, buffeted by the damp, blowing sheets, towards the figure
lashes out, her face frightened, unknowing --- she pulls down a sheet, be- comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical
In the comes rushing from the house -- to help her

There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a we see , 7 years old, reaching up into tree
At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha, 7 years, looking in
HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball and rips it down, shattering at her feet coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS hands, another ball, she pulls it down
We see her face, blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and beyond her the other children watching

We see the lonely expanse of field with 0 a low grass sprouting up, in the  is the Keller house perhaps
Going slowly across the field is the figure of the child , Patty Duke
From in under  comes , following her

Scene will be out  up until   : Now we are in leaf-dappled sunlight in the Keller yard, on three kneeling children and an old dog around the pump
with jug on way to barn to get milk
The dog is a setter named , and she is sleeping
Two of the children are Negroes,  and
The third child is , quite unkempt, in body a vivacious little person with a fine head, attractive, but noticeably blind, one eye larger and protruding; her gestures are abrupt, insistent, lacking in human restraint, and her face never () 10 smiles
She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, ' hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements of their lips
The  is on this; the dialogue is only background
() First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then -- Why you cuttin' off that doctor's legs
'm gonna give him a operation
Now 'm gonna cut off his arms, one, two
Now 'm gonna fix up She pushes ' hand away from her mouth
You stop that
Cut off his stomach, that's a good operation
No, 'm gonna cut off his head first, he got a bad cold
Ain't gonna be much of that doc- tor left to fix up, time you finish all them opera-- But  is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them away
now fingers her own lips, moving them in imitation, but soundlessly
Again the  on this
What you do, bite hand
That's how  do, she keep pokint
her fingers in my mouth,  just bite 'em off

Looka her try in' talk
is scowling, the lips under her fingertips moving in silence, growing more and more frantic, until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers
This sends  off into laughter, but alarms :
Hey, you stop now
She pulls '  hand down, You just sit quiet and But at once  topples  on her back, knees pinning her shoulders down, and ;-ravs the sissors

Obviously not hearing,  commences to go around from person to person, tapping her eyes, but no one attends or understands
(No break) As long as there's the least chance
For her to see
Or hear, or -- There isntt
Now  must finish here
think, with your permission, Captain, 'd like to write to the Perkins School
said no, Katie
0 Why, writing does no harm, Arthur, only a little bitty letter
To see if they can help her
They can't
We won't know that; to be a fact, Captain, until afLLer you write

quickly turns  away, and retrives the papers

(Staring up) What
Some asylum
It's the kindest thing
Why, she's your sister, James, not a nobody -- Half sister, and half-mentally defective, she can't even keep herself clean
It's not pleasant to see her about all the time
Do you dare
Complain of what 0 you can see

The house is at sixes and sevens from morning 'til night over the childl  want some peace here, don't care how, but one way we won't have it is by rushing up and down the country every time someone hears of a new quack

Helena My buttons
() 10 14 pushes the buttons into the doll's face 0 now sees, comes swiftly to kneel, lifts ' hand to her own eyes in question
Eyes
nods energetically
She wants the doll to have eyes
Another kind of silence now, while  takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes
stands, caught, and watches morosely,   blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress
My goodness me, 'm not decent
She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev
'll sew them on again
() 40 It's worth a couple of buttons, Kate, look
now has the doll with eyes, and cannot contain herself for joy; she rocks the doll, pats it vigorously, kisses it
This child has more sense than all these men Kellers, if there's ever any way to reach that mind of hers

Helen
All are in commotion, the baby screams, but  un- perturbed is lying her doll in its place,  on her () 11 15 knees, pulls her hands off the cradle, wringing them; 0  is bewildered
Helen, Helen, you're not to do such things, how can  make you -- (Hoarsely, handing the baby to  ) Katie
How can  get it into your head, my darling, my poor -- Katie, some way of teaching her an iota of discipline has to be () How can you discipline an afflicted child
Is it her fault
0 ' fingers have fluttered to her Mother's lips, vainly trying to comprehend their movements; we are close on these two
didn't say it was her fault
Then whose
don't know what to dot How can  teach her, beat her -- until she's black and blue
It's not safe to let her run around loose
Now there must be a way of confining her, somehow, so she can't--- Where, in a cage
She's a growing child, she has to use her limbs
Answer me one thing, is it fair to Mildred here
() 12 15 () Are you willing to put her away
Now ' face darkens in the same rage as at herself earlier, and her hand strikes at ' lips catches her again, and  begins to kick, struggle, twist
Now what
She wants to talk, like -- be like you and me
She holds  struggling until we  from the child her first sound so far, an inarticulate weird noise in her throat such as an animal in a trap might make; and releases her
The second she is free, blunders away collides violently with a chair, falls, and sits weeping
comes to her, embraces, caresses, soothes her, and buries her own face in her hair, until she can control her voice
0 Every day she slips further away
don't know how to call her back
Oh, 've a mind to write to Boston myself
If that School can't help her, maybe they'll know somebody who can
(Presently, heavily) 'll write to Perkins, Katie
