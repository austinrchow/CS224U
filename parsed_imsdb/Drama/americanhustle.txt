- , not a small man, gets dressed and meticulously constructs his combover
Camera  , see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing himself before a performance
Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to another room
3 Irving composes himself -- looks into cramped surveillance closet, there are  Agents -- we only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees a         : , swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit, pinky ring, Rotary Club pin --    , preppie shady businessman
He exhales pressure, turns as   : (who will also be known for some time as  ), stylish crafty smart
They stare at each other intensely -- they have a deep and emotional relationship , and in walks  , Bronx-born
He stands there
What are you doing, going behind my back
Telling people 'm screwing up this operation
got you a suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel
The shittiest suite at the Plaza Hotel
What
The shittiest fuckin' suite
Based on what--
2
And the food is wrong, and--What is this
You, like, went in my closet or something
No Are you dressing him like you're dressing me now
(shakes her head) No, what are you thinking
This isn't all about you, you know that
What, did you try to dress me so would look like him
No, you're not dressed like him, all right
But  do,  look like him
No, he's in like, velvet
Come on
You asked me to show you how this was done, you wanna fuck it up be my guest
What is your problem
Hey, look,  never laid a hand on her, all right
Is that what this is about
(British accent) Well technically, that's not true
Look, we never had sex ok
just -- 3
(') What'd  do
put my hand like this -- Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very carefully, not forcefully
Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his face
Don't you fucking touch me
That bothers me -- Oh it does
Oh yeah
That bothers you
Yes
You know, a lot of shit bothers me too, but  was trying to help you
If  wanted to bother you, if really wanted to fucking bother you, this is what 'd do
Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent so much time creating
Irving just stands there, hair ruined, staring at Richie
You shouldn't have done that
Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and messed up looking very angry
How's that
You bothered now
(no answer) Alright, don't make a thing of it
You shouldn't touch him
He doesn't like that
4
Oh my god, fix his hair
Don't make a thing of it
It takes some time, ok
Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in silence with his hair all over the place
She carefully starts helping him put it back together
Big fucking deal
We got to get in the other room, come on
The mayor's in there
Yes  know that
Should we go to the beauty parlor
Is that what we should do
Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on the dresser
Inside are stacks of cash
Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together
How's it look
You look fine
Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and intense
Let's go

-                         6 : , , , -- thought he was going to be here
do business face to face, person to person
That's just who  am
Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over to Carmine unprompted
' '     `
'
' ,  , Whoa, excuse me, excuse me
'll handle that for the Mayor
No, it's for the Mayor
It would be a sign of disrespect to the sheik if the mayor didn't take it himself
It's for you Mayor
Carmine looks angry and confused
He looks over to Carl
What are you doing
What-- (to Carl) Carl, what the fuck
What is this
No, 'll handle it
'm gonna take care of-- Everything's good got everything under control
( ) That's for me
handle all that for mayor
What is this
Irving looks over and says nothing
Not surprised at all how badly this is all going
6
Edith whispers to Richie
(whispers to Richie) Just stop it, ok (whispers to Edith) He's gotta take it himself, okay
don't know what the fuck that is but it's weird you understand
Misunderstanding
Misunderstanding
came here to meet a sheik, that's all  know
'm very interested in that but he's not here apparently
Carl
Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room
(') 'm very interested in meeting the Sheik
You let me know when could happen
Thank you, have a good day
Carmine leaves the room
Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders
Not surprised at all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has ruined it
(leaving) Irving
You better come get him
(stares at Irv) Go out there and get him right now
Help me get him back
Go get him
He needs to take the fuckin' briefcase, Irving
7
didn't wanna do it in the first place
This is your show,  go get him
No, you have no choice
You have to go get him
Now, go get him, so he takes the briefcase by himself
That's the whole plan, Irving
Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face
What were you doing pushing the fucking briefcase, dummy
Huh
The whole fuckin' thing was falling apart
You know how much  paid for this goddamn hotel that you fucking asked for
Now  gotta go mop up your mess
'm gonna go fucking mop up your mess
Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to get Carmine
- Irving paces back and forth as he waits for the elevator
- We push in on the concerned face of Sydney as Richie rambles on to her
You understand what 'm saying, right
It wasn't working
- Irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting for the elevator

(
) Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad
Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again
learned how to survive when  was a kid

(
) would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week, especially after  saw how my father got taken
mean, seeing that scarred me for life
-  1940' Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock through each window on the store, smashing them all
(
) (') took it upon myself to drum up business
became a different kind of guy than my father
became a con artist -- from the feet up, for real
: :
-  - Irv shakes his head, surveys the damage

was gonna survive no matter what
still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side

'   -                                    7G Irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on the phone
What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all around him
(
) And  did some art dealing on the side
Stolen or forged art

Jamming early 70s  party -- -while inside steamed glass ;      , , pale, out of shape, gold chains, in swim trunks,      , slim, hairy, chains
(
) So, one January  go to my friends pool party in Long Island
Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when he turns and sees Sydney for the first time
: Irving
He looks up, they lock eyes across the party
'     -- she turns, taken aback - Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet
She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet
As a matter of fact, it is
He died this year, you know
10
know
doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it
Well  care
He saved my life many times
Irving takes a good look at her, impressed
(impressed) Mine too
Which one
Jeep's Blues
(smiles, warm) Jeep's Blues
Oh yeah
Awkward pause
(') You wanna hear it
Right now
Yeah
Sure
:       '  as Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa
Who starts a song like that
It's magic
Magic
They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out
11
(
) He wasn't necessarily in good shape, and he had this comb-over that was rather -- elaborate
He had this air about him
And he had this confidence that drew me to him
He was who he was and he didn't care
(
) Like me, she was a very particular person
Like me, she came from a place where her options were limited -- and she had been someone she didn't want to be in her past
--      , (
) It actually can feel kind of sexy sometimes
There's a boldness in it
But where would that boldness take me
didn't know
But  was gonna find out

) Like me, she learned to survive and reinvent herself
She knew she had to reinvent her life and her identity
And like me, she envisioned a better elegant future for herself
Like me, she knew you had to have a vision
-- Sydney looks at scrap of paper with info in her hand -- looks up at office building address -- enters
(
) She came to New York
She envisioned it
() 12
(
) (') And just like that, she applied for a job at Cosmopolitan Magazine
12
-                          12 Clean bright colors, huge blown up Cosmo covers -- Sydney -- innocent, plain, slacks and blouse, hair back, nervously awaits interview
--  , small crumpled scrap of paper in hand,    -- 13
-                          13 Well you're obviously here for a reason
Let's get to it
Alright
Our cover story right now is on cunnilingus
What do you think about that
like it
Do you have any clerical skills
Yes
Can you type
(
) She was unlike anybody  ever knew
She was smart
She saw through people in situations
And she knew how to live with passion and style
She understood Duke Ellington

) was broke, fearless, with nothing to lose -- /
-    - Irv and Sydney dance slowly
(
) (') -- and my dream,   more than anything, was to   become anyone else other than who    was
24
--                           24 Irv holds the door open for Edith as she enters
--  got two in the Bronx and three in Manhattan
(to an employee) Hey, Byron
(
) He had a chain of dry cleaning stores
He asked me to come in and upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot of nice things got left behind by people and forgotten over the years- mean you wouldn't believe the shit that people leave behind here
Unbelievable
People leave stuff here
Oh yeah
They go out for the night, they drink, come here in the morning, put their clothes in and then they forget
They got no idea where they left it
Irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress
(') Look at that
Sequined thing don't know
Is that nice or not
14
It's beautiful
Irving and Sydney continue to walk through towards the back and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes
mean, some of it's been here for years
They're not picking it up
Nobody's picking it up
Sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the racks
(') You like that
love it
It's yours
You want it
It's yours
Sydney looks back at Irving in shock
: -
(') You look fantastic
Oh my god
can only dream about these dresses
They're beautiful
: , , ,
: ,    --  , ,    , (
) felt like we had a secret
Just the two of us
You know like that thing where you want to just be with the one person the whole time
15
(
) You feel like the two of you understand something that nobody else gets
could just tell her everything about myself
And never had anybody like that in my life before
felt like finally, can truly be myself without being ashamed, without being embarrassed

Irv's dingy office -                                  39 Irv leads Sydney into a small, dingy Manhattan office on an upper floor
What is this place
Do you sell art here
Yeah, sometimes
This is my office
know it's your office, but, you have these other places
What's this for
Why did you bring me here
This getting to be my main business, my growing business help get loans for guys that can't get loans
'm their last resort
You're their last resort
Because interest rates are north of 12% and heading to 18%
That's right, smarty pants
Fucking Jimmy Carter
Fucking Nixon really
And the war and the deficit and all of that shit
love you, you're so smart
You are
Thanks kid but how do you get them the money
16
Well -- You don't do you
You don't
These guys are lousy risks, you know
can't get them a loan but get my fee
Five thousand
Five thousand
You take five thousand and you don't give them anything
These are bad guys, you know
They got bad divorces, gambling habits, embezzling, all that shit, you know what  mean
Everybody at the bottom crosses paths eventually in a pool of desperation and you're waiting for them
How about `we'
We
How bout it
Sydney turns and begins walking out the door as Irving chases her out
(') Sydney
Sydney 'm sorry that was too much
went too far
didn't want to upset you
She continues walking out without looking back and leaves
(') Sydney please, 'm sorry
know it ain't for everybody
The door slams in Irving's face 17
(') (Irving shouts to the closed door) Ah   love getting to know you
'   - , ( ) What  do that for
fucked it up
should never tell a woman the truth
She's so smart
She's different
--
You said it was nice knowing me
You said it was nice to meet me
Yeah
(British accent) Would you like to meet Lady Edith Greensly
Irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand
(') (British accent) have royal banking connections in London
'd love to help you with your loan but of course  have to be very selective
That was fucking fantastic
Thank you
Did you like it
18
liked it
didn't think you were coming back
Thank god you came back
wasn't going anywhere
fucking love you
You have me

40 '  , , walk out of a 's (34) house pushing a stroller as the business man comes chasing after them
(
) And so Irving and  began our partnership -- in love and commerce
Rebecca, hold on
You're Edith right
(
) He told me to tell my friends  had (in British accent) London banking connections 'm Jim
'm her employer
Listen - - she told me you can get me a line of credit
know you have banking connections in London, England
(
) And after that
say "no" a lot until the guy is hooked
Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman chases after them
19
Becky tell her
've never missed a check
(walking away) (
) It was almost scary how easy it could be to take money from desperate people
: 41
'   -                                     41 Edith extends her hand to greet  , 35
Edith is dressed in a more sophisticated high end British fashion
Lady Edith Greensly, it's so good to see you again
, 35 Lady -- your ladyship -- thank you again
(
) These are the roles that we were meant to play
42
'   -                              42 Another desperate businessman sits across from Edith and Irving
We're very selective
You got a strong application
We'll talk about it
'   -  ,
don't take a deal that  can't close
20
You're not being aggressive enough in putting up your assets -- The man looks nervous -- Have you ever been to Queens
Have you ever been to Great Neck
Everybody knows my dealerships
desperate man takes out a    and writes his check
Five thousand gets me fifty right
Five will get me thirty five
Is that right
, 35 Five grand gets me fifty
'   - Sydney and Irving laugh and celebrate
(
) was doing so much more business with her
mean it doubled, then it tripled
'   - Sydney -- hair getting bigger -- goes over the books with a Latino Man who nods and watches her -- Edith counts cash in the register - recounts it -- explains how things can be done better as    nods
Irv watches happy
(
) And  never met anyone, man or woman, in business who was so careful and precise about everything
Every stylistic detail
21
- Irving and Edith discuss a piece of art they're in the process of selling to a businessman
(
) We kept selling art together, too
It's really a fabulous example of a genre painting, which is really rare for the time
It's a boy and his dog
Non-religious painting
55
Golden age
Dutch painting
--     -- -- ( ) -- Paul Klee
Bauhaus Movement
1920s
Before we go any further, is this legit
Let's just say it's missing from Spain and leave it at that
Don't show any Spanish friends
Irving and Sydney kiss passionately in front of the middle aged car dealer as he tries to hand them his check
(
) mean it just took off
We got an elegant Manhattan office
We called it London Associates for her accent

-   -                    44 : to a pale wall as he and Edith sip champagne from flutes and offer one to the worker who toasts with them
22
,  , Irv and Edith kiss gently, lovingly, sincerely on the lips -- They walk into their  , , (
) When  was around her  felt joy
Fucking joy
And love
That's what felt
: 46
-                                      46 47   They dance down Park Avenue together
47 - Irv and Edith dance through the lobby
49                                                 49 As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet plays "'ve Got Your Number"
Camera circles them, putting their foreheads together, very happy quietly as they dance close
50
--                               50 Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces -- He gets up, she watches him dress and leave -- 52
'  -                                      52 53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge
53 (
) As, as far as  could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted
We even con ourselves

54
/
'  -                                 54 55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55 56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch
Irv       56 gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his house -- (
) We talk ourselves into things
We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up
We leave out the risk
We leave out the ugly truth
57
'  -                                         57 Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer everywhere
He walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball -- that is taped to the refrigerator
(
) Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life
Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes -- with low sounds now of
-- Irv goes to on it -- Irv        5   ,
(
) He was married, and he had a son
58
'  -                                        58 is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread all around him
Irv stands holding the picture
Danny looks over his shoulder
(
) He had adopted her son
24
(
) He was a really good dad and respected him for that
It was a tough situation for everyone
Irv's face lights up
Danny
This is a fantastic picture
What did you do today
That kid Donovan is being mean to me
The big kid
thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you
She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards
Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on
What fire
Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it
[Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp
She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire
Irv looks concerned
59
-                                     59 Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned
put out the fire
The fire is out
For the first time in my life  do the right thing
25
Oh shut up -- save a young single mother, and her kid
marry her
adopt him - You fell in love
Don't forget we fell madly in love
Yes,  fell in love
My God, fell in love
Yes
But you know what
thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach mean, 'm dying here
And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you
You're young, you're beautiful
You gotta find somebody else
You gotta go out and get some friends all right
Don't sit inside -- don't like going out
You know that  get anxiety when  have to meet people
You know how hard that is
Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp
Alright
And  can't--  mean, look,  can't trust you with it anyway
That fire and everything can't trust to leave you with Danny
put the fire out Irving
There is no fire
Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place
Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if  was here
26
Just stop with the whole fire thing
God it was a mistake
'm sure a million people do that all the time
Those sun lamps are dangerous
Shouldn't even have them in the house, really
bet that happens all the time
This was nothing
We're not happy
Alright
Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying nothing
You know that  could take Danny
You know that most of your work is illegal
And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- 'm not saying that  would, but 'm saying that  could
And 'm saying that that is why  don't like divorce, Irving
Women do that in divorces
Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them
My mother never got divorced
My grandmother never got divorced
There are  divorces in my family
am not getting a divorce
Come on
What are we doing here
We fight and we fuck and that's what we do
That's our thing
(
) She was the Piccaso of passive aggressive karate
She was better than any con artist 'd ever met including myself
And she had me like nobody had me
Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard
Irving, come to mama
Come on
27
(
) You might say she was my karma for how  took advantage of people
Irving, come here
Come on
Get into bed
Alright

Cell is unlocked by Richie Dimaso  enters with a cup and saucer of tea
He stands near her with the tea
(to the other side of the two-way mirror) Joe, how come the fluorescents are on
Can we kill that, please
(to Syd) Jesus  put this lamp here for you 'cause  thought it'd be better for you
There's a wire here
They're scared because people hang themselves but  know you're too smart for that
Where's the table and chair
There's no bed here
It's like a fucking asylum
Joe, is everybody off today
Jesus Christ it's scary
Maybe  wanted to scare you
don't know
Maybe it was my idea
Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know
don't know
You look dehydrated
Here, want to try some tea
Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped
(re: tea) It's herbal
My favorite
Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer
She lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips
(') know you think -- look at me
Hey
Edith
() 33
(') know you think Irv loves you know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you
And you think you're at the top of that list
But what if you're not
What if you're not even on the list at all
He'd be in here right now if he took the check
She thinks about this
She trembles
(') He'd be in here right now if he took the check
But no, you did
God, it's, it's so clear to me
It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you
He uses you, Edith, to protect himself
To protect his son and his wife in Long Island
No
Yes
He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son
They have huge house, they have two cars
What does she do all day
'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches
, and she spends your money, the money that you make
Edith stares at Richie, taking this in
(') don't like that you're in jail while he's going free
don't like any of that
want to help you
All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good
It's not real
It's fake
It's not real
Who you are is who you are, between you and God
You and your soul
That's what matters
That's what counts
That's what 'm about
And that's what  see in you
Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other
Am  crazy
don't think so
'm not supposed to be talking like this, but  don't care,  break the rules
Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what he's saying
34
(') Okay, Edith
Edith
want to help you
like you
(whispers)  like you
(dead serious)  like you

,   ,  -             67 Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at Sydney
Richard Dimaso walks in
Been in there three days
Hasn't been so good for her
Irv continues to stare at Sydney
(') How does that make you feel her in there
That check was for you, right
But you knew somethin' was off
That's 'cause you're good
You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you
Irv looks at him
(') But you know what
If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala
You ever been in Guatemala
You ever been in jail in Guatemala
You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala
That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country
Who made you god and judge
My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old
Never lied in her life
Congratulations
35
Thank you
'm proud of that, too
Does that make her not a good person
Is that not something to strive for
Why you breaking my balls
Get to the point
see something in you, Irving get very excited
think that we have a lot of potential here
Now, look
came up with the idea
It's all from me
want to change things
want to go after white collar crime
Irving, you're very skilled
And  want you to teach me and we can do this
want four people that do what you do
Fraudulent investments
Fake certificates of deposit
Stolen art, fake art
You get me four people and you're off the hook
Four busts and you'll leave us alone
We don't have to testify
You're good, you're done
Anything you want
But if you run, then your life is over
You'll be hunted, and it's gonna be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country

Sydney has finally changed her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding cell
It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from 3rd Avenue below
We need to leave
We need to run and we need to do it now
We can go to Estonia or Romania,  don't care, we'll take the cash from the bed and get out of here, alright
We talked about it a hundred times
36
Irv stares at her and struggles
What about Danny
What about Danny
adopted him
gave him my name
'm not leaving him with Rosalyn, she's unstable
That's a manipulation
Rosalyn's will never let you go
She'll use Danny against you because she's too messed up to let you leave
can't leave him
love him
Alright
He's my son
Richie said you would say that
Richie
What, the cop
Your on a first name basis with him
Yes  am
'm not even on your list am
What list
Your list
Your short list
Your long list
'm not even on anyone of your fucking lists
thought you loved me
thought we had something
We do have something
love you, it's perfect
What are you saying
We're gonna go to Romania
We're gonna take Danny
Yes
Yes, that's what 'm saying
You, me, Danny
37
Well you never said that before
'm saying it now
We're us, and we can make it an adventure like we did
We can make it an adventure like we make everything, alright
But we have to go now
We have to leave right now
can't leave Danny
'll lose custody
You have to take me away
We have to leave
(sobbing) What are you saying
Oh my god
What are you doing
Please
Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her apartment
Irving follows
can't believe this is happening
Don't say  don't love you because that's bullshit
(sobbing) This is bullshit
You are bullshit
We are bullshit
She starts sobbing, shaking
Please don't do this
just never thought you were conning me
could never con you
love you
Please don't say this
38
Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as she sobs
No, 'm done
Don't say that
(cries) 'm gonna do these four busts, these four cons, to get us out of this
Not just me, but us
And 'm gonna get really close with Richie, the cop, in case we need to use him, if we need another move
We don't need another move
We need four busts, and we're done
We are going to need another move, trust me
And you're going to be thanking me
(shifts to British accent) The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe and  want to believe that we were real, and  want to believe that a man could want me
And 'm gonna take all of that heartbreak, and all of that sorrow, and  am going to use it
And 'm going to make Richie think that  want him, and that  like him, and 'm going to be very convincing -- And 'm pissed at you
Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on
(') Because 'm pissed at you
Irving stares at Sydney with confusion
He's never seen her like this before
(') Maybe  do like him -- Maybe  like him a lot
From the feet up right -- baby
Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room
39
(') Quite your belly aching and come up with something to get us out of this
And you're right -- 'm in no state to deal with this so what's it gonna be, Mister Mastermind

How do you think this works, stupid
If you could not call him `stupid' which he's isn't, he's smarter than you
Last  checked he's in control here and we work for him now so be nice
Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him
He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in
(stares at her, upset) , to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees
In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing
Then those guys will want to sell fake bank  to  guy, take the sheik's money, see
Richie looks at Irving uncertain
Only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us
40
Oh that's good
(') So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy- Keep your voice down
-- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need
-- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him
Right, but  don't tell Elway shit
wait for him to call me
The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now
Richie starts to look around
Where
Don't look
Richie looks anyway and sees ' , a man balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony
(') You have a good look
How do you know the Sheik
This is my friend Al from Queens
/ do aluminum siding and roofing
Richie stares, impressed
41
-   - Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a painting on the wall
want to show you something
This Rembrandt here
People come from all over the world to see this
Yeah, he's good
It's a fake
Wait, what're you talking about
That's impossible
People believe what they want to believe
Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody
Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger
Richie's continues to stare at the  on the wall
That's a fake
That's the way the world works
Not black and white as you say
Extremely grey
'  walks up to Irving and the group and steps into the conversation
' Irving can  -- How many times  gotta tell you
You can't meet the sheik, alright
Edith sees this and steps into the conversation
Arthur
Hi
Edith
We've met before
42
(') wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer
We're advising the Sheik together
She looks at Richie
Richie offers his hand

What's this  hear about a god damn Sheik
Why you leaving me out of this
gotta hear about it from my friends
It ain't for you Carl
What do you mean it ain't for me
We gotta do certificates of deposit
can print as many as you need
This is not a one man operation
Look,  can get other guys
What are you talking about Irving
You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week
The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone
43
Yes  can make that happen
Carl Elway can do what he says he's going to do
That's interesting but you know 've got other guys lined up
've got a meeting with my associates
' ,
Richie Dimaso and Edith    --   ' ' Carl, his associates are here
He's got a meeting he's got to go to
No wait
Don't go anywhere
've got to go
Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the doorway
(
) Crazy thing about people -- the more you say no, the more they want in on somethin
It is so stupid
Irving looks over at Richie and Edith
'll tell them, don't worry
Hey you know what Carl just told me
He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week
Or we could do somethin' much bigger
Richie jumps into the conversation
Something bigger
My guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars
How much bigger
He walks over to Carl
44
Hundreds of million --  knew you were holdin' out on me Irving
Hundreds of millions of dollars
Like much bigger
Like 'm talking about we say never the fuck mind the 's and we could have some complete access to something huge
Huge
Like what

Carl Elway
Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith, (') want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today
The rebuilding of Atlantic City

lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years
very beloved guy
guy who never gave up on his people
His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal
- Frank Sinatras  , 1940s version, as we see Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at breakfast
(
) big family guy with five kids
They even adopted some other kid
black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family
mean, his household was a joyous place
And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household
mean everyone loved this guy

He was the leader of the State Assembly
And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs
80   --     -- Carmine huddles with other       80 , horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the State Assembly
(
) But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem
So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time
And to me that meant corrupt 81                                                      :     81 You said grifters and con artists
We're not going after some politician
This is a bad idea, Richard
Shhhh
Look, it's really simple
All you need is to put two million in a Chase account -- What
(') -- under the Sheik's name -- Whose two million
47
Shh, just listen
Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control
Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account
Five days
'm not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers' money and putting it anywhere for five days,  don't care if we control it the whole time
Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration
Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country
That's my dream
Don't smother it, please
You know Richard,  understand your eagerness
really do
You know 'm from Michigan, right
Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother
We used to go ice fishing every November
Ice Fishing
That's what we lived for
Holy shit -- Just listen to me
It's beautiful
You have a little stove
You huddle around, you keep each other warm
You drop a line and you just wait
One year my brother says, "let's go in October
" He wants to go ice fishing in October
My dad says, "No, the ice is too thin
" My brother says --  love my brother he says -- 48
understand what's happening
You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying 'm too eager -- that's what you're saying
No, that's not what 'm saying
What are you saying
We'll finish the ice fishing story another time, young man
For now, no Carmine Polito
Go do your job
Richie looks at him annoyed and upset
(
) Stoddard shot the whole thing down
Boring
(
) (') But Edith was a genius

) (') She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room
woman 'd never heard of
Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau
This cat lady nobody even talked to
Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her
This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us

It was beautiful
Edith goes to hand her the   and basket of teas
Brenda, hi
Hi
You said you liked exotic food, so that's from England
That's from England
That's right
And  brought you some tea as well
Thank you so much
Nobody ever tells me about these operations, they just say, "Brenda, do the clerical wiring work and don't ask questions
" You need to tell Richie about your cats
He loves them
Oh my cats
Brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork
(') Well that's Harry -- look at him standing up, isn't that sweet
And that's Wendy
She's a rascal
But Barnaby, that's another story
Barnaby plays the piano
That's impressive
50
(
) (') We got her to wire two million dollars into an
-controlled account at Chase
It'd be there for five days and if Polito called he'd see that the Sheik was real
86                                                     86 Edith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways
(
) (') By the time Stoddard caught up to us Edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea
So before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him
,   , -- 'm very impressed
That was very smart
The Sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic
don't be modest
(
) Anthony Amado
He was the
Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself mean this guy loved the idea of being famous
And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss
'  -- 89       -- confused, dismayed
89 Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik -- '  - He hangs up, pissed, confused

You made me accept praise from my boss who's thanking me for something that never shoulda happened
Something that  didn't approve
You should be happy
There's imaginative things happening in this office, alright
We're not just working in a box

You want to wake him up
Oh no,  said we shouldn't do any of it, Irving
You know  said that
So now  support Richie
He's got vision
Do it heavy or don't do it
mean, he's the one ruining America, not me
How the hell am  ruining America
Because people just got over Watergate and Vietnam, alright
And you're gonna shit all over politicians again
And just because you want to be a big shot and get a promotion
No 'm thinking big
This is gonna be fantastic
We're doing video surveillance
'm doing this from the feet up
You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek

'm in and 'm out

That's the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on
And you can't do it
How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel
For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City
Why not
53
You need a luxury hotel for the Sheik
Come on
Carmine does back door dealings all the time
We don't have a budget for that Irving
You gotta knock the Mayor, the Speaker of the State Assembly -- you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet
He's gotta feel like he's out of his league
What you're offering, this deal,  mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country
sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City -- are you fuckin' kidding me
That's gigantic
And the Mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check
And that's why this meeting isn't happening, because to get millions, you need millions
Edith listens intently
(shrugs) We already did it
(stunned) What
Irv studies Richie and Edith
We got the bureau to park 2 million for three days -- we got the account numbers
`We' meaning you and him
Yeah we did it

Really
Yeah, me and that guy
She showed me
You showed him our thing
You did that without me
Are you kidding me

You playing me
Are we doing this

It'd be very bad for you if you're playing me
You're going to have to decide for yourself, kid,  just laid everything out on the table
This is all very exciting,  never knew life could be like this
You're wild
You know we're taking down a very important politician
Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she sits on the counter
He puts his hands on her hips, pulls her into him
He takes her hand -- puts it on his face, makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand

He's an Arab
They look at each other

Irv isn't sure what to say
Why you asking
Maybe it's a dumb question, but was just wondering --  would like to arrange for the Sheik to see Camden
To see the people of Camden
The people  serve
The people  love
Who are mostly black and Puerto Rican
really want him to see how good this is going to be for the community, how ready we are for this opportunity, and he can see how far his dollar will go
You know what  mean
What do you think
Yeah we can do that
He can see Camden

It's a microwave
It heats up everything
Pasta, lasagna, meatballs, whatever
Really
It's science, yeah
That's how it heats up the food
It's scientific
And you specifically bought this science oven for me
(Carmine stares meaningfully at Irv) Yes
new friend
Irv is touched
He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine, because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way

want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik
It can be a small jet
It doesn't even have to take off, cause  know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend
It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay
Alright, you can have a jet for an hour, but it takes off and lands at Teterboro

Okay, well, my brother and  were on the ice and my father came out of the house and  could see him coming
He was holding a lantern, and it was in the blizzard and knew he was gonna be angry
So went to intercept my father because knew if he saw what my brother was doing he was going to kill him
Richie cuts him off
So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me
Is that what the story's about
About protection
No, it's not about protection

Yeah
What would you do

, , , Carmine
(
) Victor Tellegio was from Miami
He was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man
In his prior reputation as an enforcer from twenty years ago, he was known to never bury a body because he felt it sent a stronger message to leave it in the street

-                                              125A , , ' , ,    , , : (
) This is the guy we now had to deal with
125B
-                               125B Carmine greets him
92
You sure you don't want to go into the Ocean Bar
It's really, it's beautiful in there
'm very happy    don't have to go there
like it   here
There's an exit
'm like a   ghost
Nobody knows 'm here
Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table
Everyone sits down
Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to Richie
(') Tell him  speak for our friends in Florida
We're very excited
It's been our lifelong dream to build casino resorts on the East Coast
Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear
(') You told him that
They didn't want the Jews to make money, they didn't want the Italians to make money, definitely don't want the blacks to make money
After the oil embargo -- the gasoline crisis -- the hijackings, the Olympics, they don't want to see Arabs make money, trust me, not on our soil
You can tell him this in your own way: 've been in the casino business forty years
It's scrutinized more carefully than any other business
Carmine made this legal, but we must be careful or they'll take it away
So, Mister Tellegio, how do you think we should approach this
What do you want to do
If you want to get the gaming license and keep it we have to make our principal investor here, the Sheik, an American citizen
93
Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure where this is going
To expedite citizenship -- well, that requires very special treatment
You would know the right people to do that, Carmine
Carmine knows everybody
What are we talking about
Senators
Congressmen
Wow, that's fantastic
say stay away from that
That's bad
That's trouble
No, that's not good
Irving please
That's trouble
Who is this guy
(to Irving) What are you, a farmer
Richie and Tellegio both laugh
Mr
Tellegio, 'm sorry, this is Irving
New York businessman
Irving Rosenfeld
Irving, Irving
What's the matter, Irving
What's the problem
Nothing
No problem
94
Don't get your balls in an uproar
Everything's fine, everything's good
It's all good
It's all good
just hope the other part of this is all good
And real
Because we're real
You know that
You deal with us
We're a real organization
We deal with you, we don't know what we're dealing with
Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence
This could go wrong at any minute
Tellegio looks over to Richie and points to the Sheik
Irving watches in horror as -- Where's he from
(winging it) Abu Dhabi
Oh, he's from the Emirates
Yeah
(in subtitled Arabic) (Can  count on you
You gotta be honest about this
Do you understand me
Good means good
No bullshit
) (') (to Sheik) (Did you hear what  said
Do you want me to repeat it
) Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table
(') (What do you think now
Tell me
Tell me
) Uh,  think,  think what he's -- 95
No, let him speak for himself
Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie
It's a very tense moment for everyone at the table
Tellegio stares
Everyone hangs on this
Irving and Richie share a look -- what is he doing
,  , a working man, friend of the Mayor , spilling drinks
Tellegio's guys jump in and grab him and start to pull him away
No,  know him
You guys are way too serious for a party
(to Tellegio) Hey, what are you drinking
You got a drink
(to Al) We're in a very serious meeting
(to Tellegio)  apologize
understand, you're in conference
You gotta come with me now
You got a speech to give
Everyone's waiting for you
Al, 'll be right behind you, okay
Trust me
Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio to shake his hand
Irving panics " "
(In Arabic) It is great doing business with you
The investment is real
It was a pleasure to meet you
Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything passable in Arabic
96
(
) What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic
But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand
Victor leans over to talk to Carmine
Listen to me carefully
If you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks
Carmine nods
(') Carmine, listen to me carefully, if you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the Sheik feel insulted, but our friends in Florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will
Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him
This is bad
-- " " -- , Rosalyn, you need to come with me alright
don't need to come with you
You need to come with me
This needs to stop
Come on
Oh, you think  should come with you
97
Yeah, you need to come with me right now
Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp
Why don't you get your fucking hands off me, you fucking whore
Hey
You're a whore
(to everyone) This is my husband's whore
That's real nice
We're not going to do this in the Ocean Room tonight
Not tonight
Please
This is my husbands whore
Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from Rosalyn
You stay over here with me
Everybody just calm down
don't know what's going on
Pete looks over to Rosalyn
You alright
Take it easy
These things happen
Whatever's meant to be will be
Rosalyn smiles at Pete
That's what  always say
You say that
Yeah
98
See
Kindred spirits
Whatever's meant to be will be
Whatever's meant to be will be
: '    - " "
126
'   -                              126 Rosalyn looks in mirror: sadness, anger, fear
Edith rushes in
What the hell do you think you're doing
What the hell do  think 'm doing
What the fuck do you think you're doing
You really gonna come in here and judge me for flirting with somebody after you've been fucking my husband for how many years
You don't have any fucking clue what's going on
Rosalyn holds her hand, with wedding ring to Sydney's face
got a ring on my finger
We have a child together
He doesn't love you Rosalyn he loves me
And you know it and know it and he knows it
And it might be done now, but it was beautiful and it was real
99
Stop
And we loved each other
Shut up
Rosalyn starts to tear up
You scare him, and you manipulate him, and you use your son
Well, he must like it on some level
He must want it because he keeps coming back for it
It's like that perfume that you love that you can't stop smelling, even when there's something sour in it
You can't get enough of it
But guess what, he's never gonna leave me
He's always going to want me, and will make you so sorry, Edith will make you so sorry for what you've done to my family, mark my words
That is fucked up
would never say anything that fucked up to anybody, but you do because you're gross inside, you're so fucked up and gross
Oh, 'm gross inside
Yeah
Maybe you're gross inside, with robbing people and all that shit that you do
Maybe we're both gross inside, that's what Irving loves about us
At least he's consistent with his women
You know, sometimes in life all you have are fucked up, poisonous choices
Rosalyn reaches over, grabs Sydney's face and kisses her
100
Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out
"
"
Sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her lips as Rosalyn storms out of the powder room
: 129       --            129 ' -    -      -  - -- :   , , : 130       ,          130 We need to talk
This is serious
: Ladies and gentlemen, your friend, the working man's friend, my friend, Mayor Carmine Polito
: Carmine Irving stands off to the side of the stage as his world closes in around him
Pulls his heart pills out of his pocket and takes one
Sydney sees this as she stands nearby with Richie
Irv, Edith, Richie watch near stage, jostled
Rosalyn enters the ball room looking disheveled as she is guided by Pete Musane looks to stage
101
(on mic) Hello, Camden
Hello, New Jersey
Hello, Atlantic City
[ ] lot of my friends been out of work [  - ]  lot of good hard working families just wanna
(crowd ) There's no money nowhere
You gotta be kidding me
-- don't they remember who built this country
[] The one thing we can all agree about in the State of New Jersey is that we never, ever give up
Do we
Carmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in his face as he says this
He raises his glass to the crowd
(') Please, raise a glass with me to a new era that begins tonight
From me and my family, we thank you
For all the hard work that you've given us in the community
Look what you've done
This is beautiful
Thank you

It's not your operation
And 'm not giving you a whole floor of the Plaza Hotel

They're taking bribes
This is happening right now

Stoddard
Shut up

Do you know who Victor Tellegio is
Victor

You know who that is

You're not getting ten million dollars
(screaming) Just listen to me
You're not listening to me

And your going to fucking do it
Lower your voice
You don't get to yell at me
Richie
Edith (  ) Calm me down baby
You gotta calm me down
He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass
(') Baby let's do this
Let's do this right now
-- 104
No, no

You're fucking skin is glowing baby
Your skin is glowing
'm not doing this with you
We're not going to do this unless we do it for real, alright
want to do this now
That's what we agreed on so we're not going to do that alright
Alright
Where are you
You're acting all scary
She grabs him by the head to calm him down
(') Are you here with me
(leans down to her eyes) love you
love you
Look at me
(slowly) 'm in love with you
It is real now
just said it so now's the time
He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on
(kissing him) You want the truth
You want real
'm ready for real
--      -- (   ) , this is real
Do you hear my voice
This is real
This is real
What you hear is real
105
Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney
What
This is me
What do you mean
What are you doing an accent
An American accent
No
There is no English
There's only American
There is no English
Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very confused and flustered
What are you talking about
Stop it
You're Edith
You're Edith Greensly
checked your records
falsified my records back to birth
falsified them
(') My name is Sydney Prosser, and 'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico
'm not Edith Greensly
There is no Edith Greensly
Richie steps back
He stares at her darkly
You're -- freaking -- me -- out
No, you said in the stall that we were going to be real and that we weren't going to fake it
'm being real now
This is who am
'm Sydney Prosser
Ok
So -- why -- did you do an English accent after that
'm sorry  didn't tell you in the stall
() 106
(') created Edith because  needed her to survive, okay
But 'm done with that now
'm so fucking done with that
Like you do what you need to survive, right
You do it
You know, you live with your mom -- you have a fiancee you don't even acknowledge, right
That's what you do
And you curl your hair in little fucking curlers, which is -- No, it's okay, you look good with it, but you know -- you have straight hair, so that's what you do to survive
You do all sorts of things, you know
We all do
(whispers tensely) Please don't talk about that
'm confused
'm confused and -- 'm fucking confused too, alright
--  think we should fuck, and then we'll feel it and we won't be confused anymore
-- No --  want to talk
don't want to fuck
(embracing her) Yes
Come on
'm not fucking you
'm not fucking fucking you
, a vein stands out in his neck
like an animal in confusion and frustration
, ' 107
Richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow
(') (in pain and dismay) They hear a door open off screen, someone approaches
Irving appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his handgun at Richie
Will you please step away from Edith
'm asking you nicely please step away from Edith right now
What the fuck -- Step away from her
Please
You mean Sydney
Irving looks over to Sydney very confused
told him
'm sorry
just don't give a fuck anymore,  don't give a fuck
don't fucking care
Irving has a gun
What Richie's gotten us into is worse then jail
told you last night, don't sit down with those goons
And what
Now what
No one's getting ten million for Tellegio
It's over
don't think so
Irving and Sydney stare
(') (slowly) Because when Tellegio finds out what happened, do you think he's gonna go after me
don't think so
Someone from the Bureau
() 108
(') Think he's gonna go after a politician
He's gonna kill you
Then he's going to go after your son
And Sydney
Richie       --
: (on phone) Stoddard Thorsen
(slowly, intensely) You're going to give me the Sherman Suite
The whole floor
That's a
said no wacko
And you're going to tell me the point of that  fishing story
Not the way you're behaving
() What's the matter with you
Where are you right now
What does that make a difference
Just tell me where the fuck you are
The field office on 61st street
'm coming to 61st Street
Right now
You're going to do what
To beat -- your ass
109
You're going to what
Richie  the phone down, storms out the apartment
140
'  -                                    140 You were right
We should have gone away
Irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess
Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca
(') should have gone away with you
We were supposed to do it from the feet up like you always said
That's how we were meant to do it but you didn't do it like that
You didn't do it like that
You played it safe so there was always a danger you were going to end up with Rosalyn in the dead space, floating on some dead spaceship with the furniture and the curtains
And  was your life line out and you were mine and that was ok
(Irving stares at her, emotional) wish  could get you back
He walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to Sydney
(') You know  can't do it without you
You know that
Come on
Me, you and Danny
Like we said
Like  said
You never said that said that
We gotta get over on all these guys
That's what we need to be thinking about right now
Irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes
110
That's big
That's crazy
Whatever it is, it's got to be the best we've ever done
Sydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together
141
-  -                         141 High ceiling, old office
Close on a tape recorder
-    , , ,    - - the tape recorder and microphone sit on the desk   in front of Stoddard as he records a statement for a report
(  ) Agent Dimaso called me late at night on the 21st
believe that he was intoxicated
He threatened me and  told him this was inappropriate
told him procedures exist for reasons we must respect
This is the third such call  received from Agent Dimaso
He called me again the night of the 5th and he threatened to kill me
Subsequently he demanded that  allow him to use the Sherman Suite at the Plaza hotel for purposes of bribing members of congress
Camera pull-back reveals:   Richie ,
He's in trouble with their boss, the prosecutor
am so sorry
'm not finished
There's a lot more
Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard
Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit again
111
have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor
(he reaches down and turns the tape recorder off) and as my -- (re: the recorder) What are you doing
just want to talk from my heart
don't want it on record
want to get vulnerable
Can  finish
Can  finish my statement
Of course
respect you
think you do other things besides respect me
: 139
'   -                        139 Stoddard paces while on the phone, holds up a finger to Richie to wait, Richie picks up Stoddard's phone -- rips the cord out and smashes Stoddard across the face with the base
Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over desk chair and bookcase behind
: - They stare at each other
It's just hard for me to control my passion
'm a very passionate person
(looks to Amado) You're from New York
You understand this
He goes ice fishing in the midwest
That was told to you in confidence
112
He's an ice fishing guy
Look at him
: -  - Where we left off
Stoddard reaches with bloodied hands across -- what is he reaching for
Oh, on a small table, a gun and a clip
What are you doing pulling out your gun
Stop it
That's not you
No, it's me
This is me
It's me
Don't do something that you don't know anything about
Alright
Richie grabs his gun and starts to load it
'll show you how it's done
'm not even going to hit you
He points the gun at Stoddard
(') Watch this fucko
: - Richie and Stoddard stare at each other in silence
So, you want to use the Sherman Suite
The entire floor
Stoddard throws his head back, looks at ceiling in exasperation
113
Yes
At the Plaza Hotel
What happened to the Mafia thought you were -- This is where they intersect
This is where the two things intersect
The Politicians and the Mafia
Victor Tellegio's people who run resorts international -- Victor Tellegio showed his face
Yes
sat with him
sat with Victor Tellegio
hung out with him
We can get him
We can get his whole organization as well as getting any number of congressmen
mean, that's just peeling the first layer of the onion
Wow
How you going to do that
We would get ten million dollars and put it into an account -- Ten Million dollars
And that's how we just let them know we're for real
What does he say he's gonna do for the ten million dollars
How are we trapping him
He promises to build casinos, handle the skims, do the licencing - 114
And you have him on tape saying this
You have that right
No
(to Richie) want you to find a safer way to get Victor Tellegio on a wire
No ten million dollars -- that's crazy
Thank you
Richie looks down, defeated
Even to entrap Tellegio it's crazy
But you can have the Sherman Suite - --Stoddard, please -- To go and get me some congressmen
Go get some congressmen taking bribes
want to pinch us some congressmen, ok
You come back to me
'm proud of you
Thank you
(then as an afterthought) And Stoddard
143
-     -           143 Richie and Stoddard walk down large, echoey Federal building corridor
Stoddard walking ten feet ahead turns and points at Richie
(shouts bitterly) Good luck keeping your job, by the way, and staying out of jail -- and not being killed by the Mob
But other than that you're doing a great job
Stoddard turns and storms off
115
(as Stoddard walks away) What's the end of the ice fishing story
'm not telling you the end of the ice fishing story
'm going to call your fucking brother and find out from him
My brother's dead
That's how it ends
He fell through the fucking ice
(shouts bitterly) No it's not
He died a different way, many years later
He storms off and leaves Richie staring in the hallway
-- Establishing
145
-     -  145 Richie walks out of a surveillance room and down the hallway to where Irv and Sydney wait
Listen  know it's awkward and just want to say 'm sorry, alright
think we can stick together and still fulfill our goal
mean, we got the Sherman Suite
You got the whole floor
We got the whole floor, yeah
That's good
116
Yeah, you ok
Yeah
You
Richie gestures to his eye that Sydney smashed with the picture frame
He's got a few little scabs
It's alright
got hit a little bit
My eye
It's a little blurry but  got drops at the pharmacy
Richie looks over to Irving
(') Hey, you
Yeah, 'm good -- Richie looks back over to Sydney Listen, 'm sorry
'm sorry
(to Irving) 'm sorry Irving
Irving doesn't know what to say, starts to say something twice, stops, can't think of what to say
Leaves Richie hanging
-    - Richie directs where cameras should be concealed You can put a camera here
And we get it all on film
You like it
do
(to Schmidt) Give me those flowers
() 117
(') If we put the flower base here and put a camera in there we can get a clear shot of the couch there where we can put the congressmen
Irving, sitting on the couch, looks kind of disturbed by this
That's right
That's the idea
146
'  -                         146 (
) And Carmine will go to jail after he delivers us the congressmen soon to be felons
Carmine's aid  answers a ringing phone as Carmine sits at his desk
Congressman 'Connell is on the phone -- got to take this you guys everyone out please
Dolly Polito, checking the unwatered plants in her husbands office with her coat on, she has just stopped by
Turns and holds up a parched and dying houseplant

The only problem is this citizenship situation

' Yeah, well 'll tell you, you came to the right place
Everyone looks tense and on edge before

Your constituency is not even your constituency it's your family
That's what you represent, family
One small thing we do for this man is a huge thing we do for the people of New Jersey
This is what we can leave behind
Irving can't stand how hopeful his friend Carmine is being because Irving knows Carmine is being set up
He gets up -- (') Irving what are you doing
Where you going
(excusing himself uncomfortably) just gotta go see a man about a dog

That's why  went to Miami
Sometimes you just gotta be tough
You gotta stand up and you gotta leave, you know
Rosalyn looks at Pete smitten

You're too beautiful to be unhappy

mean,  don't want to badmouth my husband, but let me badmouth my husband for a second
He just thinks that he knows everything and he's so full of shit
He's such a liar
He thinks that 'm stupid, but 'm not stupid
hear him on the phone arguing
He loves Carmine, but he hates that other guy, that curly- headed
guy, or whatever who's carting around my husband's ex-lover, that redheaded whore
Anyway
You can see that it drives him crazy
You said
What  guy
What are you talking bout
hear them on the phone
think that he's got Irv in some sort of bind or something and he's making him do all of this stuff and so Irv and Carmine right now are at the Plaza Hotel throwing away all this money at like Congress or whatever
They're giving money to congress or something
don't really know but overheard it on the phone
124
Pete's brow furrows - this is serious
You know  hate to do this to you but  have to go talk to your husband
My boss is already angry
You stay here 'm going to give you some money for a taxi home

Get yourself some dessert
Finish the bottle of prosecco

Alright fine
Yes,  wanted to hurt you but how do you think that feel all day when you leave me alone all day

That's all  ever wanted
And stay married and for you to love me
And that's why 'm going to Miami
You're  going to Miami
That's why 'm going to Miami with Pete
Irving picks up Rosalyn's clothes from the bed where there is an open suitcase, throws them back in the closet
You are  going to Miami
finally found somebody who loves me just like  always wanted
Too dangerous
Miami
Not now
Too dangerous
Irv continue to throw clothes back into the closet
129
He likes me just the way  am
Not now
Everything has to stay normal right now
And you're going to shut your mouth
You told me that you wanted me to find a nice quiet man
Oh and what a  you picked
He's the one
He's the most dangerous guy ever

Irving reaches for his heart pills but they fall out of his hands and scatter on the floor
He bends down to grab them and almost falls
Rosalyn helps him up
(') Why aren't you taking your heart pills
Irving, what's going on
What kind of trouble are you in
What's happening
(out of breath) 've got a plan
What's happening
Irving coughs and steps back
Out of breath and very winded

You've got a plan
When did you get it

It really fucking came to me when was inside of that canvas bag with your boyfriend's hands around my throat
That's when it really came to me
'  - Take it off
Take the bag off his head
Dick pulls the bag off Irving's head, his comb over is all messed up
Pete and Dick  -- We've got two million coming this week
What do you think this is
You think this is a fucking down payment plan
Like were Sears of Chevrolet
You ask Victor if he wants two million this week
That's real money
Two million
Two million

Is it true what he said about your wife
It's not fucking true
That's not true
131
'  -  - can save all of us, and we can save money
can take care of you and Danny
But you gotta close your mouth
Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving
knew it
have always said, Irving, that you are very, very hard to motivate properly
And knew that Pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you
've been reading this book, Irving
It's by Wayne Dyer, about the power of intention
Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now
Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a book
(') And my intention in sending Pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan
So, you're welcome
Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond
Forces himself to say gently -- Thank you, Rosalyn
Thank you for the plan
You're welcome
appreciate that
So,  think that we should be partners on this
'm a good partner
Almost better than Edith
You ever think about that
You ever think about how you might have underestimated me
So what is our plan
Tell me the plan
What are you gonna do
132
'm going to keep my mouth shut and 'm not going to say anything but what do  do if Pete calls me
What am  supposed to say
You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your
and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that
You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that
'll tell Pete that  was wrong but you know that in real life,  was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan
So  will tell Pete
(holding his head) (pointing with cigarette between fingers) The power of intention Irving
The power of intention
Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together
You were right
Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving
(') You're so smart
Good job, peaches
Irving, 've been doing a lot of thinking and -- you need to grow up
And you need to face the facts
And  think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a divorce
As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months, now spoken as Rosalyn's idea
133
Just think about it
(kisses him) These things are never easy

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie, Irving

As a matter of fact this is the number of our wire right here
Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to them
Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it
Where is Mr
Tellegio
Mr
Tellegio unfortunately was called out of town on business
That's not good
We were willing to come here today, in person, to see Mr
Tellegio, as a sign of respect to give two million dollars -- can assure you that  have the power of attorney -- Excuse me
If you'll let me finish, we are willing to give two million dollars today of the ten
But without Mr
Tellegio here -- (to Simone) We can't, we can't make that decision
It's not the right thing
It's not the right time
It's just not good
(to Irving across Richie) You don't have the authorization to make this kind of choice so don't be hasty, alright
136
'm not being hasty
It's just, let's be smart about it
This is not how we do business
(to Simone) 'm sorry
apologize

He's right, we can't

The guy's not here

Please do
(to Alfonse Simone) don't know if he's in, 'll call the Sheik
But before  do, 'd like to go over specifically what this money will be used for
What we will do is we guarantee all proper licenses and construction permits for any hotel casino that plans to open before the end of the year
Richie glances down at Edith and her handbag '
(') And we'll throw in the customary privileges and protection
What if there are obstacles, what will you do
Obstacles
We are prepared to overcome any obstacles

This is our business
That's powerful stuff

And 'll tell you something else
At the end of this we'll teach you how to skim and how to cut it up and make some money on the side
