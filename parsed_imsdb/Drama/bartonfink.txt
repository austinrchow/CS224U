href <b>// --> </b> Screenplay By Ethan Coen & Joel Coen : He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat bookish
He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a performance
In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a thick rope that hangs from the ceiling
The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen stage: 'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for good
'm kissin' it all goodbye, these four stinkin' walls, the six flights up, the el that roars by at three
like a castiron wind
Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury
'll miss 'em  like hell  will
Dreaming again
Not this time, Lil
'm awake now, awake for the first time in years
Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a dream if you've lived with your eyes closed
Well my eyes are open now see that choir, and  know they're dressed in rags
But we're part of that choir, both of us  yeah, and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too
The sun's coming up, kid
They'll be hawking the fish down on Fulton Street
Let 'em hawk
Let 'em sing their hearts out
That's it, kid
Take that ruined choir
Make it sing
So long, Maury
So long
We hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage: We'll hear from that kid
And  don't mean a postcard
The actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int he shadows behind Barton
An older man in work clothes  not wardrobe  passes in front of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of the stage and cups his hands to his mouth
As the man walks back off the screen: Let's spit on our hands and get to work
It's late, Maury
Not any more Lil
Barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor: It's early
With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts of "Bravo
" As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame toward the stage
The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain back up and unmuting the applause
Barton Fink seems dazed
He has been joined by two other men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage
' Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house
The actors take their bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the crowd
The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings
He hesitates, unable to take it all in
He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed gentlemen
As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening
Pushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he leads the way through the restaurant
' Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink
several members of your party have already arrived
Pulling Barton Is Garland Stanford here
' He called to say he'd be a few minutes late
Ah, here we are
Toward a large semi-circular booth
Three guests, two me and a woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton fat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw backstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in
Barton, Barton, so glad you could make it
You know Richard St
Claire
Barton nods and looks at the woman
and Poppy Carnahan
We're drinking champagne, dear boy, in honor of the occasion
Have you seen the Herald
Barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man fills it
Not yet
Well,  don't want to embarrass you but Caven could hardly contain himself
But more important, Richard and Poppy here loved the play
Loved it
What power
Yeah, it was a corker
Thanks, Richard, but  know for a fact the only fish you've ever seen were tacked to a the wall of the yacht club
Ouch
Bravo
Nevertheless, we were all devastated
Weeping
Copius tears
What did the Herald say
happen to have it with me
Please Derek Do read it, do
"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the Common Man
The star of the Bare Ruined Choirs was not seen on the stage of the Belasco last night though the thespians involved all acquitted themselves admirably
The find of the evening was the author of this drama about simple folk fish mongers, in fact  whose brute struggle for existence cannot quite quell their longing for something higher
The playwright finds nobility in the most squalid corners and poetry in the most callused speech
tough new voice in the American theater has arrived, and the owner of that voice is named
Barton Fink
" They'll be wrapping fish in it in the morning so  guess it's not a total waste
Cynic
Well we can enjoy your success, Barton, even if you can't
Don't get me wrong  'm glad it'll do well for you, Derek
Don't worry about me, dear boy want you to celebrate
All right, but  can't start listening to the critics, and  can't kid myself about my own work
writer writes from his gut, and his gut tells him what's good and what's
merely adequate
Well  don't pretend to be a critic, but Lord,  have a gut, and it tells me it was simply marvelous
And a charming gut it is
You dog
(baying) Aaa-woooooooo
Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling
We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with Barton's name on it
distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes is nursing a martini, watching Barton approach
As he draws near
thought you were going to join us
Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people
Don't panic, 'll join you in a minute
What's you think of Richard and Poppy
Barton scowls The play was marvelous
She wept, copiously
Millions of dollars and no sense
Garland smiles, then draws Barton close
We have to talk a little business
've just been on the phone to Los Angeles
Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract
They've offered you a thousand dollars a week
think  can get them to go as high as two
To do what
What do you do far a living
'm not sure anymore
guess  try to make a difference
Fair enough
No pressure here, Barton, because  respect you, but let me point out a couple of things
One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out
Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week
To see pap
Yes, generally, to see pap
However, point number two:  brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays
don't know, Garland; my place is here right now
feel 'm on the brink of success- 'd say you're already enjoying some
Barton leans earnestly forward
No, Garland, don't you see
Not the kind of success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like Derek make a lot of money
No, a real success  the success we've been dreaming about  the creation of a new, living theater of, about, and for the common man
If  ran off to Hollywood now 'd be making money, going to parties, meeting the big shots, sure, but 'd be cutting myself off from the wellspring of that success, from the common man
He leans back and chuckles ruefully
guess 'm sprouting off again
But  am certain of this, Garland: 'm capable of more good work
Maybe better work than  did in Choirs
It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind
Okay Barton, you're the artist, 'm just the ten percenter
You decide what you want and 'll make it happen
'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath
Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the floor
Garland studies him
Look, they love you, kid everybody does
You see Caven's review in the Herald
No, what did it say
Take my copy
You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash strike that, a lot of cash
Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none
The common man'll still be here when you get back
What the hell, they might even have one or two of 'em out in Hollywood
Absently: That's a rationalization, Garland
Garland smiles gently
Barton, it was a joke
We hear a distant rumble
It builds slowly and we cut to: Crushing against the Pacific shore
The roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to: high wide shot from the front door, looking down across wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed
Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights
Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops in the middle foreground to look across the lobby
We are framed on his back, his coat and hat
The lobby is empty
There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in
Barton moves toward the front desk
As Barton stops at the empty desk
He hits a small silver bell next to the register
Its ring-out goes on and on without losing volume
After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs
Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at the floor behind the front desk
It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, holding a shoebrush and a shoe  not one of his own  climbs up from the basement
He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting it
The lobby is now silent again
Welcome to the Hotel Earle
May help you, sir
'm checking in
Barton Fink
The clerk flips through cards on the desk
---
Fink, Barton
That must be you, huh
Must be
Okay then, everything seems to be in order
Everything seems to be in order
He is turning to a register around for Barton to sign
Are you a tranz or a rez
Excuse me
Transient or resident
don't know
mean, 'll be here, uh, indefinitely
Rez
That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance
Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez
If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me
My name is Chet
Well, 'm going to be working here, mostly at night; 'm a writer
Do you have room service
Kitchen closes at eight but 'm the night clerk
can always ring out for sandwiches
The clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index card
Though we provide privacy for the residential guest, we are also a full service hotel including complimentary shoe shine
My name is Chet
He pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index card
Barton looks at the card
On it: "
" Barton looks back up at the clerk
They regard each other for a beat
Okay Huh
The clerk
Okey-dokey, go ahead
What Don't you wanna go to your room
Barton stares at him
What number is it
The clerk stares back
Six-oh-five
forgot to tell you
As Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags: Those your only bags
The others are being sent
The clerk leans over the desk to call after him: 'll keep an eye out for them
'll keep my eyes peeled, Mr
Fink
Barton is walking to the elevator
Barton enters and sets down his bags
An aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon uniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel
He does not acknowledge Barton's presence
After a beat: Six, please
The elevator man gets slowly to his feet
As he pushes the door closed: Next stop: Six
- Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the doors
The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained forest green carpet
The wallpaper shows faded yellowing palm trees
Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door midway down the hall
As Barton enters
The room is small and cheaply furnished
There is a lumpy bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and a wooden luggage stand
As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft
Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, jittering
He shrugs off his jacket
Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow
The room is hot
He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and struggles to throw open the window
After he strains at it for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound
Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary table
He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat
Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: "  :
" We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall above the desk
bathing beauty sits on the beach under a cobalt blue sky
One hand shields her eyes from the sun as she looks out at a crashing surf
The sound of the surf mixes up
Looking at the picture The surf mixes up louder
We hear a gull cry
The sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone
On the nightstand next to the bed
With a groan of bedsprings Barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone
How d'ya like your room
Who is this
Chet
Who
Chet
From downstairs
Barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose
How d'ya like your room
As Barton's head drops down into frame against it
He reaches over and turns off the bedside light
He lies back and closes his eyes
long beat
We hear a faint hum, growing louder
Barton opens his eyes
naked, peeling ceiling
The hum  a mosquito, perhaps stops
His eyes move this way and that
After a silent beat, he shuts them again
After another silent beat, we hear  muffled, probably from am adjacent room  a brief, dying laugh
It is sighing and weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob
Silence again
We hear the rising mosquito hum
Barton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit
There are mosquito bites on Barton's face
From behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive suit gets to his feet and strides across the room
Is that him
Barton Fink
Lemme put my arms around this guy
He bear-hugs Barton
How the hell are ya
Good trip
He separates without waiting for an answer
My name is Jack Lipnik
run this dump
You know that  you read the papers
Lipnik is lumbering back to his desk
Lou treating you all right
Got everything you need
What the hell's the matter with your face
What the hell's the matter with his face, Lou
It's not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito in my room Place okay
To Lou: Where did we put him
'm at the Earle
Never heard of it
Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place
Thanks, but  wanted a place that was less
Less Hollywood
Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word
Sat whatever the hell you want
The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures
You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week that's what we think of the writer
(to Lou) so what kind of pictures does he like
Mr
Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr
Lipnik
How's about it, Bart
To be honest,  don't go to the pictures much, Mr
Lipnik That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine
You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn
You were dead wrong
We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart
Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song
Is that more than one thing
Okay
The point is,  run this dump and  don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo
Why do  run it
've got horse-sense, goddamnit
Showmanship
And also, and  hope Lou told you this,  bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town
Did you tell him that, Lou
And don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing although, you're the writer, you would know more about that
Coffee
Yes, thank you
Lou
Lou immediately rises and leaves
Lipnik's tone becomes confidential: He used to have shares in the company
An ownership interest
Got bought out in the twenties  muscled out according to some
Hell, according to me
So we keep him around, he's got a family
Poor schmuck
He's sensitive, don't mention the old days
Oh hell, say whatever you want
Look, barring a preference, Bart, we're gonna put you to work on a wrestling picture
Wallace Beery say this because they tell me you know the poetry of the street
That would rule out westerns, pirate pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman
He rises and starts pacing
But look, 'm not one of these guys thinks poetic has gotta be fruity
We're together on that, aren't we mean 'm from New York myself  well, Minsk if you wanna go way back, which we won't if you don't mind and ain't askin'
Now people're gonna tell you, wrestling
Wallace Beery, it's a  picture
You tell them, bullshit
We don't make  pictures here at Capitol
Let's put a stop to that rumor right now
Lou enters with coffee
Thanks Lou
Join us
Join us
Talking about the Wallace Beery picture
Excellent picture
We got a treatment on it yet
No, not yet Jack
We just bought the story
Saturday Evening Post
Okay, the hell with the story
Wallace Beery is a wrestler
wanna know his hopes, his dreams
Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element
And a romantic interest
You know the drill
Romantic interest, or else a young kid
An orphan
What do you think, Lou
Wally a little too old for a romantic interest
Look at me, a writer in the room and 'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be
After a robust laugh, he beams at Barton
Well Bart, which is it
Orphan
Dame
Both maybe
There is a disappointed silence
Lipnik looks at Lou
Lou clears his throat
Maybe we should do a treatment
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it
He'll get into the swing of things or  don't know writers
Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple
We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out
The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink 'm assuming you have it in spades
Seriously Bart,  like you
We're off to a good start
Dammit, if all our writers were like you wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved
'd like to see something by the end of the week
Lou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do likewise
Heard about your show, by the way
My man in New York saw it
Tells me it was pretty damn powerful
Pretty damn moving
little fruity, he said, but  guess you know what you're doing
Thank you for your heart
We need more heart in pictures
We're all expecting great things
We are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night
pair of shoes sits before each door
Faintly, from one of the rooms, we can hear the clack
clack
clack
of a typewriter
It grows louder as we track forward
Close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is typed, without context
One by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e
After a short beat, a period strikes
Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written
He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more
It says: : On Manhattan's Lower East Side
Early morning traffic is audible
After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place
The letter-strike area
It is lined up to the last period, which is struck over by a comma
The words "as is" are typed in and we cut back to as he continues typing
He stops after several more characters and looks
Silence
Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room
man's laughter
It is weary, solitary, mirthless
Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him
The picture of the girl on the beach
Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues
Barton looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but the sound is too insistent to ignore
The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall
The laughter
Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and looks out
The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door
At the end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconces
The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the empty hall
Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for weeping
Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound
He slowly withdraws into his room
Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat
The laughter/weeping continues
He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house phone
Hello
Chet
This is Barton Fink in room 605
Yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh
He's uh
making a lot of
noise
After a beat: Thank you
He cradles the phone
The laughter continues for a moment or two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the telephone ringing next door
Barton looks at the wall
The muffled sound of a man talking
The sound of the earpiece being pronged
Muffled footsteps next door
The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting
Footsteps approaching the hall
hard, present knock at Barton's door
Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door
As Barton opens it
Standing in the hall is a large man  a very large man  in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened tie
His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of sweat
Did you
Somebody just complained
Hastily: No,  didn't   mean,  did call down, not to complain exactly,  was just concerned that you might  not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of
distress
You see,  was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult Yeah
'm damn sorry, if  bothered you
The damn walls here, well, just apologize like hell
He sticks his hand out
My name's Charlie Meadows
guess we're neighbors
Without reaching for the hand
Barton Fink
Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask
Neighbor, 'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink
That's all right, really, thank you
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there
Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say
As he enters: You got a glass
It's the least can do
Okay
a quick one, sure
He gets two glasses from the wash basin
Charlie sits down on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask
Yeah, just a nip
feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door
That's okay,  assure you
It's just that  was trying to work What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking
Well, 'm a writer, actually
You don't say
That's a tough racket
My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it
Damned interesting work, 'd imagine
Can be
Not easy, but Damned difficult, 'd imagine
As he hands Charlie a glass: And what's your line, Mr
Meadows
Hell no
Call me Charlie
Well Barton, you might say  sell peace of mind
Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise
He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty glass
In spite of what you might think from tonight, 'm pretty good at it
Doesn't surprise me at all
Hell yes
Because  believe in it
Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what  tell 'em
Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it
Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse
Thanks, 'll keep it in mind
What kind of scribbler are you newspaperman did you say
No, 'm actually writing for the pictures now Pictures
Jesus
He guffaws
'm sorry, brother,  was just sitting here thinking  was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make good
Hell, you've got it made
Writing for pictures
Beating out that competition
And me being patronizing
He gestures toward his face: Is the egg showing or what
That's okay; actually  am just starting out in the movies  though was pretty well established in New York, some renown there, Oh, it's an exciting time then
'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so  guess it's no surprise  didn't recognize your name
Jesus,  feel like a heel
For the first time Barton smiles
That's okay, Charlie
'm a playwright
My shows've only played New York
Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald
guess that's why they wanted me here
Hell, why not
Everyone wants quality
What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh
What do  write about
Charlie laughs
Caught me trying to be fancy
Yeah, that's it, Bart
Well, that's a good question
Strange as it may seem, Charlie,  guess write about people like you
The average working stiff
The common man
Well ain't that a kick in the head
Yeah,  guess it is
But in a way, that's exactly the point
There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did
He gazes at Charlie
don't guess this means much to you
Hell,  could tell you some stories And that's the point, that we all have stories
The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king
It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater
Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow
Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater
Call it our theater
can see you feel pretty strongly about it
Well,  don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there
Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons
can feel my butt getting sore already
Exactly, Charlie
You understand what 'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types
Because you're a real man
And  could tell you some stories Sure you could
And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and and  and
so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, 'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill
Yeah,  guess that's tragedy right there
Frequently played, seldom remarked
Charlie laughs
Whatever that means
Barton smiles with him
You're all right, Charlie
'm glad you stopped by
'm sorry if  well know  sometimes run on
Hell no
Jesus, 'm the kind of guy, 'll let you know if 'm bored find it all pretty damned interesting
'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view
Well, we've got something in common then
Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door
Well Christ, if there's any way can contribute, or help, or whatever Barton chuckles and extends his hand
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself
Well,  can tell you some stories He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway
And look, 'm sorry as hell about the interruption
Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world
See you, Charlie
Charlie closes the door and is gone
Barton goes back to his desk and sits
Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening and closing
Barton looks at the wall
The bathing beauty
From offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound
He looks around to the opposite bed  wall
The wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat
One swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from the wall
About three feet of the wall, where it meets the ceiling, is exposed
The strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and nods above the bed
It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical flower
He goes over to the bed and steps up onto it
He smooths the wallpaper back up against the wall
He looks at his hand
Sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat
He wipes it onto his shirt
We hear a faint mosquito hum
Barton looks around
Whirring at high speed
The keys strike too quickly for us to make out the words
On Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring blankly
Distant phones ring
Barton's eyes are tired and bloodshot
gargoyle secretary sits typing a document
The office door opens in the background and a short middle- aged man in a dark suit emerges
To his secretary: 'm eating on the lot today He notices Barton
Who's he
The secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip of paper on her desk
Barton Fink, Mr
Geisler
More please
'm a writer, Mr
Geisler
Ted Okum said  should drop by morning to see you about the Ever act
Huh
No, 'm We need Indians for a Norman Steele western
'm a writer
Ted Think about it, Fink
Writers come and go; we always need Indians
'm a writer
Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture 'm working on
What
Ted Okum doesn't know shit
They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year
What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl
Then who should  talk to
Geisler gives a hostile stare
Without looking at her, he addresses the secretary: Get me Lou Breeze
He perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton
After a moment: Is he in for Mr
Geisler
She puts the phone in Geisler's hand
Lou
How's Lipnik's ass smell this morning
Yeah
Yeah
Okay, the reason 'm calling,  got a writer here, Fink, all screwy
Says 'm producing that Wallace Beery wrestling picture  what'm , the goddamn janitor around here
Yeah, well who'd you get that from
Yeah, well tell Lipnik he can kiss my dimpled ass
Shit
No, alright
No, no, all right
Without looking he reaches the phone back
The secretary takes it and cradles it
Okay kid, let's chow
Barton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth
Geisler speaks through a mouthful of food: Don't worry about it
It's just a picture
bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it
Life is too short
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week
Sure he did
And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa
Okay
'm just having trouble getting started
It's funny, 'm blocked up
feel like  need some kind of indication of
what's expected Wallace Beery
Wrestling picture
What do you need, a road map
Geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton
Look, you're confused
You need guidance
Talk to another writer
Who
Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate
Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll hit one
And do me a favor, Fink: Throw it hard
' Barton stands at a urinal
He stares at the wall in front of him as he pees
After a moment, he cocks his head, listening
We hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a difficult passage
It is followed by the gurgling ruch of vomit
Barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls
There is more businesslike throat clearing
Barton stoops
We boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant
white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect the trouser knees
The toilet flushes
The man rises, picks up his handkerchief up off the floor and gives it a smart flap
He quickly straightens and goes to the sink
He starts washing his hands
We hear the stall door being unlatched
Barton glances over his shoulder
The stall door opening
Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands
His hands writhing under the running water
We hear footsteps approaching
Forcing himself to look at his hands
We hear the man reach the adjacent sink and turn on the tap
Barton can't help glancing up
dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit
He has warm brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache
He smiles pleasantly at Barton
He gives a nervous smile  more like a tic  and looks back down at his hands
We hear the man gargling water and spitting into the sink
After a moment, Barton looks up again
Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands
This time, a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile
Looks back down, then up again
Extends a dripping hand
Bill Mayhew
Sorry about the odor
His speech is softly accented, from the South
Barton Fink
They shake, then return to their ablutions
We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned off and his foot-steps receding
For some reason, Barton's eyes are widening
Jesus
The dapper little man stops and turns
beg your pardon
Mayhew
The writer
Just Bill, please
Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little man, his hands dripping onto the floor
There is a short pause
Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but urgent
Bill
Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile
Finally Barton brings out: You're the finest novelist of our time
Mayhew leans against a stall
Why thank you, son, how kind
Bein' occupied here in the worship of Mammon,  haven't had the chance yet to see your play He smiles at Barton's surprise
Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the news reaches us in Hollywood
He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid
Sir, 'm flattered that you even recognize my name
My God,  had no idea you were in Hollywood
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick
Mebbe that's why  allus have such a powerful thrust
He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves it at Barton
little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink
It's still a little early for me
So be it
He knocks back some more
Bill, if 'm imposing you should say so,  know you're very busy just, uh
just wonder if  could ask you a favor
That is to say, uh
have you ever written a wrestling picture
Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat
You are drippin', suh
Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown paper towel from a dispenser
Mayhew sighs: Mistuh Fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited to essay
have taken my stabs at the wrastlin' form, as have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success
gather that you are a fresh-man here, eager for an upperclassman's council
However, just at the moment
He waves his flask
have drinkin' to do
Why don't you stop at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon
He turns to leave
and we will discuss wrastlin' scenarios and other things lit'rary
"15" We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door
Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice  enraged, bellowing
We hear things breaking
Softer, we hear a woman's voice, its tone placating
On Barton, standing in front of the door
The noise abates for a moment
We hear the woman's voice again
Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks
With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing again
The door cracks open
The woman looks as if she has been crying
Can  help you
'm sorry,
My name is Fink
Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this afternoon
Is he in
Mr
Mayhew is indisposed at the moment From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail
' '
The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps outside, closing the door behind her
Mr
Fink, 'm Audrey Taylor, Mr
Mayhew's personal secretary
know this all must sound horrid
really do apologize
Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously
Is, uh
Is he okay
He will be
When he can't write, he drinks
,
' '
She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes
am sorry, it's so embarassing
How about you
Will you be alright
'll be fine
Are you a writer, Mr Fink
Yes  am
'm working on a wres please call me Barton
Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand
'll tell Bill you dropped by
'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment
Perhaps you and  could get together at some point also
'm sorry if that sounds abrupt
just
don't know anyone here in this town
Audrey smiles at him
Perhaps the three of us, Mr
Fink
Please, Barton
Barton
You see, Barton, 'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and are
love
We- ' '
' '
Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes and heavy footsteps
see
know this must look
funny
No, no Hurriedly: We need each other
We give each other
the things we need '
bastard-ass sons of bitches
the water's lappin' up
'
'm sorry, Mr
Fink
Please don't judge us
Please
Flustered, she backs away and closes the door
Hand-printed on the package is the message: "Hope these will turn the trick, Mr
Fink
Chet
" The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened
Two thumbtacks are taken out
' Late at night
The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the swath next to it
Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed
He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near the top
On the tack
As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around the tack
Smoothing up the second swath
As he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening
Muffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning
After a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the wall
As his ear meets the wall
The woman's moaning continues
We hear the creaking of bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling
Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the secretary, where he sits
He stares at the paper in the carriage
The blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under the metal prongs that hold the paper down
We begin to hear moaning again
Still looking; sweating
Tracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the page
The moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks
As it swings open
Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling
Howdy, neighbor
Charlie
How are you
Jesus,  hope 'm not interrupting you again
heard you walking around in here
Figured 'd drop by
Yeah, come in Charlie
Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear
for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding
As he enters: Oh, yeah
An ear infection, chronic thing
Goes away for a while, but it always comes back
Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus
Don't worry, it's not contagious
Seen a doctor
Charlie gives a dismissive wave
Ah, doctors
What's he gonna tell me
Can't trade my head in for a new one
No,  guess you're stuck with the one you've got
Have a seat
Charlie perches on the corner of the bed
Thanks, 'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess
You married, Bart
Nope
myself have yet to be lassoed
He takes his flask out
Got a sweetheart
No
guess it's something about my work
get so worked up over it, don't know;  don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention
In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back  with interest
How about family, Bart
How're you fixed in that department
Barton smiles
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle
Mine have passed on
It's just the three of us now
He taps himself on the head, chuckling
What's the expression  me myself and
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie
'm often surrounded by family and friends, but
He shrugs
Mm
You're no stranger to loneliness, then
guess  got no beef; especially where the dames are concerned
In my line of work  get opportunities galore  always on the wing, you know what 'm saying could tell stories to curl your hair but it looks like you've already heard 'em
He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls a dog-eared photograph from his wallet
As he hands it to Barton: That's me in Kansas City, plying my trade
Charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running board of a 1939 roadster
battered leather briefcase dangles from one hand
It was taken by one of my policy holders
They're more than just customers to me, Barton
They really appreciate what  have to offer them
Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time You know, in a way,  envy you Charlie
Your daily routine  you know what's expected
You know the drill
My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest
There's no road map for that territory
He looks from Charlie to the Underwood
and exploring it can be painful
The kind of pain most people don't know anything about
He looks back at Charlie
This must be boring you
Not at all
It's damned interesting
Yeah
He gives a sad chuckle
Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery
Beery
You got no beef there
He's good
Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie
stitch, Oakie
Funny stuff, funny stuff
But don't get me wrong Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip
Wrestled some myself back in school
guess you know the basic moves
Nope, never watched any
'm not that interested in the act itself Okay, but hell, you should know what it is
can show you in about thirty seconds
He is getting down on his hands and knees
You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration That's all right, really Not a bit of it, compadre
Easiest thing in the world
You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here
He indicated his own right bicep
and your left hand here
He indicated his left bicep
Barton hesitates
You can do it, champ
Barton complies
All right now, when  say "Ready
wrestle
"  you try and pin me, and try and pin you
That's the whole game
Got it
Yeah, okay
Ready
wrestle
With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his head and shoulders hitting with a thump
Charlie pins Barton's shoulders with his own upper body
But before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing again, offering his hand down to Barton
Damn, there  go again
We're gonna wake the downstairs neighbors didn't hurt ya, did
Barton seems dazed, but not put out
It's okay, it's okay
Well, that's all that wrestling is
Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin
Well, it's your first time
And you're out of your weight class
Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the back of his head
This registers on Charlie
Jesus,  did hurt you
He clomps hurriedly away
'm just a big, clumsy lug sure do apologize
We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel
Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head
You sure you're okay
Barton gets to his feet
'm fine, Charlie
Really  am
Actually, it's been helpful, but guess  should get back to work
Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads for the door
Well, it wasn't fair of me to do that
'm pretty well endowed physically
He opens the door
Don't feel bad, though
wouldn't be much of a match for you at mental gymnastics
Gimme a holler if you need anything
The door closes
Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the back of his head
He rolls up the carriage and looks at the page in the typewriter
The page
: On Manhattan's Lower East Side
Early morning traffic is audible, as is the cry fishmongers
He rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the page
His gaze drifts up
The bathing beauty
Looking at the picture
He presses the heels of his hands against his ears
The bathing beauty
Faint, but building, is the sound of the surf
Head cocked
The surf is mixing into another liquid sound
Barton looks sharply around
Barton enters
The sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet Barton's towel, is overflowing
Water spills onto the tile floor
Barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and reaches into the sink
As his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged sink gulp water
' Holding a dripping wad of cotton
After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton came from  and convulsively flips it away
: : " Mayhew" hand enters with pen to inscribe: "To Barton May this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines
Bill" The book is closed and picked up
As-thoomp
-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, in front of Barton, by Mayhew
Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table
It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco open-air hamburger stand
It is peaceful early evening
The last of the sunlight slopes down through palm trees
Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the only customers at the stand
Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot
Mayhew leans back in his chair
If  close m'eyes  can almost smell the live oak
That's hamburger grease, Bill
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful
His eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the breeze
Still,  must say
haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days
Don't you find it so, Barton
Ain't writin' peace
Well
actually, no Bill
Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing
No, 've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain
Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering
Maybe it's a personal pain
At any rate,  don't believe good work is possible without it
Mmm
Wal, me,  just enjoy maikn' things up
Yessir
Escape
It's when  can't write, can't escape m'self, that  want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail
Mm
He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey
This'll sometimes help
That doesn't help anything, Bill
That's true, Bill
've never found it to help my writing
Mayhew is becoming testy: Your writing
Son, have you ever heard the story of Soloman's mammy- Audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in
She taps the book on the table
You should read this, Barton
think it's Bill's finest, or among his finest anyway
Mayhew looks at her narrowly
So now 'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched
Bill Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift
Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again
And what would that be, son
don't know exactly
But  do know what you're doing with that drink
You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out
No, 'm usin' it to build somethin'
What's that
'm buildin' a levee
Gulp by gulp, brick by brick
Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door
Maybe you better too, Barton
Before you get buried under his manure
Mayhew chuckles
'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything
Not anything, Bill
Don't test me
You're lucky she puts up with as much as she does
Mayhew is getting to his feet
Am
Maybe to a schoolboy's eye
People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is
Stop it, Bill
He wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, and urinates into the grass
He is singing  loudly  "Old Black Joe
" Audrey walks over to him
Watching her go
Audrey touches Mayhew's elbow
He looks at her, stops singing, she murmurs something, and he bellows: The truth, m'honey, is a tart that does not bear scrutiny
She touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, knocking her to the ground
Breach my levee at your peril
He rises
Coming back to Barton
Stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and waving his bottle of Wild Turkey
Let him go
That son of a bitch
Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer
He looks down the road
Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving in the dust
'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there 'll
improvise
Are you all right
We hear distant bellowing: Silent upon a hill in Darien
Audrey bursts into tears
Barton puts his arms around her and she leans into him
Audrey, you can't put up with this
Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears
Oh Barton,  feel so
sorry for him
What
He's a son of a bitch
No, sometimes he just
well, he thinks about Estelle
His wife still lives in Fayettesville
She's
disturbed
Really
He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns
Well that doesn't excuse his behavior
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize
He always does
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his Barton
Empathy requires
understanding
What
What don't  understand
Audrey gazes at him
He is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his light summer suit
"Old Black Joe" floats back to us in the twilight
' From a high angle, booming down on Barton
The room is dark
Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out on the bed, asleep
The hum of the mosquito fades up in the stillness
Suddenly Barton slaps his cheek
His eyes open, but he remains still
The hum fades up again
Barton reaches over and turns on the bedside lamp
His eyes shift this way and that as he waits, listening
The hum fades down to silence
Barton's eyes shift
The typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled halfway through the carriage
Barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter
Next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper
The page in the carriage reads: : On the Lower East Side
We can faintly hear the cry of the fishmongers
It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, perhaps, we will
Looking down at the page
' Swinging in the legwell
One foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the legwell
We hear typing start
new paragraph being started: " large man
" ' As he slides them into the shoes
" large man in tights
" The typing stops
Looking quizzically at the page
What's wrong
Sliding back and forth  swimming  in his shoes, which are several sizes too large
We hear a knock at the door
He rises and answers the door
Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of nicely shined shoes
hope these are your shoes
Hi, Charlie
Because that would mean they gave you mine
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did
Come on in
The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes
Jesus, what a day 've had
Ever had one of those days
Seems like nothing but, lately
Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed
Jesus, what a day
Felt like couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara
Jesus
Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss
But God, people can be rude
Feel like  have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my
Well, my pleasure
could use a little lift myself
little lift, yeah
Smiling, he takes out his flask
Good thing they bottle it, huh pal
He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a shot: Did  say rude
People can be goddamn cruel
Especially some of their housewives
Okay, so 've got a weight problem
That's my cross to bear
dunno
Well it's
it's a defense mechanism
Defense against what
Insurance
Something they need
Something they should be thanking me for offering
little peace of mind
He shakes his head
Finally decided to knock off early, take your advice
Went to see a doctor about this
He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton
He told me it was an ear infection
Ten dollars, please
said, hell, told  my ear was infected
Why don't  give  ten dollars
Well, led to an argument
He gives a rueful chuckle
Listen to me belly-achin'
As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans
How goes the life of the mind
Well, it's been better
can't seem to get going on this thing
That one idea, the one that lets you get started   still haven't gotten it
Maybe  only had one idea in me  my play
Maybe once that was done, was done being a writer
Christ, feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts
Barton looks at him curiously
How did you know about that
Know about it
can practically see how they're doin' it
Brother, wish  had a piece of that
Yeah, but Seems like  hear everything that goes on in this dump
Pipes or somethin'
'm just glad  don't have to ply  trade in the wee-wee hours
He laughs
Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me
You've got a head on your shoulders
What is it they say
Where there's a head, there's a hope
Where there's life there's hope
Charlie laughs
That proves you really are a writer
Barton smiles
And there's hope for you too, Charlie
Tomorrow  bet you sell a half-dozen policies
Thanks, brother
But the fact is, gotta pull up stakes temporarily
You're leaving
In a few days
Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City
Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office
'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie
'll miss you
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face
This is still home for me keep my room, and 'll be back sooner or later
Barton rises and walks over to his writing table
And  mark my words  by the time get back you're picture'll be finished
know it
Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie
New York can be pretty cruel to strangers, Charlie
If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and Lillian Fink
They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave
We hear a tacky, tearing sound
Barton looks toward the door
Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton sits
The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau  the slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close together
swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from the wall
It sags and nods
(off) Christ
Frozen, looking
Your room does that too
guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper
What a dump
He heads for the door and Barton follows
guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you
Well
Well it's pathetic, isn't it
mean to a guy from New York
What do you mean
This kind of heat
It's pathetic
Well,  guess you pick your poison
So they say
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye
Course not, compadre
You'll see me again
Barton closes the door
He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter
After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling
We hear a loud thump
The ceiling  a white, seamless space
As we track in the thumping continues  slowly, rhythmically, progressively louder  the effect, it seems, of odd doings upstairs
From a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the ceiling
We track slowly down toward him
The thumping continues, growing louder, sharper
Moving in on the ceiling
We close in on an unblemished area and cease to have any sense of movement
With a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is gone, having left a huge black "" stamped into the white ceiling
We are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of the key-strike area on a typewriter
More letters appear rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues
The thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter
Is emerging from his office
As he enters the secretary stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs tonelessly, without looking up: Barton Fink
Yeah
Fink
Come in
The clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises
' The two men enter
This office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in grays and black
There are pictures on the wall of Geisler with various celebrities
Geisler sits behind his desk
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face
Nothing
It's just a mosquito bite
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles
Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town
Wuddya got for me
Well
On the Beery picture
Where are we
Wuddya got
Well, to tell you the truth, 'm having some trouble getting started Getting
Christ Jesus
Started
You mean you don't have ANYthing
Well not much
Geisler leaps to his feet and paces
What do you think this is
It's a goddamn  picture
Big men in tights
You know the drill
'm afraid  don't really understand that genre
maybe that's the prob- Understand shit
though you were gonna consult another writer on this
Well, 've talked to Bill Mayhew- Bill Mayhew
Some help
The guy's a souse
He's a great writer souse
You don't understand
He's in pain, because he can't write- Souse
Souse
He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week
But
thought no one cared about this picture
You thought
Where'd you get from
You thought
don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch  you
You understand that, Fink
He  you
He's taken an interest
make Lipnik like you
Some puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness
don't understand- Are you deaf, he  you
He's taken an interest
What the hell did you say to him
didn't say anything- Well he's taken an interest
That means he'll make your life hell, which  could care less about, but since  drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too
Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry,  covered for you
Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited
told him it was great, so now  ass is on the line
He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow
can't write anything by tomorrow
Who said write
Jesus, Jack can't read
You gotta  it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake
Well what do  tell him
Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks up a telephone
Projection
As he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare
It continues throughout the phone conversation
Jerry
Ben Geisler here
Any of the screening rooms free this afternoon
Good, book it for me
writer named Fink is gonna come in and you're gonna show him wrestling pictures
don't give a shit which ones
pictures
Wait a minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now
Show him some of the dailies on that
He slams down the phone
This ought to give you some ideas
He jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton
Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at Lipnik's house
Ideas
Broad strokes
Don't cross me, Fink
Black-and-white footage
middle-aged man with a clapstick enters and shouts: , twelve baker take one
Clap
The clapper withdraws
The angle is on a corner of the ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real athlete
His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and he has a small mustache

The wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center ring and the camera
He affects a German accent: will destroy him
He passes the camera

As we creep in closer: (off) will destroy him

Another off-microphone, distant voice from the screen: Okay, take five
jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames
The wrestler is standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down his face as he smokes a cigarette
cut in the film and another clapstick enters
Twelve charlie take one- : Staring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn
(off) Action
The angle is low  canvas level
We hold for a brief moment on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into frame
The German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other man
The referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting fingers down into frame

Below the opening paragraph, two new words have been added to the typescript: "Orphan
" "Dame
" The foot falls continue
Night
Barton paces frantically back and forth
He looks at his watch
It is 12:30
It is lifted out of the cradle
Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 605
Can you try a number for me in Hollywood
Slausen 6-4304
We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring through
Barton sweats
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it- Hello
Audrey, listen,  need help
know it's late and  shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me  wouldn't have if  could see any other alternative, but   'm sorry - listen, how are you  'm sorry
You doing okay
Who is this
Barton
'm sorry, it's Barton Fink
Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken bellowing
Sons of bitches
Drown 'em all
We hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor
Barton, 'm afraid it's not a good time- Drown all those rascals
'm sorry,  just feel like  know shouldn't ask,  just need some kind of help,  just,  have a deadline tomorrow- said drown 'em all
Who is that
There is more clatter
Audrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone: All right Barton, 'll see if  can slip away- Who is that
Gaddamn voices come into the house
sons of bitches
If you could, 'd If  can
He gets jealous; he- Goddamn voices
'
need help, Audrey
'll try to slip out
If he quiets down, passes out
'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton
He becomes irrational Hesh up
Be still now
'
' Later
It is quiet
We are craning down toward the bed, where Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow as if to blot out the world
The track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: 1:30
At the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on over the elevator, with a faint bell
With two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his watch
There is a knock at the door
Barton swings his feet off the bed
Barton opens the door to Audrey
Hello, Barton
Audrey, thank you for coming
Thank you
'm sorry to be such a
such a
Thank you
They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge of the bed
Now that's all right, Barton
Everything'll be all right
Yes
Thank you
How's Bill
Oh, he's
he drifted off
He'll sleep for a while now
What is it you have to do, exactly
Barton paces
Well  have to come up with  an outline, 'd guess you call it
The story
The whole goddamn story
Soup to nuts
Three acts
The whole goddamn- It's alright, Barton
You don't have to write actual scenes
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey
Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios
Audrey laughs
Yes, 'm afraid  have
What are they like
What are they about
Well, usually, they're
simply morality tales
There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end
In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect
Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict
And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild
The studio always hated that
Oh, some of the scripts were so
spirited
She laughs  then stops, realizing that she has laughed
She looks at Barton
Barton
She shakes her head
Look, it's really just a formula
You don't have to type your soul into it
We'll invent some names and a new setting
'll help you and it won't take any time at all did it for Bill so many times Barton's pacing comes up short
Did what for Bill
Guardedly: Well
You wrote his scripts for him
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his- You wrote Bill's scripts
Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that
Before what
Before Bill came to Hollywood
Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path
Well, Bill was  the author, so to speak- What do you mean so to speak
Audrey, how long have you been his
secretary
Barton,  think we should concentrate on  little project- want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote
Barton
want to know
Barton, honestly, only the last couple- Hah
And my input was mostly
, really, when he'd been drinking- 'll bet
Jesus  "The grand productive days
" What a goddamn phony
He resumes pacing
Mayhew
William Goddamn Phony Mayhew
All his guff about escape
Hah
' say he escaped
Barton sighs and looks at his watch
Well, we don't have much time
He sits down next to Audrey
Audrey's tone is gentle
It'll be fine
Don't judge him, Barton
Don't condescend to him
She strokes Barton's hair
It's not as simple as you think
helped Bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him
We all need understanding, Barton
Even you, tonight, it's all you really need
She kisses him
As Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away
We frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward the sink
We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and Barton's breath, becoming labored
The continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the porcelain white
We track up to the drain and are enveloped by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of pipes
: The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep
It is dawn
Barton's eyes snap open
The white ceiling
humming black speck flits across the white
Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following the sound of the mosquito
His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the hum stops
Audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered by a blanket
Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's back
The alabaster white of Audrey's back
The mosquito is feeding on it
' Looking
Swelling with blood
As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back
She doesn't react
Barton draws his hand away
Audrey's back is smeared with blood
He looks at his hand
His hand is dripping with blood
Too much blood
Eyes wide, he looks down at the bed
Blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's back
He pulls Audrey's shoulder
She rolls onto her back
Her eyes are wide and lifeless
Her stomach is nothing but blood
The top sheet, drawn to her waist is drenched red and clings to her body
He screams
He screams again
We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door
Barton's head spins towards the door
He is momentarily frozen
Another knock
Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door
Over Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door
Charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a sleeveless tee
Are you all right
Barton stares dumbly for a moment
Can  come in
No
'm fine
Thank you
Are you sure No
no
Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face
He walks back into the room
Audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed
He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and starts back toward the door
He stops short and turns back again to the room
He averts his eyes  as it happens, toward the secretary
He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey
As he sits in
He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, totally shut down
Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed
He stares for a long beat
Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat
He is not in control
Becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops
He lurches to his feet
As Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out
Barton peers out the see if the coast is clear
The long hallway
In the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes
Next to him is a castored shoe caddy
All of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes
Close on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up
' Up the long hall
In the deep background a door is closing
He pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the shoe caddy
It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall
' Barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak
Eventually it becomes inaudible
He cracks the door again, looks out, and exits
Barton goes to Charlie's room and knocks
Footfalls end as the door is cracked open
Barton
Are you all right
No
Can  come in
Why don't we go to your room- Charlie, 'm in trouble
You've gotta help me
Once again he is breathing hard
Charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind him
Get a grip on yourself, brother
Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out
Charlie, 'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  've gotta call the police
Charlie leads him towards his room
Will you stay with me till they get here
Don't worry about it, Barton
We can sort it- He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow to stop him
Before you go in   didn't do this
don't know how it happened, but didn't
want you to know that
Charlie looks into his eyes
For a moment the two men stare at each other  Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's supplicating
Finally, Charlie nods
Okay
He turns and pushes open the door
' The two men enter
Barton lingers by the door
Charlie walks into the foreground to look off toward the bed
His eyes widen and he screams
He turns and disappears into the bathroom
We hear vomiting, then the flush of a toilet
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus have mercy
His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more agitated
Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating
Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this
What're we gonna do
've gotta call the police  or you could call for me Hold on You gotta believe me Hold on didn't do this,  did  do this Hold on
Stop
Take a deep breath
Tell me what happened
don't know
woke up, she was
God, you gotta believe me
Charlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances back into the room
believe you, brother, but this don't look good
We gotta call the police Hold on
said hold on, so hold on
Yeah
What do you think happened
don't know
Maybe it was her
boyfriend
passed out
don't know
Won't the police be able to Stop with the police
Wake up, friend
This does not look good
They hang people for this
But  didn't do it  don't you believe me
believe you    you
But why should the police
Barton gives him a dumb stare
Did you
Barton, between you and me, did you have sexual intercourse
Barton stares at Charlie
He swallows
Charlie shakes his head
Jesus
They can tell that
They  believe me, Charlie
They gotta have mercy
You're in pictures, Barton
Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you
He turns and starts toward the bed
Wait in the bathroom
Later
Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against the wall, staring glassily at his feet
From the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the sounds of bed clothes being torn off
Finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of Charlie grunting under great weight
We hear heavy footsteps approaching
Barton looks up through the open bathroom door
Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the sheetswaddled body in his arms
His neck goes rubbery
His eyes roll up
His head lolls back to hit the wall
Slap
Slap
We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap and backing away, having aroused Barton
Charlie is now wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has blood flecks across the belly
You passed out
Barton looks groggily up
Uh-huh
Where's Audrey
She's dead, Barton
If that was her name
He stares at Charlie
(off) Barton, listen to me
You gotta act like nothing's happened
Put this totally out of your head
know that's hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual
Give us some time to sort this out
Barton looks at his watch
7:45
(off) Just put it out of you head
Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and statuary set amid palms trees
Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair
Bart
So happy to see ya
Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze
Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much sun
Sit
Talk
Relax for a minute, then talk
Drink
As Barton sits: Yeah
rye whiskey
Boy
You writers
Work hard, play hard
That's what  hear, anyway
He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze
Lou
Lou exits
Anyway
Ben Geisler tells me things're going along great
Thinks we've got a real winner in this one
And let me tell you something, 'm counting on it
've taken an interest
Not to interfere, mind you  hardly seems necessary in your case
writer  a storyteller  of your stature
Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart
Gimme the broad outlines
'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down, Capitol logo comes up
you're on
He beams expectantly at Barton
Barton licks his parched lips
Yeah, okay
well
we fade in
Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story
It's a tenement building
On the Lower East Side
Great
He's poor, this wrestler
He's had to struggle
And then
well
Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits against the sun
He looks back at Lipnik
Can  be honest, Mr
Lipnik
you
You damn well better be
Jesus, if  hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if 'd been totally honest,  wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless was cleaning it
But that's no reason for you not to be
Honest, mean
Not cleaning the pool
Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton
Lou sits
Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, but must finally take the plunge
Well
to be honest, 'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress
've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words  prematurely the wrong words  well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back  so 'd just as soon not talk about it
Lipnik stares at him
His smile has disappeared
There is a long beat
Lou Breeze clears his throat
He apparently feels obliged to fill the silence
Mr
Fink
Never mind me
Never mind how long 've been in pictures
Mr
Lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented practically invented them
Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou
Now  think if he's interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay,  think that employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee
Right now the contents of your head are the property of Capitol Pictures, so if  were you  would speak up
And pretty goddamn fast
Lou looks at Barton, expectantly
Lipnik continues to stare at Lou
There is a long silence, terribly heavy
Finally, Lipnik explodes  at Lou
You lousy sonofabitch
You're telling this man  this   what to do
Lou Breeze is stunned
Mr
Lipnik, This man creates for a living
He puts food on your table and on mine
him for it
Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch
Thank him or ' fired
Barton is staring, aghast
Mr
Lipnik, that's not really necessar- Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton
He rises and points
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch
Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet
Mr
Lipnik, please Mr
Lipnik '
Lou, aghast, looks at Barton
Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look
Lipnik snarls at Lou: Okay, get out of here
You're fired, you understand me
Get out of my sight
Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away
Mr
Lipnik, apologize, Barton
No no, Mr
Breeze has actually been a great help You don't have to cover for him
It's noble of you, but these things happen in business
Mr
Lipnik,  really would feel much better if you could reconsider Ah, forget it, kid
want you to pull this out of your head
If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit,  will
respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts
He gets down on his knees in front of Barton
You know in the old country we were taught, as very young children, that there's no shame in supplicatin' yourself when you respect someone
Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his feet
On behalf of Capitol Pictures, the administration, and all a the stockholders, please accept this as a symbol of our apology and respect
' Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him
Behind Lipnik the pool glitters
' The cut has a hard musical sting
Out of the sting comes a loud but distorted thumping noise
We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room
We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the bed in front of him
He wears only trousers and a -shirt and his body and face glisten with sweat
The bed's sheets have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous rust-red stain in the middle
After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near wall
Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a knock at the door
Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door
Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head
It is the first time we have seen him well turned out
battered briefcase is on the floor next to him
He holds a parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in brown paper and tied up with twine
Barton
Can  come in
Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his briefcase and enters
As the two men enter
Jesus
You're leaving
Have to, old timer
Just for a while
Barton sounds desperate: Jesus, Charlie,
Everything's okay, believe me know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of
Charlie
've got no one else here
You're the only person  know in Los Angeles
He starts weeping that  can talk to
Charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around Barton
Barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder
Charlie is somber
It's okay
It's okay
Charlie,  feel like 'm going crazy like 'm losing my mind
don't know what to do
didn't do it, believe me
'm sure of that, Charlie
just
His breath comes in short gasping heaves
just don't know what
to do You gotta get a grip on, brother
You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till  get back
Try and stay here, keep your door locked
Don't talk to anyone
We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out
Yeah, but Charlie Dammit, don't argue with me
You asked me to believe you  well  do
Now don't argue with me
He looks at Barton for a beat
Look, pal  can you do something for me
Charlie hands him his parcel
Keep this for me, till  get back
Barton, snuffling, accepts the package
It's just personal stuff
don't wanna drag it with me, but  don't trust 'em downstairs, and 'd like to think it's in good hands
Still snuffling: Sure, Charlie
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that
guess
guess it's kind of pathetic
Wallowing in self-pity: It's more than 've got
Well, keep it for me
Maybe it'll bring you good luck
Yeah, it'll help you finish your script
You'll think about me
He thumps his chest
Make me your wrestler
Then you'll lick that story of yours
Barton is tearfully sincere: Thanks, Charlie
Charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand
Yeah, well, see you soon, friend
You're gonna be fine
Barton shakes
As they walk to the door: You'll be back
Don't worry about that, compadre
'll be back
Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns around
The room
The bed
The blood-stained mattress
Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain
For a long beat, he sits still, but something is building inside
Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator arriving for Charlie, it erupts: Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned child
Barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored stain
: With the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up
We pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of Charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running board of the 1939 Ford roadster
Sitting at the desk, staring at the picture
From his glazed eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has been staring at the picture for some time
He notices something on the desk and picks it up
The Holy Bible  Placed by the Gideons
Barton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel
The text is set in ornately Gothic type
"5
And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans,  recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill
" Staring at the passage
His mouth hangs open
Barton riffles to the first page
In bold type at the top: "   " Underneath, in the same ornately Gothic type: "Chapter One 1
Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's Lower East Side
Faint traffic noise is audible; 2
As is the cry of fishmongers
" Squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes
His mouth hangs open
' At the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in
Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains fairly dim
Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously
He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages
He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing
He is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we left him the previous night
The telephone rings
After several rings Barton stops typing and answers it, absently, still looking at his work
His voice is hoarse
Hello
Chet
Who
He puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the typewriter, and examines something he has just written
He picks the phone back up and listens for a beat
No, don't send them up here
'll be right down
small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator
We pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old elevator operator
Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue
You read the Bible, Pete
Holy Bible
Yeah
think so
Anyway, 've heard about it
Barton nods
They ride for a beat
Late afternoon sun slants in from one side
The lobby has the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it
Barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, from which two men in suits are rising
One is tall, the other short
Fink
Yeah
#2 Detective Mastrionotti
#1 Detective Deutsch
Uh-huh
All three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs
Mastrionotti perches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the shadows, studying Barton
Got a couple questions to ask ya
What do you do, Fink
Still hoarse: write
Oh yeah
What kind of write
Well as a matter of fact,  write for the pictures
Big fuckin' deal
You want my partner to kiss your ass
Would that be good enough for ya
No,    didn't mean to sound What  you mean
've got respect for  for working guys, like you Jesus
Ain't that a load off
You live in 605
Yeah
How long you been up there, Fink
week, eight, nine days Is this multiple choice
Nine days  Tuesday You know this slob
He is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward Barton
There is a long beat as Barton studies the picture
Yeah, he
he lives next door to me
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you
Ever talk to him
Once or twice
His name is Charlie Meadows
Yeah, and 'm Buck Rogers
His name is Mundt
Karl Mundt
Also known as Madman Mundt
He's a little funny in the head
What did
What did he Funny
As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off
Yeah, he's funny that way
Started in Kansas City
Couple of housewives
Couple of days ago we see the same out in Los Feliz
Doctor
Ear, nose and throat man,
All of which he's now missin'
Well, some of his throat was there
Physician, heal thyself
Good luck with no fuckin' head
Anyway
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday
Not too far from here
This one's better looking than the doc
Female caucasian, thirty years old
Nice tits
No head
You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description
But, you know, with the head still on
No
never saw him with anyone else
So
You talked to Mundt, what about
Nothing, really
Said he was in the insurance business
Deutsch indicates Mastrionotti
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers
No reputable company would hire a guy like that
Well that's what he said
What else
He
'm trying to think
Nothing, really
He
He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures
Mastrionotti looks at Deutsch
Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti
After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful
But 'll be frank with you: That is not helpful
Ya see how he's not writing it down
Fink
That's a Jewish name, isn't it
Yeah
Mastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby
Yeah,  didn't think this dump was restricted
He digs in his pocket
Mundt has disappeared
don't think he'll be back
But
He hands Barton a card
give me a call if you see him
Or if you remember something that isn't totally idiotic
' We are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on the nightstand next to Barton's bed
Barton enters and picks it up
He holds it for a beat, looking at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits
He shakes it
No sound; whatever is inside is well packed
Barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf
Finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily
: Some time later; Barton still types
He is face to us; beyond him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain
The phone rings
Barton ignores it
It continues to ring
Barton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the background
We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile as the phone continues ringing
Barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear
He resumes typing
Barton typing
The desk trembles under the working of the typewriter
Charlie's parcel chatters
Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places it face down on the growing stack to his right
He feeds in a new page
We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the hall
Barton resumes typing
We hear a knock on Barton's door
Barton does not react, apparently not hearing
We are close on the bottom of the door
Someone in the hallway is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears and his footsteps recede
The note is a printed message headed: "While You Were Out
" Underneath are the printed words: "You were called by" and, handwritten in the space following: "Mr
Ben Geisler
" Handwritten below, in the message space: "Thank you
Lipnik loved your meeting
Keep up the good work
" Barton's offscreen typing continues steadily
perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty hall
Shoes are set put in front of each door except for one in the middle background
At the cut in we hear faint, regular typing
We hold for a beat
There is no motion
The long, empty hall
The distant typing
We hold
The typing stops
There is a beat of quiet
It is broken by the sound of a door opening
It is the shoeless door in the middle background
hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway
The hand withdraws
The door closes
short beat of silence
The distant typing resumes
The long empty hall
The distant typing
We hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and indistinct
Just a minute and 'll connect you
: His eyes are red-rimmed and wild
He sits on the edge of his bed holding the phone to his ear
His voice is unnaturally loud: Hello
Operator
can't
Oh
He stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear
We hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines switch, and then a distant ring
The phone rings three or four times before it is answered by a groggy voice
Hello
Garland, it's me
Barton
What time is it
Are you all right
Yeah, 'm fine, Garland   have to talk to you
'm calling long distance
Okay
Muffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else
It's Barton
Calling long distance
Back into the receiver: What is it Barton
Are you okay
'm fine, garland, but  have to talk with you
Go ahead, son
It's about what 'm writing, Garland
It's really
think it's really big
What do you mean, Barton
Not big in the sense of large although it's that too
mean important
This may be the most work 've done
Well, 'm
glad to hear that Very important, Garland
just thought you should know that
Whatever happens
That's fine
Have you read the Bible, Garland
Barton, is everything okay
Yes
Isn't it
Well, 'm just asking
You sound a little Guardedly: Sound a little what
Well, you just
sound a little Bitterly: Thanks, Garland
Thanks for all the encouragement
He slams down the phone
one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear
He resumes typing, furiously
After a beat he mutters, still typing
Nitwit
Later
We hear typing and the roar of the surf
' We are extremely close on the key-strike area
As we cut in Barton is typing: "p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-
" The carriage returns a couple of times and "----" is typed in
The paper is ripped out of the carriage
Lying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face down, to the pile
The pile is picked up, its edges are straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, and then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up
The title page reads: " Motion Picture Scenario By Barton Fink" Barton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton wad on top of the script
Barton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton wad on top of the script
We hear Barton walk away
We hear bath water run
Still looking out to sea
We are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band plays an up-tempo number
Dancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing the air
The hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in uniform
Giggling, dancing opposite Barton
You're cute
Caught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl
white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the shoulder
'Scuse me, buddy, mind if  cut in
Barton glares at him
This is  dance, sailor
'mon buddy, 'm shipping out tomorrow
For some reason, Barton is angry
'm a writer
Celebrating the completion of something
Do you understand that, sailor
'm a His bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention
Step aside, four-eyes
Let someone else spin the dame
Give the navy a dance
Hey, Four-, take a hike
Barton turns furiously against the crowd
'm a writer, you monsters
He points at his head
This is my uniform
He taps his skull
is how  serve the common man
is where An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button
Bodies surge
The crowd gasps
The band blares nightmarishly on
Quiet at the cut
After a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall and, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear: This stop: six
Barton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the hall
He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and enters the room
' Mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading Barton's manuscript
Deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing beauty
Mother: What is to become of him
Father: We'll be hearing from that crazy wrestler
And  don't mean a postcard
Fade out
The end
He looks up at Barton
thought you said you were a writer
dunno, Duke
kinda liked it
Keep your filthy eyes off that
Deutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at him
You made morning papers, Fink
Barton opens the paper
headline reads: Writer Found Headless in Chavez Ravine
The story has two pictures  a studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs
Second one of your friends to end up dead
You didn't tell us you knew the dame
With a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the bloodstained bed
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink
Give you nose bleeds
Barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, staring at the newspaper
Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd you put their heads
Distractedly: Charlie
Charlie's back
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this
Was he the idea man
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you
Only fry you once
Barton rubs his temples
Could you come back later
It's just
too hot
My head is killing me
All right, forget the heads
Where's Mundt, Fink
He teach you to do it
You two have some sick sex thing
Sex
He's a
We
You're a sick fuck, Fink
All right, moron, you're under arrest
Barton seems oblivious to the two men
Charlie's back
It's hot
He's back
Down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator
Mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look
He rises and walks slowly out into the hall
Deutsch wathces him go
Mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, still looking puzzled
Fred
Deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt
He unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of the bed
Sit tight, Fink
As Deutsch joins Mastrionotti
Why's it so goddamn hot out here
Fred
Deutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking
Tacky yellow fluid streams down
The walls are pouring sweat
The hallway is quiet
They look at each other
They look down the hall
The elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall
For a long beat, nothing
Finally Pete, the elevator man, emerges
At this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way and that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head
He turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few steps forward, still clutching his head
Watching
He takes on last step, then collapses
As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head
His head separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound
Wide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall
All is quiet
Smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall
We hear a muted rumble
Mastrionotti tugs at his tie
He slowly unholsters his gun
Deutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit
Show yourself, Mundt
More quiet
More smoke
The crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the hall
It flickers with red light from below
Bottom-lit smoke sifts up
Standing in the foreground, gun at ready
Sweat pours down his face
Behind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from Barton's doorway
The rumble and crackle of fire grows louder
More smoke
Sweating
swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall, exposing glistening lath underneath
With a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire
Sweating
Mundt
The hallway
Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from where the wallpaper droops
More red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between elevator and hallway floors
With a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the elevator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the doorway
Wide on the hallway
Charlie Meadows has emerged from the elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame
His suit coat hangs open
His hat is pushed back on his head
From his right hand his briefcase dangles
He stands motionless, facing us
There is something monumental in his posture, shoulders thrown back
Tensed
Behind him, Deutsch gulps
There's a boy, Mundt
Put the policy case down and your mitts in the air
He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor
Relax
He murmurs: He's complying
He straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in his hands
The shotgun spits fire
Mastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown back down the hallway into Deutsch
Bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire: ' The fire starts racing down the hallway
Fire races along the wall-sweat goopus
His eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun dangles forgotten from his right hand
Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position
The fire races along with him
He is bellowing: ' ' Terrified, he turns and runs
As he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, and Karl Mundt  who, also on the run, levels his shotgun
His legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor
He slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun
Weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows
He slows to a walk
' Barton strains at his handcuffs
Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two shells into his shotgun
Charlie looms behind him and    snaps the shotgun closed
Deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie
Charlie primes the shotgun
He presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose
Heil Hitler
Screams
Tightens a finger over both triggers
He squeezes
He flinches
The gunshot echoes away
Barton strains at the handcuffs
We hear Charlie's footsteps approach  slowly, heavily
Charlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly surprised to see Barton
The set of his jaw relaxes
His expression softens
He pushes his hat farther back on his head
Barton
He shakes is head and whistles
Brother, is it hot
He walks into the room
' As Charlie wearily enters
How you been, buddy
He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who stared at him
Don't look at me like that, neighbor
It's just me  Charlie
hear it's Mundt
Madman Mundt
Charlie reaches a flask from his pocket
Jesus, people can be cruel
He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted stare
if it's not my build, it's my personality
Charlie is perspiring heavily
The fire rumbles in the hallway
They say 'm a madman, Barton, but 'm not mad at anyone
Honest 'm not
Most guys  just feel sorry for
Yeah
It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through
How trapped they are understand it
feel for 'em
So try and help them out
He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button
Jesus
Yeah
know what it feels like, when things get all balled up at the head office
It puts you through hell, Barton
So  help people out
just wish someone would do as much for me
He stares miserably down at his feet
Jesus it's hot
Sometimes it gets so hot,  wanna crawl right out of my skin
Self-pity: But Charlie  why me
Why Because you '
tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and running down his cheek
Jesus, 'm dripping again
He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear
'mon Barton, you think you know about pain
You think  made your life hell
Take a look around this dump
You're just a tourist with a typewriter, Barton
live here
Don't you understand that
His voice is becoming choked
And you come into  home
And you complain that ' making too
much
noise
He looks up at Barton
There is a long silence
Finally: 'm sorry
Wearily: Don't be
He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the foot of the bed
The two men regard each other
Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring at Barton
His muscles tighten, though nothing moves
His neck fans with effort
All of his muscles tense
His face is a reddening grimace
With a shriek of protest, the metal gives
The bar to which Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton slides the cuff off it, free
Charlie gets to his feet
'm getting off the merry-go-round
He takes his shotgun and walks to the door
'll be next door if you need me
thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton
Behind him the hallway blazes
Oh,  dropped in on your folks
And Uncle Dave
He smiles
Barton looks at him dumbly
Good people
By the way, that package  gave you
lied
It isn't mine
He leaves
Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script
As Barton emerges
Flames lick the walls, causing the wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap
Smoke fills the hallway
Barton looks down the hall
Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket for his key
With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel after a long hard day on the road
He opens the door and goes into his room
He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, the parcel in the other
horrible moaning sound  almost human  can be heard under the roar of the fire
We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive building
From offscreen we hear: Fink
Morris or Lillian Fink
Eighty- five Fulton Street
Filtered through phone: understand that, sir Or Uncle Dave
Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone
In a hallway in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry up
understand that, sir, but there's still no answer
Shall  check for trouble on the line
Barton slams down the phone
' Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel
Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton
Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window
Fink
Mr
Lipnik
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind
He turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the chest
Siddown
Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk
was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve
Henry Morgenthau arranged it
He's a dear friend
Congratulations
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet
Had wardrobe whip this up
You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town
can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs
Little yellow bastards
They'd love to see me sit this one out
Yes sir, they Anyway,  had Lou read your script for me
He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a slightly charred title page
gotta tell you, Fink
It won't wash
With all due respect, sir,  think it's the best work 've done
Don't gas me, Fink
If you're opinion mattered, then  guess 'd resign and let  run the the studio
It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run particular asylum
So let's put a stop to  rumor right now
Listlessly: Yes sir
had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back
After all 'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling
How disappointed we were
Wally was heartbroken
The man was devastated
He was  well, didn't actually call him, Lou did
But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou
Yes, Colonel
Hell,  could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but  won't insult your intelligence
Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it
They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog
Too much of it and they head for exits and  don't blame 'em
There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink
Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square"
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas"
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas"
These are big movies, Fink
About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally
But especially physically
We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering   thought we were together on that
'm sorry if  let you down
You didn't let  down
Or even Lou
We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink
You let Ben Geisler down
He liked you
Trusted you
And that's why he's gone
Fired
That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him
He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy
No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way
Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures
And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write
Not until you grow up a little
You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off
tried to show you something beautiful
Something about all of This sets Lipnik off: You arrogant sonofabitch
You think you're the only writer who can give me that Barton Fink feeling
got twenty writers under contract that can ask for a Finktype thing from
You swell-headed hypocrite
You just don't get it, do you
You think the whole world revolves inside whatever rattles inside that little kike head of yours
Get him outta my sight, Lou
Make sure he stays in town, though; he's still under contract
want you in town, Fink, and outta my sight
Now get lost
There's a war on
Crashing against the Pacific shore
At midday, almost deserted
In the distance we see Barton walking
The paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left hand
He walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking out to see
His gaze shifts to one side
Down the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the water
She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's hotel room
He stares, transfixed, at the woman
Very beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching
Following her with his eyes
Her eyes meet Barton's
She says something, but her voice is lost in the crash of the surf
Barton cups a hand to his ear
said it's a beautiful day
Yes
It is
What's in the box
Barton shrugs and shakes his head
don't know
Isn't it yours
don't know
She nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from him, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at Barton
You're very beautiful
Are you in pictures
She laughs
Don't be silly
She turns away to look out at the sea
Facing the ocean
Barton sits in the middle foreground, back to us, the box in the sand next to him
The bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background
The surf pounds
The sun sparkles off the water
