Written by George Clooney, Grant Heslov & Beau Willimon -   -  - Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is standing at a podium on a stage
there is a single spotlight on him
The rest of the stage is dark
Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion
just matter of factly
am neither Christian
nor atheist
am not Jewish or Muslim
What  believe
my religion is called the constitution
pause
Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic
We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops
We hear the director speak over the loud speaker
Hang on
let me open these up
We wait as Stephen looks around
He looks at stage hands who are busy working
No one pays any attention to him as he stands there
This isn't awkward for Stephen, (') Okay
Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage
Stephen continues
will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in
The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark
He keeps going
(') If 'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me
To the Director
() 2
: (') You got it
His podium light comes back on
No answer from the Director, Stephen continues
(') If 'm not experienced enough don't vote for me
If 'm not
Okay got it, thanks
Thanks
We'll need these monitors turned up a bit
it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear
You got it
Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions
You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes
No  know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under
Great, thanks
See you guys in a few hours
We see we're in an auditorium of a college
Stephen meets up with   his staffer
didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes
Why doesn't he wear
He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium

: (2) They walk off
: -   - , a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we see  and  exit the building
Under this we hear Rachel Maddow reporting
(
) Well it all comes down to this
We are one week away from the Ohio primary
Camera now moves past  to another news truck where an stands in front of a camera waiting to go live
There is a monitor in front of him
The camera keeps moving into the monitor where does the lead in
As 's audio continues we see the following images
: We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray, desolate
In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white- and-blue letters painted on the side
They read " "
(
) Two democrats are left standing
Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is trailing Governor Morris from Pennsylvania
Moments later we roll past another farm with a large billboard staked into the ground beside the road: " - '     15th"
We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold - knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood
Yard signs for both candidates line the street
() 4
: (
) Governor Morris has mounted a sizable lead with 2047 delegates, winning New Hampshire, California, New York and Michigan
But Senator Pullman with 1302 delegates is still in the hunt having won Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and Missouri
Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars: "  "
passing car lays on the horn and the supporters cheer
(
) win in Ohio could turn it all around for the Arkansas Senator
of a Pullman bumper sticker on an  at a stoplight, right next to a "My Child is an Honor Student" decal
(
) (') So one week from Tuesday the all important hundred and eighty one Ohio delegates could be the deciding factor
clerk placing a Morris sign in the store window
In the shop next door various 's are in a window display
We see ' report on them
(
) And once again the old adage is true
"As goes Ohio, so goes the Nation
" : -   - We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc
At a catering truck,  , a 19 year old intern grabs a tray of coffees and a box of doughnuts
() 5
: We stay on her as she runs across the street and through a door
: -    - enters and we follow her through the campaign war room, it's the size of a coffin, jammed to the hilt with twenty- something staffers manning laptops
We're in the hustle and bustle of a live telecast
We see multiple angles of the telecast
Would you call yourself a Christian
How would that matter
() " have no idea what happens when we die, maybe nothing
maybe it was like before we were born
" You did write this Governor
Then let me try and clarify
was raised Catholic,  am not a practicing Catholic
have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President
'll even vote for him
The audience laughs
Is that your idea of being specific
passes out coffee
: -  - We're now live inside the debate
() 6
: Let me be more specific
am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, 'm not Jewish or Muslim
what  believe
my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution
Meaning  will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others
believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves
That's my religion
If you feel that 'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me
If you feel 'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me
Because 'm not going to change those to get elected
just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible
Is this a Democratic primary or a general election
People laugh
( ) Well Governor, whoever wins this contest will be running for President
and if you don't think that these questions won't be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land applaud your honesty Governor, do
'm simply pointing to what is obvious
we are running for President of the United States
not for student council president
-  - - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage
sidles up next to him
() 7
: In the background we can see the candidates shaking hands
There is applause
is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran
He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between him and Governor Morris
Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage
double
double
Fucking national security
The  looks off stage to  and  for approval
(') Outta the park
Home run
We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate
- campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings
Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy
He walks over to Stephen and Paul
'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before
Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before
( ) Must've been you that did the prep work
Paul's not that clever
You always had the brains Duffy, but me -  always had the balls
() 8
: (2) (nodding to Stephen) Looks like you got some brains now too
Be careful
just might have to steal him from you
Duffy walks off to greet Senator Pullman as he makes his way to the wings
Paul and Stephen eye him as he goes
What a prick
: -   - Stephen, Paul, Ida, and Ben are having drinks around a table
The mood is festive
There is a piano player playing, singing
has a roll-away suitcase beside him
So Paul, tell me something  don't know
tell me what's gonna happen on the 15th
Ha-ha
What
What do you think Stevie
It's ours for the taking
Ben
We'll win
What do you think Ida
'm asking you
You tell me and 'll tell you
() 9
: If had to say, 'd say it'll be close, but you'll eke it out
Eke
To
(') You see, she's trying to get under my skin
So what's gonna happen
Us by nine
Nine
There's no way you'll win by nine
At least
Maybe more
(To ) So you're certain you're gonna win here
Certain
No
Confident
Yes
You just said you'll win by nine
And  think we will, but  won't tell you it's a sure thing
Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it wouldn't surprise me
Don't get me wrong
Six presidentials 've done and 've never felt this good
But am gonna sit here and say "Yes -we will definitely win Ohio"
Not a chance
In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president
How many have won
Three
() () 10
: (2) (') That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost
So you're saying there's a good chance you won't win
Don't twist my words
What 'm saying is that 'm not going to promise we'll win
But he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second
He left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate
The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy
so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential
And that Ida, is the state of the union
And on that note, 'm gonna take a shit
swigs down the rest of his drink and exits
So Stephen
Yes Ida
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen
Here it comes
hit me
Paul's going to the airport
Yes
Getting on a plane
Mmhmm
Where is that plane going
() 11
: (3) Three guesses
Not going back to headquarters
Correct
He's not going to Texas
No need, we'll split Texas, it's a wash
What if  said North Carolina
That's your guess
He's going to North Carolina
will neither confirm nor deny that statement
knew it
Now tell me why
That  cannot do
hate you
You love me
love Paul
You  hate
You only love him because he gives you all the scoops
Sexual favors
You're engaged
() 12
: (4) If it meant a good scoop my fiance would understand
Beat
(') You really buy into all this crap
All this take back the country nonsense
Ida 'm not naive about this stuff
've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty
'm telling you this is the one
You really have drunk the kool-aid
have drunk it it's delicious
don't care whether he leads in the polls
don't care whether he has all the tools
Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives
Even the people that hate him
If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him
don't give a fuck if he can win
He has to win
Or what
The world will fall apart
It won't matter
Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again
If your boy wins
You get a job in the white house
If he loses you're back at a consulting firm on Street
That's it
You used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy
Morris is a politician
He's a nice guy
They're all nice guys
() () 13
: (5) (') He will let you down
sooner or later
: - and  walk to Ida's car
This is off off off the record
What
Franklin Thompson
Seriously
Off the record
The only people who know are the Governor, Stephen and me
My lips are sealed
have a meeting tomorrow at Thompson's house
He's gonna endorse
After 'm done talking with him, what do you think
That's huge
It's more than huge
He has 356 pledged delegates
they all travel with him
That puts us over the top
He's said publicly he's not gonna endorse anyone
() 14
: That's what they all say until we get them alone in a room
So this is for real
Yup
It's just about in the bag
When are you gonna announce
Nope
That's all you get for now
: -  - Establishing shot
-  - Ben walks around to all the staffers, he hands out new cell phones
Okay so listen up
these are your new cell phones
Shelly has pre- programmed everyone's numbers in
thank you Shelly
no personal calls
if you lose them, Paul has authorized me to kill you
Ben walks into Stephen's office and hands him his new phone
(') New phones
'll get it in a bit
As Ben leaves, we see that Stephen is looking at early footage of Governor Morris
Another staffer and an editor are watching it with him
Outside the office we can see other staffers, through the glass partitions, running around in campaign mode
We see some of the footage
() 15
: ( ) The economy
health care
've got to believe we can do it
We have enemies
we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies, and see if there is something we can do about that besides using force
What we know from history is the answer to extremism is not extremism
Whoever is the next president, whoever steps up, has got a lot of work to do, but you have a little work to do yourself
Stephen hits pause
Fucking kill me
where did we get this
Before he announced at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania
Thank God it wasn't overseas
Just get rid of it - It plays to his base, if- Are you fucking stoned
this is the same
the exact same piece the Republicans are gonna run against him in the general
we don't need to brag about it
Hi 'm Neville Chamberlain and  want to be your commander in chief
If it's gonna come out- It's gonna come out but not paid for by us pal
(To Staffer) Any truth on whether Pullman had investments in those diamond mines in Liberia
() 16
: (2) 1 We're still checking
it was a blog so who the fuck knows
Doesn't matter  want to hear him denying it
If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia
win win
1 Okay
We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night
so get going
Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots
We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting
Got it
The Editor and staffer exit
Stephen turns to his computer and types as Molly walks in and hands him some papers
Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting
Oh, right
Thanks
've been waiting for this
Anything interesting
Just some white paper  gotta pass out tonight
White paper
() 17
: (3) Negative shit
Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite
So like what sort of negative stuff
Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see
Which paper
All of them
So it's something big
wish it were something bigger actually
Just some transportation numbers
'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick
Well that's what you're good at, right
guess
(Holding up her phone) Did you get your phone
(Holds his up) Just now
( ) It's exciting isn't it
He looks at her
You a Bearcat
() 18
: (4) what
Cincinnati Bearcat
Oh no
'm not from here worked with you in Iowa actually
Oh that's right
but you changed something
(Searching for a way out
) My hair
You changed your hair
( ) No
must look like a total dumb ass right now
Not at all
you're the big man on campus
'm just a lowly intern
Come on it's not like that
Sure it is
you get to stay at the Millennium, they put us into a motel on the other side of the river
You're right,  am big man on campus
Now you're starting to see
She starts to leave
(') We do have the better bar though
() 19
: (5) heard that
You ought to stop by one night and have a drink with the worker bees
Maybe  will
when's a good night
Tonight's good
Really
Tuesday
Yeah it's quiet
Quiet's good
Well you have my number
do
Programmed right there in your phone
Oh
right
(He opens the phone) Under Mary
(Looking at the phone) Yup
Mary
Molly laughs
Then, as she exits: Molly
my name's Molly
Stephen smiles to himself
: 20
'  -
- We follow a housekeeper down the hallway and into the living room where we see Paul sitting with, Senator Thompson
That's what 'm hearing
since Super Tuesday 'm a very popular guy
What are your polls telling you
That Pullman's negatives are high
mid forties
Senator we have an open seat in the White House and the Republicans don't have dick
They're disorganized and they can't find a nominee that isn't a world class fuck up
They look like Democrats
No Republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy
But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod they'll show up to vote against him
And so you think they won't for your guy
you think Morris gets into the independents
sure do
Senator
'm a bit confused
we need your delegates
we need you
your fund raising
It was my understanding that
your endorsement a week before Ohio
would win this for us
(Looks to his aide) Estella
hand me that ice bucket
: -  - We're in a staff meeting with the brain trust
Paul's gone but the rest are there
, ,
is running in and out, she gets glances from all the guys
() 21
: Paul knows
Paul agrees
Ben, where's my op ed on national service
It's better for me to work off of that
Got it right here
(He opens his laptop
) Get me a hard copy
hate these fucking things
Print it out
'll get it printed
Molly, 'm printing out this op ed
can you grab it off the printer
Be right back
Governor
if you want to change
or lets call it refresh
Just give me a second
National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy
don't give a shit about polling
'm not going to play this game with you Stephen
and if this is your good cop bad cop act with Paul
Good cop, good cop
'm not changing it
returns and hands the Governor a copy
() 22
: (2) (') Hang on
He reads down until he finds what he's looking for
(') Yeah  said it all here, "It's going to help people get an education
it's going to create national unity
it's going to teach young people a trade
and it's going to help get people out of debt from college loans
Tell me where that fails
All of that is exactly right
Governor if you're going to do it
then do it
Don't make it voluntary
mandatory
That'll poll well
Mandatory
everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country
Military
peace corps
plant fucking trees, don't care
and for that
their college education is paid for
period
We do all of that now, with this
No sir you don't
do it all
all the way
Mandatory
Paul likes this
you guys are my brain trust
And here's the beauty of it
everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it
create national pride
give all the kids an education
() 23
: (3) And all the others
Can't vote
Too young
This sits with them
Some start to smile
(') You can't lose
enters
Stephen you have a call on three, your dad
Okay, you and Ben work it into the stump speech - get me a hard copy and 'll write it in my own words
Remember, Governor
you have a six o'clock with Charlie Rose
Why am  doing him
It's long form
he's flying in
Is Paul going
No, he won't be back
Ben and are taking you
He exits
: '  /
' picks up the receiver and pushes line three
Don't tell me anyone's died
Hey Stephen
() 24
: Who is this
Tom Duffy
sorry about the dad bit
but  didn't think you'd want my name yelled out at a Morris campaign office
gets up and closes the door
What do you want
You got a couple of minutes
'd like to sit down with you
What for
think it's important
If it's important shouldn't you be calling Paul
'm calling you
This is all on the up and up
just give me five minutes
can't be talking to you
hear you
but if you get five minutes
'll be at the Heads First Sports Bar for the next couple of hours
can't Tom
There won't be anybody there
if you get a chance there's something want to show you
hangs up
sits for a few beats
He picks up his cell phone and dials
it goes straight to voice mail
() 25
: (2) Paul, listen, call me as soon as you can
it's important
hangs up the phone and we stay with him
: '   - - sits in the car, he watches the door of the bar making sure no one is around
: -  - We're in a run-down bar in Cincinnati
The furniture is shabby - Formica tables, cheap metal framed chairs
The place is desolate except for  and  who sit at the bar
You're working for the wrong man
You're working for the wrong man
Oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man
You've got something the other guys don't have
Yeah
Yeah, what is it exactly
Charm isn't the right word
It's more than that
You exude something
You draw people in
All the reporters love you
Even the ones that hate you love you
You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board
And you make it look effortless
We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move
But from the outside, you make it look easy
() () 26
: (') People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it
There's nothing more valuable in this business - the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love
You can guess what 'm gonna say next
No
don't think  can
want you to work for us
You gotta be kidding me
Not in the least
Beat
You are going to lose Ohio
am not
You're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls
six percent of the Democrats polled
Eight
Six
but that doesn't matter
Independents and Republicans can vote for the Democratic candidate
You think they like your guy
pro choice
tax and spend liberal
() 27
: (2) Fuck no they hate him
they think they can beat my guy
but they're worried about yours
so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz
Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a "Get out the vote campaign"
it's already started
every fucking conservative in Ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket
that's just one of the steps
Ohio is gone
the polls don't mean shit
tomorrow morning everyone will know
that's why want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press
They look at each other
(') And by the way
we've got Thompson in the bag
know for a fact that Thompson is going with us
We promised him Secretary of State, Ohio is over
it's been over for weeks
and with Thompson's delegates
'm thinking down the road now
that's why  want you
'll bring you in straight at the top
can't do it
'm not asking for an answer right this moment
've played dirty but  don't have to play dirty anymore
you know why
Cause  got Morris
() 28
: (3) None of this is about the democratic process Steve, It's about getting your guy into office
Simple as that
This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull
You're right, this is exactly what the Republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them
They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are
've been in this business for twenty five years and 've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants
Paul's a friend
Do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the President
Think about it
you have my number
Duffy gets up and leaves
: / '   / walks to his car
He dials  on his phone
Paul is in North Carolina driving
We intercut
Paul
(
) They don't make quaaludes any more do they
Not that  know of
What's going on with Thompson
() 29
: (
) He wants something but we'll be fine
So what's so important
It's nothing
never mind
(
) Allright
'm on the cell if you need me
fly to  tomorrow and back tomorrow night
Yeah okay
'll look for quaaludes
(
) Good man
ends the call
He stands in silence
: -  - We're in the bathroom of a hotel room
is being made up for the Charlie Rose Show stands in the adjoining room
The  talks to the -  while  and  stand in the adjoining room as well
( ) Just get online and see if there's any chatter on the blogs
What kind of chatter
There's always chatter
don't know
just see what they're talking about
Give me a second
He sets his laptop down and starts typing
The Governor, who's been talking the whole time, yells out through the door
() 30
: Stephen
you're still single, right
'm married to the campaign, Governor
Good answer
(to the make-up girl) He's married to the campaign
(looking at his computer) Wall Street Journal poll has our numbers holding steady and Pullman dropped a point
Really
When did they do that
Governor
Wall Street Journal numbers are in
and Pullman's down a point
Now we're moving in the right direction
Ben, are you still single
'm married to the campaign, Governor
(to the make-up girl) Crack team
The  starts to sing "The Best Is Yet To Come"
( ) Make sure Charlie Rose has these latest numbers before he goes on
( ) 'm on it
() 31
: (2) And get a copy of the show before we leave
: - The room has been transformed into an interview space
- and
mid-interview
Is it a difficult decision would have to believe that it is
would  do it
No
but  can't see myself
or anyone
certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body
So you would appoint a judge to
would consider it arrogant to judge someone until 've walked in their shoes
But you're against the death penalty
Yes
Because of what it says about us as a society
Suppose Governor it was your wife
And she was murdered, what would do
It gets more complicated when it's personal
() 32
: Sure
well if  could get to him 'd find a way to kill him
So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty
No,  would commit a crime for which  would happily go to jail
Then why not let society do that
Because society has to be better than the individual
If  were to do that  would be wrong
And what about guns
Isn't it time for a commercial
They laugh
This is public , we don't have commercials
That's unfortunate
25  : 25 -  - We're in Kentucky, just over the Ohio River from Cincinnati
This is where all the interns stay
In the hotel bar, Stephen and Molly are sitting at a back table, they've both been drinking hard
Where'd you go after Iowa
California for Super Tuesday
had to go to New York
() 33
: know
you guys needed a lot more help over there
Yeah
So why politics
Because the pay is so good
It just seems like an odd fit
My dad is Jack Stearns
Beat
He's a good guy
He's an asshole but he's your boss
He's not my boss
He's the head of the
You don't work for the Democratic National Committee
work for Paul, Paul works for Morris and if Morris wins, he's going to be your dad's boss
Don't tell my dad that
Don't tell your dad a lot of things
Never
What time do you start tomorrow
() 34
: (2) Nine
'm showing the new interns how to robo call
you see
'm the experienced intern
do see
How old are you
How old do you think  am
Thirty
You think 'm thirty
'm sorry, how old are you
Thirty
how old are you
How old do you think  am
Twenty one
Twenty
That's young
Too young to fuck a thirty year old
See laws are different in different states
Here in your hotel, in Kentucky
it's frowned upon
but we'll go across the bridge into Ohio
Where your hotel is
() 35
: (3) Yeah surprisingly they're very lax about their child endangerment laws
You have a car
don't drive
took a cab
have the keys to the campaign bus
On their smiles : -  - The Morris campaign bus is parked badly, a tire up on the curb in front of the hotel
- '  - is on his cell phone, he paces back and forth in front of the  -  news show in on
is in bed - sheets pulled up around her, she's just waking up
( ) In fairness, this has been tried before
Operation Chaos, as Rush Limbaugh called it, where Republicans voted for a Democrat they thought they could beat in the general election
We asked Senator Pullman's campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome
Cut to a pre-tape with
() 36
: (
) Is it decisive
Of Course not
look, we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the Senator will win Ohio
with Ohio Democrats can't really see Republicans showing up to vote for our candidate
having said that, we'll take all the support we can get
(On the phone) What time does Paul land
Christ
who do we talk to about polling
no
just
just need to get some internal polling on the fucking Independents and the right-wing nuts
Do you want me to go
He gestures for her to wait
Listen, put me on the line with
what's the guy's name at the Wall Street Journal
yeah
You seem busy
should go
He whispers to her
Wait
Back to phone
(') Right
Adler
get me on the line with him
Steve
She starts to get dressed
Molly listen, just give me a second
want to talk to you about something
() 37
: (2) We can talk about it later if
Stephen holds his finger up
( ) What
No nobody
just the cleaning lady
listen Ben
keep trying till you get him
We're gonna go with the position that we've always said, the race is closer than the polling
right
no don't
don't say that
just get him on the line and call me
'll handle it
yup
He hangs up
(') Sorry about that
The cleaning lady
What

Yup

We'll be fine
we have to do it

So how we doin
Fine now

the campaign how we doin
Great
Listen Stephen
you're not Paul
pay him to use the word "great"
pay you to tell me the truth

Okay Paul
Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me
Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win
But you wouldn't
'll do or say anything if believe in it
but  have to believe in the cause
You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work
Well  won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it

What we don't ever disagree on is how we're going to leave this planet for our daughter
Are we gonna leave it better off, or worse
The richest people in this country don't pay their fare share
And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth
That scares everybody and they all run and they hide
For the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans, by our government
And  will run on that

met with Tom Duffy yesterday
What
You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet
And  said why
he said it was very important so  did
but should've fucking told you
Stop Stop let me get this straight
You met with Tom Duffy
Yes
What'd he want Stephen
-the gist of it is he wants to hire me
He wants me to jump ship and come work for him
this is bad Paul
He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four
We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan
Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson
They promised him Secretary of State
: -  - You know how you fight the war on terror
Don't need their product anymore
Their product is oil, just don't need it and they go away
We don't have to bomb anyone we don't have to invade anyone

-   - If this is some sort of practical- mean -my fucking blood pressure is going through the roof right now
Paul 'm sorry
Believe me just didn't think it was true
It doesn't fucking matter what you thought
It matters what you did
It matters what you didn't do
If all this shit is true  made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place
And  gave away our game plan
Please believe me that  honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and didn't see the point
But it doesn't make it right and 'm sorry
Let me think
let me think
: -  - If 'm your president, the first thing  put in motion, ten years from the day 'm in office
no new car in America runs on an internal combustion engine
It'll create hundreds of thousands of new jobs
we will start the next technological revolution and we will lead the world again

What do you think
think we fold up the campaign in Ohio
take a loss and blame it on the Republican's playing games
head to North Carolina
can't run from Ohio
they'll kill us
Not if you get Thompson's endorsement
'm not gonna do it
What's he want head of the  or something ridiculous
Cabinet post
Labor
State
This sits with them
Are you fucking kidding me
'm gonna give Secretary of State to a guy who wants to cut the top ten floors off the
Paul when we started this campaign  said wasn't gonna make those kind of deals
() 48
: (2) Governor, if you lose Ohio, and they get Thompson's delegates
Then they get North Carolina
then they get the lead
lead you can't beat
But if we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him a cabinet post, then we take North Carolina
His state
Then Pennsylvania
Your state
And then it's simple math Mike
Take his endorsement and the race is over
Paul,  respect you
respect your opinion
but 'm never gonna do it
so  suggest we find a way for me to win Ohio

At this point the camera finds

Now wait she has a point to make

There was a party with you

Where was he
took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers
After the party

we were talking
a long time

Jesus fucking Christ
Were you drunk
Not that drunk
How many times

: (3) Just that once
Does anybody know
Did anyone see you
No
How could you know

Because  didn't know who to go to

he goes to the office door, opens it and yells to Ben in the bullpen
Ben
come here a minute stops what he's doing and heads into Stephen's office
What's up
What's our limit on petty cash
It's probably five hundred
Why
need as much as we have
Everything okay
anything  can help with
Yeah
don't put it on the books

Stephen hands Molly a folder that he writes on the inside of (') Here
Molly opens the folder and reads "Meet me in the stairwell at noon"

You'd ruin my reputation just so you- Wait wait wait -is that what you thought
That we were friends
've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1
You're right -you've given me a lot
But let's get real here Steve
The only reason you ever treated me well was that  work for the Times
Not because  was your friend
You give me what want,  write you better stories
Don't pretend it's any more than that
Why'd you meet with Duffy
Go fuck yourself

Okay, 'll make it easier on you
Forget Duffy
What happened at Paul and Thompson's meeting

Do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me

She's gonna take the story to Drudge, or Roll Call

You can't stop her

You can't let this story get out
'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom
You don't have much of a choice here

: (3) If  tell her about Thompson gotta tell her he's gonna endorse you guys
Then tell her
can handle it from my side if  start getting calls
No fucking way
Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag
It'll make us look like fools
You're gonna look like fools anyway when he endorses us

You fucked up, Molly

We made a deal
Paul
they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning

But why
Why would you do that to me
Why would you do that to the campaign

Then why would you do that to me
Makes it easier to let you go
What
Why'd you meet with Duffy
made a mistake - a stupid mistake
() 73
: (3) No Stephen
You didn't make a mistake
You made a choice
You called me and left a message to call back
that it was important
But when  did
you said to forget about it
You chose not to tell me
Why did you make that choice
didn't think it was important
Sure you did
But you went because you were curious, because you were flattered
Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me
Because you thought to yourself: maybe can get something out of this
Because it made you feel big
First campaign  ran tiny little race in Kentucky -state senate seat
Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie
Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office
Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance
There's no way we can compete
And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call
Says, " really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam
But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me
" What do  do
Well Stephen -this is where you and  are different told Sam about the call
And Sam says to me, "Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything  can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then  won't get in your way
" So say, "Sam -you took a chance and hired me when  was even more of nobody than you are, and 'd be damned if 'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan
" We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called
We won that race
() () 74
: (4) (') And twenty years later 'm where am now
(Beat) There's only one thing  value in this world Steve, and that's loyalty
Without it you're nothing and you have no one
And in politics it's the only currency that you can count on
That's why 'm letting you go
Not because you're not good enough
But value trust over skill
And don't trust you anymore
Well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the Governor does
The Governor knows, he thinks it's the right thing to do
He does
If  were you
'd get a good night sleep because you're gonna get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning
Off of Stephen we: : -  - is sitting in the clinic waiting room, Post-Op

(') Do you have a ride
Molly shakes her head yes
(') Okay
if you need anything you just call the clinic
okay
() Okay
The  walks back into the office
just sits there
by herself
We stay with her for a while
: '   - is driving
: - walks outside the clinic and down the street
: - Through the front window we see Molly sitting in a booth making a phone call
There is a  on the wall, the news plays
Yes Mike, Senator Franklin Thompson of North Carolina arrived at the Lunken airfield today igniting rumors of a deal in the works
() () 76
: (') The  times is reporting that Senator Thompson will pledge his three hundred and fifty-six delegates to Senator Pullman
: - drives by the clinic, he slows to see if Molly is still there
The clinic is closed
: '  -  - gets out of a cab and walks into the hotel
Under this we hear: Hey, where were you today
'm not feeling great Ben
'  -  - We're in front of ' door as the scene continues
You picked a hell of day to call in sick
Jesus
fucking wild day
Why
Stephen's off the campaign
Paul fired him
Some fucking set up about loyalty and it looks like Stephen was doubling down with Duffy on the Pullman campaign was sitting in the room when Paul told Stephen that he was fired
Stephen said who's gonna take over and Paul said me
and 'm like
easy there soldier
but Stephen goes ape shit then Paul gives the speech about loyalty and then shits on Stephen like 've before
christ
humiliating shit
() 77
: When was this
Molly listen to me
'm gonna run the campaign under Paul
Stephen is going to Duffy
just jumped three years ahead
so starting tomorrow morning we go into full damage control and 'm telling you Stephen's going ape shit
he said he's taking everyone down on his way out
Morris, everybody
Phone rings
(') Shit  gotta take this
Do you need anything
No
: -  - enters the offices, staffers look up and recognize him
Where's Duffy
1 You got an appointment
Stephen keeps walking
Stephen arrives at a medium sized, glass partitioned office
As he looks in, we see Duffy and five or six staffers around a table
Duffy is holding court, the mood is light
Duffy notices Stephen standing there
Duffy walks Stephen a few doors down to a conference room single staffer is working on a laptop
Joe can you excuse us for a minute
The staffer leaves and Duffy closes the door
() 78
: (') Not very bright, walking in here
'm in
'm coming to work for you
reporter at Roll Call phoned me this afternoon
know who leaked it
Who
Paul
You told Paul
Yeah
told him we met
He leaked it
You shouldn't have told him that
felt like  should
've worked with Paul
He gets paranoid
Obviously
So he fired you
quit
You're lying to me
come on
quit
And  can give you everything on Morris
Everything
() () 79
: (2) (') can lay out his whole strategy for you
already know his strategy
Paul gave it all to Thompson
What if  had something else
You'd do that to Morris
To Paul
Yeah
Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve
can't have someone who's unpredictable
Who's unstable
() 'm not unstable
If it had been a clean break -if you'd left Morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing
That we could control
But the way it'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us
Looks like we're picking up the scraps
Puts Morris in the drivers seat
can't have that
We see a shot close on ' clinched fist holding the yellow copies from Molly's clinic visit down by his side
We pan up to his face
What if  had something big
Like what
Something big
Something that'll bring Morris down
What is it
() 80
: (3) (Shaking his head) Give me the job
It's not gonna happen
'm sorry
Go take a nice long vacation
Beat
(') You're a smart guy Steve
Everything  said yesterday is true
But maybe politics isn't for you
Politics is my life
Do yourself a favor
Get out now while you still can
Go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica - anything
Do what will make you happy
You stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical
Like you
Yeah
Just like me
You knew  was gonna tell Paul
didn't know
thought you might, but  didn't know
You knew if  told him he'd fire me
Thing you gotta know about Paul- he's big on loyalty
Yeah  got a nice speech on that
You were never gonna hire me
() 81
: (4) Put yourself in my shoes Steve
Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team
What do you try to do
You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either
This was a win-win situation for me
You work for us -great
Paul doesn't have you
Then again, if Paul fires you and  don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you
Either way  win
The moment  got you to sit down in that chair,  knew 'd won
This is my life you're talking about
It's not easy for me to do this sort of thing Steve
Don't think take any pleasure in it
'm sorry for you
really am
Take care of yourself
: 64 pulls into the parking lot
'  -  - climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his former co-workers
He gets to the fifth floor and walks down the hall towards Molly's room
As he turns the corner he sees a maid's cart in front of her room
The door is halfway open
As he starts walking towards her door, we see the come running out of Molly's room, he heads the opposite way towards the elevators
he's fumbling with his walkie-talkie
gets to her room and we see a  kneeling over Molly's lifeless body
Stephen steps into the room
He can barely move
He just stands there looking at the situation
The  is on the phone
() 82
: No ma'am she's not breathing
No nothing
Stephen is looking at Molly
he looks around the room
he sees her prescription bottle empty on the bed next to her
he sees her clothes all around the room
(') don't know, fifteen minutes
how far away are they
The  now turns and looks at (') Do you know her
nods his head yes
(') She's gone
We hear the sound of a distant ambulance
goes back to the phone
(') Hello
'm sorry what
Yes  can hear them now
looks down on the bed and sees Molly's phone
He reaches down takes it and slides it in his pocket
Close on  face as he stares down at Molly
We hear the ambulance approaching the building : '  -  - Stephen comes running out the door
An ambulance has pulled up and 's are on their way in
Police are also pulling up
Stephen keeps walking - he gets in his car and sits there
Nothing
No emotion
Stephen pulls out his phone and listens to his messages
You have four new messages and four saved messages
First new message
() 83
: Beep
(
) Uhm
where are you
it's Uhh
(Crying) it's four something
they're gonna close in a few minutes
Beep
(
) Stephen, it's Ben
listen
what the fuck
did Paul lose his mind
Jesus
what're you gonna do
Call me
Beep
(
) Stephen  just heard from Ben
please don't do anything fucked up
(She's losing it
) Godamnit you motherfucker pick up the phone
Don't do it you fuck
Beep
We now hear Molly in a very different tone, calmer, maybe even drunk
(
) (') 'm not going away
Beep
Stephen hangs up
We stay on him for a while
: - The , ,  and the other staffers, sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece
We now cut to  footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue
() 84
: (
) The coroner has stated, that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room, that this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs
The Cincinnati police chief, Darryl Mathews, has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks
Just a terrible terrible situation for the former Senator, now  Chairman, Jack Stearns and his family
Off the Governor's face we: : -  - and   are seated on a bench
want on the ticket
you need me on the ticket
and you need my delegates
you could use em before Tuesday
Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle
so expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow
or  endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat
They look at each other
(') Anything else you want to talk about
: -  - We're at a press conference - The , , , and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone
The Governor is making a statement The entire staff is in a state of shock
We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family
() () 85
: (') and of course our hearts go out to them
it's hard to imagine what they're going through
All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug
an accidental prescription overdose
Ida
Is suicide ruled out
We have no reason to believe
He looks to Paul
(') don't think we have any of that information yet
Obviously there will be a full investigation
Just wanted to say that our hearts go out
our prayers go out to the entire family
and she was part of our family
5 Did you know her well Governor
Not well
But  did know her, and what  saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit
It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack
6 How long has she interned with you Governor
The Governor looks back at Paul
Paul steps up to the mic
She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks
maybe four think,  can check
Will you continue with your schedule today
You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon
() 86
: (2) We will most certainly stay on schedule
This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy
The work, the schedule won't be altered
It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart
As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates
He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller
It reads "Molly
" He looks up
Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating
The Governor looks at each of his staff members
Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen
holds a cell phone to his ear
They stare at each other
Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops vibrating
Stephen turns and leaves
: -  - approaches the restaurant - the lights are off
He peers through a window - we hear the door unlock
One of the Governor's    opens the door
He motions Stephen in
-  - Stephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant - they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths
They cross towards the back to the kitchen door -  enters
- The kitchen is small and dimly lit
The Governor is standing behind the center island - hanging pans hide his face
It seems you have something you want to talk about
Does it seem that way
() 87
: If you have something
or think you have something you want to get off your chest
What's say  do the talking and you do the listening
Okay
As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign
Paul is out
will be your senior campaign manager
'll draft a statement, "we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc
" You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most
And why would  do that
Beat
Because you want to win
Because you broke the only rule in politics
You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns
they'll get you for that
What do you think you have Stephen
troubled young girl tells you a story
troubled young pregnant girl
Is that what she told you
Who needed cash for an abortion
() 88
: (2) What did you do, give her money
Maybe she just wanted cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up
Is that your best play
You need a job that bad Stephen
You walk in here with your dick in your hand
you've got nothing
So how did  get here
You're right Mike, there's nothing
No phone messages, no text, no e- mails, no photos or tapes, and yet 'm standing right here
Well go home
She left a note
The Governor stands in silence
How would you know that
cleaned up your mess
took her phone and  found her note
They stare at each other in silence
thought it was an accident
: You tell me, you were the last one she called
Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion
it also said she didn't want to hurt you
Then why would she leave a note that could only do that
() 89
: (3) Because she's twenty
What do you want
Paul's gone today
set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket
You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong
All the things we both believe in
Well  don't believe in extortion
don't believe in tying myself to you for the next eight years
Four years, let's not get ahead of ourselves
long beat
Finally the Governor says: What were you doing in her room
Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one
No
You were already fired, you were out
What were you doing in her room
was fixing a situation
got a call, someone from the hotel thought  could help and called me
You were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to come back and fix things
It was your voice on the phone the other night
() () 90
: (4) (') You were fucking her
What did you do Stephen
loaned her some money and gave her a ride
bet you did
Pause
: (') There's no note
Okay, there's no note
Show it to me
You think  brought it here
That's how people get hurt
Okay let's play this out
You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal
and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison
You were fucking her and she told you about her situation
There are no records or conversations between us
And since she's had an abortion, no  evidence
So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine
Your word fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor
There's no note
It's your call Governor
As the Governor weighs his options we- : 91
- is sitting in a barber shop getting his hair cut
the cuts
Paul sits there
The  is on
a sports show
no one talks
We watch Paul's face as the barber clips the back of his head
: walks out, starts down the street
As he passes the first corner, he sees the Governor's  and the Secret Service  both parked on the side of the road
Paul looks at the
then walks up to the window
The window rolls down and the  leans his head out
Paul you got a minute
We stay outside the car for along time
We hear under this shot
We see Paul get out of the  and the two SUVs drive off, leaving him standing there
-  -   - -  - ' in a different hotel now
The  is on
How much could a big shake up days before the Ohio primary hurt a campaign
asked Paul Zara how his firing could actually help the candidate
We See , shaving in the bathroom mirror, as he listens to the
The Governor and  both felt, that in light of some of these changing numbers, it was best to put a new face on the campaign
Stephen is very talented
very smart
: 92
- We see a shot of an old church
People are walking up the steps and through the big open doors
- We're at a memorial service for Molly
We see a lot of young people
is sitting in the back row
As Molly's father speaks  walks in
He sits in the adjacent row - he and Paul look at each other
You always hear people talking about events out of sequence
the order of things
There is no greater grief than a parent laying their child to rest
She was a little girl trying to make it in a very grown up world
a world were every mistake is magnified and she was smart and pretty and so so young
He looks to the  next to him
(') Father, you ask us to accept God's plan, to not question his judgment, with all due respect,  don't accept this judgment
She made the world better, not just for me, but for everyone she touched
: -    - We're on the street in front of the church
People are filing out
is waiting next to ' car as Steven walks up
You should hire Jack for a speech writer
'll keep that in mind
Are you here to talk to me
() 93
: No
'm friends with the family
got her the internship
known her since she was born
'm sorry
The Governor couldn't make the flight
He's meeting with Thompson
Look at you, all grown up with tits and all
learned from the best
One day we'll grab a beer and you'll tell me what you had on the Governor that put me out
How do you know  didn't have something on you
They both smile
You better get going, you've got a campaign to run and 've got offices to go look at
Farragut North
Paul nods his head
Nice consultant firm right off of Street
Paul turns to leave
(') million a year and nobody to fuck you over
() 94
: (2) Sounds relaxing
Paul, without looking back
Doesn't it
: - - with his  and , stand at the podium just behind Senator Thompson
There are a few hundred people in attendance, campaign workers, supporters and press
And the right man to lead this great nation of ours in these challenging times and the next President of the United States of America, Governor Mike Morris
And  ask only one thing, that all of us stand shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm in a united Democratic party
Huge cheers
(') And  strongly urge that the three hundred and fifty-six loyal delegates that  have carried as a badge of honor, throw their support to the Governor
Let's end this primary and get on to the business of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave
More big cheers
(') Thank you
And God bless the United States of America
Thompson turns and shakes the hand of Governor Morris
Morris steps up to the microphone
: - Under the following we hear the Governor's speech
() 95
: We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc
At a catering truck we see a pair of hands grab some coffee and cookies
This is another young intern,
We follow her across the street and into a door
&   - comes through the door
We follow her through the hallways crowded with television cables and technicians
She makes her way in to a large reception room, where Stephen is watching Governor Morris give his speech
She hands him a coffee
We cut between The Governor and Stephen watching from the back
Thank you Senator Thompson
Well the polls aren't quite closed, but want to congratulate Senator Pullman
And his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio
The room explodes in laughter and applause
(') Senator Thompson  am honored to stand here today with you
am humbled by your kind words, thank you
Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals
Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past
Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand
the sands of Saudi Arabia
the sands of Iraq
Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country
We are not a nation used to coming in second or third
Cheers
: 96
-  & While the Governor's speech continues we stay close on Stephen as he walks through the crowd
We follow him into Governor Morris's staging area
Four monitors on a table show different network feeds
We watch Stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt
He ties his tie and puts his jacket on
From the monitors we hear reporters etc
We push in on one of the monitors where  is being interviewed
As we push in we see  cross out of the room
is watching, he looks back and smiles at
No it's not decisive, we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say
It does look like we'll win Ohio
But you must concede that these three hundred and fifty-six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach
And with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for Morris
We still have a lot of contests Rachel, Ohio is- Well then do you have the funds
As we read it- () Of course we have the funds
We're getting new donations daily
Our new intern,  crosses into frame looking down at
Hey
Ben
was told to talk to you
'm supposed to get a phone
Right
you're

: Jill Morris

Are you a Bearcat
No

: -  - shot of  walking across the quad towards the gym
- We pick up Stephen walking with Ida
You're making me look bad
How so
just filed a story that said you were off the campaign and Thompson was going to Pullman
You can't believe everything you read
want to give you an opportunity to comment on my next story
It says that you delivered Thompson
You got the three hundred and fifty-six delegates, you delivered the nomination
And all you asked in return was Paul's job
Any chance of you confirming that
They approach a security guard standing by a set of double doors
No press beyond this point
she's press
'll read about it in the funny papers
() 98
: Come on Stephen
aren't we friends anymore
You're my best friend Ida
And Stephen walks through the doors
-  - wide shot of the darkened gymnasium
Stephen sits on a stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light
We're now in tight - One  is putting a mic on Stephen while the  is applying make-up
No one speaks
The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear
You should be able to hear them
do you hear them
We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New York
Yeah  can hear them
Good, quick mic check can you count to ten for me
Stephen counts to ten
Everyone stands behind the camera
The sound man with his headset on whispers
(') They're coming to you in about forty five seconds
We sit in silence staring at Stephens face
Ten seconds - nothing
Twenty seconds - nothing This scene starts to resemble our opening -  dark auditorium - only a few people doing their individual jobs
Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell phones
() 99
: The   is sitting on the floor talking on his headset
The  makes adjustments
sweeping the gym floor in the distance
They all seem to be staring at him
They probably aren't - but he feels it
The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen has given over to emptiness
The price of winning at all cost
We stay on Stephen's face
We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig
Senator Thompson  am proud that you have brought integrity back to this election
Because that's what this comes down to, integrity
Who we are
Because how we project ourselves to the rest of the world matters
Dignity matters
Integrity matters
Our future depends on it
Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the
Coming to you in five

Through the earwig we hear an
We now have Governor Morris's new senior campaign advisor, Stephen Myers, coming to us from Xavier University where Senator Thompson has just endorsed Governor Morris, essentially ending this primary race
(To Stephen) Stephen, can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded
