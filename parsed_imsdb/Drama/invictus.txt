Footage would include: - Mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the - the khaki-clad  (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and Australia
- popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white - black retaliation - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the African National Congress victory - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the : "Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world

We can make out the at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much
On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00
The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake
He reaches out, switches on the light
, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in one movement
He has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger

The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed, leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed
Or a prison bunk
For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars
'  - Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door
This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous man on the planet
'  - Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a moment to savor the air
It is bone dry and cold -- typical conditions in the Highveld at this time of year
It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is completely alone in the world
The big yard is fenced
There is a small   at the driveway gate
When Mandela steps away from the house, pushes the button that opens the gate
'  - When the gate begins to open we see that there are BMWs parked either side of it
- comes to full alert as the gate opens
He is a big, scowling man dressed in a suit
He checks the load on a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster
Here he comes
Like clockwork
It makes him such an easy target

Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits  , a naturally tense and suspicious man
Both of them are hollow- eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline
They get out of the , fast and quiet
This does not look good
'  - As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga intercept him
(traditional greeting in ) see you, father
Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles
(without breaking stride) Morning boys
How are you
Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his number one bodyguard
They are both former "terrorists", and they are utterly devoted to Mandela
We're sharp, Madiba
Good
good
And how's your mother doing, Linga
She's much better, thank you
Good
Mandela picks up the pace
Jason and Linga fall back, so that they are a few steps behind him
They share a quick look
They hate this walk
It scares them
There's no way for it to be anything but completely unsanitary, from a security point of view

Jason and Linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert

Mandela does not react to this giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly -- (  : starting with the window of this grocery, there are pictures of Mandela everywhere
Magazine covers, newspaper centerfolds, -shirts, children's art -- as if to make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were banned
) -- until they       tearing towards them
They turn, 6
Linga steps in front of Mandela, shielding him, Jason steps out wide, ready for anything
Mandela is completely calm
The van screeches to a halt just past them
jumps out of the van holding a tied , which he drops with a thump at the grocery door
The guy doesn't see them
The delivery van is gone before the newspapers stop moving
Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the headlines
Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do not relax
These are dangerous times

What does it say
It says, "He can win an election, but can he run a country
" () Not even one day on the job and they're after you
It's a legitimate question
Mandela turns and marches for home
Jason and Linga fall in behind him

: The razor is dull
Mandela opens drawers looking for another
He opens a drawer that is empty but for a '  , broken and shedding tiny colored beads
Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer, looks at himself in the mirror
Mostly, Mandela's face is warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost all the time
But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask that conceals all emotion, all feeling
This is his prison face
This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in the mirror
It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey has marked his very soul
Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor

Brutal toughness and honor in his features

,  - Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on a hill overlooking Pretoria
The seat of power
Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi- racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world
Lots of new South African flags evident
We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that we can soar along the outside of the building and into the offices of state -- -- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the Mandela regime
These characters run the gamut from little old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid
They are all white
good third of the offices are already deserted
The deserted offices have open doors
Through a window, through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards striding down a Union Building hallway
We swoop in through the window -- - -- and catch up with the new President
Mandela is regal in a magnificent tailored suit
Jason in front, Linga behind
of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass
They pass a  hanging a    next to one of De Klerk, the previous President
, as he smiles at that
Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and into the offices being packed up
Up ahead, the double doors to the    , are closed
Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in, then opens the doors wide
(with great pride) After you, Mr
President
10
'  - Mandela's offices are fronted by a   , already filled with
To one side are his   '  of offices, to the other side, the
Beyond these are ' , -- his gatekeepers
Beyond that is the inner sanctum, '
The phones are ringing off the hook
Fax machines are chattering
Everyone wants a piece of Mandela
Mandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him
Good morning everybody
() , Mandela's    (and now Ambassador to the
), emerges from her office, carrying an arm load of files, folders and papers -- Barbara, good morning
You've had your hair done
like it
-- accompanies Mandela back towards his office
Thank you, Madiba
We need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers
Give me one moment, please
Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of her
'  - Mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to savor where he is
11
Then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for work
-- Barbara enters
-- please assemble the staff for me
Whoever has not already left
Right now
All of them
Yes, please
: - What's left of the    are packed into the White faces, bitter and resentful
Waiting to be fired
Through the glass doors, , Linga and Jason with him
#1 Here he comes
#2 He wants the satisfaction of firing us himself
They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with pride
- Linga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of restless Afrikaners
At the    , Mandela turns to them
'd like you to stay out here, please
But, Madiba
12
cannot talk to them if 'm hiding behind men with guns
Mandela opens the doors and enters
Jason and Linga stay outside
just
- Mandela enters, smiles -- gets not one smile in return
( ) Gooie more almal
() Does he think greeting us in Afrikaans makes this any sweeter
Some of you may know who  am
This gets a few bitter chuckles
Mandela is at this best just talking to people, like this
Only, he doesn't just talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and making individual contact as he speaks to all of them
Good morning
how are you
thank you for coming at such short notice
etc
: Mandela is a continual security nightmare
You can see the tension on Jason and Linga's faces as he disappears into the throng
: When Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody
couldn't help noticing the empty offices as  came to work today
And all the packing boxes
One black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces
13
Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right
And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away
He can be tough and blunt, when necessary
But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now,  am here to tell you, have no such fear
() Wat is verby is verby
What's past is past
We look to the future, now
This is not what they expected to hear
We need your help
We want your help
If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service
Mandela pauses, to look at the faces
They are receptive
ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts
promise to do the same
() If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world
: Jason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in and listening
Jason shakes his head
He wants to win them over, one damn boer at a time
: 14
'  - Mandela heads back through to his office, Barbara, Mary and other assistants forming a phalanx around him
Linga peels off, goes into the security office
Jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (), waits for her to finish a call, then: Molo, sister
() It's still morning
Jason grins
When you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month
We need to plan security
Jessie's phone rings
( ) Office of the President, good morning
Jessie waves Jason off
He crosses to the security office, enters
- Once he closes the door behind him, Jason shows his fatigue
Linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee
Three more bodyguards -- ,  and  -- slump in chairs
Jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a groan
We need more men
Did you talk to Barbara about it
Yesterday
15
knock at the door
That's Jessie, with the schedule
() Come in, beautiful
The door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful
in suits enter, Special Branch written all over them
,  ,  and The bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their territory
What is this
Mr
Jason Tshabalala
That's me
Am  under arrest
Etienne snaps out a crisp salute
Captain Van Eck and team reporting for duty, sir
Hendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes
Their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards
What duty
We're the Presidential bodyguard
We've been assigned to this office
(holding out a sheet of ) Here are our orders
Jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly angry
( ) You're Special Branch, right
16
Hendrick nods, sternly
Linga, Sam, Kwezi and Winston react to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them and the Special Branch
You'll see that they've been signed
don't care if they're signed or -- Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the orders:
Wait here
Jason storms out, holding the orders
The four black bodyguards seethe with hostility
The four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground
'  - Mandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something or other
When Jason knocks and enters, they pause
Sorry to disturb you
You look agitated, Jason
That's because 've got four Special Branch cops in my office
What have you done
Me
Nothing
They say they're the Presidential bodyguard
They have orders
() Signed by you
Yes
They've had special training, those boys -- with the
And lots of experience
They protected De Klerk
17
Yes, but -- You asked for more men, didn't you
Yes, but -- In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too
You represent me, directly
The rainbow nation starts here
() Reconciliation starts here
Reconciliation
Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us
Maybe even these four guys
They tried and, often, they succeeded
: Linga, Sam, Winston and Kwezi stare down Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem
: '  - Mandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with wisdom, compassion and sympathy
Yes,  know
( ) Forgiveness starts here, too
Mandela lets that sink in for a moment
He knows he asks for something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree
Forgiveness liberates the soul
It removes fear
That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason
() 18
(') () Please try it
Jason exhales
He isn't remotely ready to forgive
Yes, Madiba
Sorry to disturb you
Jason turns, leaves
Barbara shakes her head at Mandela
You ask a lot
Only what is necessary
: '  - As Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie holds out a file for him
Two copies of the schedule
Jason snatches the file, keeps walking
Thank you, Jessie
When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception area, just to get himself together
Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's going to hate
- Things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office
The silence is deafening
Jason enters, looks them all over
His face is grim
Can we get rid of these guys, now
Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him, visibly -- he holds out one of '  to Etienne
19
This is his schedule for the next month
Let's look it over for duty assignments
Right
What
Linga and the others are shocked
Jason,  have to talk to you
Outside
Linga virtually pulls Jason out of the office
'  - Just outside the Security Office door, so they keep their voices low
How can we trust them
We can't
(heading back in) This is what Madiba wants, okay
Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face
- When Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's schedule
Are there any special orders or conditions
No
Yes
Madiba gets upset if you don't smile when you push people out of the way
Seriously
20
Yes, seriously
It's the new South Africa
Madiba
The President's clan name
It's what we call him
The new bodyguards share a look
They're not comfortable with "Madiba"
We'll call him Mr
President
Jason lifts the schedule
Let's get through this
Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's, at the month's schedule
Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office
Both teams study and discuss the schedule -- (shop talk tbd // ) Etienne shakes his head
How's he going to do all this
When does he take a break
He says he rested enough in prison
Jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the schedule
Here's a headache
What
21
rugby match at Loftus Versfeld
British Lions against the Springboks
It's going to be a headache for the Lions, that's for sure
We're going to donder them
don't care about the game care that the President'll be so exposed
To thousands of drunken -- () -- sports fans
Yes
Sports fans
Who didn't vote for him
Who probably hate him
Who came out of the womb with guns in their hands
,     - : - huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male
Many wearing the Springbok green and gold
Widespread evidence of drinking
Lots of     -- the blue, white and orange apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the ringing the stadium
On the field,     and face each other in two lines
The   in their white on white with black and red trim, the  in their green and gold
Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for one man, who is "colored" (mixed race)
22
Big, tough, brutal-looking men
Scary
(We may or may not notice Francois Pienaar, standing at the head of the line of Springboks
) : -    - At the entrance of the tunnel onto the field,    in blue South African Police uniforms
Behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find but for Linga
They are keyed-up, intense -- none more so than Jason
(shouting against the ) want your eyes on the crowd at all times
We're staying in the middle of the field
He's going to walk out, shake hands, walk back
Nothing else
Got it
They nod
They are like the players at game time, only the stakes are much higher
Jason looks deeper into the tunnel, straightens up
Here we go
Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark suit
Big crowds energize him
His eyes are alive with excitement
One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga
Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods
We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel -- - -- onto the field, towards the waiting teams
The crowd rise to their feet
Lots of them jeer Mandela, lots cheer
All the old South African flags are waved at him defiantly -- plus some new ones
Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly
To him, a crowd is an opportunity to make new friends
But he stays in the center of the field
23
Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela
Mandela reaches the rugby players
Waiting for him at the head of the Springbok line, wearing the  6  and captain's armband, is Now we know what he does
Mandela extends his hand
Good luck, captain
( ) Thank you, sir
Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then returns, shaking hands with the British Lions
Quick, perfunctory handshakes
As Mandela does this, we take    of the crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless
Time to play rugby
Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk along the center of the field, back to the tunnel
Crowd noise increases
They know the opening whistle is about to blow
Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level
' :    - ,   , heads towards this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps current -- enemies
: shit
( ) Stay with him
Stop him
Stay with him
24
With his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd
Thank you for honoring our new flag
Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not
The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is delaying the rugby
Mandela is undeterred
He's into this one-on-one outreach
He turns, looks for more hands to shake -- -- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd
We're delaying the rugby, Madiba
Oh, yes, of course
Mandela gives one last wave, turns away
As he does,       from the stands
Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late
' , explodes juicily on the field
Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react
If anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field
The bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel
-    - Jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort Mandela all the way up to his box
Hendrick, the biggest, leads the way
Jason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne
Both men are in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them
Why didn't you stop him
Next time, you try
25
Does he do that sort of thing all the time
Ask my ulcer
() Good thing that was just an orange
And good thing he never saw it
Oh, he saw it
He sees everything
(rubbing his ulcer) hate rugby
: - Two international front rows come together with bone- crunching force
Huge, violent men grunt like bulls
The crowd roar vibrates the stadium
The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee
Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it
The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force
The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed
The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing Springbok defenders
The Lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically -- -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it
One last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner
As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned
26
At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team
Concentrate, dammit
Focus
We can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs
, as he realizes he is not getting through
There is dullness, shock in his player's eyes -- -- which all lift to the heavens as the through the uprights
We    as it drops past a
as it registers the conversion and shows the score:  - 10  - 0 - In the  box, Mandela turns his back on the field as the game restarts beneath him and continues in the background
He has  around his neck
Shall we work while we watch
We have lots of promises to keep
Barbara sits to his right, with her ever-present files and folders
Yes, we do
Mary pours tea at the back of the box
Linga stands two steps behind Mandela
On Mandela's left, sits the     , a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive
It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game
If they don't, heads will roll
This is unacceptable
( ) Come on you bloody bastards
27
Mandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste for profanity
He turns to Barbara
Where do you want go first, for foreign investment
Where the money is
America, England, Saudi Arabia
Barbara makes notes
Mandela lifts his , but instead of looking at the rugby, he looks at the crowd
: '    -- Mandela zeroes in on an -- the apartheid flag
It is being held by the  -  ()
Classic South African figures from the rural far north, they are already drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the field
: Do you see all the old apartheid flags
It's a disgrace
Mandela lowers his binoculars
It's also a constitutional right
Along with the apartheid anthem know
But it's time people moved on
Mandela grunts, raises his binoculars again
: '    -- Mandela finds a , holding the and cheering ecstatically
: 28
Look at that
The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions
Mandela lowers the binoculars
We did that on the island, you know
We supported anyone but the `boks
It really irritated the warders
Of course it did
as he thinks about this for a moment, then lifts his binoculars to look at the crowd again
: '    -- on the knot of black spectators, who leap to their feet, reacting to -- - -- where the Lions score yet another try
This is an ass- whipping
: The conversion sails over the `boks heads
The scoreboard clicks over to:  - 20  - - Mandela lowers his binoculars, sets them aside, shakes his head
He knows it's hopeless now
He turns to the Rugby President
How long until the World Cup
About a year
Plenty of time for improvement
29
The Rugby President can't take it
He stands
Mr
President --  wouldn't get my hopes up
We're a damn disgrace
He stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to fire
Mandela gets back to work
want to go to India and Indonesia, too
There is a knock at the luxury box door
Linga swings to face the door, alert, as a   opens it
The    (Steve Tshwete), enters
Sorry 'm late
He sits down in the empty chair to the right of Mandela
How's it going
Very badly
The Minister of Sport checks the score, winces
Maybe it's just as well
Mandela shoots him a sharp look
Why
(bending close, talking ) 've just been at a meeting of the National Sports Council executive
There's strong support to drop the Springbok emblem and colors altogether
(gesturing at the field) If they're playing badly, maybe its a good time to make a change
(with barely hidden ) () 30
(cont'd) This could be the last time we have to look at the green and gold
The Minister of Sport shoots a glance at Mandela, to see his reaction to all this
Mandela is deep in thought and completely unreadable
: - One last, bloody, violent bit of play -- then, mercifully, the final whistle blows
Final score:  - 32  - 15
The Lions celebrate
The Springboks head off the field, heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly disappointed or bloodier than Francois Pienaar
In the stands, the unheard of happens -- the Springboks are booed by their own fans
Not by everybody, but by enough
We    ` as they trudge across the field, then clatter along the concrete tunnel to their dressing room
- The atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower
Nobody catches anybody else's eye
Huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties
Plus, one dark body -- that of  , a skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man
Pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats
His body hurts
He has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen
noble warrior, defeated
(
) Francois Pienaar's team came to Loftus Versfeld stadium this afternoon, unprepared and arrogant
31
Meet   as he tapes his commentary on the test match
He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years, now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator
He is a household name, and the last word on the state of the Springboks
They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels
() And , for one, am glad
Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby
Boland defines the South African talent for pessimism and negativity
: '  - ( ) The Rugby World Cup is now less than a year away, and , for one, am relieved that we are the host nation, and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament
Because 'm not sure we would get in on merit alone
The Rugby President sucks on a rum and coke, watches Boland with one of his
Who gets the axe
Someone has to
: '  - No after-match party this night
Still depressed by the loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee
32
( ) Pienaar's team played without discipline, without strategy and without courage
He's trying to get them to drop me
He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played
Maybe, but people listen to what he says
: '  - Wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi- tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name
( ) They brought shame upon our nation, and , for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so-called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold
: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in his head
He grunts, turns off the , puts the correspondence aside, stands
Mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray
Here's your muti
warmed the milk tonight
You're too good to me
Mandela takes his pills
Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend
33
Mandela pauses, between pills
Did she say why
No, she didn't
(making it up) She said to tell you she was sorry
Mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill
Do you need anything else tonight
No, thank you
'm going to bed
Good night
Good night, Madiba
Sleep well
Mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades
As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier
, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown
He looks at his bed
It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper
He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch
He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight
The most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone
: - very poor township outside Johannesburg
stark reminder of how much work Mandela has ahead of him runs by
We    and find a , -
noisy leads from outside into the church
There is a pecking order in the line, based on size

) No pushing now
There's enough for everybody

, -  - At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of
, a stout and charitable woman
Next to her,
hands out a lollipop and says -- God bless you
-- to each kid
The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by Mrs
Dlamini's "God bless yous"
The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only    () left and only one article of clothing
An old Green and gold
Sipho could use it
His clothes are more holes than anything else
He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully
You're a very lucky boy
It's a real Springbok practise jersey
It's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever
Sipho shakes his head
It's yours, take it
Go on
Sipho turns and leaves
Mrs
Coleman looks at Mrs
Dlamini, completely confused
Why won't he take it
If he wears it, the others will beat him up
Because the Springboks are playing so badly
No
Because, for them, the Springboks still represent apartheid
: 35
- Eersterust is a settlement and conference location just outside Pretoria
Today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the National Sports Council, an  organization that is now the governing body of all sports in South Africa
banner draped across the conference center entrance tells us so:
- An   has the podium and the microphone
and now for the next item on our agenda
The hall is jammed
Very few white faces
The  executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion
ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates
that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the Springboks be eliminated immediately
That causes a stir
The delegates understand how big this is
and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known forthwith as the Proteas
Excitement and noise level rises
The  Firebrand has to shout through his mike
() We will submit this motion to a hand vote
() 36
(cont'd) In the event of a close count, we will go to a written ballot
(the moment he's been ) ,
The  firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air
With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists
Unanimous
The Springboks are history
, as      steps outside to make a call
: '  - At his desk, Mandela puts down his phone
Anger in his eyes
He slams both palms down hard on his desk
: - Both bodyguard units (minus Jason) are crammed into the small office
The black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in Xhosa
(Ad-lib
) The white bodyguards talk Afrikaans (ad- lib)
No talk between the two units, only tension
Tension broken with a crash as
Both units to the cars, right now
,  - Grey , armored grey Mercedes, grey  in a line at the entrance
Jason, Kwezi, Winston and Sam scramble out of the building and dive into the lead
Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem dive into the trailer
37
- Brusque, scowling, Mandela marches towards the exit, shadowed by Linga, flanked by Barbara
What do  tell the Japanese trade delegation
delegate that decision to you
Do you want me to inform the
No
We should at least include the Minister of Sport
No
Mandela heads out to the cars
Barbara has no choice but to follow
,  - Ever the gentleman, Mandela ushers Barbara into the Mercedes
As she gets in: strongly advise against doing this
Especially on your own
It it gives the impression of autocratic leadership
'  - Mandela gets in, closes the door
You risk alienating your cabinet and your party
Your advice is duly noted, Barbara
38
Madiba
the people want this
They hate the Springboks
They don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives
Yes,  know
But in this instance the people are wrong
And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that
Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga
Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast
Linga murmurs into his radio
The convoy pulls out, very fast
Barbara makes one last plea
You're risking your political capital
You're risking your future as our leader
The day  am afraid to do that is the day  am no longer fit to lead
At least risk it for something more important than rugby
Mandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry
- Mandela's convoy heads away from Pretoria, very fast
(
) and in concluding this historic conference
39
- brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage
The  Firebrand and the executive applaud the members
The applause spreads until the hall rocks
They are all very pleased with themselves
: -   - Mandela's convoy roars in
Mandela is the first one out, Linga next
Jason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area
Kwezi opens the door for Barbara on the other side
Mandela strides over to Jason, says something to him
Jason looks surprised, turns to Hendrick
Linga's customary scowl intensifies
: - As the applause finally begins to diminish, the  Firebrand turns and nods to a   , off to the side
The choir director brings his  onto the stage
Brothers, sisters
join us in our anthem
Anyone not standing, stands
The choir director raises his hands
The choir inhales
Go
() Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God Bless Africa) -- But before the first line is fully sung, an  rushes out, whispers urgently into the  Firebrand's ear
40
The Firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise
He crosses to the Choir Director, says something quickly
The Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus
Consternation everywhere
What's going on
Brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important
In this case, for someone truly important
(beat, milking it) Please welcome President Mandela
The place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading the way
Face stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium
The delegates press in towards them
- Jason coordinates security inside and out
Lifts his radio to his mouth
( ) Smile
, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the scowl did
, the same
- Barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by Kwezi
Mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous
When they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly
Brothers, sisters, comrades,  am here because  feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight
He lectures them like a headmaster
They don't like it
41
am aware of your earlier vote am aware that it was unanimous
() Nonetheless,  propose that we restore the Springboks
Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately
Instant and complete silence in the hall
This is utterly unpopular
Shocked faces, especially from the executive and the  firebrand
, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her
Let me tell you why
Murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise
Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one
on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners
() For twenty seven years,  studied them
learned their language, read their history,  read their poetry
had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him
() And we prevailed, did we not
All of us here
we prevailed
For the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes
Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner
They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy
Just as quickly, Mandela loses them again
And they treasure Springbok rugby
If we take that away, we lose them
We prove that we are what they feared we would be
() We have to be better than that
() 42
(') We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity
The grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder
Yes,  know
All the things they denied us
, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension
But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge
This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold
The crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment
is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe
() You elected me
() You elected me to be your leader
Let me lead you now
() Who is with me on this
It's almost as if he's daring them to go against him
Who is with me
The murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement
as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this is a fiasco
: - As delegates spill out of the conference hall, Mandela's convoy leaves as fast as it arrived
It almost looks as if they're fleeing
43
'  - Silence
Mandela looks exhausted, almost gaunt
Facing his own people like that took it out of him
Barbara stares out the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out
Linga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress
( ) - Jason and his crew travel in stoic silence
() - Similar silence from Etienne and crew
It seems like the silence of defeat
'  - Twelve votes
Twelve
luxury
All we needed was one more yes than no
What if you hadn't got it
Well, as you know,  am an obedient party member
Barbara snorts disagreement
She is angry at her boss
'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got problems everywhere we look
Housing, food, jobs, crime, our currency
You can't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority
But,  must
This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy
Without them, we cannot address the other problems
44
So this rugby, it's just a political calculation
Life and energy, flood back into Mandela
He sits up against his seat belt, faces his Chief of Staff
It's a human calculation
() If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us
, in the front seat
He's not supposed to listen -- but how could he not
will do what  must to break this cycle
Or it will destroy us
: - The sound of cleats approaching on concrete
Exhausted footsteps
The (cans) on a side table, rips them open, backs away -- -- as the Springboks enter silently, faces miserable, shoulders slumped
They've lost another game
One of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic -- This beer tastes like kuk
-- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures, sending foaming beer everywhere
as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet
It's not the beer
Pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry Springbok
45
Take another
() Everybody take a beer
This is an order
The entire team takes a beer, including Pienaar
toast
Pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up
They all crack and raise their beers
to the taste of defeat
That bewilders his team
Drink it
Remember it
And promise yourself never to taste it again
Pienaar takes one long swig -- You're right
It tastes like kuk
-- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures
Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall
The dressing room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion
As with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale
: - Both units crammed into the small office
As usual, neither team talks to the other
Jason enters with two files
Here's the schedule for the overseas trip
Jason and the boys look over one, Etienne and his unit look over the other -- and discuss it amongst themselves in Afrikaans
Hendrick says something pointed, which resonates with the others
46
What did he just say
said -- He asked when we were supposed to sleep
As well as other basic human functions
Hey
If Madiba can do it, we can do it
: - Mandela addresses the General Assembly, thanking them for their support in the fight against apartheid
The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again
Linga and Hendrick are his closest bodyguards
: -   - Mandela addresses diplomats, members of Congress, black leaders at a made-for- ceremony on the South Lawn
have come here with a message
People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us
People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country
Linga, Jason, Etienne and Hendrick are in on this one -- a little island of South Africans in a sea of : 47
- We are in a  behind the palace
Drawn by four white horses,    (an open carriage) pulls up, stops
The courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then security guards
and Mandela emerge from the palace
Footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage
The Queen and Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side)
When they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and says something to the Queen that makes her giggle
almost
For Queens do not giggle
The carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight, as they get set to face the world
(
) and in London, President Mandela made quite an impression on the Queen -- : '  - : footage of Mandela with the Queen, riding down the mall waving to ecstatic crowds
-- as he concluded a gruelling trip -- Mr
Pienaar   , so that he can deliver the latest one-liner to Mrs
Pienaar
In related news, it was announced that President Mandela will be visiting South Africa this week
Mrs
Pienaar laughs
, in the kitchen, a plump, middle-aged Tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the
This is , the Pienaar's maid
48
She does not find Mr
Pienaar's joke amusing
: - The '  taxis towards the familiar , Mercedes, convoy
: Mandela disembarks, very slowly
He is exhausted, his feet are swollen, his knee hurts
This is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world
He is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick
It's good to be home, sir
Mandela just nods
Too tired to talk
Hendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for him
Mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers
Reflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him
'm fine
Mandela steps out of Hendrick's hands, holds onto the open door
Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring
Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a   out, hands it to Hendrick
This is for you
Mandela slides into the car
Once the door is closed, Hendrick glances at the package
We don't see it
It is too dark
But we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it
: 49
- Hendrick is being driven home through the Highveld night
He chews on something really sticky, chewy
He pauses to dislodge some of it from a tooth, before it pulls out a filling
Then, he resumes chewing
: '  - On the bedside table,   clicks from 4:59 to 5:00
Mandela's eyes open in the dark
close for a second
then shoot open again
It takes everything Mandela has to sit up and switch on the light
: '  - The bodyguards' 's flank the gate
As the gate opens -- -- Linga gets out of one , Hendrick gets out of the other
They are alert
It is freezing cold
Bundled up against the cold, Mandela emerges through the gate and they close in on him
It is clear that he is pushing himself, physically
( ) see you, father
Morning boys
Morning, sir
They keep moving
It is too cold for anything else
How is your family, Hendrick
50
Top shape, sir
How about yours
Mandela's smile becomes fixed on his face
have a very big family
42 million people
Then, he stops, turns, heads back towards the house
don't think  want to walk today
Hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow
He shoots an anxious glance at Linga -- who looks at him as if he'd just committed blasphemy
Mandela goes through the open gate without a word
The gate closes behind him, leaving Linga and Hendrick to watch him through iron bars
Linga turns on Hendrick
We never ask him about his family
But he asks about ours all the time
Think about it, man
He's separated from his wife
His children
how often do you see them here
() He's not a saint, okay
He's a man, with a man's problems -- and he doesn't need us reminding him about them
Linga heads back to his
Hendrick stands at the gate, looking in at the house
: '  - Mandela shaves, avoiding his own gaze
: 51
Shaved, showered and dressed, Mandela descends the stairs, sits down to breakfast by himself at the big table
He looks at the newspaper headlines, which talk about  , ,     etc
etc
Like any other man, Mandela turns to the   for relief -- and finally finds something to smile about
: There is a
Mandela reacts to it, pleased
: '  - As a      leave, Barbara enters, holding an envelope
Hello Barbara
like that dress
Thank you Madiba
( ) This is for you
( ) What is it
Your pay checks
You haven't been collecting them
Mandela opens the envelope, looks at a check -- and grunts
What's wrong
This is terrible
Madiba, it's what De Klerk got
Plus an increase for inflation
But, Mandela shakes his head, outraged
52
(
) Today, President Mandela announced that, in his opinion -- : - (on  throughout) -- his salary is too high
Pienaar and Nerine watch the news with
Dead right
They're all overpaid
, once again, Eunice washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the
He has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity
Give me the houses and cars they give him and 'll donate a third of my salary too
Francois' cell phone rings
(to Mr
Pienaar) You would not
Not in a million years
( ) Hallo, Pienaar
Whatever Pienaar hears on the phone sends him out of the room in a hurry
( ) Hang on a moment, please
President Mandela said that he wished to set an example to other leaders and cabinet ministers
53
Fat chance
They're lining their pockets as fast as they can
Nerine is interested in the call that sent Pienaar hurrying out of the room
Mr
Pienaar
Must be his girlfriend, hey Nerine
He knows 'd bloody kill him
, as eyes and ears alive, she finishes in the kitchen
Pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned expression on his face
What
Who was it
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately
Told you
It was his girlfriend
Shush
've been invited to tea
Who with
The President
The President of  Rugby
Count your fingers after he shakes your hand
Pienaar points at the muted
The President

Eunice turns and looks at Francois, wide-eyed
54
The Pienaar family all stare at the , stunned
He wants me over for tea, week after next
Eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar
Mr
Francois -- you must tell Madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive
He must please fix it
() Good night everybody
Good night Eunice, thank you
All eyes on Pienaar
What the hell does he want with you
Pienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea
: ,  - Nerine's modest little car heads towards the seat of power
'  - Nerine drives
Pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous
Francois, relax
You've met him before
shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all
You didn't even vote for him
55
He's still the President
() He's had dinner with the Queen
With Presidents and movie stars
All  do is play rugby
What if pull something stupid in front of him
Nerine stops to let Pienaar out
Gives him a kiss, straightens his hair
You won't
'll pick you up right here
,  - Pienaar climbs out of Nerine's car
pretty sizeable    rush towards him
Pienaar takes a deep breath
He is a bundle of nerves
: - Small office packed with big men
See who's coming for tea
My nephew wants me to get his autograph
Who
Francois Pienaar
Who wants to escort him in
Hendrick bolts for the door
will
56
No autographs
() know how to do my job, okay
Hendrick leaves
Who's this Pienaar
You can't be serious
He's the captain of the Springboks
Linga shrugs, provocatively indifferent
like soccer, myself
Well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans
One the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by -- Ja, ja, 've heard it before
It wasn't funny the first time
Not exactly violin music and roses
but they are talking to each other
- Hendrick escorts Pienaar back towards Mandela's offices
Hendrick is the bigger man
Can  ask you a question, Lieutenant
Ja, of course
What's he like
They pause at the office door
Hendrick ponders that question for a moment, then: 57
When  worked for the previous President, it was my job to be invisible
Hendrick opens the door
This President
he found out like English toffee and brought me some back, from his visit to the Queen
Hendrick ushers Pienaar into Mandela's offices
To him, nobody is invisible
'  - Hendrick gestures to the waiting area
That's where you wait
One of his assistants will come for you
() There's a bathroom over there, if you need it
Okay
Thanks
Hendrick turns to leave, hesitates, turns back
What are our chances in the World Cup
mean, for real
We'll do our best
That,  can guarantee
Hendrick nods solemnly, heads back to security
Pienaar heads straight for the bathroom
- Hendrick enters
Etienne and the other white bodyguards look up
58
Well, he's not as big as he looks on
() And we don't stand a bloody chance in the World Cup
- Pienaar washes his hands, dries them, dries them again, combs his hair, looks at himself in the mirror, adjusts his blazer
'  - Pienaar returns to the waiting area, sits
There is a clock on the wall
One minute to four
Four Japanese trade officials traipse out, having just met Mandela
The second hand journeys up to vertical
When it hits 4 o'clock exactly -- -- Mary walks into the waiting area
Mr
Pienaar
Pienaar shoots to his feet
This way, please
Mary leads Pienaar back to Mandela's own office, knocks, opens the door
Go on in
Mouth dry, Pienaar nods -- -- and enters the inner sanctum
'  - Mandela leaps up from behind his desk, crosses the room to meet Pienaar
59
Francois, what an honor
'm so excited
They shake hands
Thank you for coming all this way to see me
Pienaar gulps like a fish out of water
Yes, sir
No problem
Thank you for inviting me
Tell me
How's your ankle
My ankle
was told you'd hurt it
Has it healed
Pienaar relaxes, visibly
This is small talk he can handle
This is Mandela's gift
The truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what
Yes
yes
In sports, and in life
Come
Sit
Please
(indicating a chair) Take this one
Looking into the light hurts my eyes
They sit in the chairs
at the door, and
the old Afrikaner tea lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray
Mandela stands again, immediately
Ah, Mrs
Brits -- Pienaar stands just a beat slower
60
-- you are a shining light in my day
Yes sir
Eyes twinkling, Mrs
Brits puts the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of them
The finest china, cookies on a plate
Mrs
Brits, this is Francois Pienaar
He's the captain of the Springboks
Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs
Brits
Pienaar holds out his hand -- ( ) Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits
-- gently shakes hers
Ek ook, Meneer
( ) Shall  pour, sir
No thank you,  think 'd like to
Mrs
Brits leaves
Mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her
Pienaar only sits after he does
Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian England
How do you take your tea, Francois
Milk and sugar, please
Mandela pours tea for both of them
, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea
61
The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest
Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup
Thank you, sir
Both men have big hands
Fine china dwarfed and threatened
In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye
You have a very difficult job
do
sell gas braais
Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea
Captain of the Springboks
very difficult job
Not compared to yours, sir
Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while 'm doing mine
Pienaar grins
True
It is not so difficult to get people to do their best
And imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically
Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place
Yes
But to get people to be better than that
() 62
(') Better than they think they can be
Now, that is difficult,  find
Yes sir, it is
How do we do that
By example
To an extent
But there is more to it than that
(searching for the right ) inspiration, perhaps
Pienaar is engrossed
This is a master lesson on leadership, from a master
How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do
How do we inspire everyone around us
() Sometimes,  think, by using the work of others
Long pause
Pienaar knows to keep quiet
On Robben Island, when things were very hard,  found inspiration in a poem
poem
Victorian poem
Just words
But they helped me to stand when all wanted was to lie down -- ( ) But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense
No
They make a lot of sense, sir
() On the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks
63
Yes
yes
Everybody is preparing
When  think we're ready,  have the bus driver put on a song 've chosen; a theme song
One we all know
We listen together and
it helps
Yes
remember when  was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona
The whole stadium welcomed me with a song
() At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak
But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet
it made me very proud to be South African
It helped me to come home and do better
It allowed me to expect more of myself
beat
May  ask what the song was, sir
Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika
very inspiring song
Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes
We need inspiration, Francois
Brown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of tea
Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations
Something passes between them
Whatever it is has a profound impact on Pienaar
64
Yes, sir
We probably do
: Cameras click and whirr as for the press
( that there are
) : - Pienaar walks away from the President's offices, still processing his meeting with Mandela
He seems a little stunned and mystified
Something profound just happened -- but he's not quite sure what
,  - When Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses
He looks at his country in a new way
from Nerine's car interrupts his reverie, as she pulls up at the bottom of the stairs
'  - Nerine drives Pienaar away
Pienaar turns, looks back at the Union Buildings
So
Hm
What's he like
He's
() he's not like anyone 've ever met before
An unsatisfying answer
Nerine waits for more
But, she isn't going to get it without prying it out of Pienaar
65
Well
What did he want
This is the question Pienaar is wrestling with, too
He thinks it over for long enough to drive Nerine crazy
Ag, come on Francois
It's like talking to a bloody brick wall
What did he want
Pienaar turns in his seat, looks at her as realization comes clear in him
think
() think he wants us to win the World Cup
: '  - looks down -- -- on Mandela, who is surrounded by Mandela likes the babies
, shoo and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior -- -- for the  shooting this family gathering
Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged
Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on
Excuse me
Mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves
: In the  , Zindzi looks down at a She is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman
When Mandela enters, Zindzi looks up from the newspaper with a very Mandela-like grunt
66
What do you think
It doesn't matter what  think
Yes, it does
() Okay
think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail don't like seeing you shake his hand
And 'm not the only one
Mandela overreacts
You criticize without understanding
You seek only to address your own feelings
This is selfish thinking
It does not serve the nation
Zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves
Wait
Please
-- Mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how
Instead, he pulls   out of his pocket, holds it out
Will you give this to your mother
What is it
bracelet
Zindzi looks into the envelope
In it is the , from earlier, from the bathroom
Just throw it away
don't have the right to
It's not mine
67
If she left it here, she meant to throw it away
Only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly
Mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes
man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to his own family
: '  - The    of Mandela and Pienaar that Zindzi was looking at -- only, this time, someone is cutting it out, very carefully
Eunice
Mr
Pienaar enters to get something from the fridge, sees what Eunice is doing
Eunice stops cutting
Mr
Pienaar looks down at the photo for a long moment
He doesn't know how to react to it
Mrs
Pienaar said you were finished with the paper
Ja
Of course
Mr
Pienaar leaves
Eunice keeps cutting until the photo can be lifted up
She nods, proud

) The Minister looks ragged, exhausted
Four pools of four teams each, playing in nine different venues around the country
Two teams will advance from each pool to the quarter finals
Mandela studies the diagram
He loves this stuff
The Ivory Coast qualified
This is wonderful
(For the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canada, Romania, Italy, France, Japan, West Samoa, Argentina, Tonga and Ivory Coast
) : - The Springbok squad leap up after the push-ups, sprint to the 50 m line, drop, begin 20 rapid crunches -- -- under the critical eye of the new  and

New Zealand won the one before that
() 69
(cont'd) They're both clear favorites to reach the finals this time
() According to the experts, we'll reach the quarter finals, and no further
According to the experts, you and are still supposed to be in jail
That brings a grin from the Minister of Sport
: - The coach blows his whistle
Again
, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to the 25 m line
: '  - You make a personal appearance at the finals, and at the opening match between the Springboks and Australia

billion people watching us

yes
This is a great opportunity

- Hands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has worked their way down the full length of the field

haven't even begun
() We may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest
He blows his whistle
And back
The squad can't believe their ears
No one moves
Except Pienaar
Come on boys, let's show him
Staggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m line
Shit, what's Pienaar been eating
But, they follow him
: '  - Alone in his office, Mandela looks at the World Cup diagram, for a moment, then picks up his phone
( ) Please call the head of South African rugby for me
: 71
- Thirty completely wiped-out athletes
Some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change
Pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker
The   enters, followed by the Pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright
The Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure he likes
Afternoon men
It's good to see you working so hard
have a short announcement
() As part of the  buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country
The players greet this announcement with complete silence
know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top
(looking at Pienaar, ) The very top
The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the Manager
The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted
This is complete crap
Are we some kind of circus act now
72
We don't have time for kuk like this
The boys are getting angrier by the second
They expect us to play our best, to give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody workload
The lock turns to Chester
What do you think about this, Chester
All eyes on Chester, as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a world they barely understand
try not to think
It interferes with my rugby
The perfect answer for these guys
See
Now there's a rugby player
Talk to them Francois
Make them see that this is a waste of time we don't have
All eyes on their Captain -- who shakes his head, no
'm not going to talk to them
Why not
Whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team
We're we're ambassadors inside our own country
And we might as well get used to it
Silence
Rebellious silence
Then: Is this you speaking, or Mandela
73
Pienaar's eyes are fierce
He needs them to see how serious he is
You know me better than that
() Times change
We need to change, too
It is clear that much of his team disagrees with him
: '  - -    -- horrible, startling images of the ( ) We're looking at the remains of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America, which was destroyed today in a massive explosion
to reveal that we are in Mandela's offices
Barbara, Mary, other assistants look on
So do the bodyguards
All faces stunned, appalled
Mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the horrible, irresistible images
He stands behind his people
No one has claimed responsibility yet, but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white, right-wing fanatics
An act of revenge for the killings in Waco, Texas
Jason and Linga share a pointed look
South Africa is a global leader in white, right-wing fanatics
The explosive, a truck bomb, was apparently a simple mixture of commonly available industrial and agricultural materials
( ) That's all we need
() 74
(') homemade explosive from materials every boer already has
Then, Jason realizes that Mandela is standing right next to him
So far, the official death toll stands at over a 100 people, which includes at least 12 children from a day care center in the Federal building
Mandela turns to Barbara
Please call President Clinton for me
wish to offer him our condolences
Mandela turns to Jason, eyes deep and dark
Do you see why forgiveness is essential, Jason
() Revenge only begets revenge
As Mandela walks back to his office, there is a look of utter sorrow on his face
: - luxury bus heads along the freeway
- The Springbok squad rides in style
Most are wearing tracksuits, most are asleep
Pienaar is awake
: - The same township where Sipho rejected the Springbok rugby jersey
At one edge we find what passes for a
Just a littered rectangular expanse of Highveld winter dirt
75
and a very nervous    drive to the edge of the field, stop, get out -- -- and are immediately mobbed by ,  , many of them begging for cash and candy
in the thick of things
One of the Springbok management crew pulls a   on two spiked poles out of their van
Mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township kids
They hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to hammer the second pole into the ground -- -- except that there is a    in the way
Broken glass everywhere
They look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the field
Broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field
#1 They can't play on this
#2 When are they due
#1 Fifteen minutes
#2 Plenty of time
He reaches into his wallet, pulls out a R100 note (about $17), holds it up high
The kids yell for it
#2 Mayhem, as kids sprint out across the field, hunting for glass
Sipho goes for the tiniest, most treacherous shards
: 76
- The bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt, which wakes the sleeping Springboks
They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township
Every possible incarnation of poverty, as far as the eye can see
This shocks them
Most of them have never been anywhere like this township
Shit, 'm glad  don't live here
- The driver sounds the horn, as they pull into the township
- The bus pulls up at the field -- - -- which is covered with kids on their hands and knees
- What the hell are they doing
The driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass
Don't forget, we've got  cameras on us at all times
() What a bloody joke
- As the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads -- 77
, -- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun
One of the big kids gets the R100
Attention focussed on -- -- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the Springboks exit, one by one
Pienaar first, with a huge      over his shoulder
The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship
The kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable
Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder
Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks
Even Sipho, who looks on from the side of the field
Springbok management notes it
The  crews note it
Pienaar notes it
Okay Chester --  reckon you're up
() What am  supposed to do
What you do best
Pienaar turns to the throng
roar
They all do
Pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to Chester
Let rip
78
Chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air
(60 yards, easily
) Pienaar tosses balls to the others
Let's do our best
One after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into the air
Go get them
The kids go after them
Sipho stays on the sideline
Barely controlled chaos
Each Springbok works with one ball and a group of kids
There are   to this montage
, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations
Who here knows the first rule of rugby
Me
What is it
Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking
Laughter
good ice-breaker
No
The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways
Pienaar demonstrates
(: All the rules are demonstrated
) - If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession
- This is a scrum
- You kick forwards
() 79
(cont'd) If you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout
- This is a lineout
- You score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line
That's five points
- Another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights
- Three points for a penalty kick
- Three points for a drop kick
- Have you got all that
No
Agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass
Whoever drops the ball does pushups
, as the players work with the kids, they get into it
Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy the kids, they enjoy the giving
Even the grumpiest, most conservative Springbok
Okay
Who wants to scrum against me
One huge man scrums against a horde of kids
He pushes them backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards
They love it, the cameras love it
shows the emergence of Chester Williams as the face of the Springboks
The crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other player's crew
Given Chester's basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming
The  cameras follow him even more closely than they follow Pienaar
, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at Sipho's feet
He hesitates, then picks it up
He doesn't just hold it, he feels it
as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms
One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away

Behind him is a     of a rural barbed wire fence festooned with wind-blown plastic bags

Mr
Minister, please forgive me
This sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute -- Mandela nods to Mary, who switches on a big  on the wall -- which shows       in the township
When we see the        , Mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet

This is Boland -- Mandela switches off the
Around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against Australia
Everyone thinks they'll beat us
And if they do, we'll have to go through England and the All Blacks just to get to the Final
So it is very important that we beat Australia

Ahead, we see  , home of the World Cup opener between the Springboks and Australia

We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings
Jason leads the meeting
He uses an old-fashioned pointer
All of Mandela's security detail present, plus Not a problem
We want these two approaches completely sanitized
Two approaches
We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment
() We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters
And sniffer dogs
Yes
No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City
The locals stir, share a look
This is going to be a nightmare
We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men
Not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces
85
We're not taking any chances, okay
The President's going to be very exposed
() Much too exposed

Sort of
The players look down at the pages

One by one, the players look from the page to Pienaar

What's this
We need to learn it
We can't just mouth the words anymore
Nobody cares, as long as we win matches
They do care
It's their song, not ours
It's a terrorist song
They used to arrest you for singing it
And now it's one of our anthems
But he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys

You know  leave my guts on the field for you, and you know 'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time
But this
The hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away
can't even read it definitely can't pronounce the words
One look at his men, and Pienaar knows he has hit a wall
88
Okay, boys
It's optional
Take it if you want to
The players are relieved
Pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys
It means "God Bless Africa"
() Which you have to admit, we could use
Nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them into the closest trash can

Mandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited
Linga and Jason with him
The players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit
Not a line, but orderly
(We may or may not notice that Chester Williams is missing

He's an old hand with Mandela, by now
Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match
() just wanted to wish you good luck, in person
There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye
And sometimes, very seldom, as President,  am allowed to do what want
They all laugh

Mandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason behind
Picture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern, South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his 70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal- looking white men -- ( ) Mr
President, this is -- know who this is
( ) Good luck, Andre

Did you ever imagine this
How could
By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he has won the team over, coach and manager included
They glow
And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them
But where is Chester
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach first
Coach nods

He's injured, sir

We're trying to keep it quiet
Is he out for the whole tournament
With hamstrings, who knows

The whole country will miss him

Truly honored
Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok leaping across the front of the cap
Good luck gentlemen
Your country supports you, completely
The team applauds, beaming, glowing
Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter
Francois, walk with me
Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter
93

Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an '  on it
Gives it to Pienaar
This helped me, many times
Perhaps it will help you, too
: Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising, departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until Coach blows his whistle
Enough fun and games
We've still got work to do
: -   - Jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list, making sure he hasn't missed anything
: '    - Mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "In" pile
Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills
It's time for bed

Mandela turns on the , begins flipping channels
Rugby, rugby, rugby
Mandela is sucked in
Mary sighs
: '  -    - The coach and the manager

It's just a matter of the boys executing it tomorrow
That's Pienaar's job
It's in his hands, now
'  -    - Room dark but for one small desk light
Pienaar stands at the window, looking out across Cape Town
He is deep in thought
Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where, under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela wrote out by hand
Pienaar begins reading it
There is a soft knock at his door
Pienaar goes to it, opens it
It is Nerine, accompanied by a cop
Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter
As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says: You know the best thing about you being the captain
Uh
the honor
You don't have to share a room
Nerine gives Pienaar a scorching kiss
He resists
then responds -- then pulls away
95
() Francois, come on
It's been weeks
Uh uh
need to be angry for tomorrow
Nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the poem on Mandela's personal letterhead
What's this

From the President
How does a poem help you play rugby
The same way your visit does

: - massive crowd roars
The Wallaby flyhalf runs forward, puts his boot into the ball, sends it soaring towards the waiting Springboks
The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly -- -- just as the Wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies
The World Cup has begun at last
: But not for Chester Williams
Clad in Springbok blazer and tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves, in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter disappointment at not being on the field
96
-   - Mandela looks on, calmly
The Minister of Sport isn't late for this match
The President of Rugby is pale with nerves
Behind Mandela, stand Linga and Hendrick
The  box is a safe place, but Jason isn't taking any chances
: - Jason prowls through the stadium, talking constantly on his radio
Hunter's adrenaline
: /
- Back to action on the field
The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we saw in the township
This continues the education of those who do not know rugby
So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the resulting scrum
We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting lineout
We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling, strategic kicking at it's very best
Both teams are crisp and strong
-- -- with      (snipers, lots and lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc
all overseen by Jason) -- -- with    , which, unlike the earlier test against the Lions, is completely and passionately united behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) -- -- always returning to the  , where something interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game
97
When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks: What happened
They scored
When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd roars, Linga asks again: What happened
We scored
third ball through the uprights
Before Linga can ask: They scored again
fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box
We scored
Ja
We're tied
fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild
We're up by three
, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line
Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted
ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- -- and the  box
They're ahead
By four
Nerves in the box
98
But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession -- -- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last Wallaby to try and tackle him
The crowd roars
In the  box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the waiter
The difficult, angled conversion is missed
What does that mean
We're only ahead by one
Another penalty kick
We're ahead by four
drop goal
By seven
An incredible try by the Springbok fly half
By fourteen
Everyone dares to dream
The classic South African penchant for pessimism begins to abate
Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the  box
Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second
Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the , who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day
,  '    on the field, in the stands, and in the  box
What happened
We won

We did
Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie that is one of his signature moves
-- : - -- the same shuffle hours later, at a  party
Mandela has changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired "Madiba shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning of one of the 's
You must be very pleased
What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you
Oh, Mr
President, you're exaggerating
Indeed not
My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist
As you know,  am not
() But when  look at you
envy my father
The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself
But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- -- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that Mandela is pushing himself way past empty
: '   - Jason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes
: 100
- Big party, spilling onto the streets
Most of the partiers are white
Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks
We follow the crowd into a big sports bar -- - -- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win
Even though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers
Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action
Then Pienaar gets a   which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a chagrined look
He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub: ' , The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it
Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins
Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead 's
: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie
The boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of montage
One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf
Pienaar gets an idea
: - Pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very slow jog through the mostly empty streets
101
When he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the palm of his left hand
-  ' , where he has drawn a crude street map
Pienaar takes a left at the intersection
: Another intersection, another peek at the map on his hand, and another left turn, takes the team -- - -- back onto the waterfront, to an idling  , where the coach and the manager wait for them -- along with the player's wives and girlfriends
hope you're not that slow next week
Pienaar grins, stops
The team stops around him
What's going on
change of pace
: - The ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air
It is early winter
The seas are fairly rough
So are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night
Who's bloody idea was this
, innocent as a lamb
102
- Behind the ferry, Cape Town and Table Mountain, in all their glory
Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history -- --
- Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland
It is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals
It would be pretty -- -- but for its
Concrete, barbed wire, guard towers
(In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration
Today, it is a tourist destination
) - As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles over the Springboks and their partners
One of the Springboks turns to a , getting ready to moor at the jetty
How do they bring the prisoners here
On this boat
Sobering
- The Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with some relief, look around at the prison, humbled
103
( ) Imagine being able to see Cape Town so close by
That would make it worse
They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch
The ghosts of Mandela, and all the others who spent much of their lives here, are very strong
: , in the  , the  , the
None of the usual horsing around
This place affects them, deeply
: -   - Section  is the bleak political wing
Tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway
shows the Springboks into the hallway, and they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked
Shocked at what was done in their names
This group is as quiet as we have ever seen them
Can we see the President's cell
Yes, of course
(leading them down past ) We've done it up just the way it was
They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- '
(pointing at the number) That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964
The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door
104
'  - Pienaar peers into the cell
It is tiny
There is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets
chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room
couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall
The barred window is opaque
It lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view
When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is
He can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time
This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place
Pienaar is stunned by it
He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world for over twenty years
: -   - The other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's taking
'  - Pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance
He hears Mandela's voice in the cell with him
(
) ( "") Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul
Now, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell
(The image is unclear, ghostly
) (
) In the fell clutch of circumstance have not winced nor cried aloud
Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbow'd
Pienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard, breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other political prisoners
105
(
) Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid
Pienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like Pienaar
(
) It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll, am the master of my fate: am the captain of my soul
: '  - The gates open
Linga gets out of one , Hendrick out of the other
We know the routine
Only, Mandela doesn't appear for his walk
Linga and Hendrick wait for a moment, then head in through the gate -- '  - -- break into a sprint, when they see ' , on the lawn
: '  - Barbara, Mary, the house staff, plus Linga, Hendrick, Etienne and Jason, all wait
All are scared
Nobody talks
The    from on the top floor brings them to their feet
'  descends the stairs
What happened
It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated
He needs complete rest
And don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom
() 106
(') No phone calls, no visitors, no meetings
No politics
You know him
He won't do that
Then 'm going to put him into hospital
In isolation
No
Not yet
'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave
'll cancel everything
And 'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working
The doctor leaves
The rest of them look at each other, relieved
and maybe a little guilty, for letting things get this bad
(to Mary, aside) Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan
Not yet
: '  - Dark
Curtains drawn
The door opens quietly
shaft of light from the door shows Mandela, on his back in bed, eyes closed
Barbara enters
The sight of Mandela lying like this is chilling
It is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket
Barbara makes sure he is breathing
He is
She unplugs his phone, takes it
Unplugs his
Sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs
For the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him
She gives Mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her
We stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep
: 107
- Chester Williams jogs under the tense eye of coach, trainer, manager and Pienaar
He accelerates, running fast, but not sprinting
That's not good enough
Chester opens it up
Full sprint, sustained
Pienaar grins
Chester is back
Let's hope the Samoans don't injure it again
: - ,   of a typically brutal Samoan tackle, and the ensuing foul play in the maul
: of Chester williams scoring four tries
: of the Springboks trudging off the field
Every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both
: '  - Looking frail, but better than before, Mandela pencils in a score      :   42, 14
The diagram shows us that this was a quarter final match
We can see that he has entered all the South African scores
(For the record: South Africa 27 - Australia 18; South Africa 21 - Romania 3; South Africa 20 - Canada 0
) For the semi-finals, against South Africa, Mandela pencils in France
108
On the other side of the bracket, Mandela pencils in England vs
the All Blacks
With a satisfied grunt, Mandela steps back from the diagram
Things are shaping up nicely
knock at the door, and Barbara enters, ushering in a Madiba, this is -- know who this is
Beaming, exuding energy we know he doesn't have, Mandela rises to yet another occasion
He strides forward to shake hands
Welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me
: - Monsoon rain batters the bus as it crawls towards ' , in Durban
: '   - Rain, rain, rain
The field is flooding
: - Coach walks in on his team, who are dressed for the match and ready to go
Forty minute postponement
They're trying to clear the field
: 109
'   - with brooms and squeegees push the water off the field
Capacity crowd cheers them on
(This happened
There will be stock footage
) : - The boys stretch, jump, try to keep warmed-up
: ,  - Mandela and a negotiating team are meeting with their opposite numbers from Taiwan
high-level affair that cannot be interrupted
Nonetheless, Mandela takes a discreet look at his watch, and we realize that his mind is back home, with the Springboks
: - Pienaar leads his men out into the rain
: '   - quagmire, despite the efforts of the Zulu ladies
Muddy green and gold against the muddy blue, white and red of France
End of a close game
Both teams are tired, muddy and desperate
The French assault the Springbok try line, wave after wave
The Springboks defend valiantly, but slowly go backwards
Finally, the French score a try -- or do they
-    , under a mountain of muddy men, on the ground three inches outside the try line
110
The referee waves off the try
: '  - Mandela flies home, still working intensely with a mixed South African/Taiwanese trade group
Mary slips a piece of paper in front of him, discreetly
:  19,  15
'
Mandela's face betrays nothing
But, he gets up
Please excuse me for a moment
With Mary leading the way, Mandela goes to the back of the plane, looking grave and leaderly -- -- but once he is through the galley curtain, he breaks into a huge smile
This is very good
very good
Who is our opponent
The All Blacks play England tomorrow
Then, we'll know
Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match
Yes, Madiba
: - in a private banquet room, the Springbok team watches the England/All Black semi-final, which the All Blacks dominate from beginning to end -- -- thanks to the exploits of  , their unnaturally huge, fast left wing, of Tongan parentage (and unanimous choice for the best player in the entire World Cup)
111
Jonah Lomu scores in the first two minutes of the match, the first of four tries
He runs through, over, and around hapless defenders
His speed and balance are almost unprecedented in a man his size
The Springboks go quiet as they watch this beating by the All Blacks
: '  - Mandela watches at home with Barbara and Mary
Let's do some work while we watch
Barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says: Just enjoy the rugby
: '  - The sound of the match    of one of the BMWs
Johan Lomu's name in every sentence
All the bodyguards are out of the cars, enjoying the winter sunshine as they listen to the match
So, let me understand this
The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year
Thanks for reminding me
Hendrick opens the trunk of their , pulls out a , shows it to Linga
Linga nods
Okay
Throw it
: - Another Lomu try, and a ripple goes through the Springboks
112
We're going to have to tackle better than the English, that's for sure
We do
: '  - blares
Barbara does some work
Mandela comes and peeks over her shoulder -- Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State
-- and Barbara shuts the file
They'll keep until after the match
: '  - pile of guns in holsters, on the hood of a
Suit jackets draped over the side mirrors
In the wide street, in their shirts and ties, the boys toss the ball around
The white bodyguards handle the ball expertly, the black bodyguards for the first time in their lives
Give it a spin when you pass it
() Like this
Kwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows it
The ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes Kwezi
They all laugh
: 113
- Lomu scores his third try
How much does Lomu weigh
About 120 kilos
Shit, that's what  weigh
Ja, but at least you're slow
As we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend against Lomu
: '  - Mandela isn't watching
He's at the window, looking out at a    , taking place on the street outside his house
Come and look at this
: '  - Two mixed teams
Hendrick passes to Linga, who passes back to Hendrick, who scores
() You should've played rugby
() They wouldn't let me carry my gun
Laughter
This scene was unthinkable a year ago
: 114
'  - Barbara and Mary stand next to Mandela at the window
Mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the laughter
In a way, this small moment already justifies everything he has done
Almost
He gives Barbara a sly look
Do you still think 'm wasting my time with the rugby
Before Barbara can reply, excitement on the  makes Mandela turn away
He looks at the  just as Lomu scores his fourth try, to make it 42 - 15
Mandela shakes his head, awed
Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that  need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks
Barbara gives Mandela a long look
This rugby, it's still strictly political
Oh yes
Of course
: '  - Pienaar hands an envelope to his father
Don't lose them
won't be able to get more
Mr
Pienaar opens the envelope, pulls out Mr
Pienaar kisses the tickets
Thanks, Francois
(fanning out tickets) Me, mom, Nerine -- wait, and the fourth
Who's it for
115
Pienaar looks at his father, mischief in his eyes

Red winter sunset over the arid Highveld

Chester and Pienaar billboards
(
) The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to 19 -- '  - The Minister of Sport gives Mandela his final briefing
At his side, Barbara thrusts papers in front of Mandela for his signature
This continues throughout
-- they beat Wales 34 to 9, they beat Japan 145 to 17
145 points, in one match
Linga listens openly
It's a new international record
(back to the briefing) They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the quarter finals
You saw the match with England
45 to 29
And it was not that close
() They seem unstoppable
If opposing teams play them straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild
If they focus on Lomu, that leaves others free
() And, also, there's the business of the haka
116
Their Maori war dance
Yes
It's very powerful
My sources tell me that half of the All Black matches are won before the first whistle, because of it
Mandela peers out of the window at a Springbok billboard
How are we going to beat them
have the coach's number
You could call him and ask
No
no
don't want to break their focus for even a minute
() But, how do we win
: an idea occurs to him
wild idea
He almost turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself
Maybe we won't
They're favored two-to-one
() Madiba, we've already exceeded all expectations
On and off the field
It's not enough
Not now
Not so close
() This country is hungry for greatness
Barbara pushes another paper in front of Mandela
He signs it
: '  - The coach, the manager and Pienaar gather for a final briefing in the coach's spartan office
117
How's the feeling in the dressing room
Calm
And Lomu
Are they talking about him
Pienaar shrugs -- of course
Coach grins
Nobody gives us a bloody chance like that
It plays into their one weakness
Both Pienaar and the manager look at the coach
Their vanity
() They're already counting the win
But they want to win with style, the way they won all their other matches
They want to show the world how beautiful All Black rugby is
() just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle
Pienaar's up for that
wish tomorrow was already here
: -   - Jason wishes tomorrow was already over
He goes through his plans, his check lists for the tenth time
He sighs, tries to roll the tension out of his shoulders, gives up
He leaves the office
118
/    - Cops at their posts
Jason walks alone through the tunnels, until he comes to a field entrance
He goes to the edge, looks out at the dimly lit field, trying to imagine tomorrow
(from behind him) Come on, man
There's nothing more you can do today
Jason turns to Etienne
Have  ever mentioned to you that hate rugby
Once or twice, yes
just want to get him through tomorrow, safely
That's all
We all do
look between the two men: they are united
They have come a long way
: '   -  - As in Cape Town, Pienaar stares out into the night, pensively
Preoccupied
So preoccupied, that when Nerine enters quietly, he hardly turns
brought one of your mom's protein shakes
Pienaar nods, thanks
Nerine puts the protein shake down
She tries to read Pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her at this moment
Thinking about tomorrow
119
No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another
Pienaar turns to her
'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there
: '  - We have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before
We have seen the clock on the bedside table change from 4:59 to 5:00 before
We have seen Mandela's eyes open, immediately
But we have never seen Mandela roll over and go back to sleep
:  24, 1995 -
'  - The two BWMs wait faithfully
() - Linga looks at his watch
() - Hendrick does the same
Gets out
'  - Linga gets out, meets Hendrick at the gate
Big day
Be an even bigger day if we actually won
120
Then, they both look at their watches again
Where is he
They share a worried look
Linga reaches for his radio
: '  - Mandela's bedroom door is opened from outside the room
Light from the hallway hits the bed
Mandela looks very still under the covers
Mary peers in, concern wiping away sleep
She sees Mandela lying there
Mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she stands over Mandela -- -- who opens his eyes without moving otherwise
Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him
: '  - Mary's voice on Linga's radio
( ) Okay, thanks
Out
Linga lowers his radio, embarrassed
He's sleeping in
Or was
Linga and Hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn to head back to their respective cars
Linga pauses
had an idea
About today
() It's a crazy idea
121
Hey, don't worry, man
already know you're crazy
: '  - Mandela eats breakfast -- porridge and fresh fruit -- and looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about today's World Cup final
The doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps approaching through the house
Mandela wipes his mouth and waits
Linga and Hendrick appear in the doorway
They look even bigger indoors
Morning, boys
& Morning, Madiba
What is it
Linga hesitates -- until Hendrick gives him a (for Hendrick) discreet nudge
Linga had an idea, sir
: '  - Mary walks briskly to her car, gets in and drives towards the opening gate, fast
: '  - Linga and Hendrick watch as Mary drives away
122
Now you've done it
: - As in Cape Town, the Springboks jog through the streets
As in Cape Town, cars toot their horns, people cheer
But the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was in Cape Town -- and twice as black
This crowd shows that the Springboks really do have the support of the whole country now
As the `boks rumble past, newspaper vendors, gardeners, pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks and run alongside the team
Pienaar turns to look at one of his teammates, grins, gets a grin in return
: -   - Jason addresses his entire team (minus Linga), plus assorted The tickets sold out long before the team became so popular
So it's not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there
That's the reality
() The President will greet the players before the match, he'll present the trophy after the match
He'll be exposed to 62,000 people, twice
He'll be on , live, all over the world
(expressing his deepest ) All it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement, or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio
One of the cops smiles at that
123
It's happened before
( ) But not today
Not on our watch
Not today
The security boys are fired up
: - It is hours before the match, but every entrance to Ellis Park stadium is chaotic with people, cars, face painters, flag sellers, fruit vendors
Cops everywhere, and everywhere outnumbered
In the crowd outside,   , collecting empty bottles from trash cans, for recycling
Jason was right about the demographics of the crowd: white, khaki-clad, quite a few old South African flags among the sea of new flags
Springbok colors everywhere
We may even see the   from the Lions debacle earlier
( ) Face flag
Bugger off
Ellis Park isn't exactly the Rainbow Nation today
(
) We're at Ellis Park on this historic day, where, even this early, crowd excitement is at fever -- Boland does another live remote
behind -- because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations
: 124
-  - luxury bus pulls away from the hotel, with a ,  ,
(
) But now they come up against a team that is unlike any other they have played
: - With that inward look of boxers before a big fight, the Springboks begin the journey to the stadium
(
) These All Blacks are possibly one of the greatest international sides ever, with a player in Jonah Lomu who is as dominant as any this correspondent has ever seen
: '  - Mandela's Mercedes exits his gate, BMWs fore and aft
(
) To lose to them is no disgrace
To lose to them in the finals is, in fact, an honor
: '  - Tight on Mandela's face, absolutely expressionless
His game face
(
) say this with absolutely no negativity
simply want to save people from the heartbreak of unrealistic expectations
: 125
- Back to Boland's live remote
So, take a reality check, sit back and share an afternoon with one billion fellow fans around the world
And as you do, feel a special pride in having made it this far
This is Boland Botha, signing off and sitting back at Ellis Park
Huge crowd now, all around the  truck, streaming in
: - Driving down a secure access lane, the Springbok bus and police escort approach Ellis Park
And pass Sipho, who stares up at them from the sidewalk
: - The boys are very quiet -- until the sheer spectacle gets to them
Then, the first nerves hit
You can tell in the way they look at each other, the way they swallow
: - Mandela's convoy pulls up at a secure entrance
: - Stadium almost full
Crowd noise a dull roar
, near the field, we find Nerine, Mr
and Mrs
Pienaar
and Eunice, as they take their seats
Pienaar got the fourth ticket for her
126
Eunice turns to Mrs
Pienaar
What's Mr
Francois doing now
: - All dressed, all warmed up, the Springboks are quiet, introspective
Everything that should be said has been said
This is the calm before the storm
( that almost every player wears bandages, or braces, or is injured in some way
) Pienaar is not in the room
: /    - Dressed in his rugby togs, Pienaar sneaks up the ramp to the edge of the field, takes a peek out of the tunnel -- -- and is blown away by the magnitude of it all
: - Vast city seen from the air
Zero in on Ellis Park
: of a    747 flying over the city, in the direction of Ellis Park
747  - - Final approach, Captain
Let it be noted that 'm taking control of the aircraft
--
127
assume full responsibility for what happens from now on
- Duly noted
The captain drops the nose of the 747 towards Ellis Park
: - Every seat full
Almost every seat filled by a big white man
Excitement unbearable
Jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high in the stadium
Binoculars around his neck, radio in hand
Something catches his eye
Something in the air
Jason lifts his binoculars to his eyes
-- the 747 is heading right for the stadium
Jason lowers his binoculars
He frowns -- more puzzled than alarmed
(This is pre-9/11
) He lifts his radio to his mouth
( ) Do you see that jet, to the east
: Etienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards -- sees it
( ) Did they get clearance for this
: ( ) Not from us
The 747 gets closer, fast
Jason is hit by a horrible thought
128
( ) Where is he
( ) Jason finds the  box, looks out at the 747 -- -- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium
( ) Get him out of there
Now
: -   - Mandela is not in his seat
Linga turns
Hendrick points at the closed door of the  bathroom
( ) No time
: - Nothing Jason can do about it but hold his breath as -- : 747  - The captain drops the 747 even lower
: - Jason has to fight down the impulse to flee
: 129
-   - Everyone in the  box sees the jet
They all stand
: - The 747 nose appears over the rim of the stadium
: 747  - Full throttle
Captain and co-pilot go full throttle, yank the 747 straight upwards
: - The      fills the stadium, as the 747 passes less than 200 feet overhead -- -- so that everyone can read the huge letters painted on the bottom of the wings: (This really happened
) with relief
-   - Linga and Hendrick share a look
They have just had a brush with the unthinkable
- with the roar
130
What the hell was that
which slowly fades
leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd
The boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby
Pienaar appears to be praying, silently
: - The  walks off the field, into the tunnel, stands there for a moment, then raises his whistle to his mouth and blows a ,   -- - -- which is the signal to come to the field
The cop opens the door, throws down a full parade ground salute as Pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room
Breathe, boys
Breathe
- `, we head down the hallway, down some stairs to the tunnel onto the field -- -- where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop, keeping the boys in a line in the tunnel
As they wait, they hear the Down the opposite stairway come
This is the first time we have seen them in the flesh
Huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant
Been here before, done this before
The best in the world, expecting nothing but the best from the day
They ignore the Springboks, dismiss them, line up next to them in the tunnel
131
The        in their cleats, on the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval battle
The Springbok wing sneaks a peek at
The biggest, fastest wing ever
Even bigger looking in this confined space
Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok forwards
The referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto the field -- - -- where the already-whipped up crowd goes crazy, as both teams sprint onto the field and go through their brief warm- up ritual
, focus on how white and old South Africa most of them are
The referee blows his whistle again, and both teams assemble in a line, facing each other
Glaring like boxers across immaculate green grass
- Seen only in silhouette, Mandela walks down the tunnel
He is flanked by Jason, The Minister of Sport and the President of  Rugby
Linga, as always, has Mandela's back
Plus Hendrick
- Mandela emerges into daylight, wearing not a suit, not a Madiba shirt -- -- he is wearing Francois Pienaar's green and gold number 6 rugby jersey
On his head is    given to him by the team in The crowd catches its breath
This is unprecedented, shocking
and brilliant
The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support
132
(murmuring to Pienaar) The All Blacks won't like that
Pienaar nods, eyes glinting
Mandela is giving them an edge
As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous, beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd -- -- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly
Nelson
Nelson
Nelson
63 000 South Africans, chanting as one
: ,    through Not a soul, not a car to be seen
Everyone is inside, watching
: - etc
Mandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming with pride
Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with special energy
'm so glad you're here
Chester beams
: ,  , loud African warrior woman call
Mr
Pienaar looks at her, shocked
Looks at her as a person for the first time, maybe

Eunice ululates again
: , Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who, as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing
Mandela looks up at Jonah Lomu
Hello, Jonah
Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression -- -- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a As do the rest of the All Blacks
, a Maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon
It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the whistle blows
This is very intimidating
Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka closer and closer to the Springboks -- -- who do not back down
In fact, they close ranks and advance
Major, major international smackdown
This is not fake
The emotions, the aggression are real
, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes
He wants to respond, primally
His fists clench at his side
The   with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell
, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing
Mandela takes a deep breath in
Then the boys answer
With, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: '
134
Pienaar starts it
-- -- '  etc
With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, back at the All Blacks
The crowd joins them
"Nkosi" roars through the stadium, through the nation
: his heart swells, as he sings with his people
: , who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through the apartheid years
In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are a thing of the past
The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders
' , close to tears, as  slowly fades
As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song
Is that a heartbeat, or an African drum
: , the All Black fly half tees up the ball, for kick off
As the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness, waiting for the whistle -- : , poised all over South Africa, and
Heart/drumbeat over
The last face is Sipho's
- The crowd noise spills out of the stadium behind Sipho
135
, tuned to the game
The radio is in a cop car, manned by
As the crowd noise rises, Sipho edges closer to the cops
They eye him out
: -   - Mandela front and center
Minister of Sport to his right, Prime Minister of New Zealand to his left, President of Rugby next to him
Both using all their diplomatic skills to stay cool
(to
) Perhaps we should make a small wager
All your gold, for all our sheep
was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine
Behind Mandela, Linga and Hendrick suppress grins
They are outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement
: - The referee blows his whistle
The All Black fly half boots the ball towards the Springboks, charges after it, along with the rest of the All Blacks
Game on
We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far
And mostly from a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of coverage
Say, at closest, the referee's point of view
Not now
Not for the climax
We experience this beautiful piece of mayhem up close and personal
We're inside the heaving scrums
We are the ball
We see the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with subcutaneous blood
136
We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling maul
For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as the Springbok coach wanted
This match is all about a less talented team stifling the best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness
This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into making mistakes
Lots of them
Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons
No fluency of movement, no electric building of momentum
Because of one thing: tackling
Tackling and tackling and tackling again
The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation holds its breath -- -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height, wraps him up and brings him down
The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle
We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want; from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the country
But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field
, continually exhorting his men, leading by example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield
, who always seems just one broken tackle away from running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles
, , - , who have devoted their entire lives to this moment
They are not playing for money
They are playing for pride, for their countries
Outdated notions
We miss them
No tries are scored in the Final
The two fly halves match each other, penalty goal for penalty goal
With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next
The penalty goals are unchallenged
It is up to the kicker to make them or fail
That is pressure
137
The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal through the uprights
The Springboks lead 9 - 6
tight match
So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 - 9
Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks camp in the Springbok half
The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half, who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal
The kick soars into the air, high and straight
43 million South Africans hold their breath
All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs
This will be the decisive blow
But the kick just goes wide
Relief
The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of regulation
Both teams are spent
-   - What happens now
Extra time
Twenty minutes
don't think  can take it
No one can
Mandela paces
Everyone is drained
- Sipho leans on the cop car, listening to the radio
He and the two cops suck nervously on sodas
: 138
- Two sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face each other for the extra time kick off
Pienaar turns to his men
Who's the fittest team on this field
The answer lies in their eyes: they are
An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately
Springbok penalty goal answers
12 - 12
Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn a scrum deep in All Blacks territory
Keep it here
Run it forward
The scrum goes down, wheels a little
Francois
Pienaar turns his head
The fly half taps his own chest: give me the ball
Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the ball
The ball goes into the scrum
The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight Springbok forwards
The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half -- -- who takes one step to his left and     high into the air
Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths
Higher than the uprights
but through them nonetheless
Springboks 15 - 12 All Blacks
An entire nation jumps to its feet
139
-   - Everyone is on their feet in the press box
How long before the end
Seven minutes
They turn out to be the longest seven minutes in Mandela's life
In every South African's life
: This is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby match, fully
, as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at the same time
Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no matter where they are, who they are, what color they are
(It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut away to throughout this story
) The All Blacks attack desperately
The Springboks tackle and tackle and tackle
, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet for another tackle
He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle -- -- looks over at the referee -- -- the referee puts his hands on his whistle -- -- another tackle, another look -- -- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips -- -- another tackle, another look -- -- the
It's over
The Springboks have won

- Pandemonium on the field, pandemonium in the stands
Jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (Jason is not a hugger)
: Mrs
Pienaar and Nerine are in tears
Mr
Pienaar hugs a shocked Eunice
-   - Pandemonium in the  box
Mandela shakes hands with everyone he can find
It is way too loud to say anything
Hendrick and Linga almost hug
Almost
They shake hands with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the shoulder
: - Sipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance, very political)
The two cops toi-toi with him
: , an    begins
This spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's restrict this to the people who've been watching the match together
: - The Springboks say a prayer on the field
Pienaar kneels in the middle, leading the prayer
Behind them, a
At "Amen", Pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto their shoulders
141
The crowd roars again and again as on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and thin
Tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin
As they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news crew and -- -- none other then
Francois
a few words
The interview booms through the  system
Pienaar just nods -- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this buffoon
great game, but  don't think you could've done it without the amazing support of these 63,000 South Africans -- Francois grabs the mike from Boland
(into mike, words booming) We didn't have the support of 63,000 South Africans today
We had the support of 42 million South Africans
The crowd roars
The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points
They're waiting for you over there
Pienaar turns, looks
Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy
In front of him is the    , a big gold confection
Their eyes meet
Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the press, the officials, his own team, to the podium
142
Mandela holds out his hand
Pienaar takes it
Big hands, one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a lifetime of bruises implied
Both wearing the  6
Francois,  want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country
Pienaar shakes his head
Mr
President,  want to thank you for what you have done
Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes -- African eyes, both
And then
very traditional sports hero's moment, richly deserved
Real gold, against the green of the battered field
But that is not the real prize
The prize is what happens next, all over the nation
: , people spill out into the streets, to celebrate
Utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in love and happiness
People who have been suspicious of each other, hated each other, feared each other all their lives
they hug each other on this day
: - Housewives, gardeners, cops, kids dance in the middle of the street
car horn beeps politely
, Mercedes,  come slowly down the street
143
The crowd begins to dance and ululate as they part to let the convoy through
'  - Linga in front
Mandela is alone in the back seat
He looks out at his people as they cheer him through
He also looks exhausted
Spent
None of that shining life force that makes him so big
() - ( ) This route's too crowded
We're changing to route
- The convoy switches to another street -- -- which is just as crowded as the first, with happy South Africans
It is as if every single person in the Rainbow Nation wants to celebrate together
() - ( ) Change to route
- The convoy switches to yet another street -- -- to no avail
South Africa is literally dancing in the streets
'  - Mandela leans forward, taps Linga on the shoulder
144
Tell Jason it's all right
There's no hurry
( ) Madiba says no need to hurry
() - Jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep sigh
So do the rest of the boys in the car
This day is almost over
() - Etienne, Hendrick loosen their ties, bask in the feeling
Hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes his head in amazement
'  - President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela undoes the top button of his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh -- -- and drives home through a nation that has begun the process of forgiving itself
His nation
'  as it settles into the now-familiar sphinx-like mask
Except for his eyes
Mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked for, all his life
