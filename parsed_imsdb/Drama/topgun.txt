The sea surges up, nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier  Kitty Hawk

From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then a graceful nose
The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar Intercept Officer () barely illuminated by the orange glow of their instruments
The fuselage gracefully swells to two enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back for high speed flight
Twin tailbooms cant outward, horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments
Enormous twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight

It's a MiG 21
They don't have radar missiles
Let's hope you're right

He's pissing me off

MiG  still follows

He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock

There is nothing, no -14
He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the aircraft
Suddenly, he feels a presence
He looks straight up and behind him

Maverick and Wizard stare at him
Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly touching
The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave
Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird
The MiG pushes negative , hard down and away
He heads for the deck
He's running for it

Helping him in
What makes you think we can get back in
We don't have the fuel for this
Just get me to him
He's nine o'clock high
We're two thousand pounds low
27 Maverick's plane pulls up behind Cougar's
Cougar's plane suddenly flips over, flying inverted
'm pulling up
No
Now we're inverted
Maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft
His voice is calmness itself

Nothing happens

We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down

' You'll have mine, Cougar
It'll be where your head used to be
28 All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two planes
Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles
The watches the approach
The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, drops the wing, straightens
the approach of a pilot experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear

wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down
, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low toward the deck
The deck crew watches in terror as the plane wallows in toward them
The ' turn, take a few steps and throw themselves off the flight deck
They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side
28A Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest it's downward momentum
The hook raises sparks as it skids across the deck
The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire
The wire snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of the air and slamming it all to the deck
Right wheel flies up the deck and over the side
the gear collapses
The plane  sideways
The crew watches helplessly as it skids slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam

The fire crew is there
The man in the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit
The figures inside are not moving
He hits the canopy release
The canopy pops open
Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness release
He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth
Goose, can you hear me
Goose
Nothing for a moment
He's dead
Then the ' helmet moves
His head turns
He tears the mask away from his face, looks up at Silver Suit
His head clears
Oh, Hello
Valet parking
Silver suit is stunned for a moment
He straightens up, his head inclines quizzically
Then it hits him
Son of a bitch
You will put it up front, with the Porsches
He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane
Hey
easy
Take it easy
'm a veteran
Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm
Can you check under the hood thought  heard a funny noise
Other crewmembers help Cougar out
He seems stunned, but Goose reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners
He grabs a crew member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge
He waves to them, does his best impression

Then hysterical, tension relieving laughter

He pulls away, reaches back into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid

31
-  , Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past
Goose, eyes wild, waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up
They flame out - They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking numb
Goose does his "stewardess"
On behalf of your Captain and your crew,  want to thank you for flying VF101
And next time your plans include the middle of the goddamn ocean in the dead of frigging night,  hope you'll think of Naval Aviation
The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes
Stress reaction
Check his head
(wobbling off) Never mind my head, check my shorts

33
03  -   - ' The usual , ,  of Navy life sound through the dim, deserted passage
From the distance, a single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead lights
Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily
He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign: Commander Tom Otawoczek 101 34
' The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up
Come in
He looks up
Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look on his face
Cougar, what is it
You should be in sick bay
What are you doing
He walks over to the skipper's desk
His eyes are glazed, but his jaw is firm
Thinking of my wife and kid
determined movement
Hand to chest
34A Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings
35 Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and Maverick
He turns the other way
Cougar
He stops, turns to them
There is nothing to say
Goose hands him his snapshot
Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, then looks up at them
He turns away
Cougar
(
) Maverick, Goose
Come in here
36
'  - Maverick appears, followed by Goose
They stand at attention
Sir
The Skipper says nothing
Maverick sees the wings on the desk
He enters, walks over, stares down at them
He picks them up
Don't worry
'll talk to him
Don't
He's a good pilot
talked a man back once
Three months later, we lost him
It's his decision
Only he knows
He's the best you have
He's going Top Gun
Was
What
Was going
(Turns to Maverick
) Now you are
Me
Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions
Well, he's going (indicating Goose) and he needs someone to fly the plane
Skipper, you can't do this
didn't do it, he did it himself
Something about a wife and kid
The fact is, he's lost it
He knows it
know it
You were up there, you know it, too
Give him a break, Skipper
It was raining snakes up there
He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home
The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment
know some  are a little wiggy
but you abuse the priviledge
don't believe 'm going to have to put the two of you in the same cockpit
but there it is
It may be good for the Navy
It might be good for you, but most of all, it's good for me
It'll get you out of my sight
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun
He's the best of the best
Well, you'll just have to make do with him (indicates Maverick)
Goose and Maverick exchange looks
Mav's a great flyer but
He's a hell of a flyer
In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself
Except for one thing
() He just can't seem to follow orders
Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches
You just did an incredibly brave thing
What you should have done was land your plane
You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do
should ream you out for it
But it just doesn't work with you
You're a hell of a flyer
You are maybe too good
You never really stepped in it yet
So this is your chance
'm gonna send you up against the best
They are better than you
Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it
Maverick hasn't really heard anything but
He snaps out of it
Sir
That is all
Tell me about the MiG some other time
Yes sir
He snaps off a salute and does an about face
Maverick
He turns back
Yes sir
The wings
He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over places them gently on the Skipper's desk
Gentlemen
/ Sir
His facade cracks just slightly
Good luck
37 Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews
They have become notorious
Guys grab at them
questions
the MiGs
What happened up there
How close did they get
What did the MiGs do
One word is heard over and over
"TopGun"
Goose is left behind in the crowd
Maverick pushes through
He walks fast
faster
Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through passageways
Faster
He breaks into a trot, then a canter, squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a run
38
-  - hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier
He's out on a catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs cantilevered high over the breaking seas
He plunges forward to the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak
He is yelling something
He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into the trough
The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray
The noise is incredible
Come around on his face
It is maddened
He raises his fist and punches the night
The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it : Desert Sand whipping by

- 1 big bike, a real big bike, a turbo
rockets across the desert
Fast
Real fast
Aviator shades low above the handlebars --Maverick
Goose hangs on in back
It cranks faster, pulls closer
It cranks up a notch, it's going to explode
It can't go faster, but it does
It
It under, by and away, leaving dust

- Silence
Just the
Maverick sits on it, staring out past us
Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder
We see why
Feet come into the frame
Then the uniform: California Highway Patrol

- 40A
enters the frame, the usual hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief
The usual questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some other form of life
Maverick is off the bike, standing at attention
Goose follows more slowly
Son
Do you know why stopped you
Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority
Yes sir
do sir The  adjusts his own aviator shades
Well
What   is   it
(more than sincere) Sir
You are going to give me a warning, Sir
-  touch of a smile, quickly surpressed
License and registration
Maverick hands them over with his Navy
scans them, hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more respect
Lieutenant, do you know how fast you were going
Yes sir
do, Sir
Well
Sir
was going Mach point one five
nods sagely
One  the speed of sound
Yes sir

What do you
usually fly
-14's sir
(new respect) Tomcats
Yes sir
long pause
Respect in the cop's eyes
He taps the Navy  on the handlebars
staring at this sincere young man
Lieutenant
Is there
a Russian attack
No sir
But you have to be ready
The cop nods and stares at him

- 41A The bike is
barely going fast enough to stay upright
Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the hanger with the sign: ,
He pulls ahead
In back of him, escorting with flashers

They pull up at the gate
Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their
The  gets out of his car, leans against the door
Lieutenant
Maverick turns to him
Yes, Sergeant
Remember one thing
Sir
Outside of this gate
am Top Gun
Yes sir
He salutes
The  returns a snappy one
He gets back in his car and turns away
Maverick receives his  and clearance
As he passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits ( ) stare at him
The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a dry voice, meant to be overheard
Uh oh, police escort
This one must be a real killer
The second pilot grins big at them
Maverick turns slightly stares over his shades at them as he passes
Goose grins back the challenge

-   - F4',  17' - The Doors on the soundtrack
Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane explodes
Gun camera views of MiGs, , flak, bombing runs
(
) During the Korean War, the Navy kill ratio was twelve-to-one
We shot down twelve of their jets for every one of ours
In Vietnam, this ratio fell to three-to-one
Our pilots depended on missles
They lost their dogfighting skills
-14's fighting with -5's
Music becomes current
(
) Top Gun was created to teach
Air Combat Maneuvering
Dogfighting
Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us
We do just what they did, but we do it beyond the speed of sound
43
-
-  tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, stands before a video-tape monitor
Behind him, on the monitor, the dogfighting continues
By the end of Vietnam we upped our kill ratio to thirteen to one
He turns on the lights
We see his audience in
You're here 'cause you're the top one per cent of all naval aviators
Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention
They are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks
(
) You're the elite, the best of the best
We're gonna make you better, because you're job is damned important
- The camera moves among them
Hold on one of the men; the one who greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice
(
) With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- tation is greater than ever, and carrier pilots will be the first ones there
Air combat excellence is vital
Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our direction
, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers something to him, and gestures
Ice is getting the lowdown on someone
The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as Maverick enters the frame
Someone once asked me if training men for air combat made the world less safe--flying loaded guns
an accidental confrontation and so forth
Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his direction
Their eyes meet
Ice smiles coldly
- (Con't) My answer is: the dangerous thing is being unprepared
You want trouble, that's what you get when things don't work out, when you can't do what you say you can
When you don't know what you can do
And when your opponents aren't sure either
We are not policy
We don't make policy
Elected officials civilians, do that
We are the instrument of policy
The tip of the spear
So we had best be sharp
Maverick has turned to look at Ice
Ice glances back in his direction
Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in blue flight suits stand
They are the instructors
They look relaxed, poised, mean
Goose is looking up front
Where Viper has stopped
Goose nudges Maverick
(whispers) What are you doing
Nothing
That's McGown
that's Singer, isn't it
Turn around, pay attention
What are you doing
(musing to himself) Just wondering
(turns back) who is the best
He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer grin on his face
He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy
Really
(smiles) Ya know
We'd like to know who's best too
That's why we've got that plaque on the wall
with the Top Top Gun crew from each class
You think maybe your name's gonna be on it
Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social alternatives, then tells him the truth
Yes sir
couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys
The instructors stare the challenge at him
He slides lower in his seat
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude
(somewhat chastised) Yes sir
like that in a fighter pilot
(couple of laughs from the guys) It's okay to be confident
You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers
Just keep in mind the other component of success
teamwork
Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over
Yes sir
Viper turns back for one more thought
Gentlemen, this is about combat
Remember, there are no points for second place
Dismissed
Viper walks out
Maverick finds Goose looking at him, quizzically
Others mill around the plaque
big, friendly bear of a  speaks
plaque
It's not the plaque
The winner can get assigned here as instructor
He gets to fight every day
They move closer to examine the names on the plaque

""  -
Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the night
It's Wednesday; Animal Night
Maverick, Goose Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance
45 Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the walls
dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots talking with their hands
Every pretty girl in San Diego seems to be here
It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam releaser" for people under pressure
Nevertheless, there is a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, just pilots and Naval Officers
The Ghost Riders enter
The place is on fire:  a mob of dancers, flashing lights, blaring
Beer flows
Pilots talk flying and hustle girls
-  A7 pilot stands by the bar
He knows Goose and speaks loudly for his benefit
A7 You know the Fighter Pilots motto
It's better to be dead than to look bad
They grin broadly
Goose replies as they brush past
don't know, Frank, anybody gets off on bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer
Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots
Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the music
Maverick is a bit reserved
He doesn't move among the crowd as naturally as Goose does
Hollywood and Wolfman drift away, searching for quarry
Goose orders beer
He nods toward a across the room
Keller, Black Lion Squadron
knew him at Pensacola
He's damn good
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know
Gotta keep track of the competition
Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun
If you're among the best in the Navy,  tremble for the security of this country
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here
The list is long, but distinguished
So's my Johnson
This is Maverick
Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav
So 've heard
Who's your pilot
Tom Kazansky
(very impressed) No shit
The Iceman
Mister to you
You think you can stay up with us
think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing
So  heard
Steers it pretty close
Sorry to hear about Cougar
He was a good man
Still is
Yeah
That's what  meant
Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up
Someone ducks his head and swallows it
The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar
What was that
Flaming Hooker
Sort of an institution around here
Or maybe this is the institution,  forget which
It's the house drink
It'll warm the cockles of your heart
and other things depending on where you spill it
He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up
holds a demitasse glass
The barmaid pours Drambuie
They look at Goose apprehensively
Goose looks at nearby flyers in Camo fatigues
You can't show fear in front of Marines
They're like Doberman's they'll go for your throat, it's instinctive
He takes out match and lights it
Maverick holds his arm
You ever done this before
What, been drunk
Sure
Plenty
He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still aflame
He stands there, blinking
How was it
Could use a dash more jet fuel
The others are duly impressed
Maverick's gaze falls on Ice watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick takes one too, downs it in a gulp
Sundown, taking up the challenge, motions for one
The barmaid pours it
Careful, don't make an ash of yourself
He tries to drink the flaming concoction
He tries to go for a sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame away, but that doesn't work
Finally he goes for the gulp
He burns his lip and misses
He sets his hair on fire
It goes up in a
Yeow
Mayday
Down in flames
He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire
Sundown blinks through the beer
Thanks,  needed that
You guys are not only crazy, you're dangerous
Ice comes up from the end of the bar
He motions the Barmaid for another; it comes
Goose lights it
He gulps it down, cool as hell
(Disdainfully) Frat boys
He walks away
Slider goes after him
Who is that guy
That's Kazanski
No shit
That why they call him Ice
Nope
It's the way he flies - Ice cold
No mistakes
Wears you down
After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you
Maverick moves in Ice's direction
He passes Wolfman dancing with a girl with bright purple fingernails
-
Why do you all have such funny names
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own
never changes
you have to recognize it immediately
Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left
"
you react right away
Why do they call you Wolf
(smiles) Oh,  don't know
Goose comes up with his arm around a girl
Hey Mav, this is Sally
She doesn't believe a word  say
Tell her 'm married, will you
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead
Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance floor
Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his partner
-    - Could  get a call sign
Well,  don't know
That depends
On what
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous
Like what
Oh
'll think of something
Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge
He watches a few pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider
Maverick walks over to him
Ice notices Slider's attention going to Maverick
He turns and grins at him
Figured it out yet
Figured out what
Who is the best
Nope
Need a hint
think  can work it out on my own
You like to work alone
've heard that about you
've heard of you, too
You were in 124 with Bargamian
And you were with Cougar
He was my roommate in flight school
He's a good man
The best
You must have soloed under a lucky star
First the MiG, then you slide into Cougar's place
It's not Cougar's place
It's ours
What do you think it was
Was it that MiG contact that did it
Did what
Got you here
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing
Not because of some MiG encounter
What luck
Guys fly their whole career without seeing a MiG up close
You're famous
You mean notorious
Something in the way he says it
It's not quite a joke, more an insult
Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far when something
someone catches his eye
She catches quite a few eyes in this room
She is very pretty and she's walking in on the arm of a Commander
Maverick turns back, but the moment has passed
Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile
Goose pulls him away
What do these guys think,  made Cougar quit
Pay no attention to it
They're just trying to rattle you
It's all psychological
Sit down
and drink
He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch
Maverick broods
We were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown Haiphong
It was some great shit
Jack says, "What are you doing
" "What, what am  doing, Jack
" He says, "What are you doing
"  said, "'m rolling in, Jack
" "Bugs, we're at thirty-two hundred feet
Oh shit, we were like zooom
So we scraped down at hundred feet right over--downtown Hanoi
Oh shit, goddamn it
And blowing down the river
And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and Jack says
"Bugs
don't ever do that again
" "Okay, right, Jack, 'll never do that again
" Maverick pays little or no attention
He broods and drinks
Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns
What, what is it
Target passing
Check your six
Never mind mine
Check hers
They turn
Long legs, great ass, beautiful
Her six is a ten
Uh oh, a turn to engage
- Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even then
Wolfman turns, sees her walking too
Bogey
9 o'clock level
Nine thirty
Bogey
You presume that hostile
Well, we should contact and check it out
She has turned toward them
She passes by
They start to make a move for her
But just then she finds her date at the bar; a distinguished man with Captain's stripes
Their smiles freeze and they slide back in their chairs
Maverick can't stop looking at her
After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her attention
She feels him
She is nodding and smiling to her date, but her eyes scan the room like radar
warning tone goes off in his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him
He feels that thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're targeted in someone's scope
Her eyes hold on him for a long moment
long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room
She turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something he says
Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls
The family unit -- that's the most important thing
It's the only thing you can count on
'm married --did  tell you that
Four times
We don't believe you
've been married since  was eighteen
Why don't you believe me
Because you don't look married
You're not even wearing a ring
(big smile) take it off when 'm chasing women
It's the only honorable thing to do
- He's half listening to Bugs rattle on
His eyes are drawn back to the woman
He tries not to stare
She seems to know a lot of people in the club
He looks away
Hollywood is chatting up a girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught
His line is just as polished as his appearance
You don't think about death up there, but you think a lot about the danger
One mistake and you're a smoking hole in the ground
never knew it was so dangerous
Oh yeah, it makes everything down here more meaningful
You feel a certain intensity of life, and you want to grab onto every moment
Maverick looks up at the bar again
shock
She (Charlie) is staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something in her ear
She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, embarrassed
She says something to the man
He nods and turns away as someone else grabs his attention
The woman, now wouldn't look this way for anything
She picks up her purse from the bar and walks through the crowd and out of the room
Impulsively, Maverick's up, he follows
46
- He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her
Someone disappears around a corner
He moves after
-  door slams shut
Impulsively, before he realizes what he is doing, he's through it
47
'
feminine
He should have looked at the sign on the door
The realization of where he is hits him too late
She is standing by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him
He's not quite sure what to do
hasty retreat would be appropriate, if embarrassing
Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot
He just walks right over to her
no idea what he will say
She's got her lipstick out, twisting it
She looks over at him with an amused smile
Long cruise, was it
She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover her
Anything  can do to help, Lieutenant
Lots of things
She laughs
He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging
She tries not to grin at his embarrassment
'll bet
Uhhh
Anything  can do for you
She laughs again, doesn't know what it is
could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted
Yeah
Hold this
It might be safer
She hands him a makeup mirror
Starts redoing her lipstick
He just stares at her
She looks up at him, than back to her warpaint
Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused
Now  know why all the girls come here
They know how horny you guys get
But this
is ridiculous
It's not that
Mock anger
She's toying with him
It isn't
Well, it is
It is that, too
That's a big comfort to me
could be, too
How so
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy
And on to a bigger one with you
Yeah, most likely
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots
heard of one once
She laughs again, shakes her head
another cowboy
She gently takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed
'm really flattered, Lieutenant, but  don't go out with pilots
Then what are you doing here
Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but not without interest
think the question is
what are you
She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room
The other girls look at him expectantly
beat
He just stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick
Hi
'm here to talk about a new concept in cosmetics
47A
She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to her
Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar
He orders a drink
It comes
He drinks it, pays for it, moves off toward the door
Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly and bumps into someone else; her
Sorry
She sees it's him
My fault
Should have watched where  was going
Her hand goes to his collar
She adjusts his insignia
She smiles
Where's your wing man
Who's watching your six
Uh, nobody,  guess
One final adjustment
Too bad
She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away
See you around
Maverick finds his voice
Can  walk you out
She turns back to him, a smile
'm with someone
48
""  - - From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain leave the club
They walk directly toward us and stop
She turns, says something polite
a peck on the cheek
He turns away dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door opens
It rocks slightly as someone gets in
Charlie turns back and walks over, taking her keys out
She opens the door to the car and gets in
48A
- She starts the car and pulls away
Suddenly, a figure sits up in the back
thought he'd never leave
Yeow
Startled, she nearly drives off the road
She turns to him, startled
You
What are you doing here
Everybody's got to be somewhere
What if Captain Dawson had come with me
It would have been really embarrassing
How did you know this was my car
Simple deduction
It's fast
It's pretty
Sleek and stylish
It's your color
matches your lipstick
That's all
And  asked someone
You think you're pretty smart
think 'm in love
49 She pulls up at the guard gate, a   is on duty
He sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully
Can  help you, Ma'am
She smiles even more sweetly
don't know, Corporal
Can you do anything about this lunatic
The car door swings open
Maverick gets out
The car roars away
He stands in the glare of the spotlight
rocking on his heels, looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares holes in his chest
50
-
Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG kills on walls, then down corridor
Not so fast
my head
They skid to stop outside a door
51 Ground crews work on planes in
Jester in middle of lecture
Door bursts open
Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see whole class looking at them
Who are you
'm Sundown
Yeah, right
You're late
Viper breaks in, indicating Flex
And who are you
Flex Flex
You don't look like Flex to me
You call that muscle
Doesn't look like muscle
Looks like
Pork
They laugh
Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest
What're you laughing at
You're Fungus
Stops scratching
/ Fungus
Don't make an issue of it, it'll stick
(Unhappily) It'll stick anyway
Viper turns away
Now to continue
In this class we will be dealing with -5's and A4's, as our MiG simulators
Technically the -5 does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21--it also does not bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does
The A4 does not turn as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility
Maverick looks back to his notes
footsteps
door opening
Viper looks up to back of room door
Hi, Charlie
Good, our 's here
Charlie's the most qualified to get into  subs and curves, and diagrams
Maverick turns to see the  walk forward
Maverick stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him
He is surprised, embarrassed
Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- not your ordinary
Charlie has her Ph
in astrophysics--she's a civilian contractor so you don't salute her
or anything else
Is that clear
She walks to the front and starts her presentation
She talks about something very technical, arcane
MiG tactics, technology
As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to her
Goose glances over at him
He, too, recognizes the girl
He looks at his partner
Maverick feels his stare
Hello,  think  have some new data for you
Now a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks
It won't do a Negative  push over
Even below one , they risk a flame out
Operationally, they will do a zero to one  only
snicker from the audience
She hesitates momentarily, goes on
The latest intelligence shows that the most they will do in operation is one
is there something wrong, Lieutenant
don't think you're altogether right
about the MiG, that is
She stops--some of the pilots look at him
Viper glares
beg your pardon
No,  beg yours
But  don't think you're right on that
Why not
saw one
You saw a MiG 21
saw a MiG do a 4  negative dive
(She doesn't believe him) Where did you see that
It's classified
Nervous buzz in the room
Viper goes rigid
Charlie can't believe it
It's what
It's classified
Like Hollywood says,  could tell you, but then 'd have to kill you
Pork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle
Viper is embarrassed
Maverick
She stops Viper with a glance
It's all right
She can handle it
She is very cool, not overbearing
She says it calmly
She doesn't want to embarrass him any more than he is, but she has to get the facts straight
Lieutenant,  have a top secret clearance
The Pentagon sees to it that  know more than you
Not in this case
(Flatly
) You saw a MiG push negative 4G
Yes, ma'am
Where were you
On his six
Little stifled laughs
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six
Yes, ma'am, At first
Then  was directly above him
She stares at him for a moment, then she has him
She goes for the kill
If you were directly above him, how did you see him
was inverted
real buzz in the room
Ice laughs audibly
You were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG 21
(She can't believe it
) At what range
Two
Two miles
Two meters
Chuckles, barely suppressed
Goose pipes up to deflect attention
One and a half, actually
got a polaroid
(Flatly
) Lieutenant
Ma'am
What were you doing there
Giving him the bird
Open laughter
She thinks it's at her
She grows red
The what
You know
The finger
He shows her, but she can handle this
So you're the reason those talks failed
The room breaks into laughter
At him
Now he grows red
Goose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if to say: "Let it go, pal, she got you"
She looks at Viper
He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry
He knows there's something here he doesn't control
Lieutenant
It's just like he says, sir
(He snaps) don't care
51A
- She walks away
He runs up and stops her
Why didn't you tell me you were a She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen
It never came up
You let me make a fool of myself
You seemed determined to do that anyway
Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter
Would it have made a difference
No
What would
You know, 'm assigned to this school
see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks
Your attention is flattering, but not really productive
Why don't you keep your mind on flying
She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia
Why can't you keep this straight
She smiles at him and walks away
Maverick turns, sees the others sizing him up
Most of them grin
Maverick moves down the corridor past the 's Office
Viper leans against the doorsill
He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick
His tone gives away nothing, like an  probe eliciting a response
Maverick
Where'd you get that call sign
Ahhh
Runs in the family, sir
You're father was Marvin Mitchell
Yes sir
good man
Good flyer
Viper turns away
Yes sir
Thank you sir
Maverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's not sure how or why
He turns to catch up with Goose and the others
- At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each other, going in opposite directions
As they jockey for position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips
The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears
With each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out
The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting
The extreme forces--6
5--flatten them against their seats, causing their heads to weigh over one hundred pounds
Maverick strains to turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at Mach One
've lost him -- where is he
On your six -- coming hard
Four hundred
Losing airspeed
He's on your six and closing fast
Hard left
Maverick jerks the stick left, and the -14 takes an astonishing turn
Jester  past into a wide arc
Great move
Great He should've had me
Take it down
Let's bug out of here
Call for a draw
No way
'll nail him this time
Going vertical
- rocketing toward space
Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare
Going ballistic is dangerous
The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces
The ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the moment, out of control
He's blind -- you got him
'
He's out of energy
You got control
Unload
The -14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive
It rockets down the outside, gaining energy
Over the  of jets, the of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a distant voice in a typhoon
Through the canopy, we see Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of a falcon
'  -  in windscreen - a diamond in a box
Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the high pitched tone
'
' He's right
We're at ten thousand
No way
got you, sucker
You're going down
Jester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight
The  is louder, faster
In the envelope ' , ,
(stunned) Goddamn
We beat him
There is an edge of anger in Jester's voice
They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of victory gets the best of them
Goose lets out a war whoop
The -14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman
We did it
Look, Ma, top of the world
52A
-
Maverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its side, wings perpendicular to the ground
Goose sees the world go sideways
Ahhh
little high on the left, don't you think
Right
He aileron rolls another quarter turn
Inverted, they pass right down the runway
Goose looks out and insouciantly watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down
Right
Much better
Ahhh
what do you call this
It's a victory roll
wouldn't call it victory
It's more like
self immolation
52B Controllers work
Officers watch the landing activity
One old salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming Java microns from his lips
The Tomcat roars over
He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt
52C
' -14 They complete the roll, bank left, zoom right by the tower, level with the observation window
52D
-14'
Controllers look out at the -14, mouths drop open
52E He waves jauntily
Hi
Hi there
How ya doing in there
Mav
Ahhh
you know, at one point  did want a Navy career
Come on, relax
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders
Oh, no, think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk
Come on, we beat an instructor
How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll
Just once, if they take your plane away
They roll out, break over the runway
*** 52F
Maverick and Goose walk by parking Tomcats
Ice is unstrapping, Slider is climbing down
Ice looks at Maverick, says one word
Cowboys
Maverick keeps walking
Goose hangs back
Nice
Always a good idea to show up your instructors
He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4
Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat
Hey, see any controls back there
(thinks about team loyalty, reacts to Jester's glare
) And anyway
we beat the Son of a Bitch
He turns and runs to catch up with Maverick
53
- Pilots half undressed
Maverick and Goose enter the room, carrying their helmets
The students look up at them, and Goose suddenly flashes a thumb's up sign with a grin
The students react with clenched fists, ad libs, high fives, victory punches
You won
Didn't everybody
"Oooo" -- they all go "ooo" and laugh
No, we
got our butts kicked
Thirty seconds
That's all it took to blow us out of the sky
We went like this, he went like that
say to Hollywood: Where'd he go
Hollywood says: where'd who go
And he's laughing
Right over the radio, He's laughing at us
Attention turns to the doorway as Ice and Slider enter
Ice gives a brief dramatic pause, then flashes thumbs up and smiles
The students celebrate Ice's win
Ice handles the attention with the easy composure of one who is used to it
Maverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his -suit
Ice moves toward his locker
*** You won
Congratulations Maverick and Goose won too
Ice talks into his locker
That's not what  heard
We won
Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them
Below the hard deck doesn't count
You guys are the second team, aren't you
Maverick gets up, moves to him, starts to say something, when Jester, breaks into the room
Maverick, Goose
Viper's office
Now
53A
'
lot of screaming and yelling, muffled by the door
53B
Enlisted Yeomen and Chiefs go about their clerical duties in acute embarrassment mixed with curiousity
Behind the ' door, someone is screaming his head off
The door bursts open
big, brawling Officer - Johnson, the Air Boss - blasts out, nearly smashing into a female petty officer
She almost spills her coffee
Johnson looks right and left in fury too strong for words
He looks like he wants to smash something
They move out of his way, but he justs blasts through the door and disappears down the hall
The enlisted men turn to Viper's office
53D Jester stands inside stonefaced
Maverick and Goose are rigid
Viper
with excess calm deliberation, softly walks over, grasps the doornob
He glances in this direction
The glance is totally without expression, and even scarier for that
*** 53D
() In a flash, each man finds something totally engrossing in his work, or something terribly important to do elsewhere
Slowly, steadily, Viper swings his door closed
54
' He moves over to face Maverick
There is a  like after a train wreck; nothing but the  of sprung metal and the low  of escaping steam
Viper speaks quietly, like a funeral director consoling the living
Makes you want to scream
Well
That about covers the flyby
Jester almost breaks into a grin
Now
in addition
you broke two major rules of engagement
And
That's
not good
Maverick gives no response
Viper continues
Lieutenant Candela lost sight of you, and called "no joy"
You failed to respond
He stops and looks at Maverick
beat
Maverick finally nods Why
Maverick is exhausted
It's been a long, rough day
His voice is a horse whisper
had him in view
was peeling over the egg, into a dive
He saw me when  moved in for the kill
There wasn't any danger
(to Goose) Is that how you remember it
Yes, sir
By the time we could respond, we were diving right into his view
Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet
Jester, at what point did you call off the fight
Just below ten thousand
But you continued to fight
Another pause, another grudging nod
Why
We weren't below for more than ten seconds
There was no danger
had the shot
took it
The rules of engagement are not flexible
They exist for your safety
You will obey them
Is that clear
Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the thought is momentary
He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper what he thinks he wants
He is just on the cusp of too sincere
Yes sir, perfectly clear
guess we were
was
just a little over enthusiastic
Viper measures him for a moment, then lets it go
guess you were
Dismissed
Maverick and Goose leave the room
Viper looks at Jester, picks up Maverick's fitness report
Doesn't read it, looks back at Jester
don't know what to tell you, Skip
Tell me one thing
Jester waits
If you had to go into combat, would you want him with you
Jester turns, walks slowly around the room
The walls are lined with pictures; planes and pilots
history
There are MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel
There's one picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning the camera
Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, previous 's
Finally Jester replys
Yep
Viper slaps shut the fitness report
He's seat of the pants
Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book
All over the sky
But don't know, Skip, he's really got something
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class
(laughs) "Maverick
" He throws the report on the desk
Yup, a wild pony
55 56
- Wind , jet
Hollywood and Wolfman are being thrown about as Hollywood fights the stick
No
No
Look out, you lost it
They depart flight
Tumble
The horizon swings wildly as they go into flat spin
We're dead
face appears at 12,000 feet, right in front of their canopy
Goose's eyes bug at them
Man, you guys gooned it
Your laser butts are scattered across
(disgusted with himself) Come on
died enough for one night
56A They climb out of the simulator -  cockpit sprung on moveable rams, surrounded by a dome on which video images are projected
As they climb down, Maverick and Goose climb up into the cockpit to take their place
Have you guys ever considered career counseling
57 56B
- Filled with computers, tape transports and video screen representations of computer generated combat
Now Maverick flies it as Charlie and other techs watch
56C Maverick flys the heck out of it
It's real
It lurches and bumps, the  and sights look real
He gets on the tail of a MiG
It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too fast to follow
It screams around in a turn
Suddenly, there is a
the lights come on
What happened
(
) What did you do in there
What did you do
You broke it
58 Maverick and Goose enter
The techs cluster around the keyboards trying to reprogram, to figure out what went wrong
You flew it off the template
Nobody ever did that before
That's what she said last night
She stares at Goose until he grins and moves off to give the others his valuable opinions on how to reprogram the computers
What is it about you
He just shrugs at her and smiles
What would you say, too fast
too quick
And far too aggressive
It is combat
Every second counts
The hottest moves in the world aren't gonna help you if you wind up alone
Your wingman's got to be able to follow you
Trust you
Know that he can depend on you
It's more than just fancy flying
Well, what you need
what you have to keep looking for
what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you
Who can match you move for move
Then you've got something
'm sorry
For what
That stuff about the MiG
was out of line
Apology acknowledged
Is that all
What else do you want
Um
You
There you go with those moves again
Too aggressive
don't mix with the boys
work here
Let's keep it professional
'm special
(laughs) Yes
'll give you that
Give me a break, 'm asking you out
can't
thought there was something
That night in the club
Lieutenant
Evan
or Maverick
Maverick
you know the rules of engagement
(can't believe it
) The what
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do
What are you talking about
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe
'm not your foe
And if he's harmless, you disengage
Harmless
Uh hum
What if he's not
You have to shoot him down
If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens
Harmless
Nobody ever called me harmless before
And probably never again
It's nothing personal
It's just know a lot of pilots
Maybe 'm immune
Don't worry, 'm a new strain
And don't give up
Everything 've ever wanted 've had to work like hell for
Well, how about it
How about what
How about anything, anything you want to do
Hard to argue with that, isn't it
date
Coffee
drink walk in the park
What about the plane
What plane
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit
play with the levers and things
Well, get used to it
Used to what
'm different
'm starting to sense that now
You're slow to engage
But you'll come around
She pushes him out the door Let's make it at eight
Make what
Anything
Okay, anything
Just
go
've gotta work
She closes the door, turns back to her screen
59 thru 61 *** 59A
- day off
Pilots, other personnel are enjoying a day at the beach
There are bikinis, and beer, sunfishes and water skiing
The annual Over-the-Line (a variation of softball) tournament is in progress
The team from the Teddy Kennedy Driving School is whipping another known as Scum de Terre
The pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam
59B Undulating sea grass
Muffled  of the surf
pretty fish comes into view
spear shoots through it, and nails it to the ocean floor
59C Two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach
Maverick holds the wriggling fish
Charlie is repulsed
She pulls off her mask and snorkle, follows him in to shore
59D They flop down
He drops the fish in front of her, sees her reaction at watching its death throes
Why'd you do that
(surprised) had the shot
She looks at him for a moment, then turns away, fiddles with her mask
It dies
We live
You're an animal
That's true
What are you
don't enjoy watching things suffer
He smashes the fish on a rock
It is still
No
It's not suffering anymore
(she looks at him strangely, half jokes) You're horrible You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs
(he puts it down) Things die
Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms
Every time you eat, something had to die
You don't have to kill it
Somebody does
It's more honest this way
You do your own dirty work
You ever think about killing another human being
About as much as they think about killing me
Does it bother you

That's why you're up there
It's him or me
That's the price of admission
(she draws away) It bothers you, why
You're part of it
(She stiffens, he's losing her
He softens)  Everybody dies
Most people don't get to die for something
You don't want to confront it, do you
You want to keep it all clean, cerebral
velocity vectors, wing-load diagrams
You ever been up
Flying
You use your mind to keep things at a distance
You ever just let go
She doesn't answer
You know what really scares me
Living too long
Losing my hair and my teeth
and my guts and my wind
And my brains
Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime
You don't believe any of this
You don't think you'll ever die
That's it, of course
When 'm up there and doing it, 'm cheating it every second
'm subverting all laws
gravity
whatever
'm skating the edge of it

What he said
"There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result
" All you've got is one life
guess it's worth about the same to every body
You ever see an old woman after her husband has died
And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead
When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead
maybe ten seconds
That's your whole future
That's as far as it goes
But imagine what those seconds are worth
What if you kill yourself
Think of everything you'll miss
There is lots of stuff  don't know about
Fine wine
great art
the opera
guess if  live long enough, 'll get to it
If  don't, 'll never miss it
Are you really that brave

Cancer
She had a long time to think about it
They say you reach an agreement with death
Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here

She

braver than  am
You go up there, there isn't time to think
If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground

- killer volleyball game in progress
Maverick and Charlie wander toward it, talking softly to themselves
Goose runs up and grabs him away
Come on, we're next
What
Come on,  got over six bucks on the line
Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them
Of course it had to be Ice and Slider
Charlie sits and watches as the game gets immediately out of hand
In moments, Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly opposite each other across the net
Other revelers turn to watch as it degenerates (
) to more than a game
Maverick glances at Charlie
He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably drawn into the confrontation
She says nothing, but her attitude is apparent
Back to the game: Slider and Goose set them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face
The final point
up over the middle
They both go up, Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off his forearm
For the first time ever, Maverick beats him
He looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea
She looks back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition
They call for another game, but Maverick turns away
Come on, come on
It's double or nothing
We're talking twelve bucks American, here
've had enough
for now
He grabs Charlie and his gear
Come on
Where
You want to go ballistic
don't know
don't like being out of control
He looks back at Ice, bouncing the ball and staring at him
Stick with me, you'll get used to it

ever since  first saw a jet
wanted to fly jets, then  wanted -14's, then  wanted to fly off carriers, then  wanted Top Gun
And now
And now  want you
You always get what you want

He puts money in jukebox
She watches him

He looks at her -- makes the pact: like a sailor
Acknowleged
She looks at his eyes for any sign of a put-on, insincerity
Finally he smiles at her but she can read it
It's time
She moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss
To them sitting within striking distance at a table

Their eyes are now locked
The electricity almost arcs between them

Students and instructors sit on chairs in the peanut gallery, facing Viper at the front of the room
Charlie is in the back
The bandit has good position right here
All right, freeze here
The moment of choice -- Maverick is defensive
He has a chance to bug out right here
Better to retire and save your plane than force a bad position
Stay in the diamond another three seconds, the bandit will blow you out of the sky
make a hard right, select zone 5
(turns to Maverick to drive point home) you can extend and escape
You make a bad choice
Roll forward
The computerized rendering resumes on the screen
(Con't) You perform a split
That's the last thing you should do
The bandit is right on your tail -- Freeze there
the bandit has you in his gunsight
What were you thinking here, Maverick
wasn't thinking
just did it
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane
(smiling) No guts, no glory
It's a joke
Viper doesn't like that answer at all, but some of the students laugh and mockingly whistle at the cockiness of it
They give Maverick the high sign
Slider leans forward to him
Your guts
His glory
Maverick slumps down in his chair under Viper's glare
The computer rendering rolls forward again
He glances back at Charlie
She smiles sympathetically at him
Unfortunately, the gamble worked, or you might have learned something
The bandit never gets a clean shot
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top and defeats the bandit with a missile shot
The encounter was a victory, but we've shown it as an example of what not to do
Ice is next
Another computerized rendering comes up on the screen
Hollywood leans close to Maverick and speaks quietly
Gutsiest move  ever saw
Maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation
And the dumbest
Okay, look at this
It's textbook
Ice takes control of the battle immediately
He never gives the bandit a chance to take the offensive
An early turn here -- excellent
He goes for the jugular, and it's over just that quick
Let's run that again, it's exactly how it should be done

Hollywood takes a bit of a sandwich and makes a face

They should have warned you about that one
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night
The noise alone kept me up
What'd you do
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath
It's kind of ironic
All you guys have women troubles and  don't
That's because you don't have any women
Until last night
Did you see the moves  was making on that girl at the party
The girl with the purple fingernails
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes
It was great
It was bad
Bad
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister
They all laugh
Wolfman looks stunned
Coogan spent half the night looking for her
He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister
didn't ruin her
You didn't help
No, really
She came ruined
Ya think he knows it was me
Seemed not to
But it's hard to know
You never can tell what's in the mind of a psychopath
Wolfman looks very unsettled
Hear about Ice
What now
He won again
Goose walks beside Maverick now
Something bothering you
Nothing
Let's just go fight
Wolfman looks very apprehensive as they approach the -14's
surround both planes, making last minute checks of all systems
Among them is , six and a half feet tall, looking mean
Maverick tosses him a wave
Morning, Coogan
How's it goin', Coog
Ever find your sister, Coogan
You guys know somethin' about that
Wolfman swallows hard and hurries quickly into the plane
Coogan glares at them all with a look that could kill

Holy shit, it's Viper
Keep your shirt on, he's saying holy shit it's us
The bogies split
Bogey One hard left
Bogey Two hard right
Hollywood sweeps left, pursuing Bogey One
Maverick hangs back to cover him
Bogey One makes a strong vertical move
Hollywood stays on him
, Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses him for a moment before regaining the angle
Bogey at three o'clock high
Nose on
Maverick looks quickly at three o'clock high, sees Bogey Two returning to the fight
He jerks the stick right, and the two planes make a quick pass
, '
Just cover Wood, Maverick
Mutual support, man
'm gonna take him, Goose
Don't be greedy
Stay with Wood
want him
Maverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up
Hey, come on--hey
Maverick loops the -14 down to get the quick angle on Viper in Bogey Two
Viper takes off, running from the fight again
Maverick looks over his shoulder and sees that Hollywood still has a good position on Bogey One
He takes a hard right and streaks off after Viper
What what are you doing
We're cover
Wood's okay
want Viper
Goose looks back at Hollywood and Bogey One
But we're cover
Viper streaks across the sky with Maverick close behind
He pushes the throttle forward to  5 - full afterburner
Viper shows all his tricks
hard left, hard right, rolling into vertical, flipping into a dive
Maverick stays with him
(To himself) Goddamn, rookie, you're all right

They come out of nowhere, flashing down toward Maverick--a crossfire ambush

- Silence
Several pilots in various forms of undress
Maverick and Goose sit with their heads down, a hangdog expression on their faces
81
' -   - Maverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him
Ya know, that was the best flying 've seen since Nam
(He grins) Right up to that part where you got killed
Viper sits down
He's in a jovial, taunting mood
Maverick watches him guardedly
Twenty years' experience, couldn't shake you
You may be a great flyer
mean that
lost
Of course you did
said a great flyer, not a smart one
You fly reckless
Great instincts
No discipline
That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman
Of course you got killed
and well deserved to
It was a really stupid mistake
In battle, it gets people killed
Maverick nods and stares at his beer
can take care of myself
Talent is no holy shield
Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy
Instincts are not enough
Do it our way
We've worked these things out
The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive
(he studies him for a moment)  Why do you have to do everything the hard way
It's my own way
It works for me
don't care about the rest of that stuff
Then why are you here
For the same reason you are
Oh, you mean the thrill
The flying
The fighting
'd go up there ten times a day to fight
'd win at least nine of them
That's all  want to do
It's what do best
am real good
Just give me the jet
Viper studies him, It's not a gift, just a loan
He finishes his beer, then rises
Nine out of ten is okay, as long as it's only fun and games
But this isn't about that
This is serious business
It is dangerous up there
At 500 knots, things can change a lot in a second
Discipline is what protects us
He signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar
He stretches, looks around
It was a good day
You learned something
You lost and you're still alive to think about it
And, you lost your wingman
That's a cardinal sin
don't ever do it again
You owe Hollywood an apology and you owe me a beer
Viper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away
It was just the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from his tension
He sips his beer alone
82
- Maverick and Goose move through the terminal, anxious/expectant looks on their faces
Relationships are a bitch, here
It's hard enough to concentrate under the pressure
Having a woman here is asking for it
guess that's what 'm doing, then
Where do you find the time
Where do you find the energy
It's tough enough to keep your mind on school
woman here is a real pain in the
pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first
She rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big smile that he has practiced on her for years
She sets down the kid
butt
Hi, honey, God, am  glad to see you
missed you
Goose wraps his arms around Carol, smack, a kiss
She smiles at Maverick, turns back to Goose
had to come, Willard,  got so lonesome  just couldn't stand it
Sure, honey,  understand
It's great to see you
Hey where's your backseater, where's the world's smallest
He looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly behind his mother's skirts
Goose grabs up the kid and zooms him around, a game they've played before, every six months or so
The kid laughs happily
Maverick just sort of smiles to himself and shakes his head
83 84
( ) Maverick comes to the surface
She enters frame by the side of the pool
She hands him a split fresh pineapple
He eats it in the  most salacious manner possible
He's so contented, he's babbling
Food
and you
my -14
In that order
Well no
inverse order
'm still second best
You ever fly an -14
(She laughs
) don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies
He gets out, grabs a towel, moves over to some chairs
His flight suit is draped over one
He moves it to sit down
Ahhh, you'd love it
Night carrier landings
The most dangerous thing you can think of
next to you
And the most exciting
You're living at one hundred and ten per cent
Greatest high in the world
Danger
(of course)
Yeah
Doesn't it ever bother you
Why, what's gonna happen
His flight suit slips onto the ground
Charlie retrieves it
As she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket
Looks like a gold coin
She picks it up
Maverick is drying his hair
She holds the object out to him, questioning
He sees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket
Lucky charm
What do you take me for
It's a Navy Cross
Just good luck
Where'd you get it
Pawn shop
What's to eat
He roots through a picnic basket

- (
) MiG sweep over the water
You will proceed down the one-seven -zero degree radial looking for MiGs
You will engage all that you find, destroy them, and return to base
Maverick, has the lead
Any questions
All right, let's go
Move like you've got a purpose
85
- 20,000
- Four -14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for (MiGs)
They spot them, engage
The combatants fly scissor patterns, slashing past each other, angling for position
We hear the    from the planes, a barrage of information exchanges between pilots and 's
Maverick and Ice swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each other, testing, they glance at each other and nod
The Challenge
the fight is on
Suddenly an -5 rises up out of the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls in on him
12 '
The -5 sees his pursuers
Goes into a hard left
'
' '
Ice struggles against the 's to bring his nose to bear
They go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the advantage
He is closer to the -5's tail than the -5 is to his
But he can't close, can't line up the shot
He grunts and strains as the  force pushes him down

Maverick is pulling a log of 's, but can't target his weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round and round without gaining
He can't bring his nose to bear

Ice stays
Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6
5 's, exposing his underside to Ice
All Ice sees is belly
Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him
(under breath
) Sonofabitch
He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick
Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him
Maverick sees him flash into his view
He has to slam the stick forward to avoid collision
He swings by real close
Too close
Oh, no
They pass through Ice's turbulence
The blast distorts the airflow to Maverick's left engine
The engine flames out
Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail around in a yaw
Maverick slams the stick right to correct but too late
Plane's coupling up
Plane's coupling up
The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an out-of -control frisbee
This is not good
(Rising panic) We're low
Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection lever--but is falling short by about a foot
'm pinned to the panel
Time to go
can't eject
The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control
He drops the gear
Still spins
Goose is closer to center of spin-- forces are less
He reaches behind him for the eject handle, starts the eject sequence
3000 feet
'll do it
Go ahead
can't reach
2000 feet
85A
- The canopy  away--but is held spinning above the cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet
Goose glances up at it
1000
Let's go
Eject
Goose yanks the ejection handle
Things happen in a split second
Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his seat
Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy sickening
The canopy is knocked away
Maverick is slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up
He is  out of the plane just before it spins in
85B He's in shock
the loud  of his heart, labored breathing, a scream that stays in his mind
Instinctively, he gropes for straps
He releases the pilot seat, it tumbles away
His chute streams, balloons open, snapping his body like a bullwhip
He drifts momentarily, then plunges into the sea
85C His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, choking for air
He reaches out, finds nothing to grab
Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side
85D The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling Maverick along beneath the surface
He is twisting in the water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out of the tangled straps
He finally hits the surface of the water and sucks air into his lungs
With the end of his strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the parachute
It whips away like a kite in a typhoon
The sea is choppy and rough
He struggles as his equipment drags him under
He twists, finds the inflatable raft attached to his harness
Maverick pulls the cord, and the raft hisses open
He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot raft and collapses, completely exhausted
The survival has been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical struggle
85E Maverick begins to focus on the situation
He stains the water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby
Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the water
great struggle
The weight is extremely heavy
Finally, he pulls a body to the surface
Goose
Goose is dead
Maverick releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top of him
He holds Goose in his arms
His mind shuts down again
From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water
An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, helpless figure in the raft
: 86
- Searchlights skim over the black ocean
brilliant light flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare
Helicopter blades flick powerfully
The lights of the choppers descend toward the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life
The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft
The draft from the chopper churns the water
drops from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes
He surfaces and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered
Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose
He hugs Goose closer and looks threatened
Let him go, sir
Take it easy
He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on the body
Sir
Let him go
It's all right
Let him go
Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water
Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose
The frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness
- He watches the lifeless body in the water as he is pulled up and away
He shivers from the cold
87
- Extreme   Maverick's face
He is emotionless
His eyes are flat and absolutely without expression
There is complete silence in the room
Then we hear the quiet, calm, probing voice of Viper
How do you feel
All right
Goose is dead
know
was there
Not one sign of emotion from Maverick
Not one tone of expression
We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a very long day
If you fly jets long enough, something like this happens to you
No one escapes it
It touches us all
Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed
He was
my responsibility--my
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes
Ten guys
The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it
No reaction from Maverick
He can't quite face up to that reality right now
You've got to put him in the box
Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to say
88
'  - The  plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me"
Maverick opens his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment
they say you're alright
'm fine
This is it, then
What
The dark side
The price you pay for all the fun you're having
You knew about it, of course
Didn't you
He was a friend of mine
good guy
great guy
It was my fault
That's not what  hear
was flying
my responsibility
That's what you get flight pay for
Maybe  shouldn't take it
(In surprise) Why
You act like you didn't know one day this would happen
Not to me
You knew it
You all do
It's part of it
Maybe the most important part
88A
- Charlie's car pulls up
They get out and walk down toward the water
Maverick seems dazed
She is softly taunting
Where are we
Where are we
You know where we are
It's called the beach
It's where life first crawled up out of the sea
come here sometimes
when  feel like crawling back in
You don't have to do this
Do what, show you a good time
'm not good company
should be alone
don't think so, but if that's what you want
They stand there, not making a move
No
What do you want
want it back
What
Yesterday
She turns, nods out, past the moon
You look way out there
Out past the date line
West becomes East, all things change
You cross the line
today becomes yesterday
or tomorrow,  forget which
That's what  want
Of course the line's just imaginary
You can cross it twenty times
nothing really changes
She turns and walks along the surfline
On the beach
It's what they say when Navy men retire
He's "On The Beach"
always liked that
had a picture
in my head
all these old guys wandering around here, looking out into the past
He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet
If we knew then, what we know now, we might never have come up out of there
He turns to her
She just looks at him
You don't believe that
Hardly ever
Only when you're depressed
Then it passes
It does
Everything passes
Immutable law of the Universe
He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth
This too
shall pass
You put as much life as you can between it and you
You start piling up experience between then and now
He turns and walks
What do you do when you come here
sit
think
play games
What kind of games
like to play "reality"
She stops and turns
How do you play reality
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play
(this gets a small laugh) Strip reality
How do you play that
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing
(he laughs again) One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off
You're crazy
(She stops, he goes on, softer) That's a pretty silly game
Not as silly as some
You know the silliest one
that we are gods
That we control events on the beach
that we can turn back time
She moves in close
Want to play the game
How does it go
You say the truth
(a beat
) Go ahead
Don't be afraid
You want to win the game, don'tcha
What truth
The big one
The one that's most on your mind
long pause
it comes hard
Goose is dead
(she nods) True
Now
Take something off
Off me or off you
That's up to you
He takes the ribbon from her hair
It falls down over her face and shoulders
Now it's her turn
It's dangerous
what you do
He nods
She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around his neck
It was my fault
She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes
He slowly, as if in a trance, takes her blouse off
You can't bring him back
She takes off his shirt
It was my fault
He starts to reach for her
She pulls back
Nope
Already used that
She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon
Your life goes on
Rather than struggle his  shirt over his head, she grabs it with both hands
She leans in close and bites it
She grabs both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body
What does it mean
(shakes her head no) That wasn't fair
It was a question
Penalty round
She drops her skirt
You didn't mean it
You didn't think
You'd do anything to take it back
That's three
And that's one
She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off
She unzips his pants, they fall
One more
Your watch
She unbuckles it
You owe me one
He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra
She shrugs it off
They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking into each other's eyes
Looks like a tie
Who's gonna win
We'll say it together
On the count of three
One
two
Leaning in, softer and harder
they both jump the gun
love
ove y
you
They embrace madly and sink to the sand
From the distance it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to the sea
89
'  - The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' Quarters
The door opens, and Maverick enters
He sets a cardboard box on the bed
Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal possessions
He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom
He examines each closely, like an artifact
as if he might find some message or meaning in them
He fumbles them into the box
He can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears
Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door
He takes one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door behind him

Viper is also present
The Commander looks at each of the Officers
They each nod, in turn, indicating readiness
The Commander turns to Maverick, and states for the record: The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt
Evan Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of twenty-nine July
No response from Maverick, one way or the other
Viper studies his face with concern
Lt
Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident
Still no response from Maverick
Lt
Mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay
These proceedings are closed
Maverick doesn't respond

Maverick checks ten o'clock low
He is disturbed
He tries to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is afraid

The bogey abruptly turns into him
Maverick hesitates
Then suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the -14 away from the bogey at great speed
Fungus is startled

He just won't engage
He can't do it, Skipper
He can't get back on the horse
It's only been a week
Keep sending him up
've seen this before
So have
Some guys never get it back
He walks off

He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack
What are you doing
Saving them some paperwork
Since when did you care about paperwork
Maverick walks away
Fungus hesitates, then follows him
If  could fly like you 'd have everything  want
If  could fly at all
can't fly
can't fly like that
Nobody can
Whatever it is, you've got it
Not anymore
So, you're scared--so what
You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, 'm goddamn terrified
Grabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and walks up the corridor
Jester and Fungus watch him go
Fungus goes to the phone

- Charlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main entrance to the terminal
105 Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal
She moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all directions
quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee shop, and then she heads for the bar
Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his suitcase beside him, staring into a drink
Charlie composes herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the table from him
Maverick does not look pleased
Never liked fighter pilots anyway
He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she makes him laugh
You came to the right place
The waitress comes up
MAVERICKWhat are you having
Turns to the waitress
'll have what he's having
Hemlock, is it
The waitress departs
He tries not to smile, but can't help it
You weren't gonna say goodbye
was, later
Long distance
wouldn't do that to you
'd at least talk to you
didn't want to see you
mean, did
but  didn't
know exactly what you mean
How could you
've got a gift just like you do
My gift is  just know what people mean, even if they can't say it
It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots
Like what you just said was "'m embarrassed,  feel 've done something wrong, that 've failed, and  don't think  can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself
" That about it
(laughs) Something like that
And 'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until  can think of a new career
hotel management or something
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer
Hey,  never said  was a fighter pilot
never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm
can find contentment in a good book
don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire
Sometimes just get happy being with the right man
hope you find him
think  have
could be wrong
have been before
Just remember one thing
If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot
You're gonna have to act like the rest of us
You're gonna have to master humility
For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all
She gets up
lays a bill out for the drinks
So long, Sailor
See you on the beach sometime
She swings away
Her wake sucks in the stares of every man in the place
Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks of envy in their eyes
He stares them back and can't quite meet their eyes
106
'  - Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid
They come across one creature who's had a bad night
Viper spots him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him
Tim, Viper's kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that direction
He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen the pilots do
Dad
Of all the aminals in the ocean, which one's the baddest
don't know, Tim
You'll have to ask them
Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs
Runs in the family
Maverick stands up
Skipper, sorry to bother you
No bother
called your house
My wife's house
She said you took your kid to the each
Every second Sunday
Zoo or beach or the ballgame
'have the option
(Maverick thinks for a beat
Segues to the question
) What about me
Viper turns, they stroll together
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "" --course not completed, no explanation required
Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that
Or
Or you can quit
don't know
didn't know either
That's why told Jester to prepare your papers
Maverick looks irritated
Viper stops at an icecream vendor and orders three with a gesture
You've already made up your mind
It's no disgrace, kid
That spin was hell
It would wreck anyone's confidence
You could be a good pilot again someday
(starts to get his back up) You think  should quit
didn't say that
That's up to you
But  have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you
They need to know you're all right
that they can depend on you
The vendor hands them icecream, they take it
Here, let me get this
We'll be even
He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a handful
Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper change out
Viper spots something and reaches for it
Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up with the Navy Cross
Lucky charm
But Viper recognizes it for what it is
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it
served with your old man
know
51, the Oriskany
You remind me of him
You're just like he was, only better
and worse
'm nothing like him
You may not think so, but you are
He was by the book, all the way
They waved him off
He thought he knew better
He hit the ramp
never heard that
Not something they tell dependents
It's not true
Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream away
Why would  lie
He turns, walks away
Maverick stands there for a moment, thinking, then catches up to him, stops him
struggles with the thought
as Viper breaks in
You start on a wrong heading
the more you stick to it, the further you get from your target
good pilot always questions himself, always questions his judgments, stays alert for drift and makes the corrections
You may find a little discipline helps with the fear
You don't have to be alone up there
pause
quiet intensity
How can  go on
feel so
responsible
Kid, the plain fact is
you are
'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass
Technically, they absolved you
You and  know what really happened
You pushed it
You are responsible and you'll always carry that
You know what, 'll carry it too
should have taken you out of that cockpit
guess 'm a hopeless romantic
always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death
It's no trade-off
It's not one for one
What you learned isn't worth his death
It couldn't be
But maybe there is some value in it
know it's the first thing 've ever seen that's really gotten to you
Now the question is, what will you do with it
If it gets you out of flight status
so you don't kill yourself or anybody else
that's good
That's one good thing
You were an accident waiting to happen
You think  shouldn't fly
didn't say that
That's up to you
think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot
a better man
Would you take me back
Would they
'll have to think about it don't know about them
do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you
We'd hate to lose it
Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men
107 through  114 115 The graduation ceremonies are in full swing
They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot of talking with the hands
every now and then, the name Goose comes up and a shadow passes across a face
For the most part, they press on, having a good time
Fungus shrugs at someone's question and looks around
don't know where he is
What are his plans
don't know
Ice stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others congratulate him
Hollywood looks up as the door opens, Maverick is there
He looks uncomfortable, unsure
He sees Ice with the plaque
Fungus moves over to him, brings him in
'm glad
Good to see you, man
One by one, they come over, shake his hand
Viper stands there, looking pleased but gruff
Maverick walks over, shakes his hand
The party starts to pick up
real celebration, now
Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand
He takes Viper aside for a word
Viper nods at him
The group's attention gradually swings onto them
They quiet down instinctively
Viper finally turns to them
Gentlemen, you know how  hate to break up this party before it has a chance to get really out of hand
(more serious) but there's a major flap on
We're being called back
You're on your way
Don't bother going to
Your bags are packed
He hands them orders
Someone turns the music back up
as they shake hands all around, the music grows, becomes purer as the background voices drop out

' - To include his helmet
Stereo headphones from his walkman carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit and stares at the grey water rushing under
He sits in his Tomcat on Ready 5 Alert
In the back, Fungus plays a hand computer game - Jet Attack

Stinger's voice breaks through the music

All know is that it's our ship, and our orders are to escort it out of the area
Stinger circles an area on the map

(
) This is "Bullseye"
rescue operation is to begin within the hour
Your mission is to give air support to that rescue
There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high
If you witness a hostile act you will return fire
We will be covering 360 degrees of the compass by section
Be prepared for anything

Ice and Hollywood, sector two
He turns to Maverick who stands nearby
And Maverick
You'll back them up, on Ready Five

they join together again and fly level at ten thousand feet
One of the MiGs does a sudden canopy roll
Suddenly, Out of nowhere, Hollywood's hit
Just that fast, he's hit and goes down
His f-14 disappears into the clouds

Ice puts his nose down and follows him

He sees the hornet's nest below; planes all over the sky
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo
Take him
Pull on the goddamn stick, man
Okay, okay
Don't tell me okay
Do it
Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the stick over
The -14 rolls in hard toward the battle
Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart
The MiGs break in every direction as Maverick  through their formation
Something comes up through the clouds

Another rolls in and locks onto them
The MiGs swarm toward the , coming from every direction

They come down in a section attack with their cannons blazing
From Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past at incredible speed
Cannons , as the planes scramble for position
Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight defensively
Maverick has the angle on a , when Fungus spots a missile launch
Maverick releases a flare as he takes the -14 into a hard left
The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea

Maverick swoops after him
Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, staying on his tail

He pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up
We hear instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the Maverick peels over the top and comes down like a comet

As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, ,

They look up
An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close to a mid-air collision
He pushes down
The MiG
The whole airplane goes "" it's that close

Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 below

Ice is right in his shadow
They come in hard and low over the sea
He has the MiG in the diamond

Ah Nuts
The missile goes by the tail
Son of a bitch
Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute comes out
The MiG  into a thousand small pieces
They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps

He squeezes the trigger

The missile flies by him

MiG comes back turning into him

He looks back
30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind of float
He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives through
Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him
They close at 900 knots--
--They pass nose to nose, canopy to canopy
Both planes pitch straight up, trying for the altitude advantage
Zone 5 burners
The -14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet
Maverick has the advantage
Suddenly, his -14 runs out of energy
is the first to call it
We're ballistic
Ohhhhhh Shit
The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as it flips over, falls away
He catches it, just regains control, when
He looks up
coming down
Right on him
It fills the Canopy
Instinctive -  Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end
They are being slammed and rattled all over the cockpits
bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips
and from the airframe
Terriflying
Ohhh Mother
(strangely calm) Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner
Don't worry, Fung, 've got it
Fungus is getting his teeth rattled
He's helpless, he has no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on
Don't
You've  it
Are you
Roger, 've got it
The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the canopy
You've got it
Good
Cause for a minute there, you had me worried
It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin
Now have you got it
Have you still got it
Yawing right

Rudder's left, stick's forward
Swell
Passing ten thousand
've got it -- hold on
Passing 8
Passing 6
Lock your harness

Hold on
They're in a progressive spiral, nose low
The altimeter unwinds, speed picks up
The  forces are forcing them away from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the instrument panel at the front of the cockpit
You with me
Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel
Right behind you
He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held
It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane
The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the ejection handle
He reaches for it
Speed's up to 150
Fungus's eyes are wide
The earth grows larger as it rises towards them
forces flatten them
They've long since lost the MiG
Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this maneuver
5000 feet
Speed two hundred
Okay
The earth grows larger

Critical point
grabs the ejection handle with both hands
No
Not again
What are you talking about, we gotta go

Gotta go, man
280, 290, 300 knots
3,000 feet
We gotta go, man
3,000 feet, we gotta go
You go
'm staying with it
'm gonna go
Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull
Maverick catches it
The plane responds
They're out of the spin
He gets control
Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle
Still not believing
Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the -l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet above the deck
He comes up and looks right at Ice
Ice is down low
He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap suit
flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, rolls right in on the MiG
Fungus looks like he just saw Jesus
What  in  the  Christ
was that
He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe
Did you plan that
Was all that something you planned
Maverick's acquired the target and is all business
, ,
Fungus is still lividly frazzled
Because
if that was
Next time you tell me first
Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the MiG the other way
Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration

Ice breaks left, drops flares
The MiG's missile follows the flares
Maverick
The missile doesn't twitch
It flys right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right through the fire ball
He's out
We got him
The MiG rolls into the ground
They swoop by the pilot, hanging in his straps
He watches them, dumbly
Fungus waves
What a dope
Maybe they'll give him another plane
and we can shoot him down again
Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners and blast straight for the sun
' -14 Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him
125
' What is it
What's wrong
Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers
Is there something  should know
Just relax
Is it the plane
The plane is fine
Is it you
Yeah,  guess it is
We did it

Damn
We sure did it

Ice is looking in Maverick's direction
His face is inscrutable
Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice
They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as they are buffeted by the crowd
Finally, Ice breaks
a grin
guess  owe you one
You don't owe me anything
We're on the same team
You saved our lives
You did it
We did it
You're a hell of a flyer
(he can't resist) You can be my wingman any time
(laughs) No
You can be mine
Now Ice laughs
Nobody's ever gonna win on this one
But Ice smiles at him
It's now a running joke between them
Whatever you say, Commander
He and Slider snap to and proudly salute
Maverick hesitates, then returns it
As Ice and Slider snap it off, it turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird
Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment
As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their battle damaged  on the forward elevator as it sinks out of sight below decks

We were lucky to make it back

He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute
Why Admiral
How really good it is to see you
Maverick turns away
As he backs down the steps, a jeep screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps
Who's in charge here
am
He's answered automatically, but now it hits him
He knows the voice
He turns
- , Not for long, you keep that up
He hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at her
Well
Well what
You got your -14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs
You're our new Top Gun instructor
Now what
Oh
'll think of something
What are you doing here
live here, remember
Right on the flight line
He's got her on that one
She laughs
Everybody's got to be somewhere
Maybe your somewhere's with me
He puts his arms around her
Self-conscious, she pulls away, a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line
He laughs
That's okay
always look forward to a challenge
Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him
She kisses him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it
