href <b>// --> </b> The Crying Game The Crying Game : - loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris Wheel turning round and round
black man is by a stall
On his arm is an Irish girl with blond hair
The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin
And that's cricket, hon
An attendant hands him the teddy bear
It looks ridiculous in his huge hands
He gives it to the girl
You want it
Sure
Doesn't matter if you don't
He puts his arm around her and drags her on
Jody won't be offended
Jody's never offended
What'd you say your name was
Jude
Jude
Suits you, Jude
The teddy bear
No, fuck the bear
The name
Jude
And it's June
Jude in June
He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it -
2
Gotta piss, Jude
He holds her hand
Don't run off, Jude
You don't know me, do you
Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight
We can still see his hand, holding Jude's
She leans against the canvas, looking bored
(inside) What if  did
You'd know  wouldn't run off
She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate
Her eyes flick around the carnival
They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket
He nods
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude
You didn't
And you know what
Tell me, Jody He staggers out, buttoning up
It's nice
He goes to kiss her
She turns her head away
Not here
Who gives a fuck
You never know
3
She pulls him over toward the water
never know nothing
People
They could be looking
Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on
He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle
Come and get me, soldier -- Whatever you say, Jude
He sinks down on his knees toward her
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him
Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt
Jude cocks one eye upward
shadow falls across them
, kissing her
gun is put to his head
He turns around, drunkenly
What the fuck -- The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways
Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field
Jody feels his cheek
He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields
He looks up and sees a group of men around him
The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun
- mini, driving down a country road
Two men in the front, three in the back
On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face
Fergus holds the gun
He is smoking a cigarette
His movements are slow and somewhat innocent
So what's your name, soldier
4
Fuck you
Yeah
-
-
Jody pulled through and tied to a chair
Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood
The situation is simple
You're being held hostage by the Irish Republican Army
They've got one of our senior members under interrogation in Castleraigh
We've informed them that if they don't release him within three days, you'll be shot
You'll be treated as our guest until further developments
Have you anything to say
Jody is motionless under the black hood
Give him a cup of tea
Do you want a cup of tea
He still says nothing
All the men are drinking tea
The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it
See does he want some
Do you want some food
Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing
Late at night -- it is dark
The men are sleeping
Fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner
Jude comes in, with a flashlight
5
Hey -- what's he like
Horny bastard
Did you give him it
There are certain things  wouldn't do for my country
Have a look at him
Can't
Poke him or something
See if he's still alive
He's all right
Hasn't moved for twelve hours
Go on
Have a heart
She moves over to him
She prods him in the legs with her foot
He doesn't move
Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside
Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude
You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore -- He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair
He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love
She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming
Turn the fucking thing off -- -
Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm
You all right
6
Fucking animal
She takes in huge gobs of air
You don't know that
Fucking do
had him all over me
He touches her face
Tough work, that
Someone's got to do it
She rubs her hand on his chest
Nah, it was a breeze
Just thought of you
She sidles closer, coming on to him
And you know what, Fergus
One of you made me want it
She puts her lips to his neck
Which one
She doesn't answer
They embrace
-
hot summer's day
There are tall hedges all around the house
Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse
- Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere
Broken glass
The sun pouring through
Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it
He sits opposite, gun on his lap
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag
He holds one out toward him
7
Eat something, would you
Can't
What do you mean you can't
Can't eat through a canvas bag
Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips
Jody eats, slowly
This is a farce, man
How is it a farce
seen your fucking face
So, what do  look like
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face
Am
Yeah
And the brown eyes
Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth
You're the handsome one
Jody eats the last bits
Thank you, handsome
My pleasure
8
- Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse
She is carrying a pot of tea and two cups
- It is sweltering now in the greenhouse
' The hood is drenched with sweat
can't fucking breathe, man
Be a Christian, will you
Jude comes into view
Tell him to take the hood off, honey
Jude says nothing
Lays the tea on the ground
How did you know it was her
can smell her perfume
Jude pours out the tea
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you
As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance
Thought you liked me, bitch
It was fun while it lasted
Nice lady
His breathing becomes labored
Please, man, 'm suffocating in here
Can't we take it off
Have to check with himself
9
Fergus gives her the gun
You look after him
Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves
Don't leave me with her, man
She's dangerous
Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap
- Fergus enters
Maguire and the others
Maguire has a newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping
Made the front page
They'll move now, the fuckers
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy
Why would you do that
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat
So
And anyway, he's seen our faces
You sure
He described me down to a
Knows what Jude looks like
Maguire reads the paper
Tommy -- 10
You're his keeper
If you don't mind him seeing you,  don't mind
But you're the only one he looks at
Thanks
It's your decision
- Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating
Fergus enters
He puts his arm casually around her
Leave us, Judie
My pleasure
She goes
Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat
He breathes in mighty gulps of air
He smiles
Thank you, soldier
Fergus smiles
Never thought fresh air would taste this good
Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips
Now, if you took the ropes off, 'd be able to feed myself
No fucking way
Only joking
Fergus drinks
You know,  was wrong about one thing
11
What's that
Five ten
Brown eyes
But you're no pinup
No
Nope
Not handsome at all
You trying to hurt my feelings
No
It's the truth
Well,  could say the same about you
Could you
But  won't
We're more polite around these parts
So 've noticed
Fergus looks at him
Jody isn't smiling anymore
Fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea
He fingers the gun on his lap
Hey -- What is it now
You're going to have to do it, aren't you
Do what
Kill me
12
What makes you think that
They're going to let that guy die
And you're going to kill me
They won't let him die
You want to bet
'm not a gambling man
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose
Why can't we
Not in your nature
What do you know about my nature
'm talking about your people, not you
What the fuck do you know about my people
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers
And that it's not in your nature to let me go
Shut the fuck up, would you
And you know the funny thing
No, what's the funny thing
didn't even fancy her
13
Didn't look like that to me
She's not my type
He looks at Fergus
'mere
No
Ah, c'mere
want to show you something
What
My inside pocket
Fergus holds the gun to his face
He fishes inside Jody's inside pocket
Take out the wallet
Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet
Open it
Credit cards, army identification photograph
Inside
There's a picture
Fergus takes out a picture
It is of Jody, in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat
Fergus smiles
No, not that one
There's another
Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful black woman, smiling
Now she's my type
14
She'd be anyone's type
Don't you think of it, fucker
Why not
She's mine
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you
No
Absolutely not
She your wife
Suppose you could say that
Jody chuckles
You make a nice couple
Don't  know it
So what were you fucking around for, then
You fuckers set me up
That bitch -- She's a friend of mine Okay
That nice lady
Meets me in a bar
'm saying what the fuck am  doing here anyway
She buys me a drink
She holds my hand
'm looking at her saying  don't like you, bitch
But what the fuck
Maybe 'll get to understand
What
15
What the fuck am  doing here
What the fuck were you doing here
got sent
You could have said no
Can't
Once  signed up
Why did you sign up
It was a job
So  get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face
Shouldn't take it personally
(He imitates a Belfast accent) "Go back to your banana tree, nigger
" No use telling them  came from Tottenham
And you play cricket
Best game in the world
Ever see hurling
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other
Best game in the world
Never
The fastest
16
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game
The kids play it from the age of two
My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five
Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different
How different
Toffs' game there
But not at home
Fergus looks at him
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler
'll bear that in mind
He keeps looking at him
And by the way, it's not Paddy
It's Fergus
Jody smiles
Nice to meet you, Fergus
My pleasure, Jody -
Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him
Take it easy, now
Just go slow
Down by that tree
Tree
He walks toward it, breathing heavily
You've got to loosen my hands
17
Can't
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you
Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him
Come on, man, 'm going to wet my pants
Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly
Take the fucker out, man, 'm dying -- Fergus takes Jody's penis out
Jody takes two steps toward the wall
gotta lean forward or 'll dribble all over myself
Will you hold my hands for me
Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward
Jody now pisses with immense relief Now, that was worth waiting for
Hurry up, would you
These things take time, Fergus
He shakes his body
It's amazing how these small details take on such importance
He steps back
Now put it back in
Give us a break
18
can't do it
It's only a piece of meat
For fuck's sake, it's got no major diseases
Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up
Thank you
had a case of the clap two years ago
Crabs in Ulster
But all in all it's served me well
Shut up, would you
'm sorry
Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus
Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse
-
Fergus leads Jody back to his chair
Fergus
Yeah
Thanks
know that wasn't easy for you
He begins to laugh
The pleasure was all mine
Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why
-
Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of laughter
-
Jody, still laughing
Suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head
Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus
19
What the fuck is this
It's nothing
He's just got a sense of humor, that's all
You're on duty
Keep your fucking mouth shut
Go in and get some sleep
Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door
Yeah
Get some sleep
-
Fergus, walking toward the house
He looks back and sees the figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence
-
Fergus sleeping
-
Jody sleeping
Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands, watching him
- The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse
- Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast
Maguire is sitting where he sat before, stock-still
Did he talk
Maguire shakes his head
Didn't make you laugh
Maguire shakes his head
Here
Have some breakfast
He hands Maguire a plate
Jody stirs
20
Good morning, Fergus
Maguire looks hard at him
So he knows your name
told him
Are you all there
He rises, and drags Fergus out the door
Back in a minute, Jody - You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me
Yes
And do you know why
Why
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why
Maguire goes back to the house
- Jody sitting with the hood on again
Fergus enters
They giving you trouble, Fergus
Fergus says nothing
He takes a plate and brings it toward Jody 21
It happens
'see, there's two kinds of people
Those who give and those who take
Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him
Ah, take the thing off, man
Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him
It's okay
understand
Don't mind if prattle on, do you
Fergus shakes his head and says nothing
will take it by your silence that you don't
He eats
Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody
Two types, Fergus
The scorpion and the frog
Ever heard of them
Fergus says nothing
Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim
Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride
Frog says, "If give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me
" Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as 'll be on your back we both would drown
" Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal
Takes the scorpion on his back
Braves the waters
Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all
And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr
Scorpion, for now we both will drown
" Scorpion replies, " can't help it, it's in my nature
" Jody chuckles under his hood
22
So what's that supposed to mean
Means what it says
The scorpion does what is in his nature
Take off the hood, man
Why
'Cause you're kind
It's in your nature
Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood
Jody smiles up at him
See
was right about you
Don't be so sure
Jody's always right
-
Both men dozing in the heat
Where would you most like to be now, man
Doesn't matter where
Come on, man
If this shit was all over
Having a pint in the Rock
You lack imagination, Fergus
Think of something more alluring
Like what
Like having a pint in the Metro -- Fergus laughs
23
Having two pints in the Rock
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita
Who's Dil
My special friend
Oh, yeah
We got simple tastes, you and me
The best
But you fellas never get a break, do you
Do you
Oh, yes
We do a tour of duty and we're finished
But you guys are never finished, are you
We don't look on it like that
've often wondered how you do it
Depends on what you believe in
What do you believe in
That you guys shouldn't be here
It's as simple as that
Yes
24
Jude enters
Put that thing back on him, Fergus
He's hot
Doesn't matter if he's hot
Just cover the fucker up
Have you no feelings, woman
You shut your face -- She pulls the hood down over him
You're heading for trouble, Fergus -- He's a good soldier, Jude
She whacks him with a pistol
said shut the fuck up -- He believes in the future -- -
Jody, sitting in the hood
Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's mouth, with blood now in his lips
Is it bad
No
Not bad
Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus
didn't
Some kinds of women are
25
She can't help it
Dil wasn't trouble
No trouble at all
You liked her
Present tense, please
Love her
Whatever she is
'm thinking of her now, Fergus
Will you think of her too
Don't know her
Want you to do something, Fergus
What
If they kill me -- Don't think that way
But they will
As sure as night follows day
They have to
want you to find her out
Tell her  was thinking of her
Fergus is moved
He can't reply
See if she's all right
don't know her
Take her picture
'mere
Fergus walks toward him
Take it
In the inside pocket
Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her picture
26
Take the whole lot
won't need it
told you not to talk that way -- Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields
Take her to the Metro for a margarita
Don't have to tell her who you are
Just tell her Jody was thinking -- Stop it -- The door opens
Maguire is there, with another
Volunteer
Fergus turns toward him
We need you inside
Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward, takes his seat
Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in his pocket
-
Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others
We've had word
They've used every trick in the book on him
He's starting to talk
You're going to have to do it in the morning
Maguire lights a cigarette
Fergus looks at him and nods
You  about that
'm a volunteer, am n't
Good
was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days
Not the only one -- 27
Shut up, Jude
You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus
Peter
What
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- You're crazy
Don't let him, Peter
Shut the fuck up, Jude
He turns back to Fergus
He puts his arm on Fergus's shoulder
Why do you want to do that for
Would make me feel better about it
You sure about that
'm sure
Okay
You're a good man, Fergus
Fergus leaves
-
Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody
Jody begins to laugh under the hood
It turns into the sound of crying
Don't
'm sorry
28
The crying stops
Help me
How can
don't know
Just help me
Give me a cigarette
Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke
Don't even smoke, you know that
It just seemed the right thing to do
Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips
Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth
Go to sleep now
don't want to sleep
Tell me something
What
story
Like the one about the frog
And the scorpion
No
Tell me anything
When  was a child
Yeah
thought as a child
But when  became a man  put away childish things
What does that mean
29
Nothing
Tell me something, anything
Fergus is silent; his eyes wet
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus
Me
No, 'm not good for much
-
The farmhouse covered in mist
The sun coming through it
-
Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the chamber of his gun
Fergus has a gun in his hand
He checks the chamber
Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his back, by the elbow
Stand up, now -- Jody rises
Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire
wish to say on behalf of the Irish Republican Army -- Fergus turns with sudden fierceness
Leave him be -- He pulls Jody through the fields
-
Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his back
Take the hood off, Fergus -- No
30
want to see a bit
Please, please
Don't make me die like an animal
Fergus pulls the hood off
Jody looks around him
He has a cut lip where Jude struck him
Fergus prods him on with the gun
Jody stumbles forward
Fergus is all cold and businesslike
'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus
Why
Cause you're my friend
And  want you to go to the Metro -- Stop that talk now -- Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus
The fastest
Faster than cricket
Cricket's in the halfpenny place
So if  ran now, there's no way 'd beat you, is there
You won't run
But if  did
you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare
Fergus screams in fury after him
31
Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs
You stupid bastard -- What you say, faster
said you bastard -- stop -- Got to catch me first -- Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him
He laughs in exhilaration
Fergus pants behind him, wheezing, almost laughing
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called
Hurling -- What
Hurling -- Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him
Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit more wind -- Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on him again
Bit of fun, Fergus, eh
And suddenly the trees give way
Jody turns, laughing, to Fergus
Told you  was fast -- Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody 32
Don't do it
And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits Jody with the full of its fender
His body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him
Fergus, screaming, "No-
" He almost moves forward, then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body
Fergus turns and runs
- Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as he runs
- Tinker sitting in the greenhouse
helicopter screams into view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it, shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits
- Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the masonry, tearing the walls apart
Maguire, Jude, and the others on the floor, scrambling for weapons
- Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging branches till eventually he is hidden from sight
-
forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields
An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car appears; and Fergus gets out of it
Fergus
You're back in the pink, Tommy
How're you keeping
- The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup
33
You'll notice 've asked you nothing
That's wise, Tommy
All right, then
like to be wise
He pours Fergus more whiskey
So what do you need, Fergus
Need to go across the water
Do you now
Need to lose myself awhile
Aha
He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette
He puffs
There's a man  know ships cattle to London
-
The ferry, churning into the sunset
- into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust
figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer
It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust
He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall
He works furiously and relentlessly, like a machine
We see the wall, with the hammer striking it
One brick falls away, then another
Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole
34
Fergus's face, as he works
The hole
More bricks falling away
Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green
Fergus's face, working
His rhythm slows
The hole
More bricks fall away
Then the hammer stops
The dust begins to clear
His face
The jagged hole
The dust drifts across it, revealing a cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the green
- Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters through a white door
- Fergus dressing
He puts on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city
He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls
He flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil
He puts it in the pocket of his suit
- Fergus walking down a street looking for an address
Some distance down the street is a sign -- ' - Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the window
He has the picture in his hand
We see Dil from his point of view, then Fergus walks inside
- Fergus enters
The door gives a loud ping
We're closing
'll see you tomorrow, Dil She leaves the salon
You want something in particular
35
Just a bit of a trim
Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette
Come on
She gestures toward a chair
Fergus sits down
She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair
She pushes his head back into a basin behind him
She begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo
Someone recommend you
In a way
Who
Guy  work with
What's his name
Fergus can't think of an answer
The hands with the purple nails run over his scalp
Doesn't the water get to your nails
What's it to you
Nothing
Fergus, sitting up
She begins to cut
You American
No
Not English
36
No
Scottish
How'd you guess
The accent,  suppose
And what's it like
Like treacle
She imitates his accent saying it
Fergus laughs
Nice laugh
Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back
He looks like a young London stockbroker
The hair salon around them is empty
That should make her happy
Who's she
Don't know
Who is she
-
Fergus emerges from the shop
He takes one last look through the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her hair, etc
It is as if she has forgotten all about him
He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway
The doorway of the shop
Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside
She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro
Fergus follows
37
-
Half full, with an after-work crowd
Dil makes her way through it
Hi, Dil Hiya, hon
She sits down at the bar
Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat
What'll it be
bottle of Guinness
Dil, looking at Fergus
See that, Col
See what, Dil
He gave me a look
Did he
Fergus blushes
He buries himself in his drink
Just cut his hair, you know
Yeah
What you think
Nice
Fergus throws his eyes toward her again
She has her face turned away, but sees him in the mirror
There, he did it again
38
Saw that one
What would you call it
Now, that was a look
She eyes Fergus in the mirror
Ask him to ask me what 'm drinking
The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus
She wants to know do you want to know what she's drinking
Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up
margarita
The barman mixes it
She stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes
The barman hands her the drink
Now he can look
Ask him does he like his hair, Col
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair
Tell her 'm very happy with it
He's Scottish, Col
Scottish
Yeah
What'd he say, Col
39
He agreed that he was
What do you think his name is
've no thoughts on the subject
Jimmy
Jimmy
That's what he said
Jimmy
Hi, Jimmy
Hiya, Dil burly man sits down beside her
He puts his hand on her knee
Sing the song, Dil -- She slaps the hand away
Fuck off, Dave
'mon, babe
You know what  like
Easy
She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty
-
Fergus, standing across the road from the pub
He is sweating
Dil comes out of the pub
She looks this way and that, as if searching for Fergus
Fergus stands back into a shadow
Dave, the burly man, comes out
He grabs her by the elbow
She shrugs him off
She walks off
Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again
The sense of an old argument
Dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm
40
She leans her head against a wall
Dave then puts his arms around her, consoles her
-
Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm
The street is dilapidated, full of squats
They stop outside a door
Dil opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk inside
Fergus stands there, observing
light comes on in an upstairs room
Dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her
He begins to remove her blouse
She stands absolutely still as he does so
Fergus backs away, then walks off
-
Fergus, in bed
Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera
He releases the ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily
- Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball
He imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer
Then a voice interrupts him
So Pat's a cricket fan, eh
Fergus turns
We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is
Beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman
It's not Pat
It's Jim
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck
Long as you remember you're not at Lords
Fergus resumes work
-
It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap colored bulbs are flashing around it
41
From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night
He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar
Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil
Col, the barman, sees him and smiles
So can we consider you a regular, sir
Is that good or bad
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col
Things like that
Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese umbrellas toward him
So let's call this the usual
Thanks
Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts
No, no
It's on me
Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place
He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way
Take it out, if you want
Fergus takes out the umbrella
He holds it in one hand and drinks with the other
You came to see her, didn't you
Fergus shrugs
He takes out a cigarette
guy in leather to his left smiles at him
Something  should tell you
She's -- 42
She's what
The barman looks up toward the stage
She's on
hand presses a button
The needle selects a disk
song by Dave Berry, "The Crying Game
" Fergus looks up
Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music
We see Dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly
She seems a little drunk
She mimes to the song
She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing
She does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands
The crowd seems to know this act
They cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure
Fergus watching
Dil singing, noticing him
She comes to the end of the song
The crowd cheers
Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him
He's still looking, Col
Persistent
Good thing in a man
An excellent quality
Maybe he wants something
would expect he does
43
Ask him
Ask him yourself
She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him
So tell me
Fergus says nothing
He shrugs
Everybody wants something
Not me
Not you
How quaint
How old-fashioned and quaint
Isn't it, Col
Col shrugs
You old-fashioned
Must be
The burly man comes up to her
Got the money, Dil
Fuck off, Dave
You fucking promised
Did
You fucking did
He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink
Didn't you
Well, come on
44
He drags her through the crowd
In the mirror, Fergus watches them go
The barman eyes him
It takes all types
So who's he
He's what she should run a mile from
Then why doesn't she
Who knows the secrets of the human heart
Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door
-
Fergus comes out
black bouncer is there, but there is no sign of Dil
He walks a few yards and hears voices down an alley
He looks up it
P0V -
We see Dil pushing Dave away
He grabs her, turns her roughly
Don't be like that -- You heard me -- She beats his arms away
Money falls on the ground
She staggers away from him
He picks up the money, then runs after her
Got very fucking grand, haven't we -- He tries to pull her back
Talk to me, you stupid bitch -- They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch
She smiles
45
Hi
Hi
You forgot your bag
He holds it up to show her
Thank you
Who the fuck is he
Jimmy
It's him, isn't it
Maybe
Dave eyes Fergus
Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on the ground
See, they get the wrong idea
(from the ground) Cunt
Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck
What was that
They all get the wrong idea
Cunt
Scrag-eyed dyke cunt
Charming
Dave grabs for her ankle
She kicks his hand away
Fergus presses down his foot
He looks to Dil
What'll  do
46
Break his neck
Fergus presses his foot
No, don't
She bends low to Dave
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David
Then you're to go home, like a good boy
You hear me
Cunt
But his voice is softer
Fergus removes his foot
Dil grabs his arm
Come on, honey
She draws him away
-
They walk out of the alley
You all right
Yes, thank you
What was that all about
He wants me to perform for him
Perform
You know
You on the game
God no
'm a hairdresser
47
Fergus looks back
Dave is rising
He's getting up
You can't leave me then, can you
' Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs
You want me to ask you in, right
No,  didn't -- But 'm not cheap, you know that
Loud, but never cheap
There is a movement lower down the staircase
We see Dave, holding his neck
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt
Dil leans close to Fergus
If you kissed me, it would really get his goat
She tilts up her face
Fergus kisses her, tenderly
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane
Where
Half-five
At Millie's
She goes in and closes the door
Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave
- Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus
48
Give me that look again
What look
The one you gave me in the Metro
Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back
She holds them, with theatrical feeling
Darling, you shouldn't have
She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way
The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain, and they all clap
What's that about
They're jealous
Why
wonder
She takes his arm and walks off with him
-
Fergus and Dil looking at their menus
waiter places drinks on their table, then leaves
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it
Like what
Make a pass or something
Isn't that the way it goes
Must be
49
-
They are walking in an alleyway toward her house
You got a special friend, Jimmy
How special
You want one
And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights on
Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it
Jesus Christ
Jesus
The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches off
That Dave
The things a girl has to put up with
She looks down toward where the car has pulled away
'm frightened, Jimmy
That's not like him
'
car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus
Piss off, Dave
Tough guy, huh
Are you going to be all right on your own
'm not on my own, am
She touches his cheek
50
Come on up, would you
'  -
Dil comes in in the darkness
Fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway
The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat
Won't hurt you to come in
Fergus enters slowly
He looks around the room; there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it
Would you like a drink
Yes, please
What'll it be
Whiskey
She goes into a small kitchen
Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody
The camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face
Then into Fergus's face
His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's
She comes through with two drinks
Someone out there
Jesus fucking Christ
She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in a neck brace
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss -- It's Dave
She goes back into the room and begins taking things up
Talk to me, Dil -- 51
Sure, Dave -- Please, Dil -- She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a suitcase, a teddy bear
Take your clothes
Don't throw my clothes out the window
Fuck off back to Essex
Fucking mad
Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms
Don't chuck my clothes out
Take your fucking goldfish, too
Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down
The bowl breaks to bits on the pavement
Goldfish thrash around in the street
You fucking bitch
He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands
Murderer
Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut
Sorry
How'd he drive with his neck in a brace
Must be in love to manage that
Doesn't know the meaning of the word
52
Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass
He lived here with you
Tried to
Sit down, will you
Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down
He looks from her to the picture
What about him
He nods toward the picture
She looks down into her drink
He was different
How different
As different as it's possible to be
Tell me about him
No
Shouldn't  go
Yes
And they fall into one another's arms
She stretches up with her whole body over him
They grow suddenly and violently passionate
They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor
The photograph above them seems to smile
He draws up her dress with his hands
She suddenly pulls away
No -- Did you do that to him
She comes up toward him once more
She puts her mouth close to his ear
53
You want to know how  kissed him
Yes
Are you jealous of him
Maybe
That's good
She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest
Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants
She kisses his stomach; her mouth moves down his body
Fergus stares at the picture of Jody
Jody's eyes seem to burn through him
Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth
There are tears in his eyes
What would he think
Can't think
He's dead
In Ireland
He was a soldier
Went there like a fool
She sits in front of the mirror
Do you miss him
What do you think
think you do
(dreamily) You say that like a gentleman
Do
Like you're concerned
Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair from her face
54
But you can t stay, you know that
Didn't think  could
real gentleman
She embraces him
Shouldn't you be in mourning
am
She sits back down in front of the mirror
Fergus leaves
She reapplies her lipstick
-
Singer in a blue dress
Dil and Fergus by the bar
Both drinking drinks with umbrellas
Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace
Look, 'm sorry
Fuck off, Dave
No,  won't fucking fuck off
Said 'm sorry, didn't
Yeah
heard
You hear, Jimmy
Fergus nods
He stands
Dave steps two feet back
was only going to ask her for a dance
Fergus takes Dil's arm
Shall we
The woman is singing
As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly
Dil holds her cheek close to his
55
Did he come here too
Is this an obsession of yours
Maybe
He did sometimes
Did he dance with you
Dil doesn't answer
Looks at him out of the corner of her eye
So what do you want with me, Jimmy
Want to look after you
What does that mean
Something  heard someone say once
She draws back and looks at him
You mean that
Yeah
She dances closer
Why
If  told you, you wouldn't believe me
In the bar, people singing along with the music
Col sings
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking
You're not having me on, are you
'Cause Dil can't stand that
56
No
She puts her cheek against his
Dave, at the bar, slams his drink down
And she does get very upset
Dave stands up to leave
On the stage the act finishes
Dil draws Fergus back to the bar
Col, the barman, pours her drink
One for him, too
Col pours and smiles
Drink
What is this
'm superstitious
Drink
He drinks
He grimaces
She throws it back in one
Can't leave me now
Aha
The thing is, can you go the distance
Depends what it is
No, depends on nothing
She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses
She slams it back
He sips
In one
57
She tilts his glass back
He swallows it in one
'  -
She enters; Fergus walks in slowly
He looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs
What you thinking of, hon
'm thinking of your man
Why
'm wondering why you keep his things
Told you, 'm superstitious
She turns toward him and undoes her hair
It falls around her shoulders
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful
All the time
Fergus runs his hand down her throat
Even now
No
He looks after me
He's a gentleman too
She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down
They kiss passionately
Give me one minute
She walks into the bathroom
Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water
She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono
She looks extraordinarily beautiful
58
He reaches out his hand and grasps hers
He draws her toward him
He begins to kiss her face and neck
Would he have minded
She murmurs no
His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders
, traveling down her neck, in the darkness
Then the hands stop
The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper
The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man
Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her
You did know, didn't you
Fergus says nothing
Oh my God
She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him
Fergus smacks the hand away
Jesus
feel sick -- He gets up and runs to the bathroom
She grabs his feet
Don't go, Jimmy -- He kicks her away
He runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub
She crouches on the floor
'm sorry
thought you knew
He retches again
What were you doing in the bar if you didn't know -- 'm bleeding
She lights a cigarette
Fergus runs the taps
He washes his face, rinses his mouth
59
It's all right, Jimmy
can take it
Just not on the face
Fergus slams the door shut
She is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman trace of blood on her mouth
'see, 'm not a young thing any longer
Funny the way things go
Don't you find that, Jimmy
Never the way you expected
Fergus comes out of the bathroom
'm sorry
She looks up
Some hope in her face
You mean that
And he makes to go
She grabs him to stop him
Don't go like that
Say something
He pulls away from her
She falls to the floor
Jesus
He drags himself away and runs down the stairs
' Fergus in bed
Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand
-
The place is hopping
Fergus enters
He now sees it as he should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar
He makes his way through the crowds
All the women too- heavily made-up
Some beautifully sleek young things he looks at he realizes are young men
He makes his way to the bar where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it
Her face is bruised
She is wearing dark glasses
As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror
She talks to Col the barman
60
He's back, Col Hi
Don't want any of those looks, Col
They don't mean much
Stop it, Dil -- No
Tell him to go fuck himself
Fergus sits
Col turns to him
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself
'm sorry
There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark glasses
Tell him to stop messing Dil around -- Dil -- Tell him it hurt -- have to talk to her, Col -- Says he's got to talk to you -- Fergus touches her arm
Come on, Dil -- Where
She whips her arm away
61
Tell him again, Col
Go fuck himself -- She walks into the crowd, toward the door
Fergus leaves
-
Fergus, walking outside Dil's place
The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside
We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette
We hear the song "The Crying Game
" Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and sticks it in the letter box
- man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine
Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working
- Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall
On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window
Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels
As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out
Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out
He sees Dil moving toward the site
He drops the window and the glass shatters
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up
We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus
How much did that frame cost, Mr
Franknum
Two hundred quid, Mr
Deveroux
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid
Sorry
62
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr
Franknum
Not in my experience
Off his wages
Do you mean that
He wants to know do  mean that
'm sure you do, Mr
Deveroux
Bloody right  do
Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing
He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift
The laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc
She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him
Is that his tart
Does Pat have a tart
She's not a tart
No, of course not, she's a lady
She's not that either
Fergus walks out of the room
Fergus walks round the scaffolding
Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks and opens the hamper
Darling -- She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife
She is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face
She pecks him on the cheek
63
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say
What you doing here
Got your note
So let's kiss and make up, hon
Don't call me that
Sorry, darling
Give it over, Dil -- Apologies, my sweet
Fergus smiles in spite of himself
That's more like it, dear
Have a cuppa
She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea
You're something else, Dil, you know that
Never said a truer word
She hands him a neatly cut sandwich
See,  was always best looking after someone
Must be something in the genes
Must be
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly
And even when you were throwing up,  could tell you cared
64
You could
Do you care, Jimmy
Sure  do
You mean that
Yeah
care, Dil
She lowers her head
You crying, Dil
He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes
'm tired and emotional
Then he hears a voice behind him
Do it on your own time, Paddy
What
Whatever it is she does for you
Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux
If  was her 'd consider that an insult
Consider it how you like
Just get that bloody tart out of here
Fergus stands up suddenly
He speaks quietly
Did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers
Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled
65
What's that supposed to mean
It's a simple question
Deveroux says nothing
Fergus looks down to Dil
Come on, dear
He holds out his arm
Dil gathers up her things and takes it
Her face is wreathed in a smile
He didn't answer, honey -- Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp
Sorry about that, Mr
Deveroux
Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant
Shut up
Made me feel all funny inside
said stop it
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy
You think that's wise
Nothing's wise
The lift stops with a thud
didn't mean to hit you
know that
66
Kind of liked you as a girl
That's a start
So 'm sorry
Make it up to me, then
How
Ask to meet me again
Will you meet me again
When
Whenever
Tonight
She leans forward and kisses him
Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him
He watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site
-
Fergus, outside the hair salon
Dil, inside, is throwing off her smock and walking toward him
All the girls are smiling
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach
Do they know
Know what, honey
Know what  didn't know
And don't call me that
Can't help it, Jimmy
girl has her feelings
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl
67
Details, baby, details
So they do know
All right, they do
She takes his arm as they walk off
Don't
Sorry
should have known, shouldn't
Probably
Kind of wish  didn't
You can always pretend
That's true
Your soldier knew, didn't he
Absolutely
Won't be quite the same though, will it
Are you pretending yet
'm working on it
Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look
There's Dave
He knew too
Stop it, Jimmy
68
Am  becoming repetitious
little
Sorry
They reach her door
The car stops
Don't ask me in
Please, Jimmy
No
Can't pretend that much
miss you, Jimmy
Should have stayed a girl
Don't be cruel
Okay
Be a good girl and go inside
Only if you kiss me
Fergus kisses her
He looks at her open lips as if in disbelief at himself
Happy now
Delirious
She goes inside
-
Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light
Then he hears a voice
Hello, stranger
69
He sees Jude sitting in the corner
Her hair is now dark brown
You vanished
He stares at her, says nothing
What was it, Fergus
Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up
Leave me alone, Jude
No
That's the last thing 'll do
You never asked what happened
heard
Eddie and Tinker died
know
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth
No thanks to you
What you think of the hair
Suits you
She walks round the room
Aye,  was sick of being blond
Needed a tougher look, if you know what  mean
She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch
Fuck me, Fergus
He takes her hand away
Am  to take it that's a no
70
He says nothing
We had a court-martial in your absence
They wanted to put a bullet in your head
pleaded for clemency
Said we should find out what happened first
So what did happen
He ran
couldn't shoot him in the back
tried to catch him
He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen
So you did fuck up
Yes
But you know what the thing is, Fergus
No, what is the thing
You vanished quite effectively
Became Mister Nobody
And you've no idea how useful that could be
What do you mean
We've got some plans here
And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them
No way, Jude
'm out
You're never out, Fergus
She looks at him hard
He looks away
Maybe you don't care whether you die or not
But consider the girl, Fergus
The wee black chick
He leaps up from the bed
71
Leave her out of this
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche
You know we won't leave her out of this
But 'm glad to see you care
She brings her lips close to his so they touch
And  must admit 'm curious
He grabs her hair and pulls her head back
What the fuck do you know, Jude
She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth
You fucking tell me, boy -- Fergus stares at her
Then says quietly: She's nobody
She likes me
So  suppose a fuck is out of the question
Keep your head down, Fergus
No sudden moves
And not a whisper to her
You'll be hearing from us
She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple
Keep the faith
She goes
Fergus stands in the darkness
-
Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand
He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back
Then the chair turns and we see it is Jude
Fergus freezes
He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil 72
-
He your boyfriend
Jude, turning in the chair
Lucky you
-
Carnations
What
He'd bring me carnations
So  got it wrong, then
Not at all, honey
Don't
Okay
She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus
He turns and sees Jude is there
Fergus stands, suddenly
He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog- marches her out
Come on
Why, honey -- Come on
You gonna tell me why
No
73
As they pass Jude, she smiles
-
Outside the restaurant
Fergus marches Dil away
What's wrong, Jimmy
Tell me what's wrong -- Not here
They pass out of shot
In the background we see Jude rising
-
Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar
You gonna tell me what it is
figure sitting down at the bar
It is Jude
What was it
You know her, Jimmy
Jimmy, is it
Do you know me, Jimmy
Dil, this is Jude
You following me
Yeah
Just checking
He being nice to you, Dil
Ever so nice
Aren't you, Jimmy
That's good
'm glad
Young love, as they say
Absolutely
The younger the better
Doesn't come your way much,  suppose
74
Don't go looking for it, Dil
Well, maybe you'll get lucky
Someday
bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy
girl has to have a bit of glamour
Absolutely
Long as she can keep it
Isn't that right, James
She leaves
Dil watches her go
It's her, isn't it
What's her
She's the thing you had to tell me
Kind of
'm sorry, you know that
'm really sorry
She looks at Col You see that, Col
Saw it, Dil
Fuck it, is what  say
Yeah
Fuck it, Dil
Fucking men, Col -- 75
Fuck 'em
There are tears in her eyes
She stands
And fuck you, Jimmy -- She staggers out of the pub
Fergus sits there
There is an expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very small
You could always make it up to her
How
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed
She's not a girl, Col -- Whatever you say
But Fergus rises and walks out
-
figure standing down the alleyway, smoking
Fergus looks toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting
She went that way -- Jude grabs his arm
But you come with me
She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting
They get inside
-
Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting in the car
76
-
In the moving car
Jude is driving, Maguire next to her
Fergus sits in the back
So it was you all the time
Who'd you think it was
thought it was Dave
And who's Dave when he's at home
He's at home
Should blow you away, you know that
know that
Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks him on the teeth with his closed fist
'm getting emotional
And  don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy
understand
Fuck you, too -- Jude drives
Fergus looks through the back window at the street outside
Leave him alone, Peter
He's in love
That true, Fergus
You in love
Absolutely
77
And what's she like between the sheets
Definitely unusual
And who is she
Just a girl
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you
Aye,  do, Peter
Good
-
The car draws to a halt in a sedate square
Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club
In the car, Maguire turns off the engine
He nods toward the building
So what do you think that is, Hennessy
hotel
It's a knocking-shop
Tres discreet, huh
He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings
His security's in the car beyond
He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away
Fergus looks from the window to the car
Who is he
Doesn't matter who he is
He is what we would call a legitimate target
78
Thank God for that
You being cynical, Hennessy
Hope not
Good
So what do you think
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good
And  presume you can't get in
Right
So it's on the street
Right
Kind of suicide, isn't it
Jude turns around to look at him
But, then,  don't have a choice
Och, you do, Fergie
Of course
forgot
Come on, Fergie
rehearsal
Jude and Fergus get out of the car
They walk down the street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe- bar with some tables outside
-
Fergus and Jude, crossing the street
You keep your mind on the job, boy -- 79
And then you'll leave her out of it
Aye
Then we'll leave her be
They take their seats by the tables
We can see the brothel down the way
He's arthritic
Takes him two minutes to get to the door
She checks her watch
Fergus is sweating
And what if  say no
You know what
Go
Down by the brothel, the door swings open
Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens
Fergus quickens his pace
Jude, by the cafe, watches
Fergus, walking
The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car
burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent
Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door
The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow
Pardon me, young man -- Fergus walks on
Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off
When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back
80
Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches
You were made for this
Was
Perfect
And what happens then
We'll be on the other side
We'll move when you do
And what if you don't
Fergus,  think you don't trust me
You may be right
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and 'll bring you the gear
Jude begins to walk away
Jude
Yes
Who's the old geezer
Some judge
She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe
She goes inside; he follows
Why'd you follow me, Dil
81
Was jealous, Jimmy
She downs a drink and motions for another
She seems high
Shouldn't be, Dil Why shouldn't  be jealous
There are tears streaming down her face
He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face
Don't
My makeup
She sits down; he joins her
She own you, Jimmy
Yes
She from Scotland too
You could say that
And you're not going to tell me more
can't
He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more
What you doing, Jimmy
'm not sure
Do you like me even a little bit
More than that
Dil's face, staring at him
82
Come on, let's go for a walk
She allows herself to be led out
-
Dil and Fergus walking
Fergus stops her by the window
You do something for me, Dil
Anything
You'd do anything for me
Afraid so
You got the keys to the shop
They walk inside
-
Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness
You want another haircut, baby
No
Sit down
He sits her down in one of the chairs
You'd do anything for me
Dil nods
Anything
Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair
Her head leaps back
No way -- 83
You said anything, Dil girl has to draw the line somewhere -- Want to change you to a man, Dil
She stares at him
Why
It's a secret
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy
Yes
And you wouldn't leave me
No
You promise
promise
She takes a breath
Go on, then
Fergus begins to cut
-  DlL'  as her hair is shorn
Tears stream down her cheeks
You're no good at this, Jimmy
'm sorry
But he keeps cutting
He gives Dil a short, cropped military cut like Jody's
84
You want to make me look like him
No
Want to make you into something new
That nobody recognizes
She looks in the mirror at it in the dark
Don't recognize myself, Jimmy
'  -
Dil enters, with her new haircut
She goes to turn on the light
He stops her hand
No
She looks at her hand on his
Better in the dark
Her fingers close around his
So it's true, then
What
You like me better like this
Yes
She brings her lips to his neck
He lets them stay there
His hands travel up to her blouse
He begins to undo the buttons
Oh, Jimmy -- Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso
She falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt
No
No
Dil
get up
He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed
She stretches languorously down on it
85
He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off
She turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress
She is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt
Baby
But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are
Dil on the bed, slowly turns
What are you doing, honey
We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark
Don't call me that -- Sorry
What you doing
Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position
Try this on, Dil He wraps the shirt around her
Why
For me
For you
She kisses him
-
Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside
Why are we going here, Jimmy
Look on it like a honeymoon
86
-
From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed
Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette
Time lapse
The light gradually fills the room
Fergus wakes
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out
-
car pulls up at the site
Jude gets out
She has a satchel in her hand
-
Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude
You a handyman, Fergie
take pride in my work
sincerely hope so
Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag
Tools of the trade
She kisses him
Fergus looks at her expressionlessly
And forget about the girl
Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside
There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth
-
Fergus enters
The room is empty
He calls
Dil
No reply
He runs outside
87
'  -
Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat
The sound of feet behind him
He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand
He runs toward her
Dil
Dil
What the fuck are you doing here
'm going home
Told you to stay in the hotel
Thought you was fooling me
Thought you was leaving me
They are tussling in the darkness of the park
She is very drunk
had to go to work
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you
There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy
He takes her arm
Come on
No
'm going home
Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat
So tell me
was trying to get out of something
No
Tell me everything, Jimmy
Fergus looks at her
88
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil
You mean that
Yes
And she suddenly faints into his arms
As if on cue
Stop it, would you
There is no response
He shakes her
Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake -- Still no response
He grows alarmed
He slaps her cheek
She opens her eyes slowly
Sorry
get nervous
got this blood condition
Just help me inside, Jimmy, then 'll be all right
'  -
He walks in holding her
Leans her against the wall, then goes to the window to check the street outside
She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey
You heard what  said, Dil
My pills
She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom
What pills
Prescription
For my condition
What condition
89
My condition
Ennui
He goes and gets the pills
She takes a handful of pills
She drinks from the whiskey bottle
Are you supposed to take that many
Only in times of extreme stress
She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down
See, they all say good-bye sometime
'Cept for him
She looks at the picture of Jody
Then she looks at Fergus
Are you all right, Dil
will be
She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees
Go on, then
Fergus walks slowly toward the door
Good-bye, Dil Jimmy
What
Don't go like that
She looks at him, standing up
Something incredibly attractive about her
Can't help what  am
90
He walks slowly toward her
He kisses her, on the lips
We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face
Fergus looks from it to her
She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze
She reaches out her hand and strokes his
Knew you had a heart
Fergus sits down on the bed
Dil is lying back on it
Dil Can  tell you something
knew your man
You knew which man
Your soldier
You knew my Jody
She still strokes his hand
Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast
Held him hostage for three days
You knew my Jody
Are you listening
Dil smiles woozily
Yes
got the order to shoot him
Before could do it he ran
Ran into a tank and died
Died
Did you hear me
91
You killed my Jody
In a manner of speaking
It was you
She is not rational
She is smiling, far away somewhere
You should scream
You should beat my head off
She woozily tries to hit him round the face
You killed my Jody No
You didn't
suppose  tried
You tried
Don't you want to kill me
Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him
Bang
He strokes her cheek
She says very slowly and sleepily Don't leave me tonight
Might kill me, too
Okay
Her eyes close
She falls into a deep sleep
Fergus looks down at her, almost fondly
92
'  -
They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed
Dil wakes
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a chair
She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun
-
Jude in bed
An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off
'
Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed
She ties them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to wake him
-
Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready
'
She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties that securely to the upright
She ties the other and is drawing it upward when he wakes
She jerks the silk stocking so it is secure
What the fuck -- Dil speaks unnaturally quietly
So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy
-
Jude, fully dressed
She takes a gun from under the bed and slips it in her handbag
'  -
Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand
Didn't really listen last night
heard but  didn't listen
Fergus, staring at her
He tries to pull on the bindings
93
That won't do you no good
Dil knows how to tie a body
She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look
He asked me to see were you all right
- Jude on the street
Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she gets inside
'
See,  fix on anyone that's nice to me
Just the littlest bit nice and 'm yours
Stop it, Dil -- Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched
Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever
She looks at him, tears in her eyes
See,  should blow you away, Jimmy
But can't do that
Yet
Let me go, Dil He drags at his bindings
Why
Got to be somewhere
Try and go, then
94
- The figure of the judge in the window
Outline of a woman
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street
They look toward a paper seller
Where the fuck is he
Christ -- '
Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here Let them come then
Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around once more -- He drives off
'
Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted
Just want your company for a little while longer
- Maguire's car driving round once more
No sign of Fergus
That fucker's dead -- No, we are
'
Fergus strains and roars from the bed
You don't know what you're doing, Dil -- 95
Never did
'    -- the brothel door opening
The elderly judge comes out
The car with his security men guns up
Give me the shooter, Jude -- You're crazy -- Give me the fucking shooter
He grabs it from her pocket
Throws open the door and runs across the street
Jude dives into the driver's seat
'
Fergus, pulling at his bindings
The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open by his goon
Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand
The goon sees him
Maguire shoots as he runs
Once, twice, three times, four
The judge falls
The goon, hit in the arm, pulls an Uzi and returns fire
Maguire hit, still shooting
Other goons tear from the car
Mayhem, screaming
Jude hits the pedal on her car and screeches off
Maguire, dead
'  - Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes
She looks like a sweet little boy
She places a cassette in the tape deck -- "The Crying Game" song
She comes to the bed, and points the gun at Fergus's head
You like me now, Jimmy
like you, Dil -- Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more
More what
96
More endearments
like you, DIl Love me
Yes
Tell me you love me
Whatever you say, Dil
Then say it
Love you, Dil
You do
Yeah
What would you do for me
Anything
She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest
Say it again
'd do anything for you, Dil
She pulls on his bindings to release him
Two police cars, sirens wailing
97
'
Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound his hands are nearly undone
And you'll never leave me
Never
know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it
His arm is free
He strokes her hair
'm sorry, Dil
She shudders with weeping
The music of the song plays in the background
Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a gun
You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough
But twice
Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude
You didn't knock, honey -- Dil fires, hits Jude
Jude falls and is writhing on the floor
Dil
Get that thing off me, Fergus -- Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude
What was that she called you, Jimmy
Fergus
98
What's Fergus
It's my name, Dil -- What happened to Jimmy
said get it off me, Fergus -- Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun
Manages to grab it
What's she going to do, Jimmy
She going to blow you away
Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy
She hits Jude in her gun shoulder
Jude spins one way, the gun the other
Was she there too
When you got my Jody
Fergus screams Dil
asked you a question, honey -- were you there too -- You sick bitch -- As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying: You was there, wasn't you
You used those tits and that ass to get him, didn't you
Fergus screams from the bed
He rips free his other arm
Dil shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in blood
Dil turns the gun on Fergus
She was there, wasn't she
99
She was -- And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she
Yes
Tell me what she wore
Can't remember
Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger
Then she stops
Can't do it, Jimmy
He won't let me
She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front of it
You won't let me, Jody -- She raises the gun and places it in her mouth
Fergus takes it gently from her mouth and places it on the table
He lifts her up by the shoulders
You've got to go now, Dil -- Do
Yes
Now
Am  in trouble, Jimmy
Not if you go
Will  see you again
You will, Dil 100
Promise
promise
Where am  to go, Jimmy
The Metro
Meet Col -- Yes
Say hello to Col -- He leads her out the door
Fergus goes back into the room, past Jude's body
Looks out the window to where he can see Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have gathered
The wail of police sirens coming closer
He watches Dil run off, with her funny walk
Then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house
He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove Dil's fingerprints
He turns to the picture of the soldier; talks to it
You should have stayed at home
He sits in the chair by the window, waiting
- to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in the windows
Large barred doors open and a group of women come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc
Among them is Dil, looking resplendent
She walks past the rows of convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where Fergus sits, waiting
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon -- Don't call me that -- 101
Sorry, love
Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement -- Stop it, Dil -- 've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy
'm counting the days
Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left
Thirty-five
'm sorry, darling
keep forgetting the leap year
What am  supposed to call you then, Jimmy
Fergus
Fergus
Fergus my love, light of my life - Please, Dil -- Can't help it
You're doing time for me
No greater love, as the man says
Wish you'd tell me why
As the man said, it's in my nature
What's that supposed to mean
She shakes her head
Well, there was this scorpion, you see
And he wants to go across the river
But he can't swim
So he goes to this frog, who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse me, Mr
Froggy
" 102
, and as Fergus tells the story of the scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your Man
