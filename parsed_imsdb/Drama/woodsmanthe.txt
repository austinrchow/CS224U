(0
) So
How are you adjusting
'm adjusting okay
(
) And your new apartment
Apartment's okay
(
) Are you taking your medication
It gives me headaches
(
) But you are taking it
Yeah
Across from Walter, sits , young, awkward and clearly new to the profession, jotting something down in a notepad
Good
'll talk to your physician about the headaches
Maybe he can change the prescription
Walter doesn't say anything
(cont'd) And how's your job
The job's okay
() 6
: Do  take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there
said the job is okay
(smiling) That's right, you did
pause) Have you made any friends there
'm not running for Mr
Popularity
(pause) You seem a little hostile today
That was a joke
Rosen jots something on his notepad
Walter reaches over and taps on the notebook
(cont'd) It's called sarcasm, Dr
Rosen
No need to call me doctor
'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist
It's all the same
Rosen looks at Walter for a long moment
Walter avoids his gaze
Walter, 'd like you to try something for me
What
() 7
: (2) 'd like you to keep a journal
diary
That's right
No way
Why not
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison
don't understand
Ev-i-dence
Oh
It never crossed my mind
Of course
It was just an idea
Bad idea
thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
Reflect
That's right
() 8
: (3) You think reflection is good
It's very good, indeed
How's that
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life
We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals
Walter looks at him flatly
You read that in a book
Rosen blushes
Try it
No fucking way
Then think about it
Walter is silent

The pharmacist looks at the prescription
He glances at Walter then goes over to a   working in the back area
She reads the prescription, glances at Walter over her bifocals, then back at the prescription
Walter has not missed any of this
There a problem
problem
middle-aged shopper talking on her cell phone nearby looks over and pauses in her conversation
Can you read the prescription
Yes
Can you fill the prescription
Yes
Then  suggest one of you move your ass, because if  don't get my medication  get extremely violent
The male pharmacist scrambles to fill the prescription
The shopper gasps
Walter looks at her and smiles
The shopper stuffs her items in her cart and quickly leaves
Walter stifles his grin
10
'  - Walter opens the door to his apartment, carrying a grocery bag
As he flips on the lights, a metal object is thrown across the room
He catches it with one hand
It's a can of beer
man laughs
(
) You still think fast
Carlos sits at the table with a six-pack
Walter sets the bag on the table and pops open the can
Don't need to think fast to handle beer
ook some talking to convince your super  was a relative
told her all my relatives are good-looking
Carlos laughs
Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see you
Carlos stands and they awkwardly embrace
(cont'd) You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger
There is silence
Carlos sits back down at the table and opens another beer
Walter starts unpacking the groceries
() 11
: You doing okay
Got a job at old Frank's place
His son runs it now
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious
Yeah, you still with Northland
(grins) Foreman now
No shit
Five years
Beautiful
How's business
Booming
Lots of building going on
We can't keep up with all the work
In fact,  just hired a few new guys
Glancing at Walter, he realizes his blunder
(cont'd) Just until we catch up
There is a brief silence as both men drink
Carlos looks at Walter
(cont'd) 'll never forget you got me started there
() 12
: (2) just recommended you
You still had to prove yourself
Carlos gets up and walks over to the window
He gazes outside
Hey, is that a school
through sixth
Carlos glances at Walter, then back outside
Living across the street from a grade school
Jesus
Something wrong with that
was just thinking of
the noise
like the noise
Walter walks over to the window
(cont'd) One hundred and twenty feet
What
Law says  can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate
figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty
Make a bet
No way, man, you'd rob me blind
() 13
: (3) The two men laugh, but the laughter quickly fades
(cont'd) But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school
(heated) You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and 'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood
arlos shrugs and tosses down the rest of his beer
should go
Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells
How is she
Annette
She's good
tense
When can  see her
'm working on it
Is it because of Anna
don't know
She won't talk about it
(pause) You're the only one in the family who still talks to me
() 14
: (4) remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married
" Except her brother
You treated me with respect
pause) Look, you paid your dues
Your slate is clean now
How old is Anna
She'll be twelve next week
We're throwing a big party on Saturday
Wish  could ask you to come
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet
Carlos looks away
(cont'd) Sorry, bad joke
They stiffly embrace
Then Carlos exits leaving Walter alone
- on a man's feet slowly walking heel to toe
The ground is covered in frost
to reveal Walter counting his footsteps as he walks towards the school across from his apartment building
The schoolyard is empty
One hundred and ten, one hundred and eleven, one hundred and twelve

Walter looks up to see a hawk circling above
He watches for a moment then continues walking

: (cont'd) One hundred and thirteen, one hundred and fourteen, one hundred and fifteen
He reaches the school entrance and touches it
(cont'd) One hundred and twenty
Walter looks at the hawk still circling above and hollers -- (cont'd) How about that
Slowly the  of children fades in and a red ball bounces to Walter's feet
He looks in the direction the ball came from
Nothing is there
Walter looks back down at his feet
The ball is gone
The sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a rhythmic squeak
Walter looks towards the playground where an empty swing sways back and forth in the wind, the chain squeaking in its hinges
he hawk's cry pierces the silence
Walter looks up to see the hawk being chased by two smaller birds

After a moment, she steals a glance up at Walter
Across the way, Mary-Kay watches Walter as he sits down to the table neighboring Vicki's
() 17
: Bob sits down across from Mary-Kay with a tray of food and a newspaper
He opens the paper and starts to read
- So, what'd he do
What did who do

There's something wrong with this picture

(pause) How was the party
What party
The birthday party
Oh,   Anna's
It was great, man
Anna was   so pretty
getting excited) She   looked like a princess, like one   of those girls in a fairy tale, you   know, like Snow White
Walter looks at Carlos
(cont'd) 've got some pictures
(reaching for his back pocket) ant to see
No thanks
Ah, come on
(snapping) don't want to see any goddamn pictures
Carlos backs off
They're just photos  took of the party
() 42
: (3) Walter is silent and avoids Carlos's gaze
Carlos gives Walter a look, then heads to the door
Carlos
(Carlos turns) want to see my sister and Anna in person
Okay
Carlos nods
Yeah, man,  understand
He exits
Walter walks over to the table and slowly runs his hand along the surface
'  - Walter sits across from Rosen
How do you feel about that
don't feel anything
You have no feelings for your niece
She was born after they put me away
How can  have feelings
Then why are you talking about this
Have to talk about something
What are you afraid will happen
() 43
: 'm not afraid
'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns
'm not that crazy
Do you think you're crazy
If 'm not, then what the hell am doing here
Why do you think you're here
You know why
It's part of the parole deal
Is that what you are angry about
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round
That is a marvelous image, Walter
Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around
Walter looks at Rosen
How long is this going to take
() 44
: (2) (checking the clock) We have a few more minutes
mean, when will  be normal
(pause) We have a lot of work to do
(speaking slowly) Will  ever be normal
couldn't say
You couldn't say
'm afraid not
Do you know what "normal" is
suppose it's however society defines it
How do you define it
don't
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better
They usually tell me
How do they know
() 45
: (3) What is your idea of being normal
(mimicking Rosen) What is your idea of being a Jew
(controlled) Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you
looks at the clock) Why don't we continue this on Thursday
(exploding) want to be normal
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal
Fuck you, Rosen
know -- You don't know
know you're frustrated, Walter, but -- Walter gets up and slams out the door
osen looks at the empty chair
(cont'd) -- you really are making progress
'  - Walter sits at his window with his journal, watching outside
() 46
: Walter's : Candy leans against his car, patiently waiting
Something grabs Candy's attention, and Walter follows his gaze
Kids pour off a school bus
Candy waves to one - of ten or eleven
(
) So what should  do
Call the cops
he laughs) Yeah, that's pretty funny
he boy and a buddy run over to Candy
(
0
) (cont'd) But what if Candy seduces one to go for a ride
Candy smiles and offers Angel-face a candy bar, which the boy accepts
(
)(cont'd) Yeah, that's right
If the boy goes for a ride it's because he wants to go for a ride
The  rings
The other boy grabs Angel-face, and they run off to school
Walter rests his chin on his hands, watching
- icki closes her locker to see Walter standing at the end of the room in front of his locker
She looks away
Walter looks at her, closes his locker loudly, and walks brusquely past
- Vicki stands near a pile of wood chips, taking a cigarette break
() 47
: Walter approaches, pushing a cart full of wood chips
Vicki looks at him as if to say something, but Walter continues past, dumps the chips, and returns back inside
- Walter sits at a table across the room from Vicki
ary-Kay enters and sits down with Walter - Hi, Walter
How are you doing
Fine thanks
- You know, it's really a beautiful day out there, and  was thinking - Walter wipes his mouth and gets up
Excuse me
Got another load coming in
Walter exits
The smile fades from Mary-Kay's face
icki watches Walter leave
- Walter stands alone at the bus stop
icki gets in her Jeep and pauses before turning on the engine, watching Walter
He turns his back to the cold wind and her
Vicki turns on the car and pulls out of the lot, roaring by Walter without looking at him
'
- Vicki moves around her apartment, cigarette in one hand, spray bottle in the other, squirting her plants
() 48
: She prunes dead leaves from one of them, then pauses looking at the leaves in her hands
Don't die on me, you little shit
She aggressively squirts the little plant with water, then pauses, noticing her reflection in the window
She looks at herself long and hard
'
- There is a knock on the door
Walter walks through the room to the door, tucking in his shirt as he walks
He cracks the door
Vicki stands outside
Walter opens the door
You want to go for a ride
Walter looks at her
'  - Walter and Vicki drive without saying anything
Slowly the city-scape gives way to countryside
Walter looks over at Vicki
She stares ahead
- Walter and Vicki get out of the car which is parked on the edge of a reservoir surrounded by a thick pine forest
Vicki works her way down to the water's edge
Great Blue Heron skims across the water's surface
Walter watches her for a moment then follows
He sits down near her
icki lights a cigarette and stares out over the water
After a long pause
What was prison like
() 49
: (pause) ou don't really -- Yes
want to know
Walter is quiet for a moment
Prison is
time
Vicki looks at him
You mean the time you're locked away
No
Prison is time
That's it
You think time, you feel time, you hear time
Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats
time
'm sorry, Walter
(shrugs) Don't be sorry for me
did those things
No one else did
'm dealing with that
Vicki looks out at the water
My father took me fishing here when was a kid
He could name every fish in the lake
And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story
hated fishing, but  loved his stories
Sounds like a special guy
() 50
: (2) My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave
Walter looks at her
(cont'd) He said he couldn't help it
Said he hated himself for doing it
But, boy, did that man love to drink
here is a long pause
've changed
Why young girls, Walter
Walter is silent
(cont'd) Is it their innocence
Their beauty
(pause) Their power
They seduce me
They seduce you
was always the one seduced
You really believe that
(long pause) No
That's what  used to tell myself And what do you tell yourself now
() 51
: (3) Nothing
It's over
Bullshit
Walter looks at Vicki for a moment then stands up
Okay
Then take me home
Vicki doesn't move
(cont'd) What do you want from me
Vicki stands
want you to change my mind
Walter is silent
Vicki shoves Walter hard
(cont'd) Try, goddamnit
Walter stumbles back a few steps but regains himself
He stares at Vicki
His anger wells and he snaps
had this plan once
or maybe it was a dream
was going to quit the building business
open my own shop
Make and design fine country furniture
had saved enough money
found the perfect place
Cheap five-year-lease
The loan was in the bag
My wife was a hundred percent behind it
Everything was set
Then  got in trouble
pause) Do you know what the worst kind of trouble is
icki watches Walter, silent
() 52
: (4) (cont'd) It's trouble you bring on yourself
and the people you love the most
lost a wife and a daughter
It hurt to lose my wife
It killed me to lose my daughter
Walter stops, looks at Vicki
Vicki stares back at him
After a long pause, she approaches and tentatively pulls him into an embrace
Close up on computer screen displaying a web page for registered felons
The heading reads -"Sex Offenders: the more we know, the better
" "Stay informed
" Mock Police sirens and lights frame the heading
he listing of sex offenders scrolls down revealing photos, name, address, and crime details of man after man, in alphabetical order, page after page
The scrolling slows down, past "Mason," past all of the Mc's
, and stops on "Miles, Walter
" Convicted 1988 for sexual abuse of minors, five counts, released
It is the notification page that we saw created in the opening montage
Walter's photo stares back at us
e slowly pull back to reveal Mary-Kay at the computer
She clucks her tongue and shakes her head
'  - Vicki and Walter lie in bed, spooning, fully clothed
Vicki's back to Walter, he holds her close
gently) You know, this is crazy
What
Being here, with me
() 53
: know
(pause) Most people say the odds are against me
What odds
The percentages -- Vicki looks at him blankly
(cont'd) For men like me
They say most of us end up back
there
'm saying there are risks
seeing me
Well, most people are stupid
pause) You want to talk about odds
One day 'll tell you how  survived as the youngest in a family of three sons
You wanna talk about odds
Why not tell me now
Long pause
Vicki lights a cigarette
got poked around
here and there
Which brother did this
All three -- in chronological order
() 54
: (2) You must hate your brothers
love my brothers
No you don't
love all of them
They're strong, gentle men with families of their own
And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you
You never asked them about it
(laughs) Are you serious
Not ever
Not ever
icki drinks from her beer
Walter watches her
'
- Walter sits at his table, a scrap of wood in his hand
He whittles away at the wood
It is the rough outline of a heart with wings
here is a loud  on the door
Walter gets up
The comes again, even harder
Walter goes to the door and opens it
The smiles fades from his face
ergeant Lucas pushes the door open further and walks right in
He wears a well-tailored suit
() 55
: Hiya, Walter
Cop
Sergeant Lucas
(flashes his badge) May  come in
You are in
So  am
But  always like to ask
Walter closes the door behind him
Lucas walks around the apartment
Walter watches him, uneasy
What's up
Have a seat
Walter hesitates, then obeys
(cont'd) You don't know
have no idea
think you do
Why don't you just tell me
Lucas walks over to the window
(cont'd) (pause) haven't broken any laws
() 56
: (2) Then you won't mind if  look around
would
Got something to hide
Doesn't everybody
could get a search warrant
If you could, you would have brought one today
Lucas looks at Walter
He looks at the table
Cherry
Yeah
Unusual design for a contemporary piece
Lucas runs his hand along the surface
It's not for sale
Who said  wanted to buy it
Lucas walks back to the window
(cont'd) Two nights ago, a ten-year-old-girl was attacked not too far from here
() () 57
(cont'd) : (3) Seems there's been a number of attacks on young girls in the vicinity
Kind of a coincidence, wouldn't you say
Walter stands up
If you tell me when this happened -- Walter places his hands in his pockets
Lucas whirls around
Move your fucking hands away from your pockets
Walter does
(cont'd) Sit down
Walter sits
(cont'd) We know every step you make, every goddamn step
We know when you sleep, when you eat, when you shit, and when you jack off
Lucas leans over the table, nose to nose with Walter
(cont'd) And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls
Is that when you jerk off
You can't talk to me like -- (interrupting) Like a piece of shit
In     my eyes, you are a piece of shit
Think anyone would miss you if      threw you out the window right     now
() () 58
(cont'd) : (4) could say you jumped when  came in
Who are they going to believe
Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit
Beat
Lucas taps Walter onL the forehead and smiles
(cont'd) (feigning kindness) We just want to make sure you're being a good boy, Walter
Okay
Walter is silent
Lucas taps him again
(cont'd) Okay
(flatly) Okay
Lucas rises, spits his gum in the sink, and leaves
Walter leans   over squeezing his head tight between his hands
The sound of   children fades in and Walter looks up
The girl with the red   ball stands across from him in the doorway to his bedroom
She smiles and bounces the ball
Walter folds over, cradling his head in his arms
'
- Walter stands alone at his bus stop
As he waits, he sees the white Volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the school
he bus pulls up to the stop, obscuring Walter's view
He quickly gets on and moves to the back, looking for Candy's car
It is nowhere in sight, the place where it had parked, empty
Walter sits down and stares ahead, numb
- It's a bright Saturday afternoon
city bus turns into the parking lot of a large mall
Passengers exit the bus and pour into the mall's entrance
Walter is among them
() 59
: (
) followed a girl
- Music blares from speakers
Packs of teenagers cruise the mall
It is alive with chatter
(
) don't know why  did it
Walter is frequently jostled, as if he has forgotten how to navigate crowds
(
) (cont'd) There were all of these people
e passes many stores and snack shops then sees a Barnes & Noble and enters
- The bookstore is two floors and vast
Walter looks lost as he moves through the crowds
: Walter rides an escalator
Three girls stand ahead of him
The girl closest to him wears a short skirt which flutters above Walter's face
He looks up
(
) She was pretty
Very pretty
hey reach the next level and Walter watches the girl walk away with her friends
Suddenly, the girl looks back
Their eyes lock -- briefly
She turns the corner
(
) (cont'd) She gave me a look
If she hadn't given me that look
Walter pauses, then follows
The girl separates from her friends and goes down an aisle
Walter follows her
She goes down another aisle
He follows
() 60
: In the middle of the aisle, the girl bends down, looking at titles
From the end of the aisle, Walter pretends to be looking for a book as he edges closer to her
He's now a few feet away
The girl pulls out a book and opens it
Walter gazes at the nape of her neck
(
) Can  help you find something
Walter turns, startled
Behind the salesman, Walter sees a security guard exit the rest room area
No, 'm -- He turns, the girl is gone
He bolts the other way, through the aisles, down the elevator, through the mall as fast as possible
The faces are a blur, sound becomes distorted
Then we hear -- (
) Did she know that you were following her
' Walter sits in Rosen's office
don't know
What did you think would happen
don't know
What did you want to happen
don't know
Walter is agitated
Rosen calmly writes
() 61
: (cont'd) can't believe  took such a risk
(looks at Rosen) Will you stop writing in that fucking pad
Rosen stops and looks at Walter
(cont'd) You know that if anything happens, spend the rest of my life in prison
No parole, no nothing
Is this the first one
Of course it is
That's why 'm telling you
want you to calm down
With effort Walter settles down
(cont'd) You followed a girl
One girl
Perhaps you wanted to see what it felt like after so many years
Maybe unconsciously you were testing yourself
You followed her and nothing happened
And here you are talking about it with me
This is positive
There is a pause
Walter looks down, unconvinced
Rosen checks the time
(cont'd) Walter, we'll pick up here next time
want to talk about it now
() 62
: (2) We'll talk about it more on Thursday
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was
(gently) Go home, Walter
Now  know
It's when  can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl
and walk away
(pause) That's my idea of being normal
- - Walter rides the bus, staring out the window
Sensing something, he looks up
sits across from Walter
She is about twelve years old
She wears glasses and a pair of binoculars hangs around her neck
She casually nibbles on food she produces from her backpack
She glances at Walter briefly then looks back out the window
Walter turns away
'  - Walter and Vicki sit at his table eating Chinese take-out
Walter glances at Vicki who is devouring her food
Maybe this isn't a good idea
What
(pause) Us seeing each other
() 63
: She looks up at him
You're scared
'm not scared
Neither am
Maybe you should be
Walter gets up from the table and clears his plate to the sink
Vicki looks at him
Well, Walter,  got an idea of my own
He avoids her look
(cont'd) You listening to me
He doesn't answer
(cont'd) We should live together
(looks at her) Live together
Move in with me
He stares at her
It's a bad idea
think it's a fucking good idea
() 64
: (2) Walter goes to the fridge for a beer
don't even know how to live with myself
Just think about it
've got problems
Who doesn't
Most people don't have my kind of problems
Guess that makes you pretty special
That's not what  meant
Vicki looks at him blankly
(cont'd) say we call it quits
Fine
icki puts her fork down, pulls on her jacket and exits
Walter looks at the closed door, baffled
(') She's gone
(pause) That was easy
e takes a swig from his beer
(cont'd) Good
'm glad
'm fucking glad
65
'  - Vicki jogs down the stairs and over to her Jeep
She opens the door
'  - Walter pulls the carving he was working on from a drawer and looks at it
It's finished
Vicki reenters holding a plant and sets it loudly on the table
Walter looks at her then at the plant
hat's this
What's it look like
She gets herself a beer from the fridge
don't need a plant
Everyone needs a plant
This ivy is one tough baby
It's a cutting from one of mine
Walter seems at a loss
Vicki takes a swig from her beer
(cont'd) Here's the deal
Give it a little water
Go easy on the direct sunlight
And notice it every once in a while
They love it when you look at them, or touch their leaves
Can you handle that
Walter looks unconvinced
Thank you
You're such an asshole
() 66
: She kisses him then gives him a teasing look
(cont'd) Don't be scared, Walter
(cracking a smile) 'm not scared
Prove it
Vicki walks towards the bedroom
Hey
Vicki turns
He tosses her the carving
Vicki catches it and looks at it for a long moment, then at Walter
(cont'd) made it for you
She smiles
(cont'd) It's cedar
- There is the usual morning chaos in the locker room
Walter opens his locker but stops abruptly
aped to the inside of his locker is a magazine ad of a young girl, joyfully swinging on a swing
Scrawled over the image in red marker is a circle with line across it and the words "'  " written below
Walter quickly tears down the picture and looks around
The men are all oblivious
67
- Walter works at the saw, watching closely every person that walks by him
No one pays him any mind
Bob, the boss, walks into the space and stops to have a few words with a worker who points in Walter's direction
Bob heads towards Walter
Walter sees him coming and pauses in his work
Bob walks right by to talk to another man working behind Walter
Walter watches for a moment then continues working
- Walter exits the mens room and stops to drink from the water fountain
Mary-Kay is walking down the hall and pauses
- Hi, Walter
How ya doing
Fine thanks
How are you, Mary-Kay
She leans up against the wall
- Well, 've got this problem promised my sister that 'd baby- sit her little girl tonight while she's on a date
Single mother, right
Her daughter's a cute little thing, about nine or ten
Real entertaining
But once she's asleep,  get soo bored
'd love to have some company
She gives Walter a suggestive look
- (cont'd) What are you doing tonight, Walter
(cold) got plans
() 68
: couple of men walk down the hall interrupting them
(cont'd) Have a nice day, Mary-Kay
Mary-Kay watches Walter walk away
- Walter rides the bus, staring out the window
The bus is crowded
Iime passes, fewer passengers, dusk has turned to night
'  - Walter and Rosen sit in their usual places
You're very late
Sorry
Please don't do it again
said  was sorry
can't move my patients around to accommodate one person
Walter silently stares at his hands
Rosen looks at him closely
(cont'd) Walter,  want to ask you a question
Will you try to answer it
Walter looks at him
(cont'd) When did it all start
() 69
: You mean my problem
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes
don't know
That's not a helpful answer
That's my answer
Rosen looks at Walter
lose your eyes
What
'd like you to close your eyes
Why
To relax
(snaps) 'm relaxed
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me
Walter laughs
() 70
: (2) No,  am not going to -- (closing his eyes) Okay
Eyes closed, mind a blank
'm all yours
Do it, Rosen
Rosen gets up so he's positioned directly in front of Walter
When  say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember
Nothing
Can  open my eyes
No
When  say the word "pretty," when  say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see
don't see -- In your mind, Walter
Take your time
After a moment, Walter's expression shifts
(cont'd) (watching closely) Who do you see
(long pause) see my sister
Rosen is excited by this "breakthrough
" Where is she
What is she doing
ow old -- () 71
: (3) (interrupting) Not so fast
Sorry
(pause) Where is she
In my bedroom, sleeping
Where
In my bed, Rosen
Where do you think
Where are you
In my bed too
How old are you and your sister
We're little kids
But roughly, how old
'm maybe about six
which would make her four
Rosen walks around Walter and paces behind him
And what are you doing
() 72
: (4) Just lying there
(pause) We're taking a nap
nap
Yes, a nap
Kids do that
You ever take a nap, Rosen
Walter opens his eyes
(cont'd) don't want to talk about it any more
He sees Rosen behind him
(cont'd) What the hell are you doing there
Did you and your sister often take naps together
(exploding) want you back in your chair
Right now
Rosen stumbles back to his chair
(cont'd) Don't ever do that again
All right
don't like nobody behind my back
'm sorry
shouldn't have been there
() 73
: (5) Walter looks away, quelling his anger
(cont'd) Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister
Nothing
Did you touch her
Did you take off her clothes
Did you take off your clothes
This is garbage
'm only asking questions
Okay 'll tell you what  did -- just to shut you up
(pause) smelled her hair
What else
That's all
just liked smelling her hair
You felt pleasure
(long pause) Yes
Rosen writes a few notes
Did you get an erection
() 74
: (6) (glaring at Rosen) was six years old
meant later
when you two took naps
Walter is silent
(cont'd) When the two of you held each other
When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine
When your parents were out and the two of you were alone
completely alone in that big house
It was a small house
All right
small house
with small rooms
(His eyes well up
) smelled her hair
That's it just liked smelling her hair
Walter presses his face into his hands
Rosen watches him silently
When Walter lifts his face
- Carlos sits before him
They are in a booth, the table covered with drinks and remnants of bar food
The bar bustles in the background
've got some good news
What's that
() 75
: Annette will see you
Walter is quiet
(cont'd) Aren't you glad
When
Soon
Next week
The week after
Early July
Walter looks at Carlos
(cont'd) It's just a better time
Carlos avoids Walter's gaze
(cont'd) Anna will be away at camp
The house will be quiet
It's better when it's quiet
Tell Annette 'm busy in July
'mon, Walter
You should see my appointment book
It got crazy
It's not what you think
() 76
: (2) Isn't it
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk
She needs to see you, and you need to see her
(a long pause) 'm not a monster
You're a good man, Walter
Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man
Maybe 'm not a good man
Maybe inside 'm bad, and 'll always be bad
on't talk like that
The waitress interrupts to clear the table, leaning over to grab the empty plates
Carlos checks her out
(cont'd) (pause) Next week Annette is going away for a few days
And the thing is that when Annette's away
arlos watches the waitress depart
(cont'd) get horny as hell for other women
(whispering) mean  fantasize about raping some beautiful woman
You don't have to tell me this
() 77
: (3) 'm just talking, man
Carlos,  never raped a woman
know
'm just saying understand
Walter doesn't look at Carlos
(cont'd) It's crazy out there
(signaling to the crowd) Young girls wearing mini this and mini that
Sometimes when  walk down the street and pass some sexy- looking woman, she makes me feel like 'm bothering her
She stares down like she's afraid to look at me
Why she do that
Why can't she look me in the face
Maybe because you're looking her in the face
Carlos looks at Walter
see a pretty woman,  look
That's the price of beauty, my friend
My god, you should see what Anna's friends wear
arlos laughs
Walter looks at him
Carlos, can  ask you something
Sure
() 78
: (4) (pause) othing
Ask me
Ask me anything
(pause) Did you ever
Do you have feelings for Anna
arlos looks at Walter
What do you mean
mean
feelings
look of horror/disgust passes over Carlos's face, and he lurches forward grabbing Walter by the shirt collar
Drinks spill
Listen, man
don't got your sick problem, and if you or anybody else ever comes near my daughter, 'll kill you
Carlos lets go of Walter roughly and gets up and leaves
Walter looks around embarrassed -- onlookers slowly turn away
Walter picks up a napkin and starts to blot the table dry
'  - Vicki stands before Walter who sits on the edge of the bed
Both are naked
She kisses him
He turns her around and pulls her to his lap
Walter's hands are on her hips
He moves her body slowly -- very slowly -- around his lap
Vicki goes with it, enjoying herself, then tries to turn around
Walter holds her still
() 79
: Walter
He leans his face into her hair
He takes deep audible breaths
Vicki tries to turn again, but he won't let her
She is aroused but confused
(cont'd) Walter
let me
She tries to reach back
Walter catches her hand and holds it to her side
Don't touch me
please
He holds her tight
'  - Walter lies in bed, eyes open
There is the  of children playing outside
He carefully sits up in bed revealing Vicki asleep beside him
- n slightly fast motion grainy style of transferred 8 mm, kids parade down the sidewalk heading for school
The camera pans to reveal Candy watching them
(
) (in the ratatat tone of a sportscaster) Good morning, fellow sports fans
The match is about to begin
Candy enters the arena looking sweet and trim
He checks out the scene but plays it cool
He's definitely holding back
(Pause) Uh-oh, Candy's eyes have locked onto something
Oh yeah
railing behind the others is the angel-faced boy
Freeze frame

With his other hand, he offers the boy a bag of &Ms
Jumbo size
Che boy tears open the bag

- Walter sits staring out the window
The sound of children playing
icki walks into the room and sees Walter sitting by the window
She walks up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders
What are you doing
Walter turns around, startled, brushing her off
Don't do that
Do what
Sneak up behind me like that
What's your fucking problem
Why's it always my fucking problem
Vicki looks at Walter
What's going on
Nothing
Vicki looks at him
() 82
: (cont'd) didn't sleep well
Do you want to talk about it

He walks back into the bedroom
rings and Vicki looks out the window
She sees the children running into school
She looks back in the direction Walter left
'  - Vicki and Walter ride in the car
Vicki glances at Walter
He stares ahead, then leans his head back and closes his eyes
- Walter rides, head back, eyes closed
The bus comes to a stop and a couple of passengers get on
Walter opens his eyes
The girl with binoculars comes to sit in the seat ahead of Walter
Walter stares at the girl
The bus pulls up to another stop -- it is Walter's
The doors to the bus open
Walter looks at the doors, he does not move
The doors close
He looks back at the girl
The bus drives on
- - The bus comes to a stop
The girl gets off amongst a couple of passengers
Walter follows
- Walter walks down a path that opens onto a secluded little field surrounded by trees
() 83
: The girl stands in the middle of the field looking at the sky through her binoculars
She turns slowly, scanning the trees
She spots Walter and lowers the binoculars
Hello
Walter is silent
He looks up at the trees
(cont'd) What are you looking at
Birds
(indifferently) There's a million birds here
In that birch tree is a nest
' (interested) Where
(pointing) Up there
She looks through her binoculars
Walter stares at her
(cont'd) little higher
She points her binoculars up
Walter walks towards her
There's little chicks
(turns to Walter) You want to see
Sure
She hands him her binoculars
He looks through them
() 84
: (2) They're starlings
(continues looking) Is that right
don't like starlings
Why not
They're extremely aggressive birds
Plus, their habits are rather filthy
The mother sure has her hands full
He hands her back the binoculars
(cont'd) You always carry these
When  go bird-watching
It's why like coming here
It's just a city park
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here
Last week saw a purple martin
And the week before that,  saw a solitary vireo
That's rare
solitary vireo
like that one
Their sound is quite musical
() 85
: (3) How does it sound
It's hard to describe
Try
can't
bet you can
She shakes her head
(cont'd) 'd love to hear it
(pause) It's a bright sound
She closes her eyes and pipes a little tune
(cont'd) Cheery
Cheerily
Cheery
Cheerily
She opens her eyes, shyly
(cont'd) Something like that
That was terrific
You should hear the bird
You live around here
(Pause) Not too far
() () 86
(cont'd) : (4) (She looks at him) Are you a bird-watcher too
Me
Nah
'm more of a people watcher
Were you watching me
(pause) Not   at first
You would stare at the   tops of the trees so intently
Any   second  thought you would take off   and fly
have to go
Do you come here often
My daddy likes me home before dark
It's good to listen to your daddy
The girl runs off down the path
Walter watches after her
He stands alone in the field
- Walter rides the bus
Through many different neighborhoods, day passes into night
He stares beyond his reflection
Over the following voice-over we cut between Walter's apartment and Walter riding the bus
(
) followed a girl
'  - Walter sits at his window, writing in his journal, fast
() 87
: (
0
) talked to a girl
was near a girl
Jesus God
What did  want to happen
- The bus drives by a number of billboards, children's Gap ads
(
) Maybe it's like Rosen said
Maybe wanted nothing to happen
'
- Walter pauses in the writing
(out loud) Fucking Rosen
This isn't helping
There's a loud  at the door
Walter looks over in surprise
The  comes again
Walter quickly closes his journal and puts it in a drawer
The  comes again
Walter goes to the door and opens it partially
ergeant Lucas stands outside
Hiya, Walter
Walter opens the door
Lucas enters
Walter slowly closes the door behind him
What can  do for you, Sergeant Lucas
Lucas signals a chair
Have a seat
Walter slowly sits
Lucas walks around the room
He pauses
() 88
: (cont'd) Too much sun
What
Lucas points to the plant on the windowsill
Your ivy
Too much direct sunlight
These plants don't like a lot of sun They grow outside, don't they
Sure they do
But outside they've got trees around them
The trees shade them from the sun
Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees
One of nature's symbiotic relationships
You going to take me on a nature walk
Don't be witty
(pause) Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on
Why did you stay on the bus, Walter
fell asleep
Lucas throws him a look
(cont'd) When  woke up  was confused got off at the wrong stop and walked home
() 89
: (2) Lucas looks at the bus map on the wall
You walked home
Yes
Lucas spits his gum into the garbage can and sits down across from Walter
Some of these guys
They walk right into a family's home as if they live there
Very fucking ballsy
Walter is silent
(cont'd) This one guy on death row, who 'll call Henry, told me about his last victim
Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele
Her mother's in the living room watching
She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes
Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, 'll kill your mother
" And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound
Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door
pause) Ten days later they find Adele's body
Or what's left of it
(looks at Walter) You believe in fairy tales
Fairy tales
Do you believe in them
() 90
: (3) No
Neither do
(pause) What's the one with the woodsman
Woodsman
The one with the ax
don't know
Sure you do
He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive
Little Red Riding Hood
That's it
Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch
(pause) Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half
Walter shakes his head
(cont'd) She looked so small and broken saw hardened twenty-year veterans cry
They cried like babies
was there
Ain't no fucking woodsman in this world
Lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his mouth
Then he rises
() 91
: (4) You knew her
What
The girl
Lucas stares coldly at Walter, his face red
He looks dangerous
(seething) don't know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets
It just means we've got to catch you all over again
He slaps Walter on the back of the head
(cont'd) See ya, Walter
and exits
Walter rushes to the blinds, drawing them down, then scrambles to get his journal from the drawer
He drops to his knees, tearing the pages from his journal, tearing them to bits
You have no right to talk to
to speak like
am not
am not
The  of children fades in, and Walter looks up
In the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown, sitting on the red ball, rocking back and forth, her chin in her hands
Wallie, what are you doing
() 92
: (5) Walter squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his ears
The sound abruptly stops
- Walter rides the bus
He is unshaven and looks exhausted
He is jostled by the crowds but seems oblivious
- As Walter walks into the warehouse, men step out of the way and give him leering looks
Walter walks into -- - -- the locker room
hush suddenly falls over the room
Walter looks around
No one will meet his eyes
He opens his locker and a piece of paper slides out
It is a Xerox of the police notification information of Walter printed from the Internet
Walter stares at the paper
Suddenly something slams next to his head
piece of metal clangs to the floor
Walter turns around
edro stares at him, surrounded by a number of men
Vicki stands in front of her locker holding the flyer
She looks scared
She glances at the men then walks over to Walter
(quiet) Come on, let's get out of here
Walter doesn't move
Don't tell me you feel sorry for this sick fuck
Mind your own business, Pedro
Vicki looks defiantly at the men
() 93
: Bob hurries in, followed by a worker
What the hell is going on here
He's handed a flyer
He looks it over and turns red
He looks at Walter then the men
(cont'd) Who did this
Mary-Kay stands quietly in the back of the room, a look of satisfaction on her face
Vicki looks at her
Mary-Kay turns and sees Vicki's glare
She quickly looks away
No one answers
Bob looks at the men for a long moment then at Walter
(cont'd) Any man who can't deal with it can see me in my office
'll pay you for a week, and you can clear out
Bob crumples the paper in his hand
(cont'd) We've got a hell of a lot of orders today
Get to work
Bob turns and walks away
he men are stunned
Three angrily follow after Bob
As does Mary-Kay
Walter walks off without saying anything, his expression blank
- Walter works at his station
He pauses, staring at the cutting blade whirling before him
He looks up around him
After a long moment, he turns the machine off and walks away
94
- Vicki looks up from where she is working and notices Walter's place is empty
She looks around
- Vicki enters
Mary-Kay sits at her desk, typing
Have you seen Walter
- (big fake smile) Lovers' quarrel
Vicki picks up Mary-Kay's mug and pours coffee on her lap
Mary-Kay shrieks and stands up
Vicki tears through Mary-Kay's drawers throwing contents to the floor
- (cont'd) What the hell are you doing
Bob walks in
What the hell is going on
icki pulls out a handful of the notification fliers
- People have the right to know
If she's here tomorrow, 'll fucking kill her
Vicki throws the papers at Bob and storms out
Bob looks at Mary-Kay
95
- Vicki quickly crosses the parking lot to her Jeep, putting her coat on as she goes
- Walter rides the bus, watching the landscape go by, his expression stony
'
- Vicki pulls her Jeep into the parking lot and screeches to a stop
She races up the stairs and knocks on Walter's door
No answer
She knocks again
No answer
Shit
She disappears back down the stairs
'
- The door opens
Vicki enters and turns to the superintendent standing in the doorway
Thanks again
promised 'd take care of his plants
The super shrugs and heads back down the stairs
Vicki closes the door and turns around
The place is a mess, the blinds drawn
She turns on the lights
There is no sign of Walter
She sees the journal scattered on the floor and leafs through the pieces
The image of the girl with red marker is stuck inside (cont'd) Shit
() 96
: She picks up a couple pieces of paper and scans them, then she puts the pieces together
Walter's words are scrawled across the paper
Her hands start to shake
- The bus pulls to a stop
Walter gets off
- Walter walks down park path
jogger runs by, but otherwise it is quiet
'
- Vicki frantically gathers pieces of the journal and stuffs them in a plastic bag
Her face is flushed
he stands up and stuffs the bag in the garbage then pauses, staring at the garbage can
She opens the can, grabs the bag, quickly looks around the apartment
There is the sound of the school bell outside
She rushes to the window and raises the blinds
Children pour out of the school
She quickly leaves
- Walter sits on a park bench in the same little field where he had encountered the girl before
He is alone
He sits still
He looks up at the trees
'  - Vicki drives, the bag on the passenger seat
She comes to a stop light and looks in the rear view mirror
cop car pulls up behind her
icki reaches over for the bag and stuffs it under the seat
The light turns green
Vicki drives slowly
The cop changes lanes and passes her
She lets out her breath
- Vicki slowly drives by a series of parks, schools, malls - searching
() 97
: Children abound, playing, running free, getting off of school buses, running to meet their parents
There is no sign of Walter
- The girl walks into the clearing, wearing her binoculars around her neck
She stops when she sees Walter sitting on the bench
Walter continues staring at the trees
She walks over to him
See anything interesting
Not yet
The girl sits on the bench and pulls a small book from her backpack
She starts writing in it
Walter watches her (cont'd) What are you writing in that book
It's my bird book
She shows it to him
(cont'd) 've identified sixty-seven species of birds this year alone
The girl writes in her book
Walter watches
Where are your friends
She continues writing ignoring his question
(cont'd) Don't you have friends
have friends
() 98
: pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
'm not pretty
Well
not in the common way
She looks at Walter
What does that mean
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked
Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors
The girl sits silently
(cont'd) What's your name
She picks up her binoculars and peers through them
(cont'd) Linda
Susan
Jennifer
Jackie
She continues looking, but she smiles
(cont'd) You tell me your name, 'll tell you mine
(pause) Robin
Walter laughs
Yeah, like the bird
() 99
: (2) (pause) Can  ask how old you are
'm twelve
No you're not
will be in three months
(pause) can't wait
hate being eleven
It has to be the stupidest age in the world
She looks at Walter
(cont'd) What's your name
Walter hesitates then shrugs
Walter
Do you have many friends
No
How come
long time ago,  was sent far away
When they let me come back, all my friends were gone
It sounds like you were banished
Banished
yeah
() 100
: (3) Birds are my friends
That sounds egotistical, but they are
Birds know  watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched
if they know you won't hurt them
Robin
Yes
Would you like to sit on my lap
Robin looks at him
What
Would you like to sit on my lap
(pause) No thank you
Are you sure
'm sure
Thank you all the same
That's okay
doesn't matter
(pause) Do you want me to sit on your lap
Walter looks at her
Yes
would enjoy that
() 101
: (4) Robin shivers
(cont'd) Are you cold
She shakes her head
Walter slides closer and rubs her arms with his hands
(cont'd) You look cold
Robin is silent
(cont'd) know a place in the park where only very small birds go
There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons
It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds
Would you like me to take you there
(pause) They sound like finches
They could be finches
don't know
We should go before it gets dark
He stands up
(cont'd) Ready
Robin doesn't move
My daddy lets me sit on his lap
Does he
Yes
() 102
: (5) Do you like it when he asks you
She looks at him
No
Her answer has a strange effect on Walter, as if for a moment he has lost his balance
Carefully, he sits down and stares at his hands Why not
She is quiet
(cont'd) Are you two alone when he asks you
Still silent
(cont'd) Does he touch you
Robin looks through her binoculars
(cont'd) Does he say strange things
She scans the trees
(cont'd) Does he move his legs in a funny way
Robin drops her head and quietly sobs
Walter looks at her but makes no effort to comfort her
(cont'd) Have you told your mother
She shakes her head
() 103
: (6) (cont'd) Is there anyone at home you can talk to
She is quiet
(cont'd) Is there a teacher you like at school
She nods
(cont'd) What's her name
Ms
Kramer
Tell Ms
Kramer what your daddy does

Yes you can, Robin
Robin in silent
(cont'd) You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo
But you did
Beautifully
heard you
What will happen if  do
Someone will talk to your daddy
And then he'll stop doing those things
the things you don't like
Tears come to Robin's eyes again
() 104
: (7) But will he
Your daddy will always love you
How do you know
know because
it's just something  know
don't want to hurt my daddy
Robin, listen to me
She looks at him
Walter struggles to find the words
(cont'd) At first he'll be upset
very upset
It's because he'll realize he's been a bad daddy
Then he'll try
He'll try very hard to be a good daddy
People will say stupid, ignorant things about your daddy
That will be hard for you
But one thing  know for sure, he'll always love you
always
There is a long moment of silence
Walter
Yes
Do you still want me to sit on your lap
Walter stares at her
() 105
: (8) (cont'd) will
Walter slides away from her
No
don't mind
You should go home
Can't  stay a little longer
It's getting dark
Go home
Will  see you again
Walter is silent
Go home, Robin
Robin gets up, goes over to Walter, and hugs him
Walter starts to put his arms around her but refrains
Bye
She runs off
Walter looks out, numb
'  - Walter approaches his building
The white Volvo sits parked across the street in front of the school
Walter walks a couple of more steps when the door to the Volvo opens
Walter freezes
Candy gets out of the car
As he turns, Walter no longer sees Candy but himself -- many years younger
() 106
: Walter watches, fear and emotion coursing through his face
Young Walter leans back in and pulls the front seat forward, and a young girl emerges
Flash to the angel-faced boy getting out of the car
Candy pats him on the head
Walter sees young Walter pat the girl on the head
She runs off down the street
Walter races towards Candy
Candy tucks his shirt in, puts the seat back, and is about to get in the car when Walter calls out -- Hey
Candy whirls around
Walter smashes him in the face
Candy reels backwards hitting the car
Walter attacks Candy full force
As he punches flashes of young Walter appear, then Candy, then young Walter again
He pounds and pounds on Candy then finally pulls away
Candy sputters on the ground
Walter, breathing hard, stares at Candy
He looks at the blood on his hands, which shake uncontrollably
He slowly stands up and starts to back away
Candy rolls over and groans as he tries to raise himself
Walter turns, tucks his head down, and quickly walks away
'  - Walter stands in the living room
He looks down at the floor where the journal was and sees that nothing is there
He goes to his windows and lowers the blinds
'  - Through the window we see Vicki sitting on her couch, biting her nail, staring off into space
The phone sits next to her
107
'  - Walter stands in the shower
He turns the water on and lets it run over him
Slowly, he begins to sob
'  - Walter stands at the bureau, cleaned up and dressed in fresh clothes
He looks up and stares at himself in the mirror
The sound of  fades in
- Walter walks down a city street with boarded up store fronts
The sidewalks are wet from a steady drizzle
Cars pass by on the wet pavement
As Walter walks, we intercut with a   : )

The lights play across his face

His hands are cuffed behind him, and he is roughly frisked
He tries to look back over his shoulder but his face is held down

- Robin dances in circles in the fields, arms stretched out as if she is ready to fly
108
- car races by, and Walter walks along a busy street fast
The rain falls harder now
)
-  - Walter gets place in the back of the cop car
The cops get in the front seat
Walter looks out the window at his house as the car pulls away
Standing on the front steps, his wife turns away, carrying his daughter inside
cop closes the door behind them

- Walter pounds and pounds on Candy
- Walter crosses an old brick bridge that spans a river
)
- Robin twirls and twirls, then slowly dissolves into the girl with the red ball and white nightgown
The girl spins and spins, her dress fluttering in the wind
Slowly the girl fades away so the field is empty, except for a number of small birds fluttering around the ground
'  - Walter stands outside Vicki's door
After a moment he knocks
The door opens to show Vicki
She stares at Walter
/
'  - Through the window we see Vicki sit down on the couch, and Walter sit on the coffee table, facing her
He starts to talk and takes her hand
She pulls it away
He continues to talk and takes her hand again, not letting her pull away
Trucks pass by over the wet pavement, rattling the windows
- The school is quiet, the playground empty
Swings sway listlessly in the breeze
109
'   - The old Chevy pulls into the parking lot
'  - Walter brings his duffel bag into his living room and sets it down next to a clothes hamper
Boxes are scattered about the space
There's a  on the door
It's open
The door opens and Lucas enters
Walter pauses Hi ya, Walter
Walter automatically sits down in the chair
What can  do for you, Sergeant Lucas
Lucas walks over to the window
You don't know
Know what
'll be asking the questions
(pause) Last night, you hear anything unusual
Screams
Shouts
No
() 110
: man was badly beaten across the street
You know anything about that
was asleep
(pause) didn't say what time the assault occurred
You said last night
went to bed pretty early
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty
went to bed around seven
Lucas gives him a look
(cont'd) wasn't feeling well
could take you downtown
You could
It'd be a waste of your time, though
Walter starts folding his clothes and placing them in the duffle bag
There was a boy there
Walter is silent
Lucas watches him closely
() 111
: (2) (cont'd) He
'd the assailant
The description matches you pretty well
suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build
Probably not too many men fit that bill
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head
Lucas walks around
Walter folds a shirt
(cont'd) That's a nasty scratch on your neck
have a passionate girlfriend
What's with the boxes
You're a cop
Figure it out
'd say you're moving
It's a free country, isn't it
Lucas throws him a look
(cont'd) Just kidding
'm moving in with my girlfriend
Lucas raises his brows then takes out a piece of gum
() 112
: (3) The passionate one
Yes
Then 'd say you're a lucky fellow
count my blessings
Well,  guess 'll be seeing you
Lucas pops the gum in his mouth and heads towards the door
Walter pauses in his folding
Think you'll catch this guy
Lucas turns
Oh, yeah
We'll catch him
Unfortunately, the victim can't talk
In addition to his other injuries, his jaw is broken
Walter is silent
(cont'd) However, we ran an
on the victim
Turns out he's wanted in Pennsylvania
He raped a boy there
Lucas watches Walter who impassively unrolls and rolls the same pair of socks
(cont'd) You sure you don't know nothing about this
`Fraid not
() 113
: (4) Lucas looks at Walter for a moment
Stay out of trouble, Walter
Cause 'll be watching you
He exits
Walter realizes he unrolled the socks
He tosses them in the duffel bag
'  - Vicki drives
Walter stares out the passenger window
The sun is low on the horizon
Walter wears a pressed button-down shirt
He is clean-shaven and his hair neatly combed
His hand fidgets in his lap
You okay
Yeah
Fucking liar
Vicki reaches for his hand, then something catches her eye
(cont'd) Hey, look
Walter follows her gaze
(cont'd) Starlings
n the horizon, a flock of starlings whirl and turn as if one huge body, a dancing cloud against the sky
heard they were filthy birds
Not when they fly
() 114
: Vicki looks at him and smiles
There is a long beat as they drive
/
' ,  - Vicki sits in her car smoking
She stubs out her cigarette
The ashtray is full
She looks out the window
icki's : Walter and a woman stand in the distance near the water
The woman looks a few years younger than Walter
There is space between them
Walter faces her, but she looks out at the water
After a long moment, he reaches to touch her arm
The woman pulls away and yells something at him
Walter's head drops
icki lights another cigarette
She flips on the radio to country music, blocking out all sound
She looks back out the window
The woman yells angrily then falls quiet -- staring at Walter
After a long moment, she turns and walks back up the hill to her car where Carlos waits, leaning against the car
Annette gets in the car, slamming the door
Carlos pauses, looking at Walter, then gets in the car and turns on the engine to leave
Walter stays standing near the water
(
) saw my sister
' Walter sits in his usual seat across from Rosen
It was hard
Rosen is silent
(cont'd) She's still really hurt
and angry
don't know
if she will ever
forgive me
() () 115
(cont'd) : understand that
do
just hope
just want her to
Accept you
Walter nods
(cont'd) It's going to take time, Walter
(to himself) Time
How do you feel about that
feel
okay
Walter looks at Rosen who nods
There is a moment of silence between them
