Other Prisoners around the yard turn and stare as the two men head for the main building

the Guard remains at his shoulder
Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to enter the room where he stands sentry
- , several Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing the length of the room
Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man; floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is beginning to grey
The Nameplate in front of him reads
Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other , the  stands back against the wall

: Another table has been set up; this one near the seated Prisoners, for their   -- examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin

Yes
Eugene Stewart representing Mr
McCoy

The Man checks the papers before him
(his voice a bored drone) Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery
The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction, Mr
Chairman
They no longer seek Mr
McCoy in connection with that case
(adjusting his papers) That is correct
Very well
Mr
McCoy has served four years of his sentence
Prison record satisfactory
Applied for parole on September 5th of this year
The Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer
(') (continuing) Remarks
() 3
: We would only again like to call the committee's attention to Mr
McCoy's satisfactory behavior as a prisoner
Notice is taken
He looks down the table at the dark-suited men
(') (continuing) The Board met in closed chambers last week
have you reached a decision regarding Mr
McCoy's request for parole
His face is taut
Second  looks across to the Chairman
(seated near Beynon) Request for parole is denied
The prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year
lowers his eyes, then looks up at his lawyer
The lawyer avoids Doc's glance
, he shuffles the papers in front of him, begins stuffing them into his briefcase
(still totally without emotion) Very well
The next request for parole is from John Doty
Is legal counsel present
(
) Yes
Mr
Doty is serving five to twelve years for embezzlement of corporate funds
' - torn, magazines, beaten up radio, butt cans filled with sand

and begin to cut, file and burn brush
They are always guarded by guards, some on horseback
- match, he watches the other prisoners aimlessly wander around the exercise yard
- , starchy puddles of food are being ladled out onto the metal trays
- , , cleaning a long line of open, filthy toilets
a Guard stands nearby
coarse soap and brownish yellow water
Doc has an American Eagle tattooed on one shoulder
- buildings containing bleak cell blocks stand beyond the open compound
- doored cells
-     - deafening
The clatter of the constantly working parts is maddening
- - cell
He works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge
Doc glues the final pieces into place
() 5
: Around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen, a picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks
Doc continues looking at the bridge
then suddenly begins smashing it to pieces with his right fist
-   - enters the darkened room and seats herself opposite Doc
They are separated by a wide table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid- point between them
(big smile, she wants the moment to be an upper) Hello, Doc
He simply stares back at her
Carol's finely honed features compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second glance shows willful strength
Doc continues looking at Carol
(') 'm sorry
Doc is silent
(') It's been raining a lot the last few days
Doc is silent
(') We'll try again
No way
've got to get out now
Get to Beynon, tell him 'm for sale
His price
She looks at him
(') Do it now
She hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh
Gets up and leaves
Doc remains unmoving
-  ,  - 6
,     dress
She looks very good
middle aged  looks up at Carol
short balding man ( ) in his forties works at a large desk across the room from the Secretary
He seems totally occupied with his bookwork
They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality; they are professionals
- Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter ender
- Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves
- a little older and a little smarter than the other two, his narrow features allow no warmth
: Yes
want to see Jack Beynon
The Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol towards a door leading to an inner office
Go right in, Mrs
McCoy
- ,   ,   , in bed
his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her stomach
Class - regular
No
Doc McCoy's old lady
() 7
: Cully looks startled
Jesus
Carol Ainsley
The very same
The Doctor took out McGovern for her
She only rides winning - Class easy class
Shut up
' '  - pressed against a man's neck
She kisses, then bites a tiny portion of skin
'
How are you, Mrs
McCoy
' Ready to talk about my husband, Mr
Beynon
So the good Doctor comes up again
(then) Please sit down
He's asked me to come and see you
Beynon looks at her
then lets their eyes meet
(handing her a drink) Why
Can  help
() 8
: Yes,  think you can
'        '  then drawing an imaginary line upward
a woman's hand wearing a wedding ring comes up to meet it
- , they turn a corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed in civilian clothes
Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror
He stops looking uncertainly at the image
and then moves on with the guard
- He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the edge of the penitentiary
Doc turns, looks again at the prison
four years is a long time
dark Caddy is parked down the road
- He stares at Doc
Doc crosses to him
Mr
Beynon will see you the day after tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk
He gestures and drives away
: He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance way
The duffel bag rests beside him
late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc
the passenger side door opens from the inside
Carol is driving
Doc and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several moments
- 9
Hello, Doc
Hi
You okay
(big smile) 'm a lot better off than  was an hour ago
They look at each other for a moment
Carol leans forward
Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses her lightly, but with affection
You want to drive
My license expired, let's get out of here
Sure
She starts the car, slips it into gear
, crossing the border and passing into the State of Texas
,   to Carol
'm sorry  was late
got my hair done
the girl was slow
It looks fine
pause
Feel good
() 10
: Yeah
Where do you want to go
want to take a walk
He smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of Carol's hair
-   -    - Carol
He sits on the bank watching the kids play
,   ,  ,  just grooving
, moments
Carol starts to speak but doesn't
He is preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts
Finally he stands, looking down at her
He slowly takes off his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and starts walking towards a tree
Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope
,   ,  kicked aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash
She is a brief second behind him
,        of being free and alive
She joins him, in his laughter and with their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept down stream
- The interior is cozy and Carol
Carol has lived here almost two years
On the wall there is a poster (which will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now on)
() 11
: Around the room are drying clothes
Carol is ironing with a steam iron
Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt
45 in front of him and a
32 automatic
He is field stripping
There is a bowl of peaches on the table
(pointing to the poster) It doesn't look like that
What do you mean
You've never been there
've been there every day for the last four years
She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her ironing
(') What's Beynon got set up
Small town, small bank, big money
She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him
Where did you get those
've been doing my homework
Just like old times
Better than old times
hope so
am not looking forward to another stretch
made a mistake
'll never make another one
(after a moment) Where did you get them developed
() 12
: (2) Assumed name
Houston
Good
) How much is the score
Half a million
That Beynon's got a long arm
(after a moment) What do you want for dinner
Whisky and a peach
She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice
Doc smiles at her and begins sampling
(as Doc eats a peach with a sharp knife) How does it taste
Just the way  remembered
Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently
(') You been okay
Pretty good
Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids
Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel
How's Estelle
Fatter
some things never change
() 13
: Boring
Nothing's been boring since you found me
(carefully) That's not all of it
No
It's been a long time
pause
He continues stroking her arm
You go out much
After four years and now the question comes up
Couldn't handle it then
Now  can
(with warmth and a smile) 'm still here, Doc
He stands, kisses her gently
She stands and they move toward the stairs
bed
They both sit rigidly
Doc's eyes are on Carol, she stares vacantly expectant
Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness
Carol pulls her shoulders back helping Doc drop the garment down to her waist
Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder
her hair
he kisses her
Doc gently eases himself away from Carol
(he is very tight) Oh Christ
He again moves close
Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him tightly
() 14
: Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains unyielding
He closes his eyes for a second
The pressure of the moment is again too intense for Doc
Once more he pulls gently away from her
Carol looks at him, her eyes very reassuring
(') (continuing) guess 'm kind of
It's all right
(explaining the obvious) It's just been a while
We've got time
We've got a lot of time
can help you
She stands, begins to remove her skirt
Wait
give me a minute
Sure
She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers
'll be okay
Listen, 'm just as nervous as you are
Really
Really
They look at one another
pause
He kisses her; their embrace pulls them back across the bed
(') (continuing) Let me make you feel good, Doctor
But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her
: 15
How was it
Better than  remembered
- Carol enters
was going to fix you breakfast
You were asleep
bought you a lot of new things
She exits and returns with some clothes
He looks at them
Yeah, well,  think 'll stick with what 've got
Suit yourself
They start eating
How much does Beynon get
pause
Carol looks directly at Doc
$250,000 right off the top
Is he straight
You got the parole, didn't you
He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison bars
She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him
() 16
: Thanks again
(then) 'm glad you waited
(simply) couldn't have
much longer
Yeah
know
But  got you out
Didn't , Doc
did it
got you out
Carol begins to laugh softly
Why are you laughing
laugh when  feel happy
Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh
had a lot of that
And other times that wasn't enough
had a lot of that too
know you find it hard to believe, 'm happy just loving you
That doesn't hurt
But sometimes  cried a lot too
(trying to smile) didn't
just waited
(deeply moved) Want to cry now
Doc smiling, still holding her hand, leads her from the table
'         with complete release they half carry each other into the bedroom
-   - 17
You gotta be kidding
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch
Doc sits
Pedal boats cut through the water in the background
(') Glad to see you in civilian clothes
The Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat
Apart from them two pedal boats come up behind Beynon's boat
Cully and Hayhoe are in one, and two other men are pedalling along in a boat numbered 13
All it takes is a long arm
Hard to judge how these things happen
The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions
(sarcastic) guess it was because  was a model prisoner
This is the only time you and  meet in public
Any business with me, handle it with him
Beynon nods toward the Accountant
He then turns and gestures toward the other two men
(') (continuing) You're back with your own people now
Got you some professionals
(flat, hard) get my own help
() 18
: (quiet strength) You run the job, but  run the show
You got two weeks to set it up
It's not a big bank but it handles cash deposits for an oil company
half a million
it's a family thing, the brother of the bank director is on the board of directors at Con-Sol Oil
Beacon City
Beynon nods to the two men and they immediately begin to approach in their paddle boat
-- hard eyes and an easy smile; obviously a heavy gun
-- young, mid-twenties, ruddy face and blond hair; a small man with blank, insensitive features
(nods to Cully, Swain and Hayhoe) What about them
They're mine
The one with the moustache is my brother
They stay out of it
We stay clean
As the two men arrive
(') (continuing) Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson
(to Rudy) heard about you
You work with Miller
You're out of touch
Cops blew him up
Where
Chicago
You were with him
Yeah
got out
() 19
: (2) (to Jackson) What about you
was backup man on a payroll job
(as Doc looks hard at him) hit some liquor stores
drive good
drive
Sure, (to Beynon) You're working on the passports
(as Beynon nods) and visas
They will be ready
You guys do your job
(irritated) 'll take care of my end
(big smile) Stay clean
- window
On two of them huge sets of binoculars have been racked into place, beside them on a tripod is a lectern with notepad and pencil
Doc and Carol peer through the binoculars then write several notations on the paper
Both Doc and Carol drink coffee from paper cups
the residue of dinners served on hotel trays lie about the room
Doc and Carol share a sandwich as they work

He notices a  camera and a wanted poster showing the faces of wanted bank robbers
(with a smile) Could  get change for this fifty please
His eyes alert and probing

His eyes find a Beacon City Policeman idly talking to a citizen
a police car is near the Officer, the driver's side door open

Army, super bullet proof vests which are not vests at all, more a shield
Rudy and Jackson stand near the table
Carol is seated
She nervously runs her hand along the edge of one of the road maps
Doc is holding one of the vests
The wall behind the table is dominated by diagrams and maps, and photos which show the interior of the Beacon City Bank, the Bank vault, and several diagrams of the main street of Beacon City, a Beacon City Police car, and a detailed reproduction of the Beacon City main sewage system, including electrical wiring, a detailed road map of the town and various photos of a farmhouse and barn
Bank President, three tellers and one guard
(cutting in) Usually on the right side as you go in
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody
Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call
if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons
Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard
Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards
Then they're down to their side guns
For exits off Main Street
Should be light traffic that time of day
the Bank Guard carries a

These will stop an

worked ten years without one,  don't need one now
Suit yourself
Okay
How many bank exits
Two
What about the vault
Chambers - Reilly
Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business
Wire pull over
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination
'm good at that
'm handling the fine stuff
You're back up all the way
(smile) Whatever you need
To Rudy and Jackson, Doc points to the map and farmhouse picture: Keep going over these
don't want anybody getting lost
() 23
: (2) (holding two passports and four visas held together by a rubber band) If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales
If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso
She hands Doc the visas, as she puts the two passports in her bag
'll hang on to these
We don't need them till we get to Gollies
Okay
Any questions
Aren't we going a little hard
What do you have in mind
It's just a walk-in bank
You don't have to be Dillinger for this one
(a long look at Rudy) Dillinger got killed
Jackson and Rudy begin to exit
The Accountant enters
(') (to Accountant) Tell Beynon  want no mistakes
make four phone calls, his boys better pick up
understand
Beynon has to be alone at the drop
one car at the ranch and that's it won't have the money
she won't know where it is until 'm sure it's clear
He understands
Make sure everybody does
24
- It is the night before the robbery
Carol stands looking in the mirror
You know how  feel
My mind's not on guessing games
Carol turns away from the mirror
Promise you won't laugh
(shakes his head; smiles) If it's funny 'm going to laugh
feel like the night before the first day of school
That bad
Carol laughs
(') You promised not to laugh
They both laugh
Long beat
Carol gets into bed
Doc is already in bed
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more
Waiting's hard
You never learn how
You know 've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes
worn out waiting
At least you were outside
It doesn
t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc
() 25
: Bullshit
mean it
know you do
But it is different
(before she can interrupt suddenly up a notch) It's different
(quieting down) We'll be all right tomorrow
We are always going to be all right tomorrow
'd like to be all right a few todays
We're going to have a lot of those, (easy, embracing her tightly) We're just going to get the money and then go all the way
(smiling at him) and live happily ever after

as it prowls smoothly down a brush-lined Central Texas road
Carol drives calmly, professionally
, He wears a jacket and watch cap
Doc is squatted down, quickly activating another timing mechanism, checking the clock-face on the bomb against his wristwatch
with a quick, dexterous movement, he places a bomb into the two large grocery bags at his feet
After burying the explosives within each sack, he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper
() () 26
: (') The grocery bags are then gently shoved forward, resting against the wheel well of the truck
As Doc looks at Carol
'65  - , facing the highway which lies a quarter of a mile away
He has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailor's watch cap
he stares at the highway

- ,
He shoves the pistol into the side pocket of his raincoat
Rudy starts the engine
then slides the car into gear
-  ,  - sleepy, traditional municipality
He is the  of the First Bank of Beacon City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front door of the bank, knocks twice
opens the door and the Bank President moves inside

Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it, snaps it back to position
He replaces   the gun under his jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a precaution
huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather suitcase
' , Beacon City appears on the horizon through the windshield
on the massive door as the vault begins to open
-    -     near the outskirts of town
Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving in the opposite direction
-     -       , then checks his watch
8:56
He looks expectantly towards Carol
is now within the commercial district of Beacon City
Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind
drives off Main Street and into an open field near a corner of the town
Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to the sidewalk
Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger seat
The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street
-    -
Through the truck's window a traffic signal appears
and onto a side street
Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main Street

the Bank President snaps the latch-lock closed

She pulls the van carefully to a stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red
She turns her eyes back to Doc
,   , then instantly springs into action
He reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of the truck, revealing the road below
a portion of a manhole cover is visible
(barking the words) Two feet forward
-   can be seen moving up behind the panel truck
, inserts the ends into the manhole cover notches
He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover forward
Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him
As he disappears from sight
98      , still moving parallel 98 to Main Street
The Buick is now geographically well forward of the panel truck
Jackson stares at his watch
Now
Rudy makes a sharp left
The car accelerates, its wheels begin to quietly whine
Main Street comes back into view
still red
eases to a stop behind the panel truck
He watches the signal
He turns on a flashlight, moves ahead
His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky water
() 29
: Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines that run along the sewer wall
He moves down the dark oval corridor
, allowing the morning to enter
He looks over to the wood-frame clock on the far wall
9:00 -    -    , now back onto Main Street

Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces; the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a disparity between their features

He puts the wire cutters to the first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a crunching , he cuts through the conduit with one bite
Doc immediately starts on the next strand

The wall clock shows the time at 9:02

His eyes widen

: (snapping his look to Carol) Okay
-       she engages the gearshift
The truck begins to move forward
Suddenly, the motor does
'
The cars behind the van continue -
Her lips are compressed into a thin line
After a moment
the motor catches, the truck again moves forward
from the floor of the panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol
and onto a side avenue
Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop
He pulls the truck door open, then hesitates
He touches her arm, their eyes meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment
Doc gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck
toward an open alleyway
Behind him the panel truck pulls smoothly away
-
He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley
The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite end is bounded by a large brick building
Doc removes his pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along the side of the brick building
At the last moment he pulls down the watch cap mask
on the side door
with a violent jerk of his leg
32
'          over the Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor
Their heads are down; several of them are trembling
45   , suitcase in the other
He moves into the building, shutting the door behind him
, ready to intercept any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end opposite Jackson
Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand -- The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping
His gun has been kicked against the wall
short distance away Rudy is watching
lies face down on the floor, directly under the arc of Jackson's gun
who is continually turning to watch the Guard
between the side door and the vault, passing the Bank President
He slips the
45 into his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either cuts the lock or picks it
(looking at his watch) 19 seconds
-    - She has stopped the panel truck near the deserted lot where the hay truck is parked
She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed
She moves back towards the van
,,    , lifts the suitcase and moves into the vault
, notes the distance separating the man from his gun
Though unconscious, the Guard's head begins to move
Again he takes a brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and at the Guard
-   is lined with safety deposit boxes and large cabinet drawers
() 33
: metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting on its surface
Doc opens the satchel
He then pulls open one of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money pads into the open suitcase
He listens to the  of Doc at work
He slightly cranes his neck, trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault
enters; Rudy gestures with the gun
she hits the deck
by the minute
continues working within the vault
, now on the floor, quietly crying
watching the Guard
watching Jackson
Calling out time
, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is ready for one more round
in his prone position
He looks at Jackson, then to the vault
- now at the other end of Main Street
, carries the second sack to a large rubbish bin in front of an empty store
She deposits the grocery bag
The suitcase is now filled
He snaps the fasteners shut
after withdrawing his
45 from his coat pocket
He edges around the side of the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank
' He passes the bank president
He gestures to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the side door

Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car accelerates
,     , nears the end of the alleyway
-    - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway opening
into the back of the car
then slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel as Carol slides over to the passenger seat
; his face taut
as Doc kicks it into gear
Two bombs detonate into fireballs
The Hay truck blazes upward, bales instantly igniting
The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange- flame inferno
Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes
Maneuvering through the stopped traffic
, emerging onto smoke-covered Main Street
The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park
' him
36
Suddenly a gun appears in his right hand, aimed at Jackson
The pistol roars bucks, roars, bucks again
Jackson is shot through the head twice
avoiding stalled cars
Carol grasps at both the seat and the dashboard handholds to maintain her balance
Fire licks along the one edge of the sidewalk
He tears along the highway
sweating a little but becoming cool
He is a pro
His watch cap is now removed
- Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile and bounces across the pavement
He approaches the flaming building, then hits the brakes as
is coming in the opposite direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street
,         the smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four wheel drift
Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars, through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign, then bores back onto the road
Looks in the rear view mirror
'  -   '  ,  smoke is visible billowing skyward
the countryside
police car with light turning and siren wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon City
Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears from sight
-    -  pulls off the highway and bumps down a dirt road
Rudy strains to hold the big car on the rutted pathway
() 37
: The dirt road becomes a lane
farm house and barn appear at a clearing
Rudy powers the car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn
, trots to the front of the barn and pulls the double-doors open
station wagon with wooden- panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within
and onto the dirt road
-
Carol peels off her sweater
She has worn a faded blouse underneath
She pulls a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance
-    - The Buick is now parked near the Station Wagon
Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun, then moves towards the large doors of the barn
-        - she watches as Doc drives up the lane
stands outside the barn as the car approaches
, watching him wipe his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer
just within the double doors
He passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway station wagon
the ignition switch is cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side
Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors
He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks around him
Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy
He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase, not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained a great weight
(speaking over his shoulder, not looking at Rudy) Where's Jackson
Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat
() 38
: (pointing his gun lazily at Doc, supremely confident) He didn't make it, Doc
you didn't either
Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase
He starts to turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless
Carol fumbles for the gun in her purse
Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution
Doc swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face Rudy's bullets
then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the chest, Doc's
45 slug driving him backward
Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel
He drops the suitcase with his first shot,  again, blasting Rudy in the middle
Two large holes now show at the chest of Rudy's raincoat
Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the precipice and into a grassy meadow below
Doc stands at the crest of the hill
He looks down as Rudy's body stops turning
Doc shifts the
45 to his right hand
Rudy's body lies still
, not giving Rudy's body a second glance
Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the barn, transfixed
How did you know
Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car
the getaway car
as she starts to change clothes
he reloads
Doc takes a long look at Carol
- , tooling comfortably along a country road
Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat
After several moments of silence: What about the bank
(after a moment) Jackson panicked and nailed the guard
() 39
: Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side window
Oh, Christ
Doc leans forward
, snaps on the radio
- and onto the pathway in front of the barn
His figure is slightly grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's
45 slugs, along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill
He is obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch
- which sends all-pocketed water gurgling down into a mold-covered trough
Rudy pulls off the yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the padded bullet-proof vests
Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall to his feet
huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone
, then looks at his hand
Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash the purling water across his face and then he laughs
- $750,000 stolen
We got between four and five
Carol starts to open the bag and count
Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing
Doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead
They are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic
Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead
(now noticing the road) Doc
(flat) see it
() 40
: a traffic barricade
Several cars and trucks are being waved through the check-point
Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle
He slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly-passing vehicles
She turns, starts to reach into the back
Doc gently catches her arm, preventing her from moving further
(') They're looking for three men
remember
looks into the cab of the pickup, then glances at the empty flatbed
Another  flanks the other side of the truck, repeating the procedure
Several Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional , are parked nearby
The pickup truck is waved through
The station wagon rolls up to the check-point
He smiles and nods to the Young Patrolman
(') (big smile) What's the problem
on her side of the car through the closed window
the Officer peers back at her then into the rear seat
is waved ahead without a second glance by the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock
After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio
-  - Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face
He starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a
The panel truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor, through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts out into the sunlight

He begins to dial

He presses a button on the intercom
234 Yeah
He presses a button on the intercom

He presses a button on the intercom

They checked in
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here -- () 42
: Why
There are three men dead
So what
've got to give him his money
That was our end of the deal
He might be ready to chop us up
Do it my way
He starts the engine
The station wagon pulls away
Tell me about Beynon's ranch
've never "been there
When we met it was in his office
Doc looks at her for a moment
(') (continuing; hesitant) Do you trust him
just figure the percentages
He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going
If we make a mistake
, he'll burn us
You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up
don't want to go there
() 43
: Do it my way
The wagon continues moving down the road
- is blowing
The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway, bouncing along its rutted surface
to one another
The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of the letter bins
Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at the box, then turns down the indicated road
- clears the crest of a sage brush hill and passes camera
- in front of the house
As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the
45 out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband
Carol watches the gesture
Doc starts to open the car door, then hesitates
You can wait here
'll wrap it up fast
, then pulls the leather suitcase out of the back
He quietly shuts the car door and moves around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the rear
around the area, his eyes searching for signs of Beynon's men
Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves toward the front door, tries it, moves away
Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house
After another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters the house
- / and into the kitchen
44
-  -  / ] head on hand, eyes slightly glared
on the checkered oilcloth in front of him is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full
He's drinking the sour mash straight with a water chaser
for a moment,, sets the suitcase down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass and sits down at the table
Doc pours himself a drink, takes a sip
Hello, McCoy
Beynon
(swishing the drink) News said two persons killed
Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite sober
Beynon wears a
38 Detective Special
in a worn leather belly holster
Three
Rudy got ambitious
And you got him
That's right
Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking the money
What about your wife
What about her
(moving right to the business at hand) Let's c ut up the money,  want to get North
45
Your wife told me no one would be killed
You hired Jackson and Rudy
, not me
They may nail me into this now, McCoy
That's your problem
(smiles) You know, you and  may be two of a kind
No way
always do my own work
Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's glass
Here
understand the way you feel
As a matter of fact, you and  might share a great many feelings
Beynon drinks from his glass
Doc continues counting the money
(snaps the words) 'm in a hurry
You still don't get the picture do you
've always heard what a smart ass operator you are
No applause
Beynon pauses a moment
Doc looks steadily across the table into BeynonTs eyes
Prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening
Beynon gets out of the chair, stands beside the table
() 46
: Let's examine the situation
One, an extremely attractive woman
Then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison
Three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict
why should he
Beynon sips his glass slowly
Doc's hand edges down toward his waist band
(') (continuing) simple reason, McCoy
The obvious reason
To rob a bank
knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when  was 8
(cautiously) What do you add up to here
One
The radio's rappin' about $750^000
We only got a half a million
little more was taken out before
(a beat) My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr
McCoy
had a few pressing debts
So we did that crackerbox
to cover for you
(smiles
, nodding) The obvious
(as his smile fades) But we are both not interested in that right now
No
(a long beat) My old lady must have made a lot of promises
() 47
: (2) Close
but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings  pulled
bet
Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon
Turning his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance to the kitchen
She holds a
32 automatic
the pistol seems to be pointed directly at Doc
You wouldn't have come here when you were eight3 Mr
McCoy
As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc
(') (continuing) Don't think too badly of her
After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman
(riding over Beynon's words) Get it over with
the automatic
The big gun belches the full slip in a stuttering
the slide remains back and in an ejected position
is driven back to the kitchen wall
He  aloud, the noise strangely like laughter
his body flattens against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore slugs
Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned table
He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body
Carol takes two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it clattering and spinning away across the floor
looks at Carol, their eyes find each other
He turns, moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills a glass of water from the tap
drinks it; he looks back at her
stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks
crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen toward the back door
Beynon's body has slipped from sight, only a few traces of blood show along the white wall
48
- Rudy is driving along an open highway
Rudy mouths inane lyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other clutching his wound
small sign near a mailbox catches Rudy's eye
He swings the panel truck around in a -turn, then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm house

Doc stands away from the car, his back turned to it
gazing at the horizon
Carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open, her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the ground
Doc suddenly turns, walks to her and gives her a stinging slap across the face
Stupid
Tears begin to roll down Carol's face
(') (continuing) Why didn't you tell me
There wasn't any way to explain it
Yeah
You sent me to him
When  got out, why didn't you tell me where it was

Who's she
She's on
If you don't start telling the truth

(quietly) We keep going
'  - Swain sleeps on the davenport
Cully and Hayhoe sit at two sides of Beynon's large desk, playing a game of checkers
Hayhoe seems to have Cully badly beaten
The Accountant enters the room
The block on the wall shows eight o'clock straight up
Let's go
The two men abandon their game
Cully kicks the sofa, awakening Swain
He groggily gets to his feet
-   -   - The station wagon enters the building
Doc takes a bright orange ticket from an  behind a glass window, then accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper levels of the building
checks his watch momentarily as he prowls the wagon between long rows of automobiles
' through a sweeping turn within the auto park's uppermost level -- through the building's portals the bright morning sun can be seen reflecting off the city's rooftops
() 50
: to an abrupt halt within a parking stall - - at an isolated area
He steps out onto the concrete flooring, slams the door shut
Doc turns away from the car
As he approaches the elevator, Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride
- slowly foward
She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms
The line of ticket buyers moves forward
just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down
The station is ancient, vaultlike
Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station
She places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg
Carol pops open her purse
a clumsy item in itself
as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket-seller looks across to her
Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer
- Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in forty-five minutes, gate three
Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse along with the change
Wearily, she labors the satchel back into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres-wide station promenade
, Carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles
She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: : 9:40 - at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her
Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles
Carol finally rises impulsively from the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel
() 51
: while carrying   the suitcase
As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass- walled Cocktail Lounge
She hesitates, then begins   to trudge in that direction
As Carol approaches, an elderly  deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside
Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away
Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker
She slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door
As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the locker door swings closed
She tries to open it but the door has re-locked itself
Carol quite disgusted with her predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse
As she again reads the numbered directions, a   appears at her shoulder
, Doberman Pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie
The Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness
Kind of tricky, isn't it
She turns, startled by his sudden proximity
In one smooth movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand, deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open
Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests it to show that it has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and puts it into Carol's hand
She is intimidated momentarily by the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his intentions
Thank you
(toothy grin) No trouble lady
Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a welter of station activity
Carol watches his receding figure for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail Lounge

thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cat's neck and backbone

puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag
Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn- like Animal Hospital
The large room is lined with stalls, cages and pens, many of them vacant
The wonded criminal is bare-chested
plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder
opposite   Rudy
Five years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt, bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face suggests sensuality
Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed under her rumpled skirt
(to Harold) What's the damage
Collar bone is broken
No infection yet
the bandages should be changed twice a day
got a nurse in mind
(going along, oblivious to the implication) The glucose will begin working in half an hour
You'll feel better then
(flashing a grin despite the pain) The three of us are going to do some traveling
We're going to take your car to El Paso
That's not possible
We can't leave here
we've got all this

: Rudy smiles at Mrs
Clinton
He's never met Fran before, but he's known her for years
Is it possible, Mrs
Clinton
(scared, but trying to be friendly) Just
tell us what you want
Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat
The following silence is like a scream
Finally: What kind of car do you have, Harold
(cutting in) Ford
We have a Ford
That's good
That's very good
Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road
One more thing
If anybody but you comes back
He points the gun at Mrs
Clinton
(') (continuing) She gets her clock fixed right away
You understand that, Harold
long pause
You do what he says, Harold
After you come back 'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two
You have to call another Vet about the animals
You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow
no slip-ups on that
They got to be looked after
We really don't have too many friends

: (2) They don't think he married well
(smiling) That makes things a little easier for us then, doesn't it
- Carol sits in the bar
young  approaches and sits down at the counter next to her
She is finishing a vodka gimlet
(to a bartender) Beer
Carol glances at her watch
(') (continuing - begins with the obvious) Guess you have to catch a train
pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one years old, not good-looking (his best feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not a hustler
He just wats to meet a girl
(not too patronizing) That's right
Me, too
Got twenty-four days of furlough and 'm goin' home
The soldier's beer arrives
Where's home
Utah, the Bee-Hive state
'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake
Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you
() 55
: (chuckles) No, 'm not
Me, neither
There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and 'm one of them
That certainly makes you kind of special
(awkward) Yeah
guess it does
Carol pushes aside her glass
(') (c ont inuing) You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you
(smiles across to him) No, 'm afraid not
never have any luck
Carol smiles at the soldier
Her features suddenly freeze as she glances toward the entrance to the bar
and the soldier
(') really hope you have a nice trip
Thanks
hope yours is okay, too
Carol moves towards the exit
The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim
56
They look at each other
Where's the suitcase
Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment
Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main lobby
followed by Doc
They cross to the lockers
She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the proper slot
It doesn't turn
Puzzled she tries again, then forcing the key, shakes the lock violently
Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key
Her features are now totally ashen
She walks up the bank of lockers
puts the key in another locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty
Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear
Doc at her shoulder
man helped me open it
(deceptive calm) And switched keys
He must have
(angrily) It isn't another boyfriend, is it
Carol winces, containing her anger
(') (continuing - icily) How long ago
() 57
: Fifteen minutes
Sure
Carol nods
(') (continuing - with quick calculation) He'd figure you for longer, enough time to try another hit
He's probably still in the station
As Doc pushes Carol forward
(') (continuing - lashing out) There better be a guy with the (lashing back) You bastard
Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow
They reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the promenade
eyes straining
her eyes finding the thief
He stands near another bank of lockers, the black suitcase at his feet
- virtually within the same moment that she spots him
His expression never changes
He takes a step towards her, smiling
Then, with a movement that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons
Recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him
Carol follows Doc but is unable to keep up
She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of lockers
but both men have now disappeared from view
She sags back against the edge of the metal compartments, exhausted, fearful
(indistinct above the roar of the station) Attention please

: (2) (') The Flyer now boarding at gate three
The Flyer now boarding at gate three
Carol again raises her eyes
Still breathless, her face glows with moisture
'  - () Rudy stares at her from the cot
Harold is now absent
don't think you have to worry much about Harold
He won't do anything
(he speaks very politely) That right
You can trust him
How long have you been married
Two years
Can he trust you
(smiles) That's what matters, isn't it
Rudy continues looking at her
Come over here a minute
He gestures with his gun
Fran crosses the distance slowly, moving with apprehension
Look, 'm not going to be any trouble to you either, fact is, this may sound funny, but maybe you and  could be close friends
Rudy gestures her closer
() 59
: (') (continuing) You don't always have to have your gun out
'll get whatever you want
Really, will
Fran smiles
She is now standing over the cot, looking directly down at Rudy
He jerks her down
(still polite) Get rid of that nail polish,  don't like it, and when  tell you to come over here you move fast
You and  are going to get along because 've known a lot of people like you, so don't tell me about it because  got your ticket going in
Now get up and get that paint of your fingers
okay
Rudy smiles
-     - between the rows of lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes in
After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse
Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station is unfamiliar territory to him
Both Doc and the Thief move carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference
weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor
, he passes several sealed off departure/arrival gates
, an open stairway winding downward
to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform
Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight
Doc steps behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully
After a moment or two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse
() 60
: Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers scurrying toward the awaiting train
, perpendicular to the boarding gate
Two doors to the train stand open, one in the pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach passengers
-     -      of about-to-depart passengers
the Flyer comes into sight, visible on the next level below
-   -    by the coach entrance
He grins at the boarding  as he speaks to a nearby
The Thief skirts around a baggage-laden elderly  and moves up the two-step and into the rail car passageway
He sees the Thief slip past the conductor and into the train
He heads toward the forward compartments
and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule
in a grey suit skips aboard the Flyer standing below
She is unable to get a clear look at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc
She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will take her down to trackside
Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd having already passed through
She hesitates again, staring down at the shining train
- People hesitate over their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks, clumsily remove their overcoats
The Thief continues to move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace
61
,    , scanning faces
He is one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes
Doc is further delayed by a  blocking the aisle
She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage
Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her
30
and into an 30
empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a run
,
The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train
This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes
reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway
The next car holds only baggage
He has reached furthest forward passenger car
The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are tightly locked
He begins to retrace his steps
, still unknowingly two cars behind the Thief
, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge
He tries the door -- locked
The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement
Passengers are visible behind him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the smoker
None of them notes his activity
The restroom door swings open
' The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him, crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window
He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed
, notes the half 313 dozen travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the smoker
() 62
: , although several Passengers and a enter it moments after Doc leads the way
Doc passes through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and, like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage blocked by the baggage car
Doc hesitates, then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction
'  -- staring hard at the door for a moment
He tries the handle
The door remains firmly shut
(appearing suddenly at Doc's shoulder) Be open five minutes out of the station
Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps toward his point of entrance onto the train
,     , is now undoing the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed
The lid pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands
The Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket
back through the passenger cars
' He nervously looks about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the window and stares out through a corner of the pane
He pulls the shade lower
, the train , then begins to move forward
'   as the train edges forward
His body suddenly tightens
He sees Doc outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of moving passenger cars and several parked tinders
' , walking cautiously ahead
As the Flyer continues to move slowly forward, Doc disappears from view
Turning away from the window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps back out into the vestibule
() 63
: , the Thief seats himself next to a window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair opposite from him
In the forward position of the car, well behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered about the lounge chairs
Conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch tickets
As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him
He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the paper
As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief rests one foot against the suitcase
All seems secure
Then, Doc sits down next to the Thief
' , pulling him close
(softly almost gently) When you pop a lock don't mark it
The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms
'
Doc's fingers are vise-like at his wrist
-    end of the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter
from Doc and the Thief
He continues collecting and punching fares
- -- the train has left
- '
He methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two seats ahead
'
The Thief goes out
Is he dead
'
Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head
64
- ,
Sits
waiting
The soldier comes by, stops
She doesn't recognize anything
- thief are seated
He stops in the aisleway, expectantly leaning in Doc's direction
Tickets
As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it to him
End of the line
Two
(grumpily) All right
The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make change
'  - the highway
With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat
Talk a little, Harold, loosen up
good for you
Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel
(chuckling at Harold) Something ought to loosen him up
how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy
Just want to find a suitcase
65
- '  - '      behind the overturned kitchen table
a small trickle of blood oozes out from under one of the table legs
The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring down at Beynon's body
They may still be going to Nogales
What about Laughlin in El Paso
Cover both, get someone down there
either Rudy and McCoy's got half a million
They've got to switch cars
Put out the word
(looking back at Beynon) What about Jack
Tonight
take him out in the country, throw him down a dry well, if you can find one
- He is suddenly showered with spurting water
He lowers the paper and looks to the aisle, seeing: , dressed appropriately and holding a water pistol
Stick 'em up
Doc looks at the brat
(') (continuing) 'm gonna shoot you
() 66
: He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on Doc's shirt front
Doc continues staring at the boy
The kid looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch
Come here a second
Doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer
(') (continuing) Look, 'm sure you're a nice kid and that your mother's nearby
Now you better get back to her real quick or 'm going to break your little arm
okay
Doc releases the boy
The kid looks at Doc for a moment then bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the passenger car aisleway
Doc again lifts the paper, turning to the sports page
- ( ) - at the vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the next stop
Doc prepares to get off
The passenger car remains sparsely populated
No one occupies the seats near the corpse
-      - -- she gets up, doesn't know where to go
sits down again
fear and anticipation on her face
stands up
ready to go where
Ready to sit down again, she looks up
Carol reacts
pleased to see him
pleased that he's back
until
(steely) Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville
() 67
: (nailing him) wouldn't worry Doc
can always get you out
'll screw every prison official in Texas if  have to
Texas is a big state
can handle it
'll bet you can
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc
(rising tone) If  was caught, wouldn't you
Doc is silent
After a long pause
(') (continuing - quietly) When we had trouble before it was different
(nodding) You don't like the way things are, don't like the way things What do you want to do
Maybe we should split up
'll cut the money with you
Do you mean that
mean it
long pause
Maybe she wonders; what if he is lying but what if he isn't
Temptation
She makes up her mind
No
don't want to leave
68
- train yard lights of a town go strobing by
train and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot
Doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me
Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room
(cutting in) You've got all the answers
What about when they find the body on the train
When they find it, they find it
To the cops a description's only good if there's a channel for it, and there's no connection between that stiff and the robbery
You've got it all figured
(looking at Carol and thinking about Beynon) No
there's a couple of things 'm still working on
Like what
But Doc doesn't answer
- Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped in wax paper
She passes one over to Doc along with some greasy french fries and a couple of napkins
The Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across the room
Doc silently munches his hamburger
() 69
: Doc glances at the poster rolled up
Carol hasn't put it up on the wall yet
: - , the young panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping passengers
His Mother catches him, takes him back to his seat
- discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near her leg
Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a Texas newspaper
She is surrounded on the double bed by stacks of money
She lights a match, drops it into the wastebasket
The money bands quickly burst into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly ashes
(not looking up) There may be a hunting party
Why, there's nothing on the news
didn't mean police
He continues thinking
Carol watches him for a moment
Tell me about it
Doc looks across at her
(calmly) Loredo is out
've been thinking about Rudy
If he was on his own, we're okay
If Beynon bought him out
Doc looks at her
What
() 70
: If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso
Rudy knew about Laughlins
You're full of ifs
think you liked it with him
think he got to you
Maybe
At least  got to him
(pause) Where do we go from here
El Paso
- The seven year old brat   squeezes off several plumes of water
The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck
Bang
He fires again, once again there is no reaction
The brat steps forward
smiling, he pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder
'
His eyes roll upward
staring at the panther
His neck is bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly
(very hoarsely) Get me a doctor
- , her head resting across one arm
Doc lies beside her, eyes open
He looks over at Carol a moment, noting the long strands of hair that move rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing
After a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and stares at the black suitcase
() 71
: He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn shade
Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol
- Printed clearly on the brown wrapper
- with his handkerchief
The Panther is sitting with his mother on a nearby seat
Still dressed in his panther suit, but no longer a brat
His face reflects both fear and shock
, (to the Thief) Where did you get it
(hoarsely) It was a gift
- ,  It looks great
She tosses a package on the bed
Doc looks at her outfit and opens his
They are too flashy
Thanks
(as Carol starts to speak) You look great, just great
They could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes
That would be the first time
(angry) When are you going to learn
did  killed a man
() 72
: Doc throws his clothes away
(laughing) And that could be all for you
, baby
Carol suddenly angered slaps him
Doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow
Carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties his laces and pulls on his jacket
Doc stuffs the Colt
45 into the flapped outside pocket along with 2 clips
He turns to the bed and picks up the suitcase
Carol continues looking at Doc
(') Now you learn3 this time it could be the chair for both of us
Carol starts to speak
(') (continuing) From now on you just shut up and do as you're told
If  hadn't killed Beynon
, you would have
Doc doesn't answer
He turns and exits
She follows
- , Printed at one side of the photographs are their criminal records
are seated within the Communication room of the department
The transcriber comes to life as the cylinder receiver begins to turn
- MeCOY'
73
, Yes, that's him
No question about it
That's him
(pointing to the thief) How about him
(hoarsely) Listen, 'm a friend of the Court
You are here because you're under arrest
- with a yellow light
The man has been positively identified as Carter Doc" McCoy, only recently paroled from a penitentiary where he was serving time for armed robbery
He is believed to be travelling with his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy
(ad libs) - the radio
His eyes stare vacantly ahead for a moment
, his mouth tightly gagged
bed, wearing only a bra, sleeping, one arm wrapped around Rudy's middle
How you doing over there, Harold
You sleep okay last night
Good
'm glad to hear it
Did you listen to the news
That means we don't have to drive so hard today, Harold
we're gonna be travelling a lot faster than they are
We got a lot more time than  figured
() 74
: Rudy continues smiling
He pulls the sheet away from Frank, then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from inside the bra
Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to Rudy
'  - ,   and the rest of the boys are sitting in the office waiting
- , Fran and Harold are not speaking
- They are also silent
-   - (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen before)       and approaches the reception desk
The large room is populated by overstuffed and threadbare furniture
looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish just about as badly
He flashes a quick grin from behind the counter as Cannon draws near
At the switchboard behind Laughlin, , maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks (all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine
You Laughlin
(Mr
Friendly) Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's Junior
Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old  sleeping in one of the overstuffed chairs
Congratulations
need a room
No trouble
You came to the right place, one thing we got is a lot of rooms
What else can  do for you
75
'  - The black suitcase is propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat
Doc, seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his hand
The radio is obviously not working as he turns the dials and pushes the buttons
(cajoling it) 'mon workl (almost pleading) 'mon
We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc
and then the radio conks out again
This time Doc hits the radio hard
(') (angrily to the radio) Give me the news
When it is clear that the radio won't work: (') You can't trust anything these days
'll tell you something, Doc
One day you're going to have to trust somebody
,    as the car veers over to the side of the road
trust
(he opens the black suitcase) Want to see what  trust
In God we trust
(he pulls out a bill and points at it) The word's on every bill
(slamming the suitcase closed) You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me
Do you understand that
There won't be anything left
She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her knuckles tightening around the steering wheel
76
'  -  - Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat beside her husband
a scrunched up sack of food beside her
She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery
Rudy sits in the back, eating spareribs
He suddenly throws a just finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder
Have a bone, baby
He throws another sparerib at Fran
(shouts) Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse
God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for
Jesus
(laughing) 'll tell you why  did it
it makes me feel good
He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran
She suddenly catches his mood and begins laughing herself
tossing a bone back at Rudy
His knuckles whiten around the steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front of him
the cardboard box, oblivious to Rudy and Fran's laughter
(That will be the day
) - with the light mid-day traffic, passing various roadside business establishments, then pulls up before a radio/ repair and sales shop
/  - are stacked on shelves around the small room
a television display featuring several models is in one corner of the shop
Another  is playing near the counter and the ' desk
portable
() 77
: Transistor
Yeah
The Proprietor moves to a shelf
As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube, with appropriate dialogue
, then he quickly reaches over and snaps the set off
, seemingly oblivious to Doc's action
15 to 55 dollars -- take your pick
, then looks at the corner of the small shop
have Doc's picture on them
-- the man is looking at him not at the sets
(paying) Fifty -- Taking a set, he exits
You have change
But he doesn't answer
- through the open door, hands her the set
We got trouble
Let's take a walk
They turn into a Sporting Goods Store
The Chevy is behind them, a block away
78
/ empty car, then turns and grabs his telephone
, some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the street
Doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store
An moves up to help Doc
(with a smile) Can  help you
Sure can
'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel
All right
Shells
Two boxes of double-ought buck
Gonna knock down a wall
(big smile) Might try that
The Salesman puts a form in front of Doc then goes to the gun rack behind him, lifts off a short-barreled shotgun and begins to wrap it
Sign here
,      , -        comes down the street and makes a -turn
stopping near the Chevy
After a brief conversation the Radio-Repairman goes back inside his store and the police car pulls forward, down the street from the Chevy
79
Both men stare hard at the now staked-out Chevy
-- As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket: ,   ,
Doc reads her; he knows that the police are in the street
Be one hundred and eighty-five thirty- two
Doc quickly pays the man
Much obliged
Doc turns as the Salesman drifts over to another Customer -- he approaches Carol at the store window
Only one car
Let's do it
Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and starts up the sidewalk
, Their car is pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting Goods house
,    and begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the Chevy
80
; their car pulls forward and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy
car, guns drawn
big gun
Doc  the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck
Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as their car  behind them
With three more  Doc blows most of the top off the police car then calmly reloads
Slide those guns
The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement
, started the engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street
She makes a -turn, then pulls up near Doc
,       the police car near the gas tank
He walks to the back of the car
Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy
Doc  the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly ignites
Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts to climb into the Chevy
Carol  the engine
Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police officers and the blazing automobile
() 81
: Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement
,   back to pick up Doc
,   ,   ,  his gun and jumps into the Chevy
He slams the door closed, Carol again tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement
With very long faces they study the burning remains of their once proud squad car
,, onto an open stretch of road
- gun -- Carol grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road
the Chevy continues to accelerate
'    and passes a lumbering Greyhound bus
,      ; the bus fades off into the horizon
(finally) Here
,     road for twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks
Well out of sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt
, road toward the highway
Doc still carries his gun in the brown wrapping paper
Carol labors with the suitcase as she runs
, waving both arms overhead
The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard
The bus again moves forward
() 82
: , Doc hold- 4l4 ing his camouflaged gun
They lean back on their padded seats as the bus jostles along the road
Suddenly
Two Police Cars pass the bus,  screaming, lights turning
Doc and Carol's eyes meet
One more Black and White passes the bus and races on down the road
: -  4L ,   , while leaning against a hot dog stand
One foot rests on the suitcase
The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot of Doc
Carol is driving
Doc walks up to the window of the car
Where are you going
El Paso
Doc opens the door and moves into the driver's seat
How much
Twenty eight hundred
As she looks at him, he smiles: Are you hungry
Not now
He drives off
83
'   - 've got to stop
(as Fran
s hands move over him) 'll tell you when
-  -  4L -
Carol now driving,, pulls off the highway and into an "Oasis" drive-in restaurant
the indoor portion of the restaurant
-        - a skinny girl, wearing a brown jacket and slacks, approaches the car carrying two menus
She arrives with a smile
Doc leans forward, looking past Carol at the waitress, he lifts his hand, not accepting the bill of fare
That's okay, honey
Two cheeseburgers; two coffees and a milkshake
How about fries
(big smile) Why not
The Car Hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk towards the kitchen area
- ,      , half- clothed, eating chicken, drinking a beer, while Fran slowly strips down to bra and panties
- to bolt the serving tray onto the car-door window
Could you roll it up part way
() 84
: Sure thing
The girl clamps the tray to the window
The Car Hop narrows her features, looking at Doc and Carol then smiles and turns and heads back toward the kitchen
-' , she looks casually at the mirror
, , spills it and then reaches for the light switch knob on the dashboard
' - , notes the lights 429 then turns her head the opposite direction, pretending not to see
Within the kitchen behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot
their faces expectant
She made us
Carol looks into the rear view mirror
Across the wide lot a police car appears, cutting in off the highway
Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over, jams the stick into gear
All this is accomplished while staring into the rear view mirror
-  onto his lap
cruises slowly along the line of autos
a riot gun
Mercury
() 85
: behind the Mercury, seemingly blocking the way
Now
screaming forward, as Doc shoots out the back window
Then, as the terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front windshield
The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll across the concrete
The car slams back down through a vacant space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit
with the butt of his shotgun
,  , trying to get between the Mercury and the highway
, streaking backward
She pulls the wheel to the right and brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police Car
Mercury streaks in front of them
Both Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the retreating Mercury
- around her
,  , in the opposite direction
The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along the street as the Black and White  to a stop
-       ; the wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the Black and White upward
() 86
: ,
38     at the Mercury as it streaks down the road
Three holes open up on the trunk of the auto
Black and White through the rear window
Carol makes a quick turn off the highway
' , suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn - this time through a red light
- , whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the car
She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun
,     ; the  of sirens
They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley
,
pull back into an alcove as a prowl car goes  down the street and off into the night
They continue down the alley
a large metal garbage container, and the  empties two cans of garbage into it
Then he starts across the narrow street beyond in order to grab several others
,   '
They run for the container
Doc tosses the suitcase into the container, jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him again sound close by
,      , lifts the container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol into the truck
Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have room enough
45 out of his jacket and into his hand
He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly amongst the garbage
moment after Doc frees his gun, a load of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring them
Again the  of sirens
the truck lurches forward
() 87
: , passing several prowling squad cars
-    - ,  , throwing in more refuse
The truck continues along
-      and flies
buried within their enclosure under the moist garbage
- surrounded by acres of open trash
Areas within the dump reveal the slow, smouldering fires
- , , as the load of trash tumbles down the face of the crater
, and stumbling forward they climb into a large cardboard box
, checks to see that the garbage is gone from the truck bed
On his way back to the cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto tire
With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the truck and drives away
the broken bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used tires
with his penknife
The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within the box
Okay
think so
don't know
Doc puts his hand to her face, wiping away a thin trace of blood from a scratch
It's not deep
() 88
: Carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while
No scars
No scars
Doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the crate
Carol begins to scratch her leg
(') Don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an infection
Carol ignores him, she is in bad shape
(') (continuing) Do what  tell you, it's not a game
It's all a game, don't bother me
Doc stares at the garbage around them
We better stick here till tonight
(down) Yeah
Doc smiles, trying to get her to smile again
We're going to make it
(further down) Sure
Carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled, tweed suit
She looks away from Doc
Doc stares at her mussed hair and tear-stained cheeks
want to say something
() 89
: (2) (quiet defeat) don't want to hear it
(softly) Listen to me
It's hard enough
Carol turns back, faces Doc
Their eyes find one another
(') (continuing) Look, what you said yesterday
guess that was right
It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together
don't think we can any more
If we ever get out of here, maybe  should take off
We got this far
We've come a lot of miles
But we're not close to anything
guess you're right
pause
always thought jails make people hard
Not you
You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon
chose you, not him
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here
We got to go one way or another
(setting the condition) No more about Beynon
Whatever happens it's over
pause
() 90
: (3) (not trusting his mouth) Sounds good
You want to try with me
(smiling) Things can't get much worse can they
don't see how
long moment
(finally talcing Doc's arm) Okay
(slow smile) You and me
Can we make it
We get to Mexico, we can have a life
That's all  want
It's the only thing have ever wanted
As she pulls herself against him: 'm going to try and get it for you
They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another
The fact that they have been seen in the North
He smiles
Fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets
(calling softly) Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out of there
No answer
Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom
91
- Very dead and not very pretty
Rudy looks at him, then sits on the John continuing to read his paper
- -  48L They hold one another tightly fighting the cold and the relentless roar of metal wheels
-  - They sit in booths while their clothes are being cleaned (doors open at bottom)
'    - -   - '  -   - , Cannon watches them from across the room, carefully cleaning his teeth with a cinnamon toothpick
- down the dark-walled hallway, stopping before room number 4l8
Laughlin turns the key in the lock, opens the door
It's hard to figure
There's something about the composition of the track at Pimlico
You can't go by the clock, any speed horse, take a second off any other track in the country
418 92
(continuing) but a speed horse is the only thing that consistently holds form
They got to let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try to rate 'em, just breaks their heart
Rudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach
As Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty armchair
Rudy instantly pulls out his
44 and shoves it hard against Laughlin's mouth
Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices
Live or die
(') Do what  tell you, you not only get to live, but maybe you'll pick up some money
(still breathless) Just tell me
First things first
Main thing, you work for me, otherwise  get you
If  don't, six months from now one of my friends will

Jimmy
How's it going
(shaking hands, laughing) Good to see you, Doc
(handing him a paper) It's all there, departure, arrival - everything except the $500
Doc pays him, looks closely into his eyes
Jimmy hasn't changed and it's set
How's Mama and the kids
Growing -- all of them - every day

My lady'11 come in in about five minutes

() 94
: He picks up the room key
Doc starts for the elevator
(') When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase
He took the day off
Then you do it
Can't leave the desk
Doc gives Laughlin a half-pissed look, then crosses to the elevator and pulls the cage door open
, self-service elevator move upward
He reaches for the desk phone

The phone begins to
Fran looks over to Rudy from her overstuffed armchair
Okay, Grunt, pick it up
- She walks slowly, carrying the heavy suitcase
Reaching the door to room 31oj Carol knocks rapidly three times, waits, then raps out two sets of two knocks
The door swings open and Doc stands within the archway
She enters
Doc shuts the door and slips his arms around Carol, revealing his
45 automatic in one hand

Fran is getting dressed in the middle of the room, her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines of the bra and girdle

3L8 ,      as she vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue left from their cross-country flight
windows facing across to the building next to Laughlins
The fire escape is one story beneath him
Doc crosses, throws the suitcase on the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open
He stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom
He withdraws his hand, holding four visas
He puts two of them on the bureau drawer top
the other two he begins to tear into sections and places them into a large ashtray
He touches a match to the scraps
'  in the ashtray
-    - , , ' , ; the
45 automatic sits beside it
Doc's overcoat also lies across the bedpsread, near it the wrapped shotgun
The poster is again on the wall
still in the bathroom of room 318
She wears only a slip
Carol is washing out her bra and panties in the washbasin, using a coarse bar of soap
Doc enters; he begins taking off his shirt
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute
Great
'm going to sleep twelve hours
Ten
Laughlin's going to take us across at four
(mild complaint) Oh, Jesus
how
() 96
: Jeep
There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east
He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast
we've got a 9 o'clock flight
(smiles) 'll be ready
(down) Yeah
What's wrong
(shrugs) don't know
Get in the shower
You'll feel okay
(smile) Whatever you say
The door shuts behind them, Rudy guides Fran to the stairs
318 , Tired, he closes his eyes, rests the side of his head against the tile

Her eyelids slowly fall shut
Carol has pushed the suitcase, overcoat and

He quickly pulls his pants on
What is it
Laughlin
He's always got his family around
that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses
So what
If they are not here, he must have sent them away
3l8a passing several rooms
Fran's face is taut
Rudy starts his nervous grin
,
You're crazy
(hard) Get your clothes on, move your butt
She looks at him, doesn't move
Sorry
Look, 'm clean
want to get some rest
() 98
: She is interrupted by a hard knock on the door
Doc drops his shirt to the floor
He quickly reaches down, lifts his
45
Doc gestures to Carol
she moves towards the door
(') (continuing; now at doorway) Who is it
Fran stands at the door to 318
Rudy is at her shoulder; he has taken out his revolver
It's your food,  brought up your sandwiches
318 Carol standing near the door
, looks at Doc
He mouths and half-whispers: Stall
Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room
He begins forcing the lock
Just leave it outside the door
'm not dressed right now
After a moment: can't do that, ma'am
You have to pay now so  can pay back the boy that went out and got the food
working on the door; his
45 shoved into the waistband of his pants
thinking hard
All right
You'll have to hold on a minute, my husband's in the shower
breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his automatic, then gingerly cracks the door
His eyes tighten in amazement as he sees: () 99
: , his
44 held tightly up to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use
Rudy and Fran are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door
They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter fashion
, -; he decides on a course of action
The door swings quietly open
,     between himself and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun, too late, as Doc's
45 crashes against his head
Rudy drops
Fran screams
Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed
He falls abruptly
Doc stands over the fallen body
Fran continues to scream
Doc finally turns away from Rudy, looking now at the screaming woman
He flattens her with a left hook to the jaw
Fran drops to the floor as if she had been shot
Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent
'
He lies without movement
318 Open it up, it's me
Carol swings the door open
Doc bursts back into the room, grabs his shirt, begins to button it
(') (continuing) Come on, come on
Who was it
Just get your clothes on
318 they step over the fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator
Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy
Doc pulls her along, forcing her to keep moving
Carol again carries the brown suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun
They go down the back (or front) stairs
100
Within an alcove behind and to one side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk
The Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the hotel3 acting as lookout
of the heavy chair to use as a club
The thug turns back to the desk where Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned
Just tell us the room number
He is very frightened but says nothing
Now you want to tell me
McCoy's in 318
, the other guy's in 420
Sure about that
He again whacks Laughlin's knee
,,
main entrance
They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the Accountant
Doc
Doc and Carol freeze for an instant
The Accountant snaps his fingers twice
Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain and Hayhoe
The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol
(calmly to his men) Out here
() 101
: ,         the Accountant
They look over his shoulder toward the rear of the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol
, around the
45
Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in front of herself, almost like a shield
The distance between Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk
Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden staircase
Just have her set it down
Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture revealing that his palm is empty
You want it
Come and take it
(quietly) Get him
As the three men reach for their guns
, levels the disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement
The reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast and he is hit painfully
The other   three men duck away from the sudden burst of fire power
Another shot from Doc's riot gun
this one breaking open the floor at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees
Cannon, Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover
They miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring
She struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate
45 to use with his right
102
Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull the door shut
Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol
All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their hands
Still below the first level landing, their eyes search overhead
The  of Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard
, points his gun directly up and fires
landings as Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister supports
the arrow indicator pass "Two
" 45      He fires two shots back down the stairwell
Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a
45 slug tears through his hip, the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder
, he points his 54l revolver straight up
empties it
'
Doc pulls Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar
by Doc's blast
Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward
Cannon following
"" ,     corridor
The Accountant remains within the elevator
,    ,     , runs ahead of Doc by three steps
They pass the second landing, keep moving upwards towards the third
() 103
: Doc's focus of attention is downward
He knows that he and Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces
His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly wobbles to his feet
Rudy looks down at Fran
she sobs violently, her back leaning against the wall
Rudy picks up his
44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's room
He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door
,     five steps behind
45 Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised
He moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator
The Accountant is still within the elevator
Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc
The of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering
45
Carol senses a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her
As Carol screams: Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor
his plane of movement knee high
,, the riot gun in his left hand,
45 in his right
The killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun
his aim destroyed by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of their mark
the riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator
The plaster flies away revealing further damage
The cables are smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward
, , line catching within the pulley housing
The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car
104
the floor level
The Accountant bounces from the floor of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor
Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain
He sees the suspended car through the iron grill door
The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the elevator
His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle
his 45 ready for an appearance by Swain
Reloading completed, he stands, with Carol
He again begins to move upward
,
45 on 562 the banister
He waits
on the winding staircase below him there is a dark movement
The thug is obliterated by the firepower
He again resumes his flight upward
' ,  splashing water over himself
Carol's underwear is still present
Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray
No further avenues open, they turn down the corridor
Doc grabs Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the door shut
,    ,  off the shade, lifts the frame, looks
The drop is too far
He grabs Carol and runs into the hallway
Over the door is the sign "Fire Escape
" 105
He aids her with his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his right
He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows
They reach the end
The fire escape stays rigid
Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps
He turns and with the suitcase crosses to the end
Throws the bag and the shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall, preparing to jump
holding his 44
He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun
Carol screams
(flesh wound)
In the air he spins and lands
Rudy fires again and again as he runs down the fire escape
Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun and fires
'
against the wall and off the fire escape
the six feet
mutely, as she sinks beneath the retaining wall
(his hand out) Jump
And she does
He catches her and pulls her up
They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind they walk into the alley
, , a tough, grizzly Western is about to pull out
Doc opens the back door and Carol gets in
Doc opens the front door as Slim turns and looks at him
() 106
: (
45 in hand, pointing) Drive
Suit yourself
He lets out a yell and guns across the lot over the four foot drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the street
(') (grinning) How was that
(smiling in spite of himself) Just fine
Where we go in1
Mexico
'd like to find a quiet place to cross
Why not
The car pulls forward as the light blinks to green
,   cars can be seen arriving at the front of Laughlins
The car continues moving up the street, then makes a right onto a larger boulevard
Doc half turns to Carol
You okay
(nodding) Where do we go from here
don't know, airport  guess
() 107
: They will have our description before we can get a plane
(way down) Yeah
guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you
kinda doubt it
Slim is obviously pleased that some excitement has come into his life
That's good
'll cooperate, don't worry about that
yes sir, 've had some trouble with the law myself
Doc and Carol look at the man
(') Three years ago  dynamited some fish at the reservoir
(beginning to laugh) Oh my God
That little job cost me a hundred dollars
didn't even get to keep the fish
(resigned to the insanity of the moment) Let's just get to the border
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up
'Bout an hour
Quiet crossing that is
- At the white line a Mexican   emerges from the station house
As he looks inside the car: () 108
: Buenas tardes
Your destination
(speaking right up) Chihuahua
gonna do some sightseeing
The Official smiles and motions them past
Which way
Juarez - Chihuahua City road
Don't you want to go to the airport
Not now
How long before this car's hot
(after a moment) Pull over
Slim stops the car near the soft shoulder of the dirt road
Doc looks at Slim
(') (continuing) Listen
how much money did you make this year
(slightly offended) What's it to you
(patient) Come on
How much
'Bout five thousand
() 109
: How about if  buy your car for ten grand
You serious
Sure am
And  keep my mouth shut
That's what  want
don't report the car and  don't know either of you
You got it
How about twenty thousand
- How about thirty
(delighted) Done, by God
Doc turns to Carol
Pay the man
As she begins to open the suitcase
' You're going to have to walk back to the border
Don't worry about me, 'll grab a cab
can afford it, you know
() 110
: Slim steps out of the car, Carol moves into the front seat as Doc slides behind the wheel
(') (continuing, leaning through the window) Hope you get to where you're going
Thanks
Hope you do too
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister
(laughs) Well,  paid a hell of a price
Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut
(his pride hurt) Wish you hadn't said that
When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed
(smiles) Go with God
into gear
One thing though
how do  explain this to my wife
Tell her you robbed a bank
The car pulls forward
Slim waves goodbye, then turns and begins walking back down the highway
, Are we going to make it
Hell,  don't know
but we sure gave it a run
() 111
: (positive with a small smile) Whatever happens
we're going all the way
(smiles) Yeah, why not
We're the good guys
guess we are
After a moment: Why don't you try the news
Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is heard
No more news, from now on we're just going to listen to music
She spins the dial
Mariachi music comes on
,
What now
We walk
,    now a dot in the background
Another dot appears, grows bigger, as it gets closer it is a bus
Very Mexican but very Greyhound in appearance
Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down
It pulls to a stop, they board
The bus pulls out
They sit
Mexico rolls by outside the window
They look at each other and smile
() 112
: (
) Hey
Doc and Carol look back
, his empty fist cocked up like a pistol
He grins
(pulling the trigger) Bang
Doc and Carol look at him
