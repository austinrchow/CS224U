The  of an answer phone as we hear  peeing, in a far off bathroom

Suddenly she stands and makes her way to the train door

51 wedged in the back of the cab, with  and as they are lost eating one another's faces
Looking uncomfortable,  frequently takes glimpses in the rear view mirror
and  continue making out
It's almost animal

52 dimly lit street- cab is pulling up
opens the door
've got it, 've got it
Get out, get out, get out, get out

(') Come here, come here, come here, come here
Finally  steps out of the cab,  lifts her over his shoulder
42
() Oh, God

Get off
Get off

How did that work
Get off me
starts to enter thru the revolving door
follows Ah come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
is left alone to pay the driver
53
'  -
53 waits in the lobby, pressing the button for the elevator
An elevator arrives
He ignores it and sits down
54
/
54 Darkness- enter his apartment door
He hears giggling from his bedroom
(
) () Well,  am hot,  am hot
(
) You are hot
/ (
) ( and chatter) walks to his kitchen
hits the kitchen cabinet in frustration
He walks into the living area and paces
considers, looking out through the window, he sits on the ledge, wringing his hands
43
(
) No
(
) () (
) You're cursing me
need to take this off
'm hot

) What if  kiss you right here
About here
takes off his shoes and starts to undress
We hear and  making love
(
) () (
) Yeah
doesn't want to hear
stands back against a wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more
His breathing is irregular
Something of the past has come to the present
All of his distractions have now stopped, and he is at once confronted with himself
His face bears the pain of something long passed, but visually present
This wound has not healed
Jolting himself out of his trance,  hurriedly heads out into the corridor- 55
55 pulls running gear from the hallway closet an exits, leaving the   of  and ,  , 56
56 dimly lit street- 44
just visible in his apartment block steady on the approach
He is dressed in running gear
Pushing the glass doors open,  hesitates and presses a button on the iPod Nano on his arm
He stretches, zips his top, pulling his hood up
slips his earphones on, moving off
57
57 running past illuminated windows and neon lights
The city is alive
stays focused, running, music pumping in his head
58
58 Later enters his apartment checking for noises
The sound of movement in the bathroom
He pushes open his bedroom door
It's like a murder scene
Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex
lone condom disregarded on the floor
We see his bedside drawer ajar
He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut
59
59 Later - lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight on
enters
opens his eyes, inwardly flinches
gets into the bed, covering herself with the white sheet
Snuggles up to have to be up and out by seven
inhales through her teeth
(to herself) It's cold
Uncomfortable - 45
Sissy, get out of my room
doesn't move
(') Sissy, get out of my room
All this time,  has not looked at , staring up to the blank ceiling
He  at the top of his lungs- (') gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and slowly walks around the bed
the bedroom door on her exit
60
60 Midday- The office is in full flow- crosses it, clearly worse for wear
wheels a computer out of 's office
(in passing) Hey slacker, your computer's back

Hey
You like your sugar
(nods/ smiles) do
is still standing, waiting
They look at each other
Eventually she turns and walks out
63
63 stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward the Hudson River, the  of murky water, audible
He hovers for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back to the main road
The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond
64
64 Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny still lives
comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans
Above him, engraved in stone is "1949
" He looks up toward the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin building
Stark and authoritative
slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window, a   ushers him away
, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans and t-shirt, paces along the window
Catching sight of , she  the curtain along the length of the glass
stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up
just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster
And then  sees her- stands, naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson River
The steady back and forth of the behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck
50
hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment 's eyes lock with the   's dead gaze, standing high above- - turns, his hypnotism broken
It's as if he comes back to himself
65
65 distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street- waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink, clearly there for some time
Her eyes checking the room, with quiet concern
stands watching from a distance- makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter until- 66
66 enters the restaurant
Hi
Hello- Hello

Yes, 'm glad you made it
Oh, yeah

Great

The  smiles, at last moves off- They sit looking at their menus
steals a moment, eyes tracing over- 's fingers playing with the edge of her menu- The flutter of her lashes- Nipples ghosting her dress
An ring indent around her wedding finger, the shrink of skin
So ( ) Where do you live

Born and raised

Great choice

Gave it a shot

No
Wow

Well, you just seem, like

averse to the whole idea
Well, yeah

Especially nowadays, mean, it's
You know

In relationships
57
It doesn't seem realistic
considers, lips grazing the rim of the glass
Are you serious

Yeah,  am, really
() Well, then, you know, why are we here, if we don't matter to one another
Well
Why are you here
The food's supposed to be really great here

'm not
'm not saying it like that

One person for the rest of your life
mean, it's mean, you know, you come to restaurants, you see couples sitting together and they don't even speak to one another
They don't have anything to say, they don't have anything
They probably don't have to speak because they're connected
Or they're just bored with one another
Every
The  approaches, a bottle of wine in hand

67
67 dirty grey street, brightened by the glow of  and seated inside the restaurant
68
68 - and  stand heady from the wine and a little awkward in the freezing cold- They walk- 59
sneaks a side glance,  smiles
It's freezing
They're breath and bodies steaming as they walk
Thank you
Look, touch that
bows, pointing to the back of his head
Your head
turns to touch 's head
As she does so, he at her, like a little dog
shrieks
They  laugh
(') () Oh, no, no, no
() You're such a
Weirdo
She pushes him playfully
No, seriously, seriously
Touch it
There's a massive knot on the back of his head
(') Oh, my God
Do you feel that
Yeah, what is it
It's a remnant
remnant
60
Yeah, from the Neanderthals
There's only a few of us left since the homo sapiens took over
() Hmm
That would explain the forehead
What's that supposed to mean
`What's that supposed to mean
' What do you mean
() No, seriously, how did you get it
()  used to play this game with my cousin
Hm-hmm
Where  would sit on his feet and he'd fly me through the air
hit my head on the ceiling and blacked out
They both laugh
Marianne laughs hysterically
laughs along
(') was knocked out for 5-10 minutes
peed my pants
(Reacts Sympathetically) Oh
If you had a choice to live in the past or future and you could be anything you wanted, what would you be
What would you be
always wanted to be a musician in the sixties
61
That's cool  musician
Yeah
Sixties is tough though

It kind of seemed like hell

() Yeah, the sixties would be the last place 'd want to be
No way
Yes
Eugh, chaos
So where would you wanna, and what would you wanna be
Erm
You know
Here, now
That's boring Fuck you
() Still walking along,  thinks for a moment turns and stares at , holding his gaze blushes
There's a silence as they walk on
They get to a subway entrance
(') Well, this is me
nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet- This is you
They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward
62
Thank you very much Brandon
Thank you very much
We should do this again
They loiter on the edge of something more
Right
hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of uncertainty
descends into the depths of the subway, with a half wave
So, is that a yes
(
) Maybe, yeah
69
69 The  of the door- enters
The sound of the record player, which had finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable
Pulling off his jacket- Hello
Sissy
- puts the needle back in it's dock
hangs up his jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room
He spies all 's crap spilling out across the floor- He sighs
Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge
70
70 The lock of the front door rotates
Someone is entering the apartment
Darkness- bursts through the door, in a hurry
63
After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of light into the darkness
From the blackness we see  framed, masturbating in front of the bathroom sink
, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door handle, transfixed by a naked
As  instinctively turns,  runs from view
slams the door shut
(
) Oh
Fuck
() Fuck
looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and bewilderment and deep embarrassment
Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage
He hits the wall in frustration
(') Fuck
71
71 opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his waist, looking for
What
Are you fucking spying on me
() Lock the fucking door, Brandon
() Are you fucking spying
(Mimicking him) Uhh
Are you fucking spying
leans over , pushes her down onto the sofa
(') Fuck
() Brandon
() What do you want
What do you want
climbs onto , straddling her
64
Oh, you wanna fight
You wanna fight
You wanna fight
You wanna fight
() Yeah
You want some of this
You want some of this
's towel falls down as he forcefully pins her down
() You wanna fight
You wanna fight
You wanna
() What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Brandon
shakes  by the shoulders
She reacts, upset now
() What do you want
() () Get off me
() Why did you come here
Why
() Get off me
Get off me
Why
() Get of me
Why
Ow
You're fucking hurting me
() Talk to me
You fucking bitch
() Fucking get the fuck off, you fucking weirdo
stands and exits
shouting after him
65
(
) Fucking slut
72
72 locks the bathroom door
He exhales, letting the moment slowly pass until- (
) Brandon- lowers himself onto the floow, desperately struggling with his emotions- He closes his eyes, eyelashes fragile and flickering until- opens them, reaches a hand out, almost mechanically, turns up the shower, the room now swirling in steam, trying to drown 's voice out
(
) (') Brandon, 'm sorry
closes his eyes, tears pricking- 73
73 walking back from kitchen, resigned- 's laptop on and open on his desk
approaches it, sinking down in front of the illuminated laptop
She absently taps the mouse, dragging open a series of held windows, the shifting lights of the screen cast across her face, revealing- Slowly 's face changes, a blurred smorgasbord of porn sites, graphic and obscene, their colors reflecting across her face and body
An escalating collage of graphic images, obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom
The images haunting, brutal, from the weird to the sadomasochistic
The open windows, an endless stacking of obscene chatroom conversation, emails posted with graphic sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form
is taken aback and strangely intrigued- Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a woman legs splayed- 66
Hey, where's Brandon
Are you Brandon's girlfriend
Do you want to play
looks closer, mildly appalled
(') Do you wanna play with my tits know Brandon would really like it
And  know exactly what Brandon likes
picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom
takes her coat and leaves the apartment
74
74 - The thump of music- sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder, hands grasping his hair
Then suddenly he enters the whole contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag
Then,  moving like a dervish through the apartment, a black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone numbers on the back
moves on, picking up anything he can find
An old jacket, elbows worn
handful of old t-shirts
He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing more crap along the way, one of 's dirty thongs on the floor
He picks it up, moving on
75
75 An open fridge- tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by date mush into the bag
Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an old joint, magazines all get dumped on route
heads out, picking up more detritus along the way, old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones- pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads down along the corridor
67
76
76 strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers smelling and cracked from under a chair
He peers up, looks around the room almost bare- His laptop resting on his desk
stops, considers, initially resistant and then something finally compels him to do it- He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall
Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff
Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the heaving bag of crap out into the corridor
The  of the front door- 77
77 heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on the sidewalk
pile of black garbage bags already piled up along the street in waiting for collection
Further down the street a   holds hands, walks by the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk
goes past- The  banter of a
heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door firmly
78
'
78 , now the voyeur, looks across the room, into 's office
He studies her, almost like prey
The moment seems to last a lifetime
There is much want in 's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable
Suddenly, and without any warning,  walks into his dream, entering 's office, and pulls her behind a partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately
She responds, startled, but happy to be taken
She surrenders
They pull away, looking at one another
She smiles, laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on
Come on
leads  away
68
79
79 and  stepping out of a cab,  leading , both giggling and tripping
Where are you taking me
() Come on
You'll see stops
She smiles, quizzically, allowing herself to be guided and yet- No, where are we going
() Come on
80
80 snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top of the white water tank in the toilet
Exiting, we see  looking out onto the Hudson from the large hotel window
81
81 enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink
Watching  at the window
You wanna drink
He pours a drink from the mini bar
(') What are you looking at
The view is amazing
approaches nervously, standing next to her
Hey
leans up and kisses
() 69
takes 's hand and leads him to the bed
We see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender touches
caresses 's face and kisses both his eyes
attempts to do the same to , slowly but surely
This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's flesh
rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites giggles
() Are they vintage
little bit
() The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for each other's breasts and thighs
At the height of this passionate encounter, 's attention strangely, slowly starts to fade
It's as if the intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him
He recoils, unable to continue
Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing heavily
's face is one of puzzlement and hurt
She looks at  for some kind of answer
He gets up
, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her skirt, adjusts her hair
82
82 Late afternoon sunlight seeping across the room- sits at the edge of the bath looking out onto the view
Brandon
Erm
looks at him, the moment fragile
She does up her bra
(') You know, it's cool
It's
(') Should  go
Sure
70
Hurt,  put on her top, picks up her bag and makes to leave (') can walk you down
(
) That's
- looks back out over the grey of the Hudson River
's face is one of embarrassment and failure
The  of the door,  gone
The  of the traffic, audible through an ajar window
reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering down, a man on the edge
83
83 banging the life out of  , doggy style, tits pressed up against the glass of the window- The   of horns
84
84 The trawl of cars- The grey of the Hudson River- and the   just visible high above, caught full frontal in the window- 85
85 close to climax- cold sweat beading 's forehead as he comes, face twisted before the slow seep of release
withdraws, laughs
The   laughs as well
turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful
smiles, already pulling on her underwear watches her, pulling on a tiny thong
She looks up, stares at him
looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame
71
Can  get you a drink
hesitates, smile, shakes her head
No
nods
fingers fastening a cheap nylon bra
(') Fuck
Need a hand
The hooks odd- (') () There you go
86
86 sits on the bed, now alone, caught in the half light of dusk- The rise and fall of a distant lift
87
87 is sitting on the couch, watching a cartoon enters the apartment, on her cell phone
ignores her (
) (into phone) David
Pick up take it you're at your pottery class
hangs up
(
) (') Have you eaten
No
(
) Are you hungry
No
Sits down next to  on the couch
72
Can you just give me a hug
puts him arm around her
She snuggles up to him
He's not gonna screw you again
()
You left a message didn't you
You can't help yourself

88 's reflection in the window as the train travels
76
We see that  has a nasty cut on his cheek
89
89 Earlier that night- sits, drinks alone at the bar- An   paws a    plying her with drinks, knocking them back much to his delight
watches, catching the eye of a girl () walking towards the bar, her friends playing pool- Hey- Hey
smiles, as she leans against the bar, her breasts spilling out of her -shirt
(') (close to) You want to get out of here
giggles- (') could take you somewhere
looks over at her   just visible across the bar talking to a couple of
(') What

like the way it's just me and it
wanna taste you
like to slip my tongue inside you- leans in closer, her lips blotting the edge of a glass overfilled with beer
(') just as you come

The   reacts as  shoves his fingers under his nose
() Yo
The   shoves
Jesus, come on
You mother fucker
laughs, sips his drink- 90
90 is rounding a corner, doing up his jacket
The runs out after him
Hey, Romeo
He spins  around and punches him
The slip and slide of 's shoes, his face smashed against the sidewalk
The   comes in hard again, kicking him, sharp in the ribs
recoils yet almost seems to want more as he struggles to stand
He spits on
91
91 walking, aimless and bleeding- The  of taxi's streaking past- 79
seated outside a bar, drinking and smoking, lost in their laughing conversation oblivious- walks on- with a satchel roughly brushes past him- The   wavers on seeing  is crying, moving on- 's face head down wanting to get away
rush of  and    spilling out of a cinema- walking, disorientated, jaywalking through the traffic
The  of horns- ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller gets in his way until- 92
92 walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop signs- Across the street, a snaking queue of  wait in line outside a club
He keeps walking, eyes scouring- loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and hoods
93
93 lively bar; a couple of   entering- considers, goes to enter, barred by , who point him back along the cue- He stands in line- Across the street, a    eyes him
He stands smoking outside a heaving bar
looks away- pass, The  let them in with ease
reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with his phone to get into the club- Woah
Not tonight, buddy
80
ties to get in again
The  stops him a second time
(') said not tonight
The    over the street, flicks out his cigarette, eyes grazing over  as he re-enters the heaving bar opposite
considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets
Through the glass a heaving bar
considers, on the edge until- He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi streaking past
94
94 Fluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a beam on a lighthouse- heaving dance floor of  ,  , and , arms raised, dancing to the pulse of music
The   , walks away, waiting for  to follow
follows
95
95 Passing through a low hung door,  moves along a dark labyrinth of corridors, eyes grazing over- Dimly lit crevices,  caught briefly in light, lost in fellatio and stand up fucking- keeps walking, drawn towards a dark doorway- 96
96 An endless darkness, punctured with groans from dark cubicles- hesitates, foot slipping on the moist floor
Suddenly a hand reaches out, drawing him into the dark cubicle- The    presses  up against the wall, kissing him, tongue searching his mouth, rubbing along its roof, hungry and urgent
pulls away, hands gently yet forcefully pushing the down on his knees
81
looks beyond- down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole between walls
stands, legs splayed letting the    take him in his mouth
He is beautiful
The palm of 's hand pressed against the side of the cubicle
He stands, fucking the    in the mouth- The  of music heaving, the club rocking, punctured by groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within
throws his head back, gripping the cubicle wall
97
97 The early hours- , heading away
He clocks his phone, several messages from  logged
listens to his voicemail- (from ) Brandon, it's Sissy
really need to talk to you
Please
pockets his phone
98
98 Please will you pick up the fucking phone
stops and knocks on an apartment door
woman opens and  steps in
99
99 threesome
has sex with a  and
Throughout the images of the threesome, we hear more of 's Voicemail
We're not bad people
We just come from a bad place
Thanks for letting me stay
, at climax, his animalistic grimace turns to pain and anguish
82
100
100 The grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground- stands on a platform
It's not the rush hour yet
The  of the subway pulling in- boards the train
101
101 virtually empty car- sits- across the car, head lent against the window, half asleep, clearly at the end of a long shift
Above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising - 's eyes graze over the poster- He stands his reflection mirrored back at him, preparing for his stop- The train  to a sudden halt- Wheels  along the track- The   wakes- plugged headphone on, looks up from reading her book
inwardly curses
The train sits in the station
Doors not opening
The silence at last punctured by the  hum of the intercom- Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time, due to a police investigation, we have to discharge this train
Please follow the conductor to the rear of the train
The long low  of the intercom fading out- They wait
And wait in silence
leans his head against the glass, closes his eyes, a hangover kicking in
83
The other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly, wondering why the doors aren't opening in the station
Details of the carriage appear
Half-drunken cup of coffee
An old New York
Graffiti on all the car windows
They wait
Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way through the carriage that 's in, with the ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end
(
) Watch your step between cars
Passengers asking, "What's going on
" finally makes his way down with the other passengers to the last carriage
As he steps out, he looks down to his far left and sees a    being unraveled, and and  making their way to the far front of the train
102
102 , face bowed, sits talking to a giving a statement- Watch your step
Several  stand further down the platform surrounding a  - Follow, me please
Follow me
Two   talk to
(') Watch your step
This way
This way
Quickly This way
Nothing to see
Move on
(
) () Right this way, please
Move on
This way
84
makes his way past the wrought-iron gate with other passengers, going up the stairwell
103
103 climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes catching on- 's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room, discarded
picks up his pace
The intermittent  of sirens- emerging from the subway, already reaching for his cellphone- Beyond the glow of an ambulance- keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly distracted
He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his ear
The  of a distant phone ringing- The answer machine kicks in- This is Sissy
leave a message
Don't if you're an asshole
flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket picks up his pace
He flicks out his phone again
Tries again- (') This is Sissy
leave a me- is running now, heart beating fast now, breath quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash- Shit
he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk at pace
104
'  -
104 His finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by doing so will make it arrive quicker
85
105
'  -
105 enters into the elevator
The door shuts immediately behind him
106
'  -
106 Exiting,  heads along the faceless corridor, reaching his front door
He is already pulling out his keys and pushing them into the door with growing dread- 107
107 The sound of running water from the bathroom
stops with relief, leaning his forehead against the bathroom door, letting himself exhale- Sissy- - hesitates, a seeping concern pricking his skin- 108
108 walks into the bathroom, freezing on seeing- sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the toilet- The pump of blood seeping from her wrists, already pooled across the floor- reaches for  gripping her wrists, deep slashes scissoring the veins, the flap of skin, flaying- pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash, blood seeping between his fingers- looks at her wrist, every time he moves his fingers, he releases the pressure the blood flows
grips them tighter, a quiet determination to stop the bleeding- The skid of blood underfoot,  cradles her in his arms, grappling with his phone, desperately calling 911
desperately holds her, cradled between his legs, his fingers pressing her wrists, temporarily stemming the flow of blood, the phone wedged between shoulder and chin
86
The slip of 's wrist through 's fingers
He slams down the phone, struggling to hold her in his grasp
She slips again
109
109 head bowed
Sitting by Sissy's bedside- lies, sleeping, skin white, strapped to a drip
The gentle rise and fall of her breath
's gaze falling on  lying in the hospital bed, her wrists bandaged
, eyes falling on the scars covering her arms
He reaches out a hand, on the edge of touching them, letting his fingers hover over them until finally- lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm
She stirs a little but- 's eyes just opening, focusing on him until- (murmuring) Shithead
Relief overwhelming , he laughs, exhales on the edge
turns to stroke 's hair, rests his head next to hers
She sleeps again
110
110 now walking along the side of the river, railings seemingly speeding up his journey
Beyond, the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch out toward the open river
111
111 The endless grey of the Hudson River, close now- walking along a concrete jetty- rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging along the jetty until- reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out- The  of grey water beneath
87
stands, a hangover kicking in- And at once  is crying, the tears flowing slow at first until they rush, like floodgates opening
He reaches for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion- sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body shuddering
The  of the water steady now- sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River
Far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of traffic kicking in- The froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking, back and forth
112
112 stands in his familiar spot on the platform, waiting for the train that will take him to work
Wearing a vacant face, the train pulls into the station
boards
He takes a seat automatically, as if pre-programmed
The train leaves the platform
113
113 Looking into no man's land,  feels the heat of someone's gaze
As he instinctively looks up to respond, a mixture of surprise, fear, excitement and doubt across his face
The    who we met at the beginning of our story is staring down at , this time in a more engaging fashion
She looks because she wants to be looked at
Again, a dance begins
This time, she leads
Engaged, active, decisive
's face is fractured into many conflicting emotions
It's as if a magnet is drawing him in, but at the same time he's trying to resist
At this moment, the    stands up, eyeing as she makes her way to the door, blocking  as the train pulls in to her stop
88
114
114 The train pulls away from the station and disappears into the tunnel
We do not know if  is still aboard or has succumbed to his urges
