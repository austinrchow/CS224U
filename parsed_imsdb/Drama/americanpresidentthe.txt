- It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building
on this for a moment before we : - presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff
Liberty's moving
Another  rounds the corner into the corridor and is followed a step or two later by 's walking with his personal assistant, , a shy, professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old
The 10:15 event's been moved inside to the Indian Treaty Room
(to Janie) The 10:15 is American Fisheries
Yes, sir
They're giving you a 200-pound halibut
Janie, make a note
We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish
starts to make a note
Yes, sir
Janie,  was kidding
Of course, sir
(to the  at the elevator) Hey, Cooper
'Morning, Mr
President
and  enter the elevator
As the doors close
Mr
Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning
Is he upset about the speech last night
He seemed concerned
Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something  did Sunday night
The elevator doors open, revealing
At 32, is the President's chief domestic policy advisor
It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down
You skipped the whole paragraph
(to Janie) And Monday morning it is
falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn
"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"
and then nothing
You dumped the whole handguns paragraph
This is a time for prudence, Lewis
That was the kick-ass section
The three of them are now  and making their way down the   that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing
thought what with being the President and all
Sir, of course  didn't mean to imply-- thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval
That's great news, sir, but
They walk past a  who's at work at a patch of grass
'Morning, Mr
President
Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, quickly and quietly said-- Charlie
'Morning, Charlie
Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation
For what
,  and  walk through the door being held open by an
The conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of - They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with , Because you dropped the whole kick-ass section, now we've got this thing hanging out there
There's a thing hanging out there
"Americans can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society
" Then
nothing
No explanation
No context
So now it's just this thing
And it's hanging out there
Yes, sir

Did they tell you 'm gonna need-- () --overall consumer spending and not just first homes
Yes, sir
We'll have it for you in 15 minutes
Thanks
moves on
and  stay with him
Mr
President,  really feel we need to focus on
Lewis, however much coffee you drink in the morning,  want you to reduce it by half
don't drink coffee
Then hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat, would you please
Another  crosses their path-- Happy birthday, Laura
Hey, Laura, happy birthday
() Thank you, sir
Once out of earshot-- (to ) should send her some flowers
You already did, sir
And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into - In the  ,

She stands as walks in-- Good morning, Mr
President
How're you, Mrs
Chapil
Fine, thank you, sir
Mr
Kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you
He seemed to indicate that it was very good news
Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate
And by now they're in the   itself
has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him
As someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time
Lucy called just a moment ago
You forgot to sign her permission slip for her class-- --the museum trip
'll go get it
(to ) What time does she get home today
Three-twenty
How's my afternoon look
Very crowded
Schedule some time for me at 3:30
(
) Buenos dias, Senor Presidente
This from  McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the President's press secretary, as she strides into the room
Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico
didn't truly appreciate it until came back and discovered that America isn't a great society
(to ) He dumped a whole section
Now there's a thing hanging out there
Not a great society, sir
Well, with you out of the country, it wasn't, Robin
Now that you're back, we're great again
There's a press room full of people saying "What did he mean by that
" See
(re: a memo he's been looking at) , did you get one of these
This is said to
as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room
In addition to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor, he's the President's closest and oldest friend
Is that the letter from Solomon at the
It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community
These people are outta control
think they're just frustrated, Mr
President
Are they blaming the President for global warming
Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean
(continuing; to ) Sir, 'm on the phone with these people twice a week
honestly don't know what they want at this point
What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions
It won't pass at 20 percent
We haven't really tried
Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers
If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year
Talk to the  again,
Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment
Tell them 'll send 455 to the floor
But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction
If they want to pull their support, fine
At 63 percent job approval rating
don't need their help getting a bill passed
We gotta get going-- where's Leon
(to an ) Would you call Mr
Kodak and tell him the President's-- 's sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office-- (
) Aaagh
(
) Sorry
Sorry, my fault
(to the ) Never mind
comes into the oval office
The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz
He, along with
, , and , are regarded as the President's Starting Team
The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years
Excuse me
Good morning, Mr
President
You all right
They keep moving that big ficus plant
We're all here, Mr
President
Okay
First,  wanted to say congratulations
Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job
Wait a second
You wanted me to poll registered voters
Everyone
even  smiles
But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory
So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear
Can  tell my morning press gaggle that gun control-- Crime control, Robin
Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime
Hang on, are we not-- Lewis-- Are we not putting back the handgun restrictions
We're leaving 'em out
Sir, we campaigned on this issue
Now,  understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now
After the elections
Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again
Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do
We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis
We need it to get re-elected
For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime
Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon
As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda
Got it
Leon, you're gonna run the war room
We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week
And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn
Do what the
does
Scare the shit out of 'em
Yeah
can do that
Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this
You're gonna run the show on the hill
Can  just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers
responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper
Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win
Yes, sir
We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today
The last nose count put us 18 votes short
Eighteen votes in 72 days
Thank you, everyone
Janie, what's next
Thank you, Mr
President
The meeting's over
, , and  say their "Thank you, Mr
President"'s as they exit
Security briefing, sir
: - It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district, in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays
- On the seventh floor of the building
tells us where we are by answering the phone-- (
) Global Defense Council
(
) You wanted to see me
(
) just got off the phone with
MacInerney
: '  - , a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with , a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way to create an issue where none exists
Did the President read the letter
The President's pissed as hell, Susan
That letter was a stupid move
It was aggressive, and we should stand by every-- This isn't the guy who needed us four years ago, Susan
He's incredibly popular
He's gonna win re-election in a walk, and he could give a shit what we stand by
If the President passes the most important piece of environmental legislation in history, and does it despite our negative endorsement, our political weight in the future will rank somewhere below the Save the Spotted Owl Society
(beat) 'm bringing in some help
We don't need another environmental expert to confirm what every other environmental expert-- Not an environmental expert, a professional political strategist
We're playing hardball with Andrew Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat
Who
Sydney Ellen Wade
Oh Christ
That woman doesn't know the first thing about the environmental lobby
She's a closer, Susan
She gets the job done
: - and  -- working on a speech
Try it like this and lose that
(entering) David Sasser from the Times called and wanted to know what the White House felt was a great society
What did you tell him
told him  couldn't speak for the President, but for my money: Bermuda
Perfect
steps in-- Mr
President, your cousin Judith's come down with the flu and won't be able to join you Thursday night
That's too bad
Remind me to give her a call later
Yes, sir
You gonna go stag
That's not a problem
No
We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower
The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone
(continuing) My God
(beat) can't believe  said that
(beat) Mr
President, that was an incredibly thoughtless remark
would never dream of insulting you or the memory of your wife
That's okay, forget it
(to ) What time is it
It's 3:45, sir
'm gonna go over and say hi to Lucy
You have the Attorney General at 4:00 and the trade representative at 4:30
Somewhere in there you promised five minutes
Mr
President-- Robin, don't worry about it
: - We  the sound of a  being played--not well--from one of the rooms
comes around and down the corridor
He walks into-- '  - , Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing
No, keep going
liked what you were playing
What's it called
Scales
Well
you play it with gusto
Are my lips swollen
Are they supposed to be
Yeah
Then you're doing fine
Whatcha got behind your back
little gift
Is it a dirt bike
Nope
He hands her an old textbook
Is it a really old seventh-grade textbook of yours that you're gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with
'm not comfortable with the "really old" part, but everything else you said was true
(reading the cover) "Understanding the Constitution
" Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week
You talked to Mr
Linder
Yes
It's called a Parent-Teacher Conference
Mr
Linder and  were the key player in that discussion
Why don't you like social studies, Luce
like it fine, Dad
All your other teachers say you're happy, you're enthusiastic, you've always got your hand up
Mr
Linder says you don't participate unless he calls on you, and even then it's a one-word answer
don't know what to say, Dad guess 'm just not
don't know
Luce, take a look at this book
This is exciting stuff
It's about who we are and what we want
Read what it says on the first page
(reading) "Property of Gilmore Junior High School
" The next page
(reading) "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union
" See
Grabs you right off the bat
It's a page-turner
can't wait
Good, 'cause it's possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight
Do you see it as part of your job to torture me
No, it's just one of the perks
See you tonight
He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door
Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief
" shoots her a look as we : - Where  is finishing a meeting with the ,      and a , each of whom is accompanied by at least one or
is also present
The - hardware's been in place for a month
We've got 22 instructors from the Army Air Defense School waiting to go down and train the Israelis
How soon can you deploy them
We can airlift 'em in the morning
They'll have - operational in 20 days
Any security concerns
If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now
Okay
Let's move on it
Thank you, gentlemen
and
leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of "good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr
President"'s
They pass
and
(continuing) Have a good evening, Mrs
Chapil
You too, Mr
President
starts his walk from the West Wing back to the residence
It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the in the morning
'll see you in the morning, Janie
You will, Mr
President
follows at a distance
#2 (sotto) Liberty is moving
Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the
It's about time
She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade
know this woman well
She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected
Maybe we should try to steal her
Ten percent,
Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that
You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello
It might smooth the way
Mention it to Janie
Good
Then let's clear this off the table and get everybody focused on the crime bill
don't want to win this
want to win it by a couple of touchdowns
We will, Mr
President
Good
starts to leave
stops him
(continuing) Yes
Listen, Robin said something to me today that 'm sure she wouldn't have said it if
mean, she wasn't saying it to me,  realize
(beat) Ah, never mind
Have a good night
Good night, Mr
President
, when we're out of the office and we're alone, you can call me Andy
beg your pardon
mean you were the best man at my wedding, for crying out loud
Call me Andy
(laughing off the suggestion) Whatever you say, Mr
President
They have reached the south entrance to the White House
(continuing) Have a good night, sir
Good night,
enters the White House
: - : - It's early morning of the following day, and the grounds outside are in full swing
- In front of the guardhouse, Susan and her new colleague, , are being cleared
(to the ) Hi, my name's Sydney Ellen Wade
He just needs your driver's license
hands the guard her license
(handing him her license) 'm from Virginia
He doesn't care
(to the ) 'm here for a meeting with Mr
MacInerney
He doesn't need to know that
The   her through the gate
(to the ) Forgive me, this is my first time at the White House
'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality
He doesn't know what Capra-esque means
(to ) Yeah,  do
Frank Capra, great American director -- It's a Wonderful Life, Mr
Smith Goes to Washington
(handing  and their laminated passes) Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia
Knock 'em dead
Thanks
and  begin to walk up the path toward the entrance to the West Wing
: - meeting with the  , the  , several  and  is breaking up
is ushering people out
The day the government starts subsidizing private schools is the day we give up on public education
know the proposal only scratches the surface, but it's the least we can do
We're already doing the least we can do, but  can't think of anything better, so we'll go with this for now
(to  ) Jerry, say hello to Linda for me
And if  don't see you again, have a good Thanksgiving
Thank you, Mr
President
The room has cleared
is arranging new papers on the President's desk
How're we doing
You're running four minutes ahead of schedule
Ahead
Yes, sir
(exited) Janie, this is unprecedented
don't know what to do with myself
Mr
MacInerney asked me to remind you to pop your head in on-- The  meeting
Right
: 's  - Your concerns are not falling on deaf ears
The environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the White House than President Shepherd
Hardly an impressive distinction,
is trying to avert the inevitable-- Sydney, we should leave Mr
MacInerney alone now
He's already given us more time than-- Susan, Mr
MacInerney doesn't want us to leave, because Mr
MacInerney's not yet done what he needs to do today
Sir, Ms
Wade's been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day
She hasn't even had a chance to read the report of the Quebec Conference
-- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes, check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides, instead, to hit the gas and swing away
The  are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck
You're right
haven't read it
If someone had asked me yesterday, 'd have told them the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams
But what  do know is that it's time for the President to run for president again
Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and 'm certain he's told the President exactly what 'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel
But if had read these eight hundred pages, would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the  is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration
(to ) It's really time to-- Susan,  promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news
No one in the room really understands what's going on
except
, who would like to take the time to admire but, of course, can't
(pause) 'm afraid Sydney's right
Although not about Michigan and California
The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent
There's an uncomfortable silence in the room
(continuing) The President is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the
The President's expecting our full support
Yes, he is
The President's dreamin',
Sydney
--the President has critically misjudged reality
If he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland
(
) Let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him
's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in person, The President of the United States
She is frozen
Mortified
If she were capable of thought process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now
Good morning, Mr
President
How are you today
Couldn't be better
(to the ) apologize for the interruption, but asked me to stop and say hello
You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you
Mr
President, 'm
don't know what to say
'm speechless
All evidence to the contrary
Mr
President, we haven't met
My name is Susan Sloan
used to work with Congressman Myers
hope this episode in no way-- Sydney
Yes, sir
You got a second
(quietly) Of course
gets up to leave
escorts her out of
's office and into the hallway
thought maybe we might have a word in private
Someplace a little less intimidating
(calling) Janie
Yes, sir
(to ) This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin
Janie, would you show Ms
Wade into the rec room
'll be there in a second
enters a doorway off of the hall
continues down the hallway
(to ) This way
leads  into
- where  just stands uncomfortably, not knowing whether to sit or stand
Waiting
Trying -- the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to notice things like the  Desk, the Seal of the President of the United States, the bust of Lincoln
strides in-- Sorry to keep you waiting
Mr
President-- Is it okay if  call you Sydney
Of course
Mr
President-- Have you ever been in the Oval Office
've just been on the regular tour
It didn't include
hear it's pretty good
Mr
President, what you saw in there was nothing more than vanity run amok
was showing off for a colleague who doesn't think very much of me
It'd be a real injustice for you to hold the accountable for my behavior today
On top of which, 'm monumentally sorry for having insulted you like that
Are you under the impression that 'm mad at you
(pause) Well
Sydney, seldom does a day go by that 'm not burned in effigy
Not by a professional political operative standing 30 feet from the Oval Office
No, 'll give you that
Mr
President-- Did you know that when the City Planners sat down to design Washington,
, their intention was to build a city that would intimidate and humble foreign heads of state
It's true
didn't know that
The White House has the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world
Learned that one the hard way
Sydney, this bill is important to me
Yes, sir, 'll convey your message
But you don't believe me
The  is asking for 20 percent, sir
It's not gonna pass at 20 percent
It's a long shot at 10
How do you know that until you put the full weight of the White House behind-- Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the House
It can't be done
But  tell you what
'll make you a deal with you
If you can get 24 votes, 'll get you the last 10
Twenty-four votes
If you can swing 24 votes by the State of the Union, 'll promise you full White House support
Do  have your word on that, sir
Absolutely
Listen, are you hungry
skipped breakfast
You wanna have some coffee
donut or something
Sir, 'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, 've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: The  has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war
The best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the  seriously
But 'm gonna give you one more
If you don't live up to the deal you just made, come New Hampshire, we're gonna go shopping for a new candidate
heads for the door-- You can't do that, Sydney
With all due respect, Mr
President, who's gonna stop me
Well, if you go through that door, the United States Secret Service
That's my private office
(pointing) You need to go out that way
(beat) Ah
, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the Oval Office
muses about what has just transpired
: - has converted one of the rooms on the second floor residence
His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is something he does almost as well as being President
stands to the side with his pool cue
McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know we're making our move on the crime bill
They're circling the wagons on the assault weapons
Should  meet with them
Let Lewis take a pass at them first
Fine
2 in the side
sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket
Nice shot, Mr
President
Nice shot, Mr
President
You won't call me by my name when we're playing pool
assesses the table
will not do it playing pool,  will not do it in a school,  do not like green eggs and ham,  do not like them Sam  am
At ease,
, and get away from the pocket
9 in the corner
makes the shot
Leo Solomon phoned
He said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning
lifts his cue for a moment
trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell
forgot to tell you
It's a waste of time
Not our time
makes a big push for the votes, and when they come up short, we move in with the softer bill, to get passed, we're everybody's hero
3 in the side
Also, Sydney Wade called
, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile
Sydney Wade
(beat) She wanted to apologize one more time for her behavior
3 in the side
Did she say anything about me
(beat) Sydney Wade
When she called
Did she say anything about you
13 in the corner
No, it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together
She threatened me and  patronized her and we didn't have anything to eat, but  thought there was a connection
is staring at him in disbelief
She didn't say anything about me
(quietly) Well, no, but  could pass her a note before study hall and-- Tell me this: Hypothetically, what would happen-- feel a nightmare coming on
1 in the corner
He misses the shot
--if  called Sydney and asked her to be my date at the State Dinner Thursday night
You're not serious
Don't  sound serious
The President can't just go out on a date
Why not
Jefferson did
Wilson did
You're not-- Wilson was widowed during his first term
He meets a woman named Edith Gault
He dated her, courted her, married her, and somewhere in there managed to form the League of Nations
Mr
President, this is an election year
If you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and-- don't want you to get me a girl, What is this, Vegas
No, sir, this is the White House
And 'm talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office
'm a single adult, and  met a woman that 'd like to see again socially
How's that different from what Wilson did
The difference is he didn't have to be the president on television
You've said it a million times: If there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair
What are you saying
We'll take a hit
How big
don't know
Five points
Maybe more
Five points we're standing here talking about
It could be more
drop five points when Wisconsin doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl
5 in the corner
Do you want me to have Kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about
Yeah
(beat) No
No
don't want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay, like 'm asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew
This isn't the business of the American people
Mr
President, the American people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business
like her,
(pause) Stop being my chief of staff for one minute
(beat) Give her a call
(calling out) Janie
(to
) She didn't say anything about me
She said you're taller than she thought you'd be
That's something
enters-- Yes, sir
need you to track down a phone number
: - Lined with red-brick, three-story walk-ups
: '  - few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as evidence that 's staying with her sister temporarily
, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a bottle of wine while , in a bathrobe and wet hair, tries to get off the phone
(into phone) Richard
Richard, it wasn't funny
acted like a college freshman at a protest rally
Tell him the part about walking out the wrong door
Oh God,  forgot about that
(back into phone) No, Richard
Richard,  don't want to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation
wanna hear it
'm hanging up now, Richard
Tonight
was gonna go to bed early and wake up when there's a new president
She hangs up
(continuing) The President must think 'm a third- rate jerk
If he thinks you're a jerk, 'm sure he thinks you're a first-rate jerk
'll tell you one thing, boy regrouped, you gotta gimme that
pulled it together at the end stood in the middle of the Oval Office and  made it very clear that from now on, he who doesn't take the seriously does so at his peril
And then you walked out the wrong door
Are you gonna be throwing that back at me the rest of my life
That's my current plan, yes
The
That's gonna be Leo Solomon
He said he'd call at nine
picks up the phone-- (continuing; into phone) Hello
Uh, hi, is this Sydney
doesn't recognize the voice-- (into phone) Leo
No, this is Andrew Shepherd
looks at  and rolls her eyes, then explains to her-- Andrew Shepherd
(back in the phone) You're hilarious, Richard
You're a regular riot
And we - between  and
Uhh
this isn't Richard, it's Andrew Shepherd
Oh, really
Well, 'm so glad you called, because  forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have
'm also impressed that you were able to get my phone number, considering don't have a phone
Good night, Richard

You want me to deal with him
No way
may choke in front of Shepherd, but Richard Reynolds can handle
She picks up the phone
(continuing) Hello
And we begin - again between the two
Sydney
Are you learning-impaired
Listen, do me a favor
Hang up the phone

Hang up the phone
Then dial 456-1414
When you get the White House operator, give her your name and tell her you want to speak to the President

: '  - 's still holding the phone and seems a little confused
an emotion which is about to be replaced by horror as the unbelievable into the reality
(to herself) This isn't happening to me
She dials
What's going on
(to herself) It's not possible  did this twice in one day
The  answers
(filtered) Good evening, the White House
swallows
(continuing; filtered) Hello
(quietly) My name's Sydney Ellen Wade
'd like to-- (
) (filtered) The President's expecting your call, ma'am
'll put you right through
: '  /  - He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings
He picks up the phone-- Hello
Mr
President, 'm sure there's an appropriate thing to say at this moment
Probably some formal apology for the nice-ass remark would be in order
just don't quite know how to word it
It's my fault
shouldn't have called you at home
Should  call you at the office tomorrow
No, sir, of course not
mean -- yes, you can call me anytime you want -- this is fine
Right now is fine
When  said "of course not,"  meat that
You know what
The hell with it -- 'm moving to another country
(smiling) What did you mean when you said you don't have a phone
just moved to Washington over the weekend, and my apartment isn't ready yet
This is my sister's apartment
Come to think of it, how did you get this number
(beat) How did  get the number
That's a reasonable question
don't know
Probably the
(trying to pretend it's just another guy on the phone) The
Sure
'Cause i-if you want to find someone and you're the president, that's who you would call
You know who else is good at that
The
Well, yeah, but  was thinking of the Internal Revenue Service
They have computer files that
Well
should stop stalling
As 'm sure you know, the French have elected themselves a new president, and we're having a formal state dinner at the White House, and was wondering -- and you're under no obligation at all -- but  thought it might be fun
was wondering if you maybe wanted to go
with me, and uh
there it is
That's why  was calling
There's a long silence on the phone
(continuing) Sydney
Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long to-- The President has asked me to join him in representing our country
'm honored
'm equal to the task
And  won't let you down, sir
(beat) Sydney, this is just a dinner
We're not gonna be doing espionage or anything
No
Of course
'm a little
uh
what do  do
,  mean, where do  go
Should  meet you
Will you
'm gonna have a very nice woman named Marsha Bridgeport call you
She's the White House Social Director, and she'll help you with anything you want
Now when she calls you and tells you her name is Marsha Bridgeport, it'll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt
Of course
'll see you Thursday night
Mr
President, thank you for asking me
Really
This is a first for me
Me too
They hang up
: - - large conference room at  has been converted for the use of a half-dozen  as well as ten or twelve interns, some of them high school age
sign on a corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days
" The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following numbers in descending order
There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns: ,  , ,  , and
Who's on Indiana

New people,  can't remember your names
Raise your hand if you're on Indiana
Two  raise their hands-- (continuing) Put your hands down -- you're on Illinois

We've got Jarrett

George Jarrett
He's ours
Solid "yes

(to an ) You
New guy
"Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota
" Slide his name on over to "for

" How'd you get the fence pole out of his butt
wish  could take credit
He just said, "Lewis,  support the President a hundred percent
" Not the bill, the President
We're gonna win this in a walk
It's like a kissing booth at a carnival
Give us a vote, get a photo-op with number 63

We gotta do one thing at a time
We don't have time to do one thing at a time

Is the Majority Whip takin' a break
Congress is in session, right, 'm not wrong about that

Terrific
She rips the "23" off, making it "22
"  reaches for her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils
In righting the pencils, she knocks over her coffee
You're awfully jumpy today
What do you have -- a big date tonight
With that, a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk
: - It's a beautiful night
The White House, lit up and shimmering in its golden glow, would appear now to be exactly what the poet was looking at when he described The Shining City on a Hill
Limousines, several of which fly the flag of foreign diplomats, pull up one by one, their doors opened by white- gloved
White lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks of flashbulbs from the print media
- The  -- of whom there are a couple hundred -- in black tie and evening gowns, are entering the receiving area
All this happening, of course, under the eye of the , both American and French, who are strategically placed throughout
The light from a  camera comes on as a reporter begins a quick stand-up interview with  , a handsome man in his late forties
() (to the camera) 'm standing here with Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just one of the many guests arriving at what, for a few hours at least, is a non-partisan White House
Senator, the latest public opinion survey shows the President with approval ratings that would make him all but unbeatable, come next November
Is there a Republican who can mount a serious challenge, and are you that candidate
Lloyd, it's a long time till next November
Right now, 'm just looking forward to a pleasant evening
: '  - Lucy is standing behind her father, tying his bow tie
That's a little tight, Luce
It's supposed to be tight
It's supposed to make you look regal
Is it supposed to cut off the blood flow to my face
All done
He looks in the mirror
Not bad
Where did you learn how to do this
Social studies
Very funny
(smiles) Really, where did you learn
don't know
just guess
Sweetie, did Mom teach you how to do this
Yeah
(pause) Lucy, is this okay with you
My having dinner with a woman
It's totally okay
Are you sure
Because if you want to talk about it
Dad, it's cool
Go for it
You know, 'm a little nervous
You'll be fine
Just be yourself
Be myself
And compliment her shoes
Her shoes
Girls like that
: - Dressed in formal, but not festive, clothes and holding, as always, her notepad,  waits by the door
sits alone behind a small desk
The door opens and  walks in
She's, needless to say, stunning
Miss Wade
The President wants you to join him upstairs in the residence
May  show you the way
: /  - This formal reception area is filled with special
As walks in,
goes to her immediately
Sydney, come on in
You look beautiful
Thank you
have no idea what 'm doing here
promise you there's no hidden agenda
approaches
Sydney
Andrew Shepherd
We spoke on the phone
Yes, sir
remember
, ,
' wife, joins them
You know my wife, Esther
Sure
It's nice to see you again
(affectionately) Sydney, the President told me about how you two met
think it's priceless
don't know what happened
One minute  was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader
The next minute  had a date
Men like being insulted by women
It makes them feel loved
Don't ask me why
Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right
We just signed a new trade agreement
Got it
The French President, ', and his  approach
(to 'Astier) Mr
President, would allow me to introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the Commonwealth of Virginia
Sydney, this is President Rene-Jean 'Astier and his wife Monique Danielle 'Astier of France
An honor to meet you both
Mr
President, 'm sorry to interrupt
The receiving line is in place
Sydney, it sounds like our table's ready
's guests make their way out of the residence, leaving  with  and the   and '
: - and  are walking down the staircase that leads to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters the East Room
The  escorting the President gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy
Once we hit the bottom of the stairs,  gotta do a thing
You'll be escorted
They took me through it
After a slight pause-- (continuing) Do you do this often, sir
(beat) This is, actually, only our second State Dinner
The first was for the Emperor of Japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case
meant do you go out on
do you-- often--do you-- Do  date a lot
Well, yeah
No
How 'bout you
Me
Lately,  seem to be going out on a lot of first dates
Then you're experienced at this
Oh yeah, you can ask me anything
How are we doing so far
It's hard to say at this point
So far it's just your typical first date stuff
And all of a sudden an   from inside the East Room-- --The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes
Damn
And  wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys
over the
announces-- (
) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States
And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision -- By the way, nice shoes
-- walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays
The 180  come to their feet and applaud long and loud
The  following the President catches up to the spot where  has stopped walking
They all join in the applause
We can see in 's face that she's been quite swept up
: - The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the strategically positioned
: ' are clearing away the main course and refilling wine glasses
In addition to the two main couples, and  MacINERNEY and    are seated at the President's table
Mr
President, the President and Mrs
'Astier look bored
They're not talking to anybody
They're hammered
Esther, do you speak French
Latin
thought you spoke French
No, Latin
Great, next time Julius Caesar comes to town, you're our gal
Sydney, don't suppose that you speak any-- (taking over-- to 'Astier) Monsieur le President, nous sommes tous habilles, nous avons ce merveilleux orchestre, une piece magnifique
comment se fait-il que les invites ne dansent pas
(proudly to
and Esther) That's my date
' Je ne connais pas la tradition en Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les invites de Louis  et Marie Antoinette avaient ose danser devant le roi et la reine, ils auraient perdu la tete
Really
' Absolument
Sydney, you didn't dissolve the treaty, did you
just said that we're sitting in this beautiful room, listening to the music of this wonderful orchestra, and wondered why nobody was dancing
' And  informed Ms
Wade that in my country, a guest at the palace of Louis  and Marie Antoinette would soon find their head in a guillotine if they made the impertinent gesture of dancing without so much as a by-your-leave from the King and the Queen
'll bet no one accused Louis of being soft on crime
There's a lesson there, Mr
President
More beheadings at the White House
Bob Rumson would embrace it
'm sure he would, but  have a better idea
stands, holds out his hand to
(continuing) Would you like to dance
Uh, yeah,  guess
mean, yes, sir, 'd love to
and  move to the dance floor, accompanied by the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the
The dance band begins, and  and  dance
beautifully
: each and every one of them, have stopped all conversation and are fixating on this captivating sight
As we go around the room, we can observe the subtle reactions of, at first, various anonymous , then : , holding hands smiling as they watch their old friend, and we : ' where the Minority Leader's game face can barely conceal the gears that have slowly begun to turn in his head, as we : don't know how you do it
Arthur Murray
Six lessons
That's not what  mean
Two hundred pairs of eyes are focused on you right now, with two questions: "Who's this girl, and why's our president dancing with her
" First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes aren't focused on me
They're focused on you
And the answers are "Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she said 'yes
'" looking on from the back of the room
They make a nice couple
Lovely
We've got troubles
Huge
As  start onto dance floor, we : - as it pulls away from the White House and into the night
In the back,  slips a shoe off and rubs her foot
She smiles, then turns around to look out the back window as the White House slips out of view
: - - : - and  are at their respective desks as walks in
Good morning, Mrs
Chapil
Good morning, Mr
President
Mr
Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the office, sir
They said they needed to speak with you before scheduling
Fine
Janie, can you get me the number of a local florist
'll take care of it, sir
Where do you want them sent
want to do it myself
just need the phone number
don't understand
want the phone number of a florist
You just want the phone number
Yeah
(beat) don't understand, sir, is there-- want to send some flowers, Janie
want to do it myself
don't want to staff it out, and  don't want to issue an Executive Order
just want a phone number
'll get it for you right away, sir
Thank you
He heads into the office
: - where  and  are waiting anxiously
Mr
President, we need five minutes before scheduling if you can spare it
(to Robin) just need two minutes to make a call and 'll be right with you
enters and hands  a piece of paper
(continuing) Thank you, Janie
She exits
Who are we calling, sir
'm calling the Organization of the United Brotherhood of It's-None-of- Your-Damn-Business, Lewis
'll be with you in a minute
Yes, sir
and  exit the Oval Office
picks up the phone
(to the ) Yeah, good morning
How do  get an outside line
Really
That's simple
Thank you
dials the phone number 's given him
: and hovering near the outer office
Janie
Yes
What's the President doing
'm sorry, 'm really not at liberty to say
: (into phone) Tell me something
What is the state flower of Virginia
: Does this have something to do with Sydney Wade
'm really not at liberty to say
: (into phone) Is there someone else there who might know
(beat) No, 'm not trying to five you a hard time,  was--hold on please
'  comes through on
(
) (through intercom) Janie, what's the state flower of Virginia
(turning to
) Mrs
Chapil
State flower of Virginia
The dogwood
: (
) (through intercom) The dogwood, sir
(to ) Thank you
(into phone) It's the dogwood
(pause) What
Hold on please
(to , through intercom) Janie, the dogwood is a tree, not a flower
: walks by
It's a tree and a flower
Are you sure
Yes
What's going on
: (
) (through intercom) Sir, it's a tree and a flower
(into phone) The dogwood is both a tree and a flower
'd like a dozen, please
Really
No dogwoods
How 'bout roses
Simple
Classic
Two dozen roses
: Janie, 'm the President senior domestic policy advisor
It's important that  have a full understanding of-- (
) Janie
Do you have any idea where my credit cards might be
: They're in storage in Wisconsin with the rest of your personal items
Ah
(into phone) Listen, what might be better is if you just bill me for the flowers
'm sure it'll be okay with your boss
Well,  don't know if you recognize my voice, but this is the President
(beat) The United States
(they've hung up) Hello, hello
: '  - enters
Leo, you wanted to see me
So there  was, thinking maybe should give Sydney a call
She's new in town, doesn't know many people
produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo of  and  dancing
Leo-- Then  picked up the Times-- It was crazy
He called me at home
What's going on
Nothing
It was innocent
His cousin got the flu at the last minute
Did you sleep with him
What
Did you sleep-- That's none of your business, Leo
Yeah, it is, Sydney
You wanna tell me how my personal life in any way-- Because when it's the President, it's not personal
Sydney,  hired your reputation
hired a pit bull, not a prom queen
That's unfair
It's incredibly unfair
But you've spent a lot of time over the year telling me the trouble with the environmental lobby is that we don't understand the fundamental truth that politics is perception
This is a bad time to develop ignorance
You're making way too much of this
Am
This is your time, Sydney
You're sitting at the grown-ups' table
You have a chance to get everything you want -- run a national campaign, be a major player inside the party
But this relationship had better go all the way, because with the leader of the free world there is no halfway
Politics is perception, and if thing don't work out, the amount of time it'll take you to go from being a hired gun to a cocktail party joke can be clocked with an egg timer
There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's  steps in with a strange-looking package
Leo, there is no relationship
It was one night
It's done
' Mr
Solomon, this was just delivered by White House messenger
It's marked "Perishable
" The White House has sent me something perishable
' It's for Ms
Wade
Here we go
begins unwrapping the package
Relax, Leo
'm sure it's just a formality
' (exited) It's from him
Of course it's from him
So he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket
' He wrote the note himself
'm sure he didn't take the time to-- ' The messenger said he was waiting in the Oval Office for ten minutes while the President wrote the card
Okay, listen, so he-- (to ' ) --it took him ten minutes to write a card
' Apparently he went through several drafts
can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is
What is it
what is it
ham
(beat) ham
He sent me a Virginia ham
' Dig it, Ms
Wade
You're the President's girlfriend
's smile fades away
she looks at
There's never an egg timer around when you need one
: - as the white-gloved  snaps the door open for , and we : - is conferring with  and
Sir, they're gonna be pressing today about whether the White House is prepared to soften the assault weapons section of the crime bill
There is no need to entertain that at this point
How do you want me to handle the Sydney issue
The Sydney issue
We should have a consensus on how the White House is going to handle it
sure hope the Sydney issue refers in some way to a problem we're having with Australia, because if it's anything else
pokes her head in
Mr
President, Ms
Wade is here to see you
Tell her she can come right in
'm finished here
Yes, sir
(to  and ) There is no Sydney issue
enters, crossing paths with  and
They exchange pleasantries
(to ) Thanks for seeing me on such short notice
No problem
Did you get the ham
got the ham, yes
Thank you very much
wanted to send you flowers, but there seem to be some kinks in the system
'm really glad you stopped by
had such a good time last night
So did
It's just that
enters
They're 45 seconds away, sir
During the following,  will go to the desk, pick up two briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat
'm delivering a luncheon speech at the Governor's Conference this morning
'm sorry to-- No, no, that's fine
just stopped by to
Are you free for dinner tomorrow night
Dinner
Casual
In the Residence
Without the United Nations
My daughter'll be with us, so it may seem like the United-- 'd love to meet Lucy, but
An  has slipped in and hands  a note
(reading to himself as he talks ) She's gonna like you
(calling to the ) Excuse me -- Jeff
Actually,  have some concerns that-- The  () steps back in-- Yes, sir
(reading the note) can't do this
Which
Robbins or Stackhouse
Either one
have to be in and out
Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just needed 10 minutes
think he wants to talk about the assault weapons
Stackhouse wants to talk about grazing rights
Trust me
Got it
And he's gone
(to Sydney) Sorry
You have concerns
Yes
Not many
few
One
have one concern
Does it having anything to do with one of us being the President
You like to make jokes about this, but-- am not mocking you, honest
'm just a guy asking a girl over for a meal
And, as if from out of nowhere, a  , like the sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere outside -- growing louder and closer -- What's that
My ride's here
And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the Oval Office, is -1, the President's helicopter comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf
Leo Solomon has serious concerns about my exploring a social, you know, scenario, with the President of the United States
Yeah, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound that great to me either
It's just not-- Have dinner with Lucy and me
It's meat loaf night -- how presidential can it be
As  rushes out
(continuing) Seven-thirty
now stands alone in the  , trying to figure out what just happened
: -   - Marine 1 lifting off the south lawn
off night sky to reveal - : /  - room designed more for comfort than for show, with its overstuffed couches
Lucy enters
Are you Ms
Wade
(standing up, smiling) Sydney
Lucy Shepherd
Nice to meet you
My dad told me to tell you he's on the phone with his dentist and that should behave myself and entertain you till he gets here
Your father's on the phone with his dentist
No
He told me to tell you he's on the phone with his dentist
He wants you to think he's a regular guy
Who is he on the phone with
The Prime Minister of Israel
They're probably not discussing his teeth
No
They're talking about that abbreviation  can never remember
-
Yeah
Capricorn Surface To Air Defense
Right
enters
Let meat loaf night begin
Everything all right with your teeth
My teeth
The dentist
Oh, right
've got a cavity in my upper bicuspid region
You've got a short-range weapons system outside Tel Aviv
(to ) You turned on me
Can we eat
: - Two dozen limos and town cars line this suburban Maryland street, their drivers waiting patiently
: - cocktail party is underway
This is a fat cat fundraiser for the Republicans
(
) You're over-thinking this
: - The look and feel of old money
Rumson is holding court with a half-dozen political insiders
Some smoke cigars; others sip their drinks
(continuing) Voters aren't interested in how to achieve economic growth, and they don't want to hear our plans to strengthen foreign policy
#1 So it comes down to character
#2 The press like him, Senator
The networks, the newspapers, they're-- Reporters like him
Networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation
For all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes down to a character debate
#3 The press is an unwitting accomplice
Bob, the character debate didn't work out for us
Because it couldn't
Our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after he'd lost his wife was gonna be a turn-off and was gonna make people feel sorry for him
We couldn't run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower
He's still a widower
Time's passed, but-- (to the rest) You'll have to forgive my friend
He's been on a hunting trip and cut off from the world
What's going on
And four  grab whatever newspaper is closest to their hand and toss them to
The President's got a girlfriend
: /  - ,  and  are finishing up a game of Scrabble
(to ) Your dad says you're studying the Constitutional Convention
She's not having any fun, though
Dad-- You're not having fun
(to herself) This is a nightmare
This is a social studies nightmare
They're doing a mock Congress
Each kid is playing one of the original delegates, and they debate the Amendments
Now what's not fun about that
gets up from the table and kisses her father
'night, Dad
'night, sweetheart
It was nice meeting you, Mrs
-- Sydney
It was nice meeting you, Sydney
Thank you
It was nice meeting you
Sleep well, honey
love you
love you, too
leaves
and  are alone now
She's wonderful
She's her mother
She's you
After a pause
Would you like the 25-cent tour
: - This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you see when you take the official tour
Only a few lights are lit, and while the    give  plenty of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the distance or checking a doorway ahead
thought - wasn't gonna be operational until January
It was ready ahead of schedule
We've just been waiting for the personnel
The Israelis
No, our guys
We've sent a team of Army instructors to train the Israelis
and  enter the: - Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full place settings of the official White House china and silverware from every administration since Jackson

It's not the dish-- Yeah, it is
It's the room with all the dishes
It's the China Room

If you're curious about the mansion, there's probably a book you can get-- There're about seven-thousand books
'll get one for you
's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows, she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of incredibly flattering moonlight
The vision isn't lost on
They stare at each other for a moment
Sydney
Mr
President -- have you ever noticed how similar the Van Buren flatware is to the Buchanan flatware
Do you think there will ever come a time when you can stand in a room with me and not think of me as the President
This isn't a state of mind
You are the President
And when 'm in a room with you, oval or any other shape, 'm always gonna be a lobbyist, and you'll always be the President
got news for you, Sydney
As a lobbyist, you would never be alone in a room with the President
This last statement is not lost on
He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the moonlight
He puts his arms around her
You think this is a good idea
Probably not
They lean in to kiss each other
They barely make contact when
#3 (
) Mr
President
An  is standing in the doorway --  and break apart
#3 We have a secure call from the sit- room
knows what that means
Excuse me
He moves out the door and into the corridor
, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to follow him and be with him, but the  hasn't moved from the doorway, so-- #3 Sorry, ma'am
(beat) No
of course
comes back in
Listen-- Is anything wrong
'm sorry, we're going to have to cut our evening short
The Libyans have just bombed -
'll try to call you tomorrow
(to the ) Can you show Ms
Wade out
exits
, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally approached by a   , who starts to escort her out
(
) The response scenario's in place
: - ,
, the   , the , and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Council, and Joint Chiefs  are doing exactly what they're trained for
(continuing) The -18's are fired up on the Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk
They're just waiting for your attack order, Mr
President
And we're gonna hit Libyan Intelligence Headquarters
The
confirmed they're the ones who planned the bombing
What's the estimate
We'll level the building
Libyan
's in the middle of downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit anything else
Only if we miss
Are we gonna miss
No, sir
How many people work in that building
We've been all through-- How many people work in the damn building
've got those number here
There are three shifts, so it-- The fewest
What shift puts the fewest people in the building
The night shift, right
By far
Mostly custodial staff and a few-- What time does the night crew go on
They're on now, sir
It's immediate, it's decisive, it's low risk, and it's a proportional response
Someday somebody's going to have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response
There's a

Sir, what do you think about a national address
The last thing  want to do is put the Lybians center stage

You know Rumson's gonna be talking about your lack of military service
This isn't about Rumson
What  did tonight was not about political gain
But it can be, sir
What you did tonight was very presidential
Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now there's a janitor working the night shift at the Libyan Intelligence Headquarters
He's going about his job 'cause he has no idea that in about an hour he's gonna die in a massive explosion
He's just going about his job 'cause he has no idea that an hour ago  gave an order to have him killed
You just saw me do the least presidential thing  do

Is there anything at all about the - weapons system that could have been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence as offensive rather than defensive
No
We did everything but show them the blueprints

They didn't hit it until the American personnel got there
Leslie
Sir, there's an unconfirmed report that you were with Sydney Wade when you learned of the attack
Can you comment
(sotto to ) Get him off
Yes, we'd just finished dinner
Last question
Sir, would you care to comment on the status of your relationship
We don't have a relationship
We just had dinner

In the dish room

The China Room
Then what happened
He had to go and attack Libya
It's always something
've gotta nip this in the bud
This has catastrophe written all over it
In what language
Sydney, this man is the leader of the free world
He's brilliant, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's an above-average dancer
Isn't it possible our standards are just a tad high

Look,  know you've had a tough day
Not as tough as some
You want a drink
Lemme take your coat
But  doesn't take her coat off
Mr
President, this isn't gonna work
Sure it will
You button the top button, and it doesn't fall off the hanger
That's not what
didn't think so
Listen
've really enjoyed the time we've spent together, but this has catastrophe written all over it
Please, Mr
President, don't pursue me outside the political arena
Well,  have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena, so that leaves everything out, and that's unacceptable to me
If  were on your staff,  would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world
Let's clear up a couple of things
Number 1:  seldom prance
Number 2:  have no intention of engaging in a character debate, and Number 3: You're not on my staff
Yes, of course, but if you'll follow the immutable-- Why is that, by the way
Why's that
Why aren't you on my staff
You can't afford me
How much do you make
More than you do, Mr
President
The name's Andy
How much money do you make
What the hell does it matter how much money -- You would raise your voice to the President
'm only thinking about the health of your Presidency
You think this morning's press conference was the end of it
Bob Rumson's gotta be drooling over this
Are you attracted to me
beg your pardon
asked if-- (of course she is) That's not the issue-- Well,  tell you what
Let's make it the issue
Let's try something new, 'cause  know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool
You're not most people
You know what your problem is
What's my problem
Sex and nervousness
Sex and nervousness is my problem
Yes
Last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, realized that those place settings were provided by the First Ladies
And 'll bet none of those First Ladies were nervous about having sex with their President husbands
And you know why
No, but 'm sure you'll explain it to me
will
Because they weren't presidents when they met them
Not the case here
Ahhhhhh
You see what 'm getting at
Yes
May  use your bathroom for a moment
Sure
It's right through there
want to freshen up
As you pass through, you'll see a large closet on your left
And if you feel comfortable, hang up your coat, and when you come back 'll have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on the couch, and  will explain to you my plan
You have a plan
Don't make me wait
You're on a roll
disappears into the /  area
keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks
(speaking up) Okay
You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President
It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and  know what a big step that was for you
So, Sydney, 'm in no rush
Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down
When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen
comes back into the room
she's wearing one of 's dress shirts and nothing else
She walks toward him
(continuing) Perhaps  didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the "Slow Down" plan
You explained it great
She moves closer to him
(pause) Are you nervous
No
Good
My nervousness exists on several levels
Number 1 -- and this is in no particular order -- haven't done this in a pretty long time
Number 2: Any expectations you might have, due to the fact that 'm, you know
The most powerful man in the world
Exactly, thank you
Just so you remember that's a political distinction that comes with the office
mean, if Eisenhower were here instead of me he'd be dead by now
And number three

They're both standing, facing each other
They gently kiss
They just stay with it until it becomes easier and better and exactly what they want

) Does New Hampshire want traditional American values back in the White House
Yes

You understand that by diversion 'm not saying we set the White House on fire
No, please, let's do
Can  state very clearly that can't be party to anything illegal
Good for you, Lewis
Say what you want, but it's always the guy in my job that ends up doing eighteen months in Danbury Minimum Security Prison
Rest easy, Lewis
We're not creating a diversion
No diversion

Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you
The White House has no official position except to say "no comment
" No comment
The White House doesn't comment on the President's personal life
We can't just leave it at that, sir

But, sir

Nineteen post-graduate degrees in mathematics and you explain going from a 63 to a 46 percent approval rating in 5 weeks on mood swings
Well,  could explain it better, but 'd need charts and graphs and an easel
Fellas, we haven't slept in three years
Can't we forget work for one night and take this moment to enjoy each other as friends
It's Christmas
(pause) It's Christmas
Yeah, you didn't get the memo
#1 'Cause your father's President, does he automatically get to be on money
honestly don't know
#2 think only if he's a really good President
spots  as she walks through the doorway and comes over to her
She seems a bit agitated
Hey, Sydney, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas,
Where you been
got stuck on DePont Circle
can never remember which lane 'm supposed to take
Then  got cut off by this idiot cab driver who starts screaming at me like it's my fault
Syd, relax
It's Christmas
joins them
Hi, Syd
Get stuck on DuPont Circle again
It's not funny
hate that place
Can't you declare it a Federal Disaster Area or something
'll look into it
What were you doing up on the Hill, anyway
Ahhh
had a terrible meeting today
Totally lost my cool with McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
You went to see the Motown Three
pitched 'em the hill
(beat) On its merits
The woman knows no fear
She'd lobby the Carolinas to the American Lung Association
It was a disaster
You're in good company
sat with 'em a week ago
They told me there was nothing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill
Well, congratulations, fellas, you're outta the cellar
McSorley told me the only thing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill was the fossil fuel package
This catches  and
by surprise--like accidentally drawing to an inside straight
You're kidding, right
isn't aware she's said anything of particular consequence
No, 'm not kidding
It's funny that he used the same words
and  are trying to study the situation without giving anything away
Yeah
don't think the Pep Boys know too many words
'm gonna get a drink and shake this off
When  come back, 'll have Christmas spirit
(beat) Okay
Is something wrong
No,  was
was thinking about-- nothing
'll be back in a minute
She goes off
Did what  think just happened, just happen
Did the 's political director just tell the President and the White House Chief of Staff that there are three votes on the crime bill that can be bought by stickin' the fossil fuel package in a drawer
No, the 's political director didn't tell us anything
Sydney Wade told her boyfriend and her boyfriend's best friend that she had a lousy day
It doesn't change the facts, Mr
President
If Sydney gets her 24 votes and we're three short, there's some maneuvering to be done
made a promise,
You made a deal, Mr
President
made it with Sydney
You made it with the
Yeah, well, this is all academic anyway
We're not going to need those votes
If your approval rating drops any more, things are gonna get tight
: - sits with a Congressman's aide
'm hearing rumors that your boss is wavering on the crime bill
You can't believe rumors, Lewis, you know this town
That's what  wanted to hear
'll tell you, though
My boss is starting to waver on the crime bill
- lunchtime crowd is doing business over white wine, oysters and cobb salads
, a , and his are going at it
() Sydney, everybody cares about the environment during a phone survey
On election day, nobody gives a damn
That's, that's why you have a job
Congressman Pennybaker, on election day, people give a damn about what tell them to give a damn about
And that's why  have a job
(offering the bread basket) Did you want another roll
: - is on the phone-- (to the ) She got Pennybaker
All right
Good job
rips off the top sheet of the tote board, which now reads "5 Votes in 14 Days
" : '  - is walking on a treadmill while  stands by
Congressman, it was our understanding that we had your support
Hey, look,  like your boy
Always have
But for God's sake, kid, does the woman have to spend the night
: - photocopying, clipping, stamping, crunching numbers, drinking coffee
is on an extension, listening to 's final pitch over the phone
The tote board reads: "3 Votes in 5 Days
" (into phone) We've got the full backing of the White House, Katherine
(listens) Yes, at 20 percent
Three more votes and the President sends it to the Hill
(listens) Katie, 10 years from now any cars with an internal combustion engine is gonna be considered a collector's item
Come on board, we'll make your Volvo a classic
: - and , each with an , have been meeting with two  and their
Congressman, the assault weapons are gone
The bill is priced to move, see
The bill isn't the issue, fellas
'm facing a serious challenge in November, and the President's coattails aren't what they used to be
The President's coattail's are gonna have room for you, Congressman, you leave that to us
We left that to you people, Leon, and the President's in a free-fall
wouldn't say he's in a free-- just can't give you my vote
: '  - and  stand in front of
's desk
The well is drying up
The President's gotta make a move or we're gonna die fast and quiet
What if  do a new poll
We give him detailed public opinion
And we put Sydney in the new model
hesitates
(continuing) , it's meaningless unless we ask him about Sydney
Fine
Do it
: '  - The street's been temporarily closed to traffic, and man the sidewalk
The  and form a small crowd, kept well at bay by police barricades
'  - and  are finishing up dinner
This was delicious
Thank you
Is there any left
(taking his bowl) Tons
didn't think you liked it
Are you kidding me, of course  did
But actually it's not for me
The agent who checked the food thought it was delicious, and  sort of told him 'd bring him some if there was any left
So you didn't like it
No,  loved it
You're lying
No, 'm not
You are
can tell when you're holding something back
You do a thing with your face
pops a bottle of port and pours two glasses
When have you seen me do a thing with my face
Two days before  met you
You gave a speech for the Daughters of the American Revolution
was there
You were
You remember the speech
Vaguely
"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society
" Ah
There was supposed to be something else after that, wasn't there
How did you know
told you
The face
hands him a glass
They clink glasses and sip
Wow
what's the occasion
You're looking at a lady who's two votes shy of the promised land
Two votes
got Pennybaker
That got me Cass and Zimmer
(beat) That's great, Sydney
mean it
That's great work
Well, 'm not there yet
Look, no matter what happens, you have every right to be proud of yourself
'll be proud when  see you sign the bill
Yeah, well
Andy
Yeah
You're doing that thing with your face
: -  - light rain is falling
: - sits at his desk staring at a computer printout is nearing the end of a phone conversation that isn't going well
He's pacing around with the phone
desperate and intense
The tote board reads: "1 Vote in 2 Days
"  enters
(to ) How're the numbers
Bad
How bad
Forty-one
Character across the board
Who is Lewis on with
Jarrett
He's trying to keep his finger in the dam
(into phone) You're supposed to be a United States Congressman, for the love of Christ
and  appear in the doorway, sensing a surprise development
is losing it on the phone
(continuing; listens) But you're not gonna stay at 41
The numbers are gonna be go back up
(listens) But they're gonna go back up
(listens) George
(listens) Congressman
(listens) Congressman Jarrett
(listens) George, it's crunch time
It's personal
This is one of those moments
It's just you and the President
Now that's it gonna be
looks over at  and
his face telling the story
(continuing) Yeah
(listens) Yeah
(listens) Hey, George
Can  tell you something
We're gonna win this thing
We're gonna get the votes and we're gonna win
And after we do,  mean that very night, 'm gonna go to Sam & Harry's, 'm gonna order a big steak, and 'm gonna make a list of everybody who tried to fuck us this week
and  are trying to get their friend from setting fire to a bridge out of pure frustration
(a whispered shout) Lewis
(into phone) Vote your conscience, you chicken- shit, lame-ass-- hangs up the phone
He takes a deep breath, slumps down in the nearest chair, and looks up at  and
There's a long silence before  says-- (continuing) We lost Jarrett
(beat) hope so
'Cause, you know, if that was an "undecided," then we need to work on our people skills
picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers
Even before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone and punches in a different set of numbers
(into the first phone) Karen, it's Lewis
Could you hunt down Congressman Quincy for me need to talk to him right way
: - stands in front
, , , and
is somewhere in the background
We lost Quincy, too
Did he give a reason
He thinks your numbers aren't likely to rebound
We're three votes down again, sir
There's a pause before
(continuing) Mr
President, as of this morning, Sydney only needed one more vote
The Motown Three have gotta be scared blind
don't think there'll be a better opportunity
The press is expecting an announcement on the crime bill by the Sate of the Union
If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer until after the elections, they'll give you the three votes
(beat) And we declare victory, sir
We said as a last resort
We're there, sir
The State of the Union is 48 hours away
No
Come on
There's gotta be three votes someplace else
There isn't
Bullshit, Leon
There's gotta be somebody we haven't-- There isn't, sir
Storch
beg your pardon
What about Storch
Mr
President-- Storch is a "no
" Wagner
No
Sobel
No
Clark
No
Not that Clark, the one from Indiana
(pause) That one too, sir
is stopped
Mr
President,  think we have to do it
She is one vote away,
It's important legislation that for the first time has a legitimate chance
think she deserves every possible opportunity to-- She
You meant "it," didn't you, sir
You meant the "important legislation" deserves every opportunity
Lewis, shut up
There's a horrible silence in the room
has locked eyes with
You got something to say to me
Respectfully, sir
think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score
Examine what
They don't like that 'm going out with Sydney
It's not that simple, sir
think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief
Whose problem we talking about, Lewis
Yours
You worried about your job
This poll isn't talking about my Presidency
This poll is talking about my life
Two hundred and sixty-four million people have decided-- Mr
President, two hundred and sixty- four million people don't give a damn about your life
They give a damn about their own
All right, that's enough
Mr
President, you've raised a daughter almost entirely on your own, and she's terrific
What does it say to you that in the last seven weeks, 59 percent of this country has begun to question your family values
The President doesn't answer to you, Lewis
Oh yes, he does,
'm a citizen, this is my president, and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders, it is our responsibility
But you already know that, Mr
President, because you have a deeper love of this country than any man 've ever known, and  want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks 59 percent of Americans have begun to question your patriotism
Look, if people want to listen to Bob Rumson-- They don't have a choice
Rob Rumson's the only one doing the talking
People want leadership
And in the absence of genuine leadership, they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone
They want leadership, Mr
President
They're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand
(evenly) Lewis, we've had Presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight
People don't drink the sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis
They drink it 'cause they don't know the difference
The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just said
picks up the polling data and heads to the door
(continuing; on his way out) Make the deal
: - , , ,  and  are having a little office celebration
Champagne flows from paper cups
Streamers and balloons adorn the tote board, which reads 0 Votes in 1 Day
, maybe a little drunk, has concerned
want to go on the record and apologize for my attitude toward you since your arrival
didn't notice
Was there an attitude
, and one of the staffers takes it tries to rejoin the party, but-- think  have a lot of pent-up hostility
Well-- wonder who  can blame it on
'm not really qualified to-- 'Cause 've been blaming it on my mother and my ex-husband, and that hasn't been working
(approaching ) Leo needs to see you
Tell him to get over here
It's a party
He needs to see you in his office
It can't wait
He just got off the phone with MacInerney
There's been a development
holds for a moment
then heads out the door and we : - comes from 's bedroom as  rounds the corner
'  - pops his head in
Sounds good
It's progressive
'll say
Hey, Dad, what's wrong with Sydney
You guys have a fight
(beat) What do you mean
She seemed pretty-- You saw her
She's here
Where
In your room
Why is she mad
Don't worry about it
Were you a dork
Practice your music
If you were a dork, you should say you're sorry
Girls like that
: '  - is going through the closet in search of something
The door opens, and  steps in, perhaps a little tentatively
He doesn't see  at first
(calling out) Syd
comes out
Have you seen a gray cableknit sweater
grey
sweater
No
called you at the office, but
It's Beth's
wore it here one time, and  didn't want to leave it
Where were you going
continues her search
'm going home, and then 'm going to Hartford
Connecticut
Yes
Do you know if it was sent with your dry cleaning by any-- What's in Connecticut
Richard Reynolds' campaign
He may be able to get me a job
When did you decide to get a new job
Not long after Leo Solomon fired me from my old one
Beth's gonna kill me
She loves that-- Why did he fire you
Total failure to achieve any of the objectives for which  was hired told him he was being unreasonable
After all,  did get to dance with the President and ride in Air Force One a couple of times
But you know those prickly environmentalists
It's always gonna be something with them
If it's not clean air, then it's clean water
Like it isn't good enough that 'm on the cover of People Magazine
'll call him
You'll call him
You mean you'll call him yourself
Personally
It'll come from the President
That's a great idea
think you should call Leo and make a deal
He hires me back for, say, 72 days go around scaring the hell out of Congress, making them think that the President's about to drive through a very damaging and costly bill
They'll believe me, right, 'cause 'm the President's Friday Night Girl
Now  don't know if you can dip into this well twice, especially since 've lost all credibility in politics, but you never know,  might just be able to pull it off again
might be able to give you just the leverage you need to pass some ground-breaking piece of crime legislation -- like a mandatory three-day waiting period before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi
Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to learn to live with disappointment
She starts to exit What do you think went on here today
She stops
know exactly what went on here today
got screwed
You saw the poll, you needed the crime bill, you couldn't get it on your own, so  got screwed
The environment got screwed
Nothing happened to you today, Sydney
Governing is choosing
Governing is prioritizing
've made no secret of the fact that the crime bill was my top priority
Well then, congratulations
It's only taken you three years to put together crime prevention legislation that has no hope of preventing crime
heads out the door-- (stopping) Sydney
Please
don't want to lose you over this
Mr
President, you got bigger problems than losing me
You just lost my vote
And  is out the door
we  on , looking like a man who's taken a lot of punches to the heads
: - rack of billiard balls explodes from the break
Hartfort
What's in Hartford
Richard Reynolds' district office
She's thinking of running his campaign
Four in the corner
gets down over the ball-- (continuing) Hartford
The insurance capital of the world
Have a good time, Syd
smacks the ball, '-
Listen
'm gonna have Janie clear your schedule for the weekend
You need to get some rest
You handling me,
No, sir
Good
14 in the side
gets down over the ball
but instead of the cue hitting the ball, it's
's palms slamming the cue against the table
But  sure as hell will if you don't start gettin' your head outta your ass
Excuse me
Lewis is right
Go after this guy
Has he lied
What
Has Rumson lied in the last seven weeks
Has he lied
Other than not knowing the difference between Harvard and Stanford, has he said something that isn't true
Am not a Commander-in-Chief who's never served in the military
Am not opposed to a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning
Am not an unmarried father who was sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist down the hall from my twelve-year-old daughter
And you think you're wrong
don't think you win elections by telling 59 percent of the people that they are
We fight the fights we can win
Don't-- You fight the fights that need fighting
Is the view pretty good from the cheap seats,
beg your pardon
It occurs to me that in 25 years 've never seen your name on a ballot
Why have you always been standing a pace behind me
Because if  hadn't been, you'd be the most popular history professor at the University of Wisconsin
Fuck you
's tossed his cue stick and is heading out
(continuing) Have Lewis put the final drafts of the State of the Union and the Crime Bill announcement on my desk in the morning
Yes, sir
gets to the doorway
stops
turns around
If Mary hadn't died
would we have won three years ago
Would we have won
If we'd had to go through a character debate three years ago, would we have won
don't know
But  would've liked that campaign
If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up,  would have liked that campaign
looks away
nods absently
(pause) Yeah
exits, leaving
alone as we : - series of shots showing  walking down the corridor to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which contains a series of paintings of various presidents
Then sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought
: - and  are eating breakfast in silence, neither of them very happy, each with their own problems
nearby
glows with the live coverage of 's morning press briefing
Finally
You're not hungry
This is oatmeal
Yeah
We never have oatmeal
It's good for you
'm from Wisconsin
need food
You're not from Wisconsin
'm from Wisconsin
You've lived in Washington your whole life
He glances toward the
screen
's standing up there doing what she's been told: "No comment
No, this President is not participating in character debates
" He mutes the volume
(continuing) How are you doing in your Constitutional debates
We're done
You're done
We ratified it last week
Oh
well
that's good
Why didn't you tell me
It's not a big deal, Dad
Okay,  give up
don't care why you're not happy in social studies
care about why you're not talking to me about why you're not happy in social studies
Dad, 'm perfectly-- You're not perfectly happy
You don't think  know when something's bothering you
Damnit, Dad
Hey
You know-- Talk to me
Look-- winds herself up
It would appear she's about to burst
She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in her life-- (continuing) --sometimes when you talk, you say things  disagree with
is stunned and totally confused
Almost every time  talk,  say things you disagree with
mean politically
(pause) Politically
Yes
(pause) What do you mean
It just starts spilling out in a stream-- Yes
Okay
Yes
Sometimes,  mean, 'm not sure
You know a lot more than  do -- but still,  have these feelings, and  don't think they're wrong
Like, okay, for instance, 'm not so sure it's all right to burn a flag
mean, it really bothers a lot of people, and  don't know why you think it's okay
hear Senator Rumson talk, and some of the things he says sounds right to me, and think, "God, am  like Bob Rumson
mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk
Dad hates this guy
Why am  agreeing with him" And then think, "Well, maybe 'm not really like Bob Rumson, but maybe 'm not like Dad either
" But the point is 'm the President's kid, and people pay attention to what  say, and if say something different from what you say, it'll be embarrassing for you
So  can't just get up in social studies class and say whatever  want
is silent
totally blown away
he had absolutely no idea
He stands up slowly and moves toward her
doesn't know what's coming
(quietly) Stand up please
gets up slowly
She's never seen her father like this
(continuing) want you to pay very close attention to what happens now
knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands, and gently kisses her forehead
He pulls her to him and holds her in a tight embrace
(continuing) In your  lifetime, you will never embarrass me
It could never happen
You're not the President's daughter, Lucy, you're mine
And no one's gonna vote me out of that job
You're my daughter, and everything else is a distant second
(more) School is for you, Lucy
You say what you want
The only thing you have to do to make me happy is come home at the end of the day
squeezes her dad tight
they hold the embrace for a long moment
(continuing) One more thing
don't dislike Senator Rumson because of his political views
And even if you voted for everything he would vote for, that wouldn't make you like him
There's a fundamental difference between you and the Bob Rumsons of the world
What's that
The difference is that he says he loves America
Saying you love America is easy
What takes character -- and this is what you have-- trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney
(continuing) What takes character is loving Americans
(beat) And now it's as if  is waking himself up from the longest trip of his life
he looks over at the
monitor
"No comment"
"No,  don't know how many other ways  can say it
The White House isn't getting involved in
" (continuing) Luce,  gotta go
Dad, is everything all right
Everything's fine
'm just a little late for work
He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes-- Somebody get my daughter some food
The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin' out loud
And he's gone as we
: - is on her last drops of energy and patience
#4 Robin, will the President ever respond to Senator Rumson's question about being a member of the American Civil Liberties Union
But instead of hands going up, the   suddenly stands
turns to see  stride in and step up to the podium
Yes, he will
'Morning
Good morning, Mr
President
takes the podium
There's a palpable  in the room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc
People starts to stand
That's all right, you can keep your seats
For the last couple of months, Senator Rumson has suggested that being president of this country was, to a certain extent, about character
- who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in four numbers
She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the rest of the room
(into phone) Lewis
call
and come on down here
don't know, but something's happening
and although  have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me, 've been here three years and three days, and  can tell you without hesitation: Being President of this country is entirely about character
enters with
and
(continuing) For the record: Yes,  am a card- carrying member of the
But the more important question is why aren't you, Bob
This is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the questions
(continuing) Why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president, choose to reject upholding the Constitution
If you can answer that question, then, folks, you're smarter than  am, because  didn't understand it until a couple of minutes ago
Everybody knows American isn't easy
America is advanced citizenship
(continuing) You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight
It's gonna say, "You want free speech
Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating, at the top of his lungs, that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours
You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest
" Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms
Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free
've known Bob Rumson for years
've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it
Well,  was wrong
(continuing) Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it
Bob's problem is that he can't sell it
Nobody has ever won an election by talking about what was just talking about
(continuing) This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing
The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment
We are a nation afraid to go out at night
We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated
We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them
And whatever your particular problem is, friend,  promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it
He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it
That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections
You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character
Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend
You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore
Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob
She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources
(continuing) You want a character debate
Fine, but you better stick with me, 'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league
've loved two women in my life
lost one to cancer, and lost the other 'cause  was so busy keeping my job  forgot to do my job
Well that ends right now
(continuing) Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration
It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years
It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming
The other piece of legislation is the crime bill
As of today it no longer exists
'm throwing it out
'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense
You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns
consider them a threat to national security, and  will go door to door if  have to, but 'm gonna convince Americans that 'm right, and 'm gonna get the guns
We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card
If you want to talk about character and American values, fine
Just tell me where and when, and 'll show up
This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up
My name's Andrew Shepherd, and  am the President

The  begin from the
They're talking among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they just saw
steps to the podium
Any questions

Well, you don't see that every day of the week
He's got the whole White House Press Corps asking each other how to spell "erudite
" Lewis, call the printer
know
Gotta rewrite the State of the Union
Every word, Lewis
It's a whole new ball game
You've got 35 minutes
Oh, good
thought  was gonna be rushed
goes off in one direction
heads towards the Oval Office
: - is on the phone
don't want the limo
don't want an escort
enters
(continuing) want a plain, ordinary, non- bullet-proof automobile
Someone around here must have a Chevy can borrow
Well, find one and meet me outside the West Wing entrance in five minutes
Where are you going
'm going to her house
'm gonna stand at her front door till she lets me in
And 'm not leaving till get her back
How're you gonna do that
haven't worked that out yet
But 'm sure groveling will be involved
You're just gonna drive over
'm the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful army in the world
You don't think  can drive ten blocks
Just stay away from DuPont Circle
hear it's murder this time of day
doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing in the doorway, but of course he does anyway
Hi,
It's nice to see you, Ms
Wade
If anybody needs me, 'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen
exits
heard your speech
was in my car, and it just kind of steered its way over here
'm glad
