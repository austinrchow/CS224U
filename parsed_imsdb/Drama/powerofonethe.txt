What if the power of one becomes the power of many and the power of many becomes the power of one

-  (1939)                      1 white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse
On the door, a decal: "
" Two men dressed in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm- house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase
The
of a young man narrates: (
) There comes a time in everyone's life when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is yourself
That the only real power anyone has to get anything done is the power of one
With any luck you can make it through a lot of years before you ever have to face the reality of that fact
(beat) It was a luxury  never had discovered it the year my mother had her nervous breakdown
One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for the woman
Before entering, she turns one last time toward the farmhouse

The car drives off down the road
The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of swirling dust
(
) My father died before  was born, and even though  was raised by my Zulu nanny, with my mother, depending on her health, in nominal attendance, it was decided, with her departure, that , too, would depart
(beat) for boarding school
The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself
An unseen vehicle comes up the road
(
) But before  could be sent out into the world one very serious matter had to be dealt with
(beat) was a chronic bedwetter
Since my nanny was the one responsible for my well-being, she did what any responsible Zulu mother would do
She called on the greatest medicine man of her tribe -- Inkosi Inkosikazi
Out of the dust a large black Buick   up the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old and his tremulous nanny
huge Zulu jumps out of the front passenger seat and opens the rear door
moment passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from the car and settle into the dust
, 100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed chicken in the other, exits the car

-                                        4 fire burns bright in the black African night
The Boy sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the dust with a stick
4
(
) Legend had it that Inkosi Inkosikazi was the last son of the great Zulu king, Dingaan, who fought both the Boers and the British to a standstill nearly 100 years before, and the night Inkosi Inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun rose
The circle    complete, the old man sits down opposite the Boy
From     a leather pouch he produces several bones
He throws the    bones on the ground and studies them for a moment
He     begins to wave the fly switch back and forth in front of    the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly
The Boy's eyes    grow heavy; his lids droop
5    -
5 The Boy and the old man are standing above a great waterfall
In the swirling pool far below are ten stepping stones linking one bank to the other
(
) The medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as  went until  reached dry land
The Boy jumps, cascading down the   falls and into the pond below
He clambers up the first   rock
It is slippery
He falls off and climbs back on,   buffeted by the spraying water
He makes his way stone by   stone toward the other side
(
) Even though it was only a dream, felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real
The water was like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as  made my way from one stone to the next could feel my strength desert me
The progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water, coughing and sputtering
(
) was three rocks in when  ran out of gas
couldn't pull myself any further
No matter how hard 5
tried, the current tried harder
felt myself going under for the last time
The Boy's grip slips off the rock
He starts to go under

-                                        6 The fire has gone out
The Boy is still sitting in the circle, the chicken still in his lap
His eyes snap open
The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi sitting across from him with a big smile
: 7
-                                             7 Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick
The Boy and his smiling nanny watch
They Boy still holds the chicken
(
) Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit of the great Zulu warriors lived in me
He told me that whenever trouble arose  should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks until the trouble passed
He said three rocks were enough to conquer my problem with the night water; that  was very brave
He said  was a man for all Africa, bound to her by my spirit, bound by my dreams
(beat) And he let me keep the chicken
The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of dust

-                                            8 The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance
sack on his lap moves
The chicken's head pops out
The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches behind his scraggly comb
(
) Although  was bound by spirit 6
and dream to Africa,  was bound by heritage and language to the birthplace of my grandparents -- England -- a country  had never seen, but one that was to cause me eminently more problems than bedwetting ever did

(
) The school    was sent to was attended and   staffed entirely by Afrikaaners,   the oldest of the two white tribes   of Africa
: 10
10 The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls, filled with bigger boys -- brash, noisy, hostile
They only speak the "Taal" -- Afrikaans
Over and over they jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old, knocking his books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is kicked in the butt
Or pulling his shirt out from under his jacket and making it hard to move
(
) spoke only English
The hated tongue
The language of the enemy who had usurped power and stolen the country through political chicanery and military brutality
mob of boys, led by a big bully,  , runs the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the showers, fully clothed
He tries to run out
Jaapie Botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the shower on with the other
The six-year-old stands miserable as the stinging water pelts him
(
) During the Boer War of 1896, 26,000 Boer women and children were herded into detainment camps by the British, where they died like flies from dysentery, 7
malaria and black water fever
And it seemed  was destined to shoulder the responsibility for each and every one of those deaths
The six-year-old in his first soccer game receives the ball
He tries to move  upfield, but he is kicked and pushed, the ball taken from him
He gets up gamely to follow the chase, only to be flattened, blindsided by Jaapie Botha
(
) And no one made this more evident to me than Jaapie Botha, a wheat farmer's son from the Transvaal

11 The six-year-old, asleep, his chicken perched alertly atop the bed
(
) The only time  was at peace was when  slept
Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken proved to be, like his previous owner, a salvation

-                                   12 The Boy builds a small shelter for the , who and forages contentedly
(
) During the day he would live outside the dorm, happily scarfing down bugs and grubs, secure in a little house  built for him
: 13
-                                        13 (
) And at night he would hop through the window and, perching over my bed, squawking if any intruders came near

Several boys sneak up in the    dark
The  begins to
The six-year-old     wakes, a shoe in hand ready to throw
The shadows     scatter
The Boy gives the chicken a few grains of corn    and an affectionate scratch behind the ear, and goes back    to sleep
(
) He was my best and only friend

14 Boys and faculty running through the halls excitedly, showing newspapers with pictures of Hitler and Chamberlain on the front
Posters and slogans with swastikas are slapped up on walls
Some boys mimic "heiling" to each other
(
) 'm sure in time a status quo would have been achieved between me and my schoolmates were it not for the cataclysmic events occurring in that faraway place none of us had ever seen
(beat) Two montjhs after  arrived at the school World War  broke out in Europe
Hitler had vowed to crush the British Empire
The Boers sharpened their swords in anticipation
The six-year-old comes back to his bed in the dorm to find a swastika carved into it
: 15
-                                         15 The six-year-old sleeps fitfully
There is a He wakes
blanket is thrown over his head
: 16
16 The Boy is dumped on the floor, the blanket removed
His eyes open in horror
The room is lit by torches
Shadows dance fearfully off two dozen boys with swastika armbands and leather pistol rigs without pistols strapped to their sides
In front of him on a platform Jaapie Botha stands, his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder, 9
as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with a swastika, using a knife and blue dye
Seeing the six- year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and addresses him in Afrikaans
God has sent Hitler to deliver us from the English bastards who stole our country and killed our people
Heil Hitler
The other boys chorus in
Heil Hitler
We will swear a blood oath
When Hitler comes we'll rise up and kill the Verdomde Rooineks
blood oath
blood oath
Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the shirt front, yanking him up
With your blood
Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times
Blood flows from his mouth and nose
Jaapie dips his finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo
He holds up his bloodied fingers
We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler
Heil Hitler
We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler
Heil Hitler
Death to all Englishmen in South Africa
Heil Hitler
The chorus repeats
God bless the fatherland
Heil Hitler
The voices come back to him stronger
10
Heil Hitler
Jaapie grabs the six-year-old again
See what we have in store for you when Hitler comes, Rooinek
Hoy
He gives a command
The boys at the far end of the room part
The six-year-old's eyes open in terror
17                                                           17 20 feet away Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken, his chicken, is hung from a rafter upside down, haplessly flapping against his bonds
18                                                      18 No
But before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is gang-tackled and held
Jaapie picks up a sling and a rock
For crimes committed against the whole Boer people
, Jaapie Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer, sentence you and your Rooinek kaffir chicken to death
Heil Hiter
Heil Hitler
Jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around
The six-year-old struggles to get free
Heil Hitler
Heil Hitler
The   through the air, faster and faster
No
Jaapie releases the stone
It flies true, catching the , struggling  flush in the chest
The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers
11
Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious
Heil Hitler
Heil Hitler
The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose
He rushes Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off balance
The Boy catches him low, driving his head into Jaapie's exposed stomach
Jaapie falls back and gets the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass
Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs futiley for the embedded blade
His cohorts laugh, thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his eyes murderous
The laughter dies
Jaapie's breath comes hard
Hang him up
few boys protest
Jaapie
No
But Botha is murderous, intent on revenge
Hang him
He waves the bloody knife in the air
Three boys grab the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is hanging
Two more boys throw a rope over the same rafter
Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his hands to his sides
You will pay for the deaths of our grandfathers and grandmothers, our aunts and uncles
All Rooineks will pay and you will be first
Pull
The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter
The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with the chicken
In the name of Adolf Hitler and the fatherland,  sentence you to die, Verdomde Rooinek
12
Kill him
Kill him
Kill him
Jaapie swings the sling overhead, faster and faster
19     --                                         19 He watches as Jaapie bears down
As Jaapie is about to let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two burst in, surprising in
What's this
The rock flies from the sling, but Jaapie's attention is diverted
His aim is off
The rock grazes the boy above the eye
He loses consciousness

The end of class
Offstage, other classrooms are exiting into the common hall, but no one in St
John's study moves
St
John takes his 13
glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately
After a long moment he turns to face the class
Very evocative, yes
Particularly the image of the chicken
Good choice there
St
John rises, lecturing
Any ideology that needs to attack the thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its own generation

You are to appear before them in three weeks

Yes, sir

Contemporary to most of these fellows means the seventeenth century

comes up to him

How we doing
Morrie consults the book
You win and your dream comes true
You lose, we're back to bread and butter sandwiches till term's end
What'd he want
My appointement before the Oxford committee came through
snap
For a brain like you, maybe
Come on, you'll read one of your pieces, they'll be begging you to attend
But will they pay for the privilege
Well let's bloody hope so
It'll be a lonely time without you there
Morrie Levy
Is that the voice of sentimentality  hear coming from you
Sentimentality my ass
Practicality
Where am  going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody Oxford
Go on
He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows

-  -              22 as they walk down the long   hall looking straight ahead
Sweat dapples 's face
Both boys are focused on double doors at the end of   the hall
There is the distant  sound of a
You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays
don't believe it
heard it from Bartlett's own lips
He's selling reservations for next holiday
pound for one night; three pounds for four
You register
For both of us
Took the whole holiday
The  crowd grows  the closer they get to the double doors
You nervous
No
Christ
'm about to have a calf
This bloody Boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse
They reach the double doors
Still in , Morrie turns to face  for the first time
Now remember
We're not here to exhibit our wares
We go in, we do the job, we get out
Right
is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors
He does not move his head a hair
Right
17
Morrie and  draw a deep breath
Together they push open the double doors
Together they stride into a floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center
Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan and English, yell, whistle and clap
and Morrie, in  , reveal  in a boxing robe with taped hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket
And at the end of six matches in all weight divisions, the score is Prince of Wales three victories, Helpmakeer three victories
The stands explode with cheers
And now for the final bout to determine which school will win the Johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team championship
In this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5'8", from the Helpmakeer School with a record of 13-0 on the year, Jannie Geildenhaus
huge cheer goes up for , muscular, bare-chested, as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd
enters the ring
He stands, robe on, eyes intent on Jannie
When the noise subsides the Announcer continues
And in this corner, representing the Prince of Wales School, the current Johannesburg Public School welterweight champion, also with a record of 13-0 on the year, also 140 pounds, Kid
Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but does not respond
He barely moves
He raises an arm in bare acknowledgment
His attention stays focused across the ring on his shadowboxing opponent
watches Jannie dance closely when a low  begins from outside the stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black voices building until the white voices inside the stadium are stunned to silence
The song carries beautifully in the night
For the first time 's focus is broken, but not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue as to what's happening
He has heard this before
This is familiar
18
This is for him
distant knowing flickers in his eyes like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his name
Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the chorus of the song
"Ono  bi shobi ingelosi
" The chanting stops as suddenly as it began
moment passes before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon
The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention back to the business at hand
We thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm
But now, on to the main event
Fighters to center ring, please
, focused again, meets Jannie at the
You both know the rules
No butts, no elbows, no low    blows
First man to score three    knock downs wins
Let's have     a good clean fight
Good luck     to you
The fighters slap leather
turns back to his corner when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the crowd
23     -   - -                23 sit; one of them   , 17, with honey- blonde hair and lapis-blue eyes, turns her head and engages 's eyes and his heart
She quickly looks away
But a  connection has been made -- fire passed
24                                                            24 goes back to his corner and takes off his robe
Morrie stands, holding 's mouthpiece
First row, third from the left
Find out who she is
Morrie looks down at Maria
We're in a bloody war here, in 19
case you forgot
Let's keep our mind on that, hey
He jams the mouthpiece into 's mouth as the
turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler
Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail  until he finds his footing and dances away
Jannie comes after him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement
But 's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed- iate disadvantage
It is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter
's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's length, until he closes with a combination
Jannie, willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs 's point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches
When he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch
Blery Rooinek
'll kill you
pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys
Backing up,  repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the face
works Jannie, turning him left then right, working the angles, keeping him off balance while he racks up the points
Jannie goes left
As  chases him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring
25     -    -                      25 with a younger black companion of more average height, the only black faces in a crowd of 2,000 people
26                                                    26 Their presence distracts     for a split second, and in that split second Jannie    seizes the opportunity
He comes across with a big    right hand to 's jaw
Jannie connects
goes down     hard
The crowd goes wild
Morrie leaps up and down    in the corner
Get up
Get up
But  is seeing double
He shakes his head, trying to clear it
Up
Up

The Ref checks him
Okay
Fight
Jannie comes rushing in, banging  with a series of hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws one
absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing up, dancing away
Jannie is all over him just as the Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant
goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex- pression
Morrie goes to work on a small cut over his eye
What are you trying to do, bankrupt us
What happened
turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door
Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men
Christ
If they get caught in here they're dead
(beat) What the hell's going on
don't know
Well, worry about it later
In case you haven't noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you
You see the way he drops his left when he throws the right
Yeah
The
and   Morrie trade a look
Jannie comes rushing over and  throws a big right
steps to his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his dropped left hand
He looks at   Morrie again
21
29                                                 29 Thank you, God
Jannie comes after , paying for each big right he throws as  finds his mark
plants one, then two, then three punches on Jannie's face
Finally, frus- trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail  with wild, flailing blows
bobs and weaves and feints
Jannie's punches grow weary
begins to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com- binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut
Jannie goes down in a heap
The crowd goes wild
The Referee counts him out
Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter
Morrie also rushes in, followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team
They hoist up on their shoulders

She disappears in the crowd

The tall African and his companion have vanished
: 32
32 The boxing team and a number of their supporters are in raucous celebration
Morrie comes bouncing through the crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the rear, where  is getting dressed
Morrie takes a wad of money out of his pocket
Here you go, pal
He hands  the money
You're the treasurer of this company
You hold it
Did you find out what  asked for

backs into a 24
darkened room to his left
The girls appear        in robes with towels and toiletries and step into the       same room
One flicks on the light to reveal the shower       room -- 14 separate cubicle stalls
Still chattering,        the girls disrobe

He holds his breath as one of the girls heads towards his stall
Her girl- friend cautions her
Those are always cold
Use this one
The girl turns away to another stall just in time
The allows himself to breathe again
He exits quickly

38 Maria Marais sits at her      desk in a nightgown,  working on a paper, when there is a       on the door
With her mind still on her work,      she opens the door
Her eyes go wide with shock when she      sees
He puts a   cautionary finger to his lips
May  come in
Maria, frozen with surprise, steps back
enters, gently closing the door behind him
'm sorry to scare you
(nervous) You can't be here
She speaks in Afrikaan-accented English
didn't know how else to meet you
could be expelled
25
Girls don't usually come to boxing matches
We went on a dare
Please
ignores her anxiety
Did you like it
It was
(beat) exciting
You were very good
(in Afrikaans) Thank you
'm glad  impressed you
(surprised) You speak the Taal
'll speak Zulu if it'll help me see you again
can't
Why not
need my father's permission
Is it hard to get
Hard for an Afrikaaner boy
Impossible for an English one
How about your permission
Do have that
Maria blushes
All of a sudden there is a  on the door
Maria starts
moves quickly behind the door as it opens to 26
#1 We're having coffee upstairs
Want to come
have to finish this paper
#2 Come when you're finished
We'll be up late
They close the door
Maria reinforces it with her body
Please go
You didn't answer my question
There are plenty of English girls
What makes me so important
The way  felt when  saw you
He is so direct she can only blush deeper
Her response is indirect but affirmative
My father will insist on meeting you
can't wait
, the outside door to the dorm opens
matron's voice calls out
(
) Lights out, ladies
Now please
opens her window and starts to climb out
(in Afrikaans) Good night, Maria Marais
(in English) Good night,
27
pauses
don't remember telling you my name
(smiling) And  don't remember telling you mine
smiles back at her
He drops to the ground
Maria closes the window and watches him scoot across the campus until he is swallowed by the night

a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek, an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang- ing of Boer farmers by British regulars
Women and children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn in the background
Boer kommandos sniping at a British column on the veldt

Jan Piet Marais
My uncle
At 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him
My people
The English
consider myself an African, sir
As do
As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele
We're all Africans
But all from separate tribes, ay
28
Unfortunately
Why do you say that
Because it's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in South Africa
The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism
They come from counter-tribalism
From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God's creation, should be tampered with
Does the gazelle sleep with the lion
Does the rhino graze with the mouse
The separation of things is not coincidental
Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than  do
No, sir
But  don't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has
Which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law
Laws define rights
But do they define justice
Ah
Justice
The banner behind which the English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world
Justice, my boy, is only relative to who's in charge
And how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice
(beat) with all due respect
29
Marais fixes  with a stare
's eyes meet his evenly, unwavering
Maria enters
Papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor
(pleasant) The library, mein leib
Maria smiles at  and exits
He leads  towards the library
can't figure out if you're brave or foolish
Why is that, sir
You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter
Correct
Yes, sir
And knowing  who  am, what  stand for, do you  think this sort of discussion  is going to put that request in  a favorable light
thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think
Let me give you some advice then
You're right
admire a keen mind
But intellectual reputation or not,  am first a Marais, a member of the Volk
(') And if you're trying to impress a member of the Volk with your intellect, don't do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an English private school
30
These ideas  picked up somewhere else
Marais opens the library door
(joking) No doubt from an expert on race relations
Actually, sir, from an expert on cactus

-                                 40 brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below
On the rock, a seven-year-old  sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape
long shadow covers him
The  of a  is heard
turns, shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots and kneesocks, holding a box camera
() Ja
Perfect
You will excuse me, please
, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from the sun's glare down to 's level
On his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it
This  do not normally without permission do, ja
But to catch the expression
After all, it is the expression that is important
Ja
Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat
You have some problems,  think
am Professor Karl von Vollensteen
Doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly
'm
He holds out his hand
Doc takes it
Such a young person with such an 31
old expression
think we can be friends
Ja
Eighteen-year-old  narrates
(
) That was how  met Doc, as he insisted  call him
chance meeting between a directionless seven-year-old boy and an old German professor out collecting cacti on the African bush veldt
(pause) So began my education
Doc and  walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails, down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always explaining
(
) Doc believed the brain had two functions and that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with only one
The brain,
, has two functions
It is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have
Ja
But also from it comes original thought
In school you will get all filled up with the facts
Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think
And then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been
Doc and  sit high up
watches the endless animal migration below while Doc points things out across the landscape
(
) Doc knew everything
He had a love of learning
But his real passion was centered around two things -- music and cacti
: 41
'                                            41 and Doc walk up a steep road toward Doc's house which sits on top of the hill, both carrying cacti-filled 32
packs
(
) Until he was fifty, Doc had a successful career as a concert pianist all over Europe
On his fiftieth birthday he gave it all up and moved to South Africa
From that point on it was all cactus
: 42
-                                 42 Behind Doc's simple, whitewashed cottage is a magnif- icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples Doc has collected for years
and Doc plant another specimen
Doc photographs it
records its genus in a notebook
(
) Every specimen Doc found would be carefully photographed and catalogued
: 43                                                          43 Doc an  walk through the cactus garden
If God would choose a plant to represent Him,  think He would choose of all plants the cactus
This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man
It is true
Look
The cactus is humble but not submissive
It grows where no other plant will grow
The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand
Not a complaint
In good times or bad it will still flower
It protects itself from danger
Doc touches a cactus needle
But it harms no other plant
It 33
has patience and solitude and modesty
In Mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night
That is saintliness of the highest order  think
Ja
From cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of God or stare into the mouth of hell
It is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness
Modesty, beauty
Toughness and gentleness
Of all the plants  think it is closest to God
Ja
(
) Doc was a hard man to disagree with
So when he decided  must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my educational environment  didn't argue
: 44
'                                  44 Shabbily-genteel, Doc sits in his Sunday best, a cup of tea on his lips, talking in earnest to 's pipe- puffing, also shabbily-genteel grandfather as  looks on
(
) Appealing to my grandfather's stoic belief in the primacy of European culture in all its forms, Doc offered to instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate and gather his precious cacti
: 45
'                                         45 Doc and  practice on a beautiful Steinway, so grandly out of place in Doc's simple abode
(
) As a student of music  was never more than adequate, something suspect Doc knew from the start
It is the love of music that is most important, he would tell me, and  would believe him
34
: 46
46 Doc and  wander through the jungle looking for flora
Everything fits,
Nothing is unexplained
Nature is one big chain reaction
Everything depends on everything else
From the smallest to the biggest
Always in life an idea starts small like a tree
Doc shows  a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it
This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky
But this little vine can choke it and keep it small
Most people are like these vines
Afraid of new ideas
Afraid to let things grow
Doc rips the vine away from the tree
Always listen to yourself
Follow your own idea
If you are wrong, so what
You learn something
And with learning you grow stronger
And if you are right at the beginning
An even bigger bonus
: 47
-                                           47 Doc and  move alongside the great herds
(
) roamed the kloofs and ridges, the dry riverbeds and jungle floors with Doc for over a year, learning more than  realize even today
(pause) also played a lot more 'God Save the King' due to my new musical celebrity

-                                          48 Barberton, a small town on the low veldt, in all its colonial backwater splendor
(
) Barberton was a very proper English town with a proper square, a wide main street, and the colonials' overblown patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen, hanging in the air like fine dust
Not quite seen, but there nonetheless
: 49
49 plays "God Save the King" on the stage
The town's population stands -- the men, stoic; the women, dewey- eyed, at patriotic attention
Some people file out -- the men in officers' uniforms of the South African penal system and their wives -- Boers
They exit to the dagger stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her Majesty's loyal subjects
(
) The only Afrikaaners to live in Barberton were sent there to work at the government prison, just outside town
Germany had covertly supported the Boers in their two unsuccessful wars against British rule, supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample stocks of ammunition
(
)(') Germany was an old friend, a trusted friend
And in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond for life, as the war in Europe grew fiercer tensions in Barberton heated up
Suspicion was afoot
Spies were everywhere
: 36
50
'  -                            50 Doc and  walk toward the cottage
Doc reads 's report card
Grammar: satisfactory
Science: satisfactory
Mathetmatics: satisfactory
He looks down at
, if there is one thing know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory
Ja
But  don't want to be known as a brain
Why not
Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school
My boy, to be smart is not a sin
But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one
And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be
He hands  the report card, his displeasure obvious
As they crest the hill the cottage comes along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it
Seeing Doc and , the soldiers smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing
Doc's face grows pale, his lips tight
pulls close to him for support
Again it begins
The stupidity
Do not be frightened
Doc puts na arm around 's shoulder, drawing him close, comforting him
One of the soldiers pulls a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances
: 37
51
51 car pulls up
Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the car
exits after him
Two guards lead Doc toward the doorway to the prison, a square in the looming gates
Doc walks, his head held high
walks alongside holding his hand
(
) Karl von Vollensteen, for the failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with His Majesty's government orders to do so, you are hereby sentenced to be confined at Barberton prison for the duration of the war with Germany
At the door a guard touches 's   shoulder, holding him back
The door opens
Doc goes     through
Just before the door closes he looks back at    one last time
The door slams shut
, with tears    streaming down his cheeks, is left outside

'  -                                      52 Morrie lies in bed, asleep
sits up at his desk, writing
(
) And again  was alone with nothing to depend on to see me through except the power of one
puts down his pen and sits, regarding the pages
He raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a rock
smiles at hidden memories, caps his fountain pen, turns off the light
The room is pitched into darkness
: 53
-                             53 The seedy side of town
carrying a gym bag and Morrie looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come striding up the alley
38
Look, even if the scholarship doesn't come through, my old man said he'd lend you the money
Morrie
All right
All right
We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen
' How's that
Tell your father  appreciate the offer
God,  hate people who can't be bought
Why is that
don't know
Personality disorder

Undoubtedly
The boys come to their destination marked by a rickety, faded sign: "'
" Excitement shines in 's eyes
He bounds up the narrow flight of stairs
: 54
54 Morrie and  rush up the stairs, stop at the landing, and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym
They take a breath and enter
: 55
55 down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of 39
men training
Sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood
Fighters, both black and white, train with each other
Morrie is amazed
How do they get away with this
But  has his mind on other things
His eyes fix on an   across the room standing by ringside
There he is
Christ, he's old
And he's the best
'mon
leads Morrie across the gym
passes an African fighter
He stops training when he sees
He turns to another African fighter, glancing at
One by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish- Jewish accent
( ) No, no
God gave you two hands so you can knock a man out from either side
Left-right
He moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate
Mr
Goldman
Solly turns to the boys
look of bemusement comes over his face when he sees their blazers
What
You boys lost
'm the one who called you yesterday
From the Prince of Wales School
Oh yeah, yeah
The champeen
Right
(smiling) Right
40
And who are you
The champeen's manager
Solly rolls his eyes to heaven
Oy gevalt
(beat) You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to
Three knockdowns you win
Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw
He hits the canvas inches from where they are standing
Solly,  and Morrie all look at him, and then at each other
What does it cost for you to train him
For my personal attentinons, Mr
Manager
Fifty pounds a month
For one of them
(points to the other men working with fighters) less
Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly
Here's for six months in advance
Three hundred pounds
Solly pushes the money back
Six months
don't know your boy'll last six minutes
'll last
Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has stopped working and is staring at
41
What are you staring
Punch, don't stare
'mon
Work or you're out
The blacks go back to work
That your gear
Yes, sir
Go change in the back
We'll see if you couldn't find a better use for all that money
Thank you, sir
heads towards the rear
Solly turns to Morrie
Why's he want to do this, a nice- looking schoolboy
He wants to be welterweight champ of the world
Solly breaks up laughing
Oh sure, sure
And 'd like to be twenty-five again
You like to make book on it
(joking) You giving odds
You name them
Solly gives him a long look
You both meshugah
Solly walks away

-                                            56 is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well-built opponent
Morrie stands at ringside with Solly
Let's just start out nice and easy now
He hits the bell
The fighters circle
's opponent starts punching, jabbing, probing
After two feints he comes after  in earnest
steps left and peppers him with three quick blows to the face
Solly's interest is suddenly piqued
Again the fighters circle
Again the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks
This time  dodges, hits him hard and spins him around, hitting him twice more
smile appears on Solly's face
The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches
The opponent unloads, banging away at  with everything he has
backs up two steps, then shifts positions
The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes
As he comes off the ropes  throws him an eight-punch combination, demolishing his opponent
steps back
The opponent sags
Solly hits the bell, clearly excited
Never  seen someone so young throw an eight-punch combination
Where did you learn such a thing
In prison, sir
You trying to be a comedian and a boxer
Mr
Manager, come to my office
We'll talk terms
You, get showered, and see me after
We'll talk training
Solly and Morrie head off toward Solly's office watches them go, a small victorious smile on his face

Of course to your English town he is a prisoner, a criminal
To us who respect such learning and culture, he is an honored guest

He hands  a pass
This pass is good for any time, any day
Would you like to see him now
Yes, sir
Come
will take you myself
Von Zyl rises and opens the door for
They exit
: 62
62 and Von Zyl walk together
We have cleared a little plot behind the cellblock for the cactus
And tomorrow we have the professor's piano moved here
There is not another instrument like it in the territory
Maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us, hey
Yes, sir
Just then the sound of  and  fills the air
passes a room set up as a boxing gym
Through a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached by some guards
Some guards are also being coached by a second man
third man,  , oversees the whole training session
watches, mesmerized
You like to box

Smit comes over
Sir
We have room for one more on the squad
Smit looks down at
He's a little small, Kommandant
We'll build him up then
Yes, sir
But  really don't have anyone  to spare to teach him right now
You know, with the tournament  coming up
There must be someone
Smit looks around the hall

You teach this boy basics, and you teach him good or  knock your black head flat, you hear

You took a big chance talking to my father the way you did
Not really
Going in  was behind on points with him
'm English
attend a politically suspect school
'm a boxer
He likes boxers
All men like boxers
But not for their daughters
So  had to find some way to make an impression
They get on line for the Ferris wheel
You could have picked a more agreeable topic
And made much less of an impression
Talk to someone about their passion
Even if they disagree they'll remember you
It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it
Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me, too
Days
Know what  think

You're dangerous
Their turn comes to mount the Ferris wheel
They get into the seat and strap in
When  was little we would go to my grandfather's farm in the high veldt for holiday
The Ferris wheel starts to go up
My father would take    me   to the top of the highest hill    and   we'd play this game, 'What Do    You   See' until we ran out of things    to   see
Do you ever play that
No

Now you
The wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops

Now you
see the big trees getting bigger, their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of Africa
The wheel stops again at its highest point

see the sun growing weaker, giving off less light
see the big trees dying because they cannot live without a lot of light
see the little trees take over the forest because they learn to adapt

(furtive) Excuse me, big baas
But can talk to the small baas
Of course
Geel Piet looks hesitantly from the man to the boy and then begins
Every day  see you bring the bucket and in the bottom is some tobacco leaf
It keeps the roots wet
What happens to the leaf after
little  use in some water to make a bug spray for the plants
And the rest we throw away
Geel Piet fidgets
He drops his head, speaking low
If you leave the pail when you go plant is a problem, small baas
don't understand
Is like this
You see how hard the life is for the people here in prison
Only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night -- a little smoke
Now with the big war in Europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside
Inside it is gone
We are the forgotten in here
We have bunches of leaves at home
'll bring a whole bucketful tomorrow
52
No, no
Mustn't do that, little baas
don't understand
What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous
Something the guards might not want the people to have
What's wrong with tobacco
Why wouldn't they want them to have it
What's wrong is people whose job it is to punish
After a little while it is all they know how to do
What should  do
This is for you to answer
The sound of a  on  turns them to the door where  , a side of beef with a sadist's eyes, stands, truncheon in hand
He enters the room and circles the trio
smell something not right here, ay, kaffir
He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon
(submissive) No, meneer sergeant
Everything okay here
Bormann swings his truncheon into the back of Geel Piet's knees, buckling the little man to the floor
don't fuckin' believe you
He glares at Doc and
If you're up to something 'll find out
53
Bormann, still eying them suspiciously, exits
Doc and help Geel Piet up
Schweinhund
No, no
This old kaffir's okay
Sorry to make any trouble, little baas
We  just stick to the boxing now on
Sorry, sorry
Geel Piet goes hobbling off, picking up towels
Doc and  go to exit
At the door  turns
Geel Piet
Geel Piet turns
leave my bucket on the side by Doc's toilet when  practice piano
Geel Piet breaks out a smile he usually keeps to himself and exits
looks up at Doc who tossles his hair approvingly
, to me you are the champion of the world already
Come
Let us go box now with Mr
Beethoven
and Doc exit

'                                                68 in the ring is about to start sparring
Solly gives him instruction as Morrie stands by
Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this
one-two
(he punches the air) One-two-three
the Solly Goldman thirteen
Okay
nods
Solly hits the
The sparring begins works his way in
54
That's it
That's it
Move him around
Jab jab
Slip slip
Now
pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight
Solly is silently counting
And
one-two
one-two-three
fires the last three punches like lightning and backs up
That's it
That's it
Now work around the defense
Jab jab
The opponent becomes aggressive
starts dancing, slipping punches
How do you get away with this, Mr
Why don't they close you down
mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other
In a public match
Not in a gym
Not yet anyway
The Boer is a funny people
Outside the ring the black is not equal
Inside he is
But only in private, not in public
So  keep my mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that's that
It's a crazy world, huh
from across the gym draws Solly's attention
He and Morrie turn to his office where his assistant stands with the tall black man from the Schoolboy Championships
Solly's face takes on a serious ex- pression
He rings the bell
He turns to Morrie
Work him on the heavy bag
Solly heads for his office
69                                                      69 turning away from his opponent
He and the tall black man trade a glance just before the man enters Solly's 55
office and Solly closes the door
: 70
70 pounds the heavy bag as Morrie stands by
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten
That's it
stops, relaxing
Morrie throws a towel over his shoulders
One of Solly's  comes over
Solly wants to see you two
and Morrie look at each other and head for Solly's office
: 71
71 Solly faces the door as it opens
and Morrie enter
You wanted to see us, Mr
Close the door
(beat) Someone  got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request
He wants to put you in a match
With who
young guy just turned pro
Gideon Mandoma
black fighter
They want him to fight a black fighter
In a black township
Sofiatown
Out of the question
Not even up for discussion
'mon,
56
Morrie goes to exit
doesn't
Who asked you to ask
The man who promotes all the fights in Sofiatown -- Elias Nguni
And you trust him
In thirty years  know him, number one on the list
You're both out of your minds
Did he tell you why he wants the match
told you what he told me
Just talking boxing -- how do match up with Mandoma
Pretty even
mean besides    getting thrown out of school and    into jail, do you know what else    happens you do this
He's a     pro
The minute you fight him    you're a pro
There's no purse being offered
That's a good career move
Risk everything to gain nothing
Very sound business sense
Tell Mr
Nguni 'll think about it
exits with Morrie steaming behind
They head for the locker room,  clearly perturbed
57
Okay
What's going on
don't know
Well why don't you tell me what you do know
There's an African myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors
They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel
That chanting at the school championships
For you
haven't heard it in years
begins to disrobe
And how did this honor fall on your broad back
told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton
Well after that was going for a while  learned that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did
They couldn't read or write
So you did it for them
Right
And after that
clothing program for their families and a food program
One thing sort of led to another
58
can see where 'angel' would be an appropriate title
(beat) But it was, uh, this Geel Piet who was really behind all of it, wasn't it
He was very good at pointing things out
Man like that should be running a country, not rotting in prison
He's not in prison anymore
(pause) He's dead
steps into the shower pulling the curtain closed
: 72
72 and Morrie exit the locker room
73   '  -                                73 talking to Solly
She sees  and smiles
74                                                  74 and Morrie come up
thought 'd surprise you
Well, you succeeded
Mr
Goldman was explaining the theory behind the left hook
Beats talking about the weather
You may have heard about me
59
'm Morrie
Oh yes
How d'you do
Solly's Assistant whistles for him
Well, nice meeting you, Maria
Nice meeting you, Mr
Goldman
We never had a girl come to the gym
(beat) It's not such a bad thing, huh
Solly moves off
You got a pass to come out on a weeknight
Maria lifts her jumper a bit, displaying the results of treeclimbing on her knees
Your tree pass
moves Maria and Morrie off down the stairs
Do you box too, Morrie
Do  look that daft
Morrie's the brains of the operation
He means the bank
Your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance
They exit the staircase
75     -    -                         75 in the shadow of the alley stands, smoking a cigarette
60
76                                          76 (in Zulu) see you, Nguni
see you,
They talk across the narrow street
You have heard my request
Yes
Why do you make it
woman has thrown the sacred ox bones
She has made a fire and read the smoke
What did she read
That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief
But it's not true that 'm a chief
Who knows what is true and what is not
The legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people
They see you box the Boer and always you win
They have heard the stories from Barberton
The people live with little hope
They must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man
And   if  lose
If the spirit of the   Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not   exist in me anymore, then what will   they live with
Less hope
But still they must 61
see
It is our way
At that moment a spotlight blinds them
police car comes up the alley, stopping in front of them
The exit, threatening
#1 What's this here
Maria is gripped by fear
Morrie is cautious, unmoving
An old family servant, Officer
From home
We just ran into each other
#2 Papers, man
Come on, be quick
Nguni reaches into his pocket
#1 Where you coming from
Gym, sir
train there
#1 And you
'm his manager
The Police look at each other and share a laugh
#2 (to Maria) And you're the sparring partner, hey
The Police laugh
Police #2, satisfied Nguni's papers are in order, hands them back
#2 You have an hour to curfew and a long way to go, kaffir
Be off
(subservient) Yes, baas
Going right now
Nguni moves off, no semblance of the proud man in his gait
62
Nguni
Nguni turns
'll do it
Nguni smiles and disappears into the night
watches him go
: 77
77 and Maria stand by the tree set to climb over the wall
'm scared for you,
Solly's a great teacher
He wouldn't put me in a fight couldn't handle
mean about how involved you are with the black people
That scares me
Because you don't understand them
No  don't
If you did you wouldn't be so scared
You ever have a conversation with a black person
Of course
Besides a servant
Maria's silence is her answer
You should sometime
hate it when you tease me
63
Sorry
He kisses her
(pouty) No you're not
Yes  am
He kisses her again
This time she responds, kissing him back
The kisses become more passionate, touching, feel- ing
The heat in both of them begins to rise when a car passes, its headlights arcing across the tree, startling them out of their passion
They cling to the shadows until the car turns the corner
better go
They kiss once, lightly
boosts her over the wall and waits until she is safely on the other side before run- ning off into the night

-                  78 The Oxford Board of , eminent academics all, sit four across at a lecture table, looking absolutely musty with learning
Across from them  sits, a folder in his lap
One man,  , peruses the file in front of him
According to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world
Lewis reads the last sentence with a tinge of amusement in his voice
Yes, sir
Don't you   find seeking a career as a pugilist   and reading for a degree at   Oxford a bit, how shall we put it,   intellectually 64
incompatible
Lord Byron was a boxer, sir
And 've never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity
One of the other Examiners coughs theatrically to hide his smile
Lewis looks down the table at the man
do not recall Lord Byron actually engaging in matches for money
Actually, sir, there are several recorded instances of Lord Byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money
#2 Quite right
Yes
In   a letter to his wife Shelley makes mention of just such a thing
For  hundreds of pounds, actually
Lewis has heard enough
Let's move along, shall we
As your presentational you've requested to read from a work of your own fiction
Yes, sir
Well, then, let us hope we'll be treated to the stirrings of another Byron
His sarcasm is not lost on
ignores it, opens his folder, and begins to read
The Concerto for the Southland and the Death of Geel Piet
(pause) His name was Geel Piet -- yellow Peter
He was a mix of half the blood in Africa -- Dutch, Portuguese, Zulu, Sotha, and who knew what else
His father 65
deserted his mother before he was born
His stepfather threw him out to survive on the streets of Capetown when he was nine
: 79
79 Geel Piet is instructing a nine-year-old  in the Geel Piet eight
Both boy and man are enjoying what they do -- and each other

) When  met him he had spent forty of his fifty-five years in one South African prison or another
He was a thief, a con man, a black marketeer
As the narration continues, the   : 80   --                                              80 with a much better grasp of the Geel Piet eight
He and Geel Piet seem closer than ever
(
) He may   even have killed a man or two in   his time
But despite all that he   was one of the kindest, wisest,   most self-effacing persons ever   knew
He was my teacher; he was   my friend
: 81
81 sits opposite a black prisoner who talks to him
, thirteen years old now, writes what the man says on a piece of paper
When he is finished, he folds it, puts it into an envelope, and hand it to the man
The man smiles, shakes 's hand profusely, and exits
turns to Geel Piet who is on his hands and knees polishing the floor, seemingly part of the surroundings
Geel Piet and share a smile
(
) Geel Piet bore no  animosity, held no hate
Should   a guard beat him he regarded it as  self-inflicted, 66
the result of some carelessness on his part
To survive the system he lived in he became an expert in the art of camouflage, a master of the invisible
In this he strove to be perfect, and in the end it was his quest for perfection that provoked anger from above and killed him

They chant a verse to Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
is a little embarrassed by it
You know every time they do that want to jump up and say 'm just a twelve-year-old
'm not anything else
To them you are
You are the one who brings the smoke, the one who writes the letters, the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold
You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
But you know that's not true
Who is to say what is true and what is not true, kleine baas
Doc comes running up, excited, waving a newspaper
The Allied armies have crossed the Rhine into Germany
It is almost over
That's great, isn't it
He turns to Geel Piet
67
(subdued) Yes, kleine baas
You are a good    faker, Geel Piet
but you don't    think it's great at all
It means     you lose your star letter writer    and tobacco importer
No matter that, Professor
We always manage here
What pains me most is  lose my boxer
'll come back
(adamant) No, kleine baas
You leave this damn place you don't come back never
Geel Piet, when a painter finishes a work of art he doesn't lose it
He sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation
This is what you are going to do
And to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here, have composed an entire concerto -- 'The Concerto for the Southland' -- which it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners before  leave
Not possible
The kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing
He'll think it's a concert for him and the brass
But we'll know, ay
And the people will know
He'll never let black be with white here, Doc
If the black is part of the 68
orchestra, like the piano, he will
But the people have no instruments in this place, big baas
They have their voices
Each tribe a different voice, a different language -- all singing together
It is brilliant, no
Except the tribes don't trust each other
They don't even talk to each other
(crestfallen) Oh
This is correct
This stupid hatred
They will do it for you, kleine baas
You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
You bring the tobacco
You write the letters
You put clothes on their children's bodies and food in their bellies
All you do is ask and they all sing for you
He's right
Wunderbar
You are the smartest of us all
Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit truncheon stops him
All turn to Sergeant Bormann
kaffir smarter than all of us
You are a strange German, Professor
That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin you admire
He is the strange German
And soon kaput,  hope
If that's true you'll not be long for this place, eh, Professor
69
No, Sergeant
God willing
And you, too, little Rooinek
But you, kaffir, Hitler comes or goes
He takes Geel Piet's hand
You are going to stay with me
He forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus with long thorns
And  will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone
One slip
He pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle
Geel Piet does not cry out
have you
He lets go of Geel Piet's hand
Geel Piet removes it from the cactus, bloodied
Get out of here
Geel Piet takes his watering can and goes
You see, Professor, they are not like us
white man would scream bloody murder
Doc and  glare at Bormann
He smirks and walks away
(
) As the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind
and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders, talking, agreeing, shaking hands
(
) Having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups, we set about instructing them
Four men from each tribe were taught the 70
intricacies of their group's parts
They were the choral leaders responsible for teaching the others
and Doc instruct
Doc plays the piano
leads the singers
Geel Piet turns the pages for Doc
(
) At night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing
: 83
83 Nervous guards patrol as the  of the prisoners singing wafts through the air
: 84
84 Geel Piet instructs
(
) My boxing instruction accelerated as well
It was as if Geel Piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge he had before we parted
And always from the corners and shadows Bormann watched and waited
Bormann watches  and Geel Piet from the door of his room, his truncheon beating idly against his leg
: 85
85 photographer sets up a group picture of the boxing squad -- kids and guards
Geel Piet stands off to one side,
(
) Our boxing squad, the Barberton Blues, won the State Championship with a perfect record
won at 100 lbs
It was my first championship
It made me want 71
more
The group disperses
beckons the photographer to wait
He grabs Geel Piet and forces him to stand, much to the little man's protestations, for a photo of the two of them
As the picture is taken Geel Piet has the widest smile imaginable
86
-                               86 The guards, all in crisp uniforms, patrol nervously, truncheons at the ready
The towers bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard
(
) Finally the night of the concert arrived
The prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening
Each prisoner entering the yard is searched
It was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling
Divide and conquer
The policy of control
(
) (') This was to be the first time in the history of the South African prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle
And if trouble came, it would be the last
All the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc, who is raised with the piano on a small stage
Guards surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing a black center
The front of the yard is filled with seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local Afrikaan Hierarchy
is overseeing the seating of the prisoners when Doc comes up to him
Have you seen my page turner
No
He asks a prisoner in Zulu
Have you seen Geel Piet
The man shakes his head
looks worried
72
(reassuring) He will come
The Kommandant, all medals and polished leather, mounts the stage, signaling a beginning to the festivities
Where is Bormann
need Bormann to translate to the prisoners
don't know, Kommandant
Is there a problem here, Kommandant
want to address these filthy kaffirs but  don't have a translator
'll translate
You can speak Zulu,
Yes, sir
All right
Listen up
He addresses the prisoners
Tell them this concert is the gift to them from the professor who, even though he is in prison, is not a dirty criminal like them but a man of culture and learning
(subtitled) The Kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing
For such a man  am happy to do this
But one hair of trouble and it's finish
73
(subtitled) He hopes each tribe will sing its best and bring honor to its people
One wrong move and you get marched back to your cells and don't come out for a month
(subtitled) He says tonight let us be one people under the African sky
The prisoners break into spontaneous applause
Von Zyl looks at , unsuspecting, pleased
You did a good job
Thank you, sir
Professor
He turns the stage over to the professor and takes his seat
The professor sits at his stool, poised
, in front of the singers, watches him for a cue
Doc drops his head
points to a group of singers
and blend spontaneously
"The Concerto for the Great Southland" begins
Doc plays magnificently with great style
focuses on leading the singers
Each section, each tribe singing its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on rhythm, pace and tone
87                                                    87 leading the singers in and out of the

91                                                  91 Instinctively the first four prisoners in each group, the leaders, stand and turn to face their people
They take up the lead
, distracted by his inner vision, runs off stage
Doc looks after him, worried, but keeps playing

runs through the corridors
He runs through the kitchens, the empty dining area, the  of the concert chasing after him
He runs through the recreation area and past the boxing room when he hears a , and another
93
93 He bolts into the room and hits the light switch
The light over the ring comes on, illuminating Bormann, truncheon raised over the lifeless, broken body of Geel Piet
No
Startled, Bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood- ied head in his lap, and begins to sob
along Geel Piet's arm to his bloodied hand, holding the snapshot of him and
The Concerto grows  around  until it enfolds him in its melodies
The voices of Africa, the music of Europe, reaching for a musical and spiritual crescendo
(
) Geel Piet died of massive internal hemorrhage, the result of Bormann's ramming a truncheon up into the little man's body until his entrails spilled out
When reached him he was already dead

voices rising to heaven above, even as her blood soaked the ground below

The night  escaped from the Tsar's Army it was just like this
Six of us -- four Jews, two Ukranians
Dark as anything
No streets

It is not for you or me to say what it means
An old man, one of the dignitaries says something to Nguni
Please
He motions for  to step on the scale
does
The weight is duly noted
Mandoma then does the same
The twelve men are satisfied
They head for the exit
It is time
He motions for the others to follow
goes to walk with Maria
Nguni pairs him with Mandoma
They exit the room
: 103
103 The party walks towards a big double door behind which a single   can be vaguely heard
Nguni knocks on the door
104
104 The doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with humanity
boxing ring is raised in the center
The only lights in the area directly over it
With the twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way through a path in the crowd
An   with a fly switch, not unlike Inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring
As  passes the whispers start
Onoshobishobi
80
The Woman in the ring begins to chant
The crowd picks it up
Onoshobishopi Ingelosi
Shobi shobi Ingelosi
looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are Morrie and Solly
He looks across at Mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing
The two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners
The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into 's face
She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd
Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
The crowd picks up the chant
She waves and the crowd goes silent
Somewhere in the darkness a single voice begins to sing "Nkosi Sikelel  Afrika" -- the African national anthem
The crowd picks it up
looks down to the front row where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat of honor among the twelve men in suits
The African national anthem finishes
The three times
The Old Woman is led from the ring
An Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves the two fighters forward
You are listening to me please
When  am shouting break, you must break at once
When a knockdown is coming, it is for an eight count
No heads, no elbows
You fight clean or by golly  am giving you penalty points
Good luck, boys
and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective corners
What do you see
Solly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring
very tough fight
The
81
Watch the left hook
Mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire everything in his arsenal at , overwhelming him cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat- ing combinations which end in a left hook to 's jaw
drops like lead
The Referee starts counting shakes his head clear and rises at eight
The Referee checks his gloves
There is a cut under his right eye
Continue
Again, Mandoma comes charging hard
defends himself as best he can, trying to counter
But Mandoma's offense won't allow it
He beats on  until the round ends sits down in his corner
Morrie works on his eye
God, he hits like a truck
He's going for the quick knockout
He can't keep it up
Soon the truck runs out of gas
If he catches me again like that 'll run out of gas -- permanently
The
is hardly off his stool when Mandoma is on him, pummeling him
backpedals, bobs and weaves
Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each one looking to end the fight
Mandoma gets  against the ropes and bangs away
covers up
Mandoma punishes his arms and kidneys
swings back and es- capes
Mandoma pursues him
He catches  with a body chop and then a chopping left
goes down again
The Referee starts to count
The crowd is completely silent
The
returns to his corner, shaking his head, trying to clear it
He flops onto his stool
He's had it
He's got no strength in his punch
Could've fooled me
'm telling you
82
Tell him
Look -- he's taking water
They all look

106                                                   106 See
Where that water goes -- you go
Right to here
He pokes 's belly
You put your punches there, you win
You don't, you lose
The
Mandoma comes charging out
goes on defense
He hits Mandoma hard to the head
Mandoma whips around and hits him hard
spins and hits the canvas
His vision blurs, doubles
The  of a fills his head
: 107                                                            107 struggling to climb the rocks in the pool below the waterfall
He is halfway across this time

The crowd goes wild
The Referee holds up six fingers
How many fingers
Six
Where are you
In a fight behind on points
Okay
Continue
Mandoma rushes in for the kill
feints and comes up under one of Mandoma's punches, burying a body shot into his gut
Mandoma grunts and backs up
pursues him
Mandoma tries to recover
He throws another big punch
ducks under it and puts two more hooks into Mandoma's stomach
Mandoma starts to back up for the first time in the fight
boxes, jabbing, feinting, pushing Man- doma around the ring, taking control
Mandoma, heading for exhaustion, throws another big punch in desperation
hits him with three punches in return
Mandoma swings again with a last desperate effort, and  buries the Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down
The crowd goes silent
The Referee counts Mandoma out
He raises 's hand
Still, the crowd is silent
We're in the shit now
Nice knowing you, Solly
He and Solly look around at       the somber black faces flick- ering in the shadows of the       ring light
looks  down at Mandoma in silence
Mandoma        rises unsteadily
He  stands in front of , staring into       his eyes, and then he raises 's arm above his head

The crowd goes wild, chanting, singing over and over as and Mandoma stand in center ring, arms raised

Solly and Morrie wait in the car
The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays from now
would like it if you could escort me
Maria Marais with a rooinek at the Senior Dance
What will people think
They'll think what they think and 'll think what  think
And what is that
Maria touches his face
Her eyes soften
think  love you
swallows hard
They kiss and embrace
caresses her face
would be honored to be your escort
Maria beams
didn't doubt it for a minute
Solly  the
kisses Maria once more
'll give you a boost

Maria boosts up to the first branch of the tree
She crests the wall
Thank you for tonight
You were great
She smiles and drops down behind the wall

113 Morrie is sleeping in the back seat
Solly and  are sitting in the front
When you and your manager first came to me with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you did not have a big believer here
But  gotta tell you
Now you do
In London lives Benny Rosen, the greatest trainer in the world today
When you go to your Oxford  give you a letter to Rosen
Whatever can't do for you, he can
Thanks, Mr
Solly pokes Morrie awake
And  give the address of a very good bookmaker
Teach you also a thing or two
Now, go on back to being fancy-schmancy English gentlemen
'm proud of both of you
and Morrie exit the car and run back to the school

114 As  and Morrie jog toward their dorm a  stops them from behind
(
) Gentlemen
and Morrie stop cold
They turn to St
John, up early 86
for his daily constitutional
You're up early, sir
Best time for walking
Best time for running too, sir
Have to put in the roadwork, sir
You know, keep those legs strong
St
John eyes the bruise on 's cheek
Yes
Quite a fresh bruise there
tripped
Maybe you should change your footwear
He looks down at their shoes
Both boys are wearing pro- per shoes; not at all what would be worn for roadwork
To something a little more appropriate for
(beat) roadwork
Busted, the boys squirm uncomfortably
Yes, sir
St
John fixes them with a look, and then walks off
The boys bolt into the dorm

Gideon Mandoma sits in a chair facing the door
He rises
Please excuse me for coming like a thief by the window
87
You speak English
is surprised
Mandoma nods
You are a great fighter, Gideon
Second greatest in this room
But you didn't come to talk about fighting
Mandoma shakes his head
He waits for a moment, then begins
When you say to me, Onoshobishobi Ingelosi means nothing, you are right
And you are wrong
The legend gives the people hope for a good tomorrow
But hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people
You cannot write our letters, get us clothes, food, work
These things we must do ourselves, so we can be part of this country's good tomorrow
If we are not, the hope will disappear
The people will grow tired
The tired will grow angry and there will be no good tomorrow for anybody -- black or white
What are you asking from me
To be part of something you must know what everyone else knows
We have our own knowledge
We need yours
We get our knowledge in schools, Gideon
We're not born with it
Then it must be the same with us
You have schools
88
Yes
And teachers who cannot do more than their own 's
We have a system made not to teach us
(anxious) am only seventeen years old, Gideon
cannot teach five million people how to speak English and do sums
You taught the singing to thousands at Barberton Prison
You were only twelve
Mandoma rises
(') You are a great fighter,
Second greatest in this room, Gideon
Mandoma exits through the window

'                                     116 stands in front of a pondering St
John
You are asking me for a lot, young man
'm only asking you to put what you've taught us into practice, sir
You are asking me to put the reputation of this school in jeopardy
The reputation of this school, sir, is based on its integrity
89
'm aware of that
'm also aware of what will happen if this ever gets out
We live in a country where the rules are being rewritten
Then we'd better be careful to keep a firm hand on our pens
(beat) sir
St
John regards
All right

Here are my conditions: you tell no one; you operate at night on Saturdays when the student body is gone; you involve no one besides yourself and Mr
Levy
If you can comply, you can have your school

Maria is given a head start of ten yards
Ready

Go
They both take off
Maria runs     as hard as she can catches up to her
She strains     with the effort crosses the finish line first
Maria trips and falls, rolling in the sand
comes     back to her
He kneels down
You okay
You're supposed to let me win
Then you'd say  was being condescending
You were guilty of that when you gave me a head start
90
She kisses him and stands up
They begin to walk along the beach
Get your formal yet
grows uncomfortable
Uh
no
The dance is only a week away
Maria
(beat) can't come to the dance
(shocked) Why not
have an obligation
Can't you change it
It's a permanent obligation
Every Saturday night
(beat) It starts tonight
Maria cannot believe what she is hearing
You're breaking up with me
No
Then what could be so important that it takes all your Saturday nights
really can't say
Maria starts to cry
She throws her arm around him
91
,  love you
Please don't go away
'm not going away
Yes you are
can feel it
'm not
'm just tutoring
Maria pulls back
started a school
(beat) for Gideon Mandoma and some others in the seniors library
Maria's sadness turns to anger
'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs
You're not losing anything
No
Are you escorting me to the dance
Are you going to see me on the only free night they give us
Maria, this is important to me
And my life's important to me
Damn you
She runs off in tears

118 On an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest cover,  and Doc move along the sheer cliff face with photographic equipment and rucksacks
notices Doc's labored breathing and slow movements
They reach some small cacti growing out of the side of 92
the cliff in full bloom
(breathing hard) Ach
You see how beautiful
You ever hear of glycerine, Doc
Mr
Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants
Of course  know about glycerine
Triglycerine
Biglycerine
Monoglycerine
What do you want to know
Why you don't use it
It's only a little pill under the tongue
Tongues were not made to put little pills under
When  have to start with that,  become something else
Well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart
of  cuts into their conversation
Thick roiling rain clouds appear suddenly
Little pills or no little pills -- we don't find cover, we both turn into something else
Lightning splits the sky
Rain begins to fall, pelting the escarpment
Look for a cave
Always in this kind of rock there is caves
Quick
Quick
starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like a spider on a wall
Doc follows
The rain becomes torrential
turns to look back at Doc
Don't look at me
Go
93
forges ahead
119     -                                          119 some 20 yards ahead
120                                                        120 've found something
The rain is so heavy  can barely make out Doc behind him
When he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing hard
makes his way back to Doc
Halfway there, Doc waves him forward and starts to move
reaches the small opening and slips in
: 121
121 stoops in the small cave, dripping wet
moment later Doc's foot appears at the entrance
helps him in
Doc slumps down, exhausted
You okay
Breathing too   hard to reply, Doc shakes his head in the affirmative
looks out at the rain forming a sheer wall of water   outside
He turns to Doc, who is getting up, flashlight   in hand
What are you doing
Exploring
Why don't you just rest
Plenty time for resting when  am something else
Look
He strikes a match
wind from inside the cave blows it side to side
When does a cave have wind
This 94
is more than some little cave, my friend
Doc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening
He shines the light into it
Here
See
There is a passage
Before  can say anything else, Doc has wriggled through the small opening
, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows
: 122
122 crawls after Doc, making his way through the small tunnel on his stomach
You know the pyramids are nothing more than man's attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had -- the cave
It is the ultimate safe resting place
The first place man could lay down and have a good night's sleep without worrying about waking up as something's supper
Doc stops crawling
So does
can be heard
You hear that
There is something waiting for us
Doc starts moving quicker
Let's hope it's not hungry
Doc squeezes out of the small space
joins him in a slightly larger tunnel, the same size as the first one -- stoop height
Better, ja
What's that smell
95
All of a sudden there is a  noise
What's that
Doc recognizes the sound
He pounces on , knocking him to the floor and covering him with his body
Not a moment too soon
For a thousand bats fill the tunnel flying through
123   '  -                                            123 flying wildly through the flashlight beams
In a blur, the bats are gone, disappeared into another tunnel entrance to the left
124                                                  124 Doc an  rise slowly
The silence of the cave is punctuated by the
Maybe it's stopped raining
Who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave
You don't know that
The bats didn't come from a shoebox, Mr
Know-It-All
Doc heads off
Sometimes  think maybe sending you off to that fancy-shmancy school was not such a good idea
It was your idea
Your'e the one who pushed for me to go
Ja
But who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of 96
your brain
Which part is that
The one where is all the questions
The curiosity center
Look
Ahead in the tunnel is a luminous glow, filling an entrance
Did  tell you
Doc and  hurry on
125     -                                    125 As they come to a tunnel opening: a large cave, perhaps 200 feet wide by 100 feet high, filled with stalactites and stalagmites composed of pure, crystallized calcium carbonate
Wunderbar
The whole chamber    glistens with an eerie phosphorescence
Toward one end of    the crystallized room eight stalagmites grown up from the    floor cement to form a huge crystal slab some ten feet    off the floor
buttress of stalg- mites drip off it    forming a natural, if uneven, stairway
126                                                    126 Doc and  stare at the crystal cave in amazement
How many hundreds of thousands of years to make this masterpiece
Everything outside can change, This remains the same
We are in the heart of Africa,
The heart of Africa
Doc, in his own world of wonderment, wanders down into the cave among the stalactites
follows, soon losing sight of Doc behind the large crystal columns
(
) You know, if a person stayed here for 100,000 years what would be 97
left
Crystal
Like a crystal mummy
Incredible, ja
(to himself) Incredible
Doc's preoccupation with death irks him
He studies a piece of crystal
wish we had brought the camera
Think there's enough light to shoot
Doc does not answer
Doc
His concern rises
He moves through the maze of crystal, his pace quickening
Doc
Still no answer
His vision obscured,  reaches the elevated slab
He clambers up the buttress for a better view
When he reaches the top he stops cold
127     -                                               127 lying on the crystal slab, eyes closed, hands folded on his chest
This is not funny
Doc opens his eyes
This is incredible
The crystal
You can feel the life go right through you
Here
Doc rises
Come try it
128                                                    128 98
(short) No
That's all right
Can we go
We have only just gotten here
What's the matter,
All day long you've been talking about becoming something else, about dying
You never talked about dying before
'm 87 next month
It's natural
Not to a sixteen-year-old it's not
It's painful
Doc realizes what  is saying
You are right
am sorry
Sixteen-year-old ears should only hear life
Doc starts to whistle "The Marriage of    Figaro" by Mozart
The  of the  off the    crystal sounds beautiful, exotic
Doc beckons  to     join in with him
does so, hesitantly
Then pleased     with the sound and the feeling, more fully
Doc and  exit through the stalactites, whistling
: 129
'  -                                  129 and a very exhausted Doc enter
Doc sits down heavily on the bed while , shrugging off his rucksack, heads right for the small kitchen area
'll just set you up with some coffee here, so in the morning you won't have to bother making it
He begins to prepare the coffee
didn't mean to tell you what 99
you can and can't talk about back in the cave today
guess just don't like to think of you being
(beat) (') becoming
(beat) something else
know it's natural law and it's the way it is with everybody
(beat) just wish it weren't with you
There is no reply
Doc
turns to Doc, dead asleep, still sitting up
goes over and gently lays the old man down
He removes his boots and throws a blanket over him
blows out the kerosene lamp and goes to exit
He is about to hang their two rucksacks on two hooks by the door when Doc's voice turns him
'm here, Doc
The crystal cave will be our secret, ja
Whatever you say
Promise
promise
Ja
Good
rest a little
(beat) The heart of Africa,
Doc lays down
The heart
100
He is asleep when his head hits the pillow
watches Doc's chest, washed in moonlight, rise and fall lightly
sudden sadness falls over him
The corners of his mouth turn up in a bittersweet smile
He finishes hanging the rucksack and exits
: 130
-                        130 and Morrie stick close in the shadows
looks at his watch and then twenty feet away to the locked gate
Christ
If someone would have told me this is where 'd be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, 'd call them batty
(beat) You know, you're going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one
That all
figured you'd hold me to it longer
You get the insider friend's rate
Thanks, mate
black groundskeeper comes walking along, seemingly on his duties
pokes Morrie
131     -                                     131 walks up to the gate
He looks left and right, then quickly unlocks it
He walks away
132                                                     132 and Morrie advance
opens the gate
As he does, 101
Gideon Mandoma, followed by 15 men and 5 women, enters
see you,
see you, Gideon
Let's get inside before the whole bloody world sees us
Morrie
He clasps Morrie's hand, first in a traditional hand- shake, then in an African handshake
Mandoma smiles
You some great friend
Morrie is taken by his sincerity
Let's go
Stay to the fence
The group moves out
: 133
133 The Africans are seated around desks, waiting for Morrie and  to tell them what to do
All right, class
know you don't understand a    word 'm saying, but part of    learning a language is hearing    it spoken
So --  am
He taps his chest
This

Now you all have a chalkboard
He holds up the chalkboard
Chalk and an eraser

Everyone freezes
Maria enters the room
is stunned

hurries over to Maria
Not a word needs to be spoken

Or  can just sit and watch
hands her the chalk

This is Maria

Maria takes the front of the class

135                                                   135 She battles the butterflies in her stomach as she writes an "" on the blackboard
She clears her throat

' No one says anything
Maria looks a little lost

All the Africans obey
looks up from checking the students
Maria's eyes are twinkling

136 The Africans are exiting
Maria, Morrie and  stand, receiving their heartfelt thanks one by one
Mandoma is the last to leave
(to Maria) You are one brave Boer, Miss Maria
Thank you
And you are one lucky English
He kids
blushes
Good night, Gideon
He playfully pushes Gideon out the gate and closes it
He turns to Maria and Morrie
Well,    think 'll go
um
lay on   my back and count the cracks   in the ceiling
'Night
Nice to   see you, Maria
104
Good night, Morrie
Morrie runs off
takes Maria around

They embrace and kiss
Can  ask you a favor
Anything
We don't have to go in    or anything
You can hear the music    from outside
'd love to     have one dance with you before     graduate

(reading) 'Dear sir
It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford,' etc
, etc
, etc
It says nothing about the scholarship
technicality
Another  comes over
St
John wants to see you two in his study
Good news travels fast
'll get showered and changed
106
He said to come as you are
Immediately
The Boy runs off, leaving  and Morrie wondering
: 140
'                                        140 and Morrie enter to a somber St
John
Wanted to see us, sir
Yes
Come in
Close the door
As the door closes,   , a quiet but formidable man, comes into their line of vision
Trouble is in the air
This is Brigadier Bretyn from the police department
Bretyn just nods his head
He has come to deliver, in person, an order to close the Saturday school
Why
Because it is illegal
We're only teaching them how to read and do sums
You don't have certification to do that
Prince of Wales is a certified school
Yes
But not certified for that 107
sort of thing
Can he do this, sir
Of course  can do it
Would be here if  couldn't
Come now meneer headmaster
Let's end this now
have a full day ahead of me still
St
John meets Bretyn's steely eyes
He cannot hold the man's gaze
(resigned) The Saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice
Thank you, meneer headmaster
Your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated
Good day
Bretyn goes to exit
You know it can't go on like this forever
St
John tenses
What can't
What you're doing
'm just doing my job
And if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours
Bretyn exits
Is that really the end of it, sir
For the moment 'm afraid it is
If we let them get away with it on our own grounds, it will never 108
change
It'll just get worse
History disputes you
History takes too long
Yes it does
But it is never kind to those who try to hurry it
feel we should resist, sir
So do ,
But this is not a subtle government
They mean to have their way and damn the consequences
And  cannot jeopardize this school, no matter how  personally feel
'm sorry
(beat) heard you were accepted at Oxford
Yes, sir
Received notification today
Well, congratulations
Thank you, sir
St
John looks at  who remains silent
To both of you
(tight) Thank you, sir
An uncomfortable silence lingers
We'll talk before you go
Yes, sir
Will that be all
That'll be all
109
turns immediately and exits
Morrie and St
John trade an uncomfortable look
: 141
141 walks down the hall, anger building in his face
He exits the hall
: 142
142 comes up to the main gate
stops him
'd like to see Maria Marais please
The Guard checks his list
Sorry
She's not allowed visitors
Well, if  could just talk to her
Sorry
backs away and moves off down the street
He turns the corner

Morrie
Morrie
What
110
want to show you something
What time is it
He looks at his watch and turns over
Can  see it later
No
Come on
He pulls Morrie out of bed
Morrie groggily starts pulling his clothes on
You know, when we get to Oxford -- separate rooms
Will you hurry
Is there some girl out there waiting for me
Yeah
Stunning
Breasts like casabas
Just waiting for you
Bullshit
throws a jersey into his chest and pulls him out of the room
: 145
145 The campus is swaddled in early morning fog
and Morrie stand on the side of the school chapel while a black groundsman opens the door to the basement
What do you think
think you're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards won't 111
come after us in here
The groundskeeper opens the door to the basement
The boys enter
: 146
146 switches on a light switch to a cavernous space cluttered with old desks, blackboards and church pews
This is a church
Didn't you ever hear of the Christian concept of sanctuary
Yes
But 'm not the one who has to respect it
Even the Boer has limits, Morrie
'm sure he does, but 'd still like to see a big bolt on the inside door
Mr
Levy
The Caretaker pulls a large deadbolt out of his pocket, with a smile

He passes by     Maria's window
When he is gone,  appears from     behind a tree
He taps on the window
Maria comes to the     window and sees him
Her face lights up
She opens      the window

Maria puts her finger to her lips and waves him in climbs through the window

She puts a record on her phonograph
She turns to and embraces him fiercely, holding on tight

He said if  didn't he'd see they arrest you and ruin your chances
couldn't let him do that

She releases him
They look at each other

As their lips part, their breath shortens
Maria moves forward slowly, lifting 's hand to her breast
He touches it
The heat builds
Passion overwhelms them
They begin to make love

-                                          151 Maria sleeps peacefully in 's arms on her small bed
lies awake, staring at the ceiling
He rises quietly so as not to wake her
He pulls on his clothes, gently brushes a wisp of hair away from her eyes, kisses her forehead, and exits through the window into the breaking dawn
: 152
-                                      152 and Morrie    stand by a side gate near the athletic field looking    alertly about
The gate  opens
The Africans led    by Mandoma come through
and Morrie greet them
When they are all through Morrie closes the gate and    runs after them
: 153
-                                     153 man with a walkie-talkie sits in the shadows, watching 25 people run across the athletic field
He talks into his walkie-talkie
114
: 154
154 The light switch is  on
The four lights above the center of the room  illuminate a classroom area -- desks set up in neat rows  with stools, a blackboard
The other furniture has  been piled high against the walls on either side of the  room where the light does not reach
If you'll all be seated we can begin
The Africans head toward their desks
turns to Morrie
So far so good
Morrie's response is to throw the new deadbolt into its slot with a skeptical eye
takes his place at the head of the class
want to thank you all for having the courage to come tonight
(in Zulu) Thank you
(in Zulu) You're welcome
will be teaching the first part of class tonight and Mr
Levy will teach the second
woman whispers something to Mandoma
Mandoma raises his hand
Gideon
Miss Marais
Will she not be coming
Not anymore
115
This causes a flurry among the women
writes on the blackboard the word "see
" See
He says the word in Zulu
see
You see
We see
He moves his hands, eliciting response

You see
We see
holds up a book with a picture of a boy
Boy
Boy
see the boy

holds up another picture
Girl
see the girl
see the girl
There is a  on the door
Everyone freezes
, it's me
Morrie pulls the bolt, opening and shutting the door quickly
and Maria look at each other
wanted to say goodbye to my students
(beat) and to you
116
The four women in the class speak in unison
We see the girl
Maria smiles, surprised
The moment is shortlived as a  from behind the pews in the rear of the room turns everyone
In the shadows, risen from behind the piles of furniture against the two opposite walls, stand 20 policemen with long menacing riot sticks
Bretyn steps into the light
Mandoma gives a command and the Africans form a phalanx around the women
Once warned
Twice punished
You're violating the sanctity of the church
No
You are with your damned race mixing ideas, rooinek
155                                                 155 by the door, slowly slipping the bolt lock, trying to remain innocuous while doing so
sees him and trades a look with Mandoma, who also sees what Morrie is doing
At least let the women go
You want everything to be equal, little Boetie
Why not men and women too
Just then Morrie throws the bolt
Now
He goes to charge out the door, but to his chagrin the door does not open, locked from the outside
117
Bretyn smiles cruelly
Locks keep people out but they also keep them in
He has walked right up to Morrie, not taking his eyes off Morrie's for a moment
Morrie meets his gaze evenly
The moment is broken as Bretyn's baton slams into Morrie's stomach, dropping him to this knees
Get up, you bloody commie Jew
He bangs Morrie hard in the jaw, knocking him out cold
Captain
The two police lines start to move towards each other, sandwiching the Africans,  and Maria
Mandoma gives an order
The blacks pick up anything they can to face the inevitable--stools, chairs, a flagpole
No
Wait
We'll leave
Too late
You never should have come
At the ready
The two police lines tense to charge forward
The blacks brace to defend
No
Stop
Now
The police charge from both ends of the room, yelling, clubs held high
The Africans respond with their own war cry and engage the club-swinging police
policeman swings at  who ducks and buries a hook into the man's ribs followed by another to his jaw
The man goes down
156   '                                                   156 118
Morrie has risen to take a policeman out with a stool over his head
Two other police beat Morrie from behind
He goes down once again under their brutal clubs
157                                                  157 turns just as another club comes for his head
He slips past the blow and punches out his assailant with a lightning combination
As the man falls another cop charges from behind
turns off-balance
Maria leaps
The club cuts through the air
Maria is caught flush on the forehead as she comes between  and the club
She falls to the floor dead
swings a stool with all his might, breaking the cop's face open
Maria
drops to the fallen girl's side
He is frantic at the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of her open blank eyes
The battle raging around him recedes before his pain and rising rage
All at once he explodes, screaming like a madman
He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another into the startled man
Bretyn's face is broken over and over against 's fists
Still  keeps pounding blow after blow into the fallen man
Three cops descend on  and beat him mercilessly until he drops to the floor, unconscious
Mandoma is hit hard and goes down
The few Africans left fighting go down before the withering assault of clubs, fists, and boots
158
-                                        158 Maria's funeral
Hundreds of Afrikaaners are gathered
Daniel Marais and his wife stand by the open grave, grieving, as the minister reads the final prayers
119
The coffin is lowered
Daniel Marais steps forward and shovels the first dirt down after it
As Marais looks up he sees  standing behind the mourners, 20 yards off
His anger replaces grief
Marais advances towards , clutching the shovel as a weapon
Several  restrain him
Daniel
No
Marais glares at
All of a sudden a thousand African voices cut through the air,  songs of mourning

159 Thousands of Africans and a smattering of whites have gathered outside the cemetery
The singing rises from them
Gideon, Morrie, St
John and Solly stand in front of the crowd

Morrie enters
He picks one up off the desk and looks at it
120
(surprised) You're applying to South African universities
In case the scholarship doesn't come through
Why are you so bloody stubborn
You don't belong in a South African university any more than belong in the priesthood
Will you take my father's loan
takes the applications back just as a comes to the door
There a Mr
here
It's your scholarship
Morrie grabs the telegram
Sign here
Odd name --
What's your name
Waldo
You're not one to talk about names
Morrie scribbles his signature and proceeds to open the telegram
snatches it away from him
He pulls the telegram out
His face falls to worry
What's it say
Doc's missing

Since his pneumonia last year 've had one of the men drop by once a week to see if he needed anything
Of course you know the professor
He never did

At the beginning of the week he wasn't home so  decided to drop by myself
Waited a whole day here
When he didn't come back sent search parties
After three days  sent the telegram
Seven days is a long time for him to be gone
Do you have any ideas where he went
looks at the pegs where the rucksacks hang
There is only one hanging

His eyes spot something
He kneels over the remains of a small campsite
touches the ashes
His eyes rise to the escarpment soaring above the jungle floor

He drops down into the entrance to the crystal cave
: 165

He resolutely climbs the stalagmites to reach the top
's eye level shifts from below the slab to even with it, then to above it
As his sight rises Doc's corpse comes   -- 122
laid out, serene hands clasped on his chest
From above the stalactites drip onto his body ever so slowly, turning him, molecule by molecule, into crystal
stands off to one side

Inside is a letter unfolds it, and with trembling hands reads: (
) So Mr
Schmartypants
It did not take you so long to figure out what happened
hope you forgive me for not saying goodbye, but  did not think it would be necessary between us
What could say you don't already know
() (
) (') That  love you with all my heart
That you have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes could fill
That the last thoughts  have before becoming something else will be of music, cactus, and you
You know all this
turns the sheet to page two which is a whole side of music
(
) Last night this music came into my head
It is my music for Africa
My music for you
So go
Be welterweight champion of the world
Be a writer

Remember -- the only thing between a dream and a reality is you
Until we meet again, your friend, Doc

Solly Goldman's being deported
Of course last time didn't have the luxury of being able to pack
For what reason
Their reason is that 'm here illegal
didn't enter the country with a passport
Like the Czar was issuing passports to Russian Jews in 1910
This is because of me, isn't it
No, boychick
This is because of them
They are the problem, not you

He opens the door to Daniel Marais, sitting at his desk, reading from his fiction-filled notebook
You're a very good writer
The subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting
What are you doing here
came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund
Neither will you be admitted to any of the South African universities
Here are your applications back

Screw the scholarship
Come on
Let's leave
If  leave or if  stay in South Africa it's because  choose to, not because they choose for me

He picks up his notebook and packs that too

exits the management shack and walks through the crowd
(
) Dear Morrie
Here is how it works
127
The copper of the mines in Northern Rhodesia is mined below ground
All day a behemoth of a man, a diamond driller, works a stope which is like the top of a funnel
: 178
178 huge diamond driller at work drilling and blasting in the stope
(
) Setting charges and drilling the rock
The only way for the raw ore he takes from the sides of the stope to get to the haulage below is to pass through the spout of a funnel and out the steel doors at the bottom -- sixty feet down
: 179                                     179 opening, as the haulage cart fills with ore and moves away on the track in the tunnel below
(
) Halfway down the spout area is a set of six tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large to make it through the funnel mouth to safe haulage
180                                                   180 six bars with men working them
(
) These are taken care of by a grizzly, an explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing, and since when the ore doesn't flow, neither does the money, working the grizzly is a very crucial and therefore very well-paid position
Three months' 128
work earns a year's    stay at Oxford
Yesterday,     on receiving my blasting license    from the School of Mines,     signed on to work the bars for a    year
: 181
'                                             181 crude place where the bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there -- to drink hard and long
, a harsh, ruddy-faced Welshman, the School of Mines instructor, downs a drink, pours another and looks up at
Are you crazy
To sign on for a year
You said  was the best you ever taught, sir
And you are, boyo
The absolute best
(') But even the best doesn't survive a year on the bars
Down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later
You may be a genius at reading the rock but you ain't no fuckin' fortune teller
Thomas throws back another drink
You worked grizzly a year
And let me show you what  have to show for it to this day
He holds up his hand
It shakes noticeably
And that's thirteen years after the fact, boyo
129
from the doorway turns Thomas's attention
He looks over as four huge men enter, drillers, men whose faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock they work
One of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as an enormous jolt of pain runs through it
He shakes it off and follows his friends to a table
Thomas looks concerned
Something wrong
(unconvincing) Nothing
The  comes over and puts another shot in front of Thomas
One double brandy
One
(derisive) lemon soda
He puts the lemon soda in front of
Come on, then
Thomas lifts his glass
On being the best damned blaster ever taught by Ian Thomas
Cheers
Thomas and  clink glasses
Thomas knocks his shot back
Another
The bartender pours another
Sure you don't want one
don't like the taste
Taste
You don't drink for the taste
130
He holds out his hand
It is steady now
He fixes with a portentous stare
Thomas looks over at the table of drillers
The man with the headache is downing one shot after another
Hell's comin'
He draws 's attention to the drillers
Drillers
He's got a powder pain from breathin' too much of that damn gelignite
The pain's bad enough
Mixed with a little alcohol it's fuckin' lethal
He watches the driller down two more shots of liquor
Come on
We ain't got much time
Thomas directs  towards the door
The two most dangerous things you'll ever see in your life, boyo: a hangup of rock that won't blast free on first shot and a driller with a powder headache drinkin'
As they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a roar
He grabs his head and staggers backwards; a mad look comes into his eyes
His three huge frineds rush to grab him
He throws them off as if they were ants
He rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete floor and flings it across the room
The men drinking in the bar, all tough cases, begin to flee
Thomas grabs  whose eyes stare in amazement as the behemoth struggles against his three massive friends and pulls him out of the bar

) Dear Morrie
To answer your question: yes--sports are played here, but only in the loosest sense of the words "sport" and "play"
The rules are different for everything, in games as well as in the rest of our lives
The managers, the foremen, the company people
They live apart from the miners
They have families
Proper gardens
Sunday dinners
The miners--the crud, as we are called -- don't
This is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind
Future does not apply
It is a society only in the loosest sense of the word
The laws of survival are simple-- you either do or you don't

The chase takes  and his pursuers flying through the streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after another
People watch, disinterested
No one raises a hand to help
comes racing around the corner to three of the men 132
blocking the street in front of him
He whirls
The others catch up behind, yelling and hooting
The two lines advance
gets ready
When the first man is close enough he hits him hard, breaking his jaw
He swings at another, catching him flush in the face
But then the rest are upon him
Even though  fights like hell, he is overwhelmed
The blows come from everywhere, beating him to the ground
His arms and legs are firmly grabbed by four men
He is banged hard face down onto a concrete table
The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth begins to undo his own fly
All the men scream obsceni- ties, anticipating the rape
struggles like hell to no avail
As he is about to be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the pack like a bear shredding dogs
He scatters the men, knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight
He stands over , a looming block of granite with a wild black beard and coal-black eyes
His intent only becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or helping a friend when he offers  his hand, lifting effortlessly
He examines 's bruised face with some concern and then smiles
You know, Rasputin,  had them right where  wanted them
Another minute they were done for
Rasputin claps  on the back and addresses him in Russian, to which  responds with a smile
The two men walk off together

When he finishes the    bottle he takes another one out of a case sitting by his   side and begins to drink anew
(
) Friendships are rare--arising out of mutual need rather than 133
any shared interests
But they do exist and even flourish
Except between the drillers and their grizzlies
No one wants to get too close to the man who might be buried at night by what you drilled loose in the day

-                                           185 inspects his nightly quota of gelignite charges and fuses
Five Africans, all serious faces, keep their eyes firmly on
(
) The Africans who come here looking for work are driven by a different desperation--drought, famine, locusts
Satisfied with the equipment,  nods for the box to be closed
, his head man, closes the boxes
(
) They come and risk their    lives to send money back home to    the families sitting on the    barren farms, starving, waiting    for death or rain
When the boxes are closed the other five men in the crew lift them and follow  out
: 186
186 The elevator descends into the mine
(
) Superstition runs deep in them, so a good grizzly man attracts a good crew
On the bars, the longer you live the luckier you are
And by association -- they are

: 187
187 and his crew make their way through a narrow tunnel and come to the grizzly
It is dark
The only light comes from the lamps attached to their helmets
Boulders litter the bars
and Elijah are onto the bars first
Their light beams move along across the boulders
Baas
Baas
turns to Elijah
His lamp catches Elijah's face which is looking upward
looks up
His  in the narrow bands of light: a bunch of rocks big and small, packed into the funnel
His face grows dim
: 188                                       188 Five feet across a rock wall with stones of all sizes blocking up the funnel's mouth
(
) Hangups are the worst of it
When the top of the funnel gets blocked up and the ore won't flow
scales the sheer rock wall of the funnel, his shirt packed with explosives
(
) The only way to unblock it is to set a charge to blow inward
And the only way to do that is to set the charge in mud, which means climbing up to the mouth of the stope and coming face-to-face with the devil
reaches the hangup
He works at taking a prepared parcel of gelignite sticks and jamming them carefully into a crevice
As he does the hangup creaks deeply, shifting, ominous
few rocks fall
freezes, holding his breath

Elijah remains on the grizzly bars, his light shining on : 190                                                            190 holding very still, listening
(
) Sometimes the rock doesn't need the provocation of explosives
Sometimes the earth shifts
(beat) a pebble moves
(beat) you talk too loud
(beat) and in the moment before you are turned into something else by fifty tons of rock you understand why it is called grizzly
finishes setting the charge
He scales down the wall
large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes bouncing down the sides to the funnel, just missing , crashing through the bars below
freezes
Elijah holds his breath
The crew in the safty tunnel quakes
Nothing happens
comes down the rest of the way
He takes the cordtex rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse
He nods to Elijah
Elijah lights a cheesa stick
He hands the glowing stick to
waves towards the tunnel
One of the Africans sounds the
Two blasts followed by two blasts
nods for Elijah to be off
Elijah stands his ground
wait for you, baas
lights the fuse
Elijah takes off like a scared rabbit for the safety of the shaft
is right on his tail
The fuse travels quickly toward the bomb
136
Elijah trips
, coming behind him, grabs him by the collar and flings him into the safety tunnel, diving after him a second later, just as the few rocks come down, but nothing else
The Africans look at each other with real apprehension
rises from Elijah and peeks out

studies the hangup, stepping out onto the grizzly, listening, looking
The hangup groans
The Africans are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel
stops midway on the bars
He studies the hangup intently, then picks up a rock
Choosing a target he heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup and runs like hell
The rock hits the hangup springs off the grizzly, right into the Africans as the hangup thunders down
Dust and small rocks fill the safety tunnel
When the avalanche has stopped  raises himself off the Africans
They are all covered in dust but smiling and babbling, happy to be alive
peeks out and up
He signals to Elijah who hits the -
Three blasts
Let's clean her off and call it a night, hey
Happy, the Africans lift shovels and crowbars to clear the bars
As they pass  they touch him reverentially as one would an icon
(
) The Africans think the longer you survive the luckier you are
And the luckier you are the longer you survive
know there's something inherently wrong with their logic
Still, 'm beginning to see their point
Especially with less than six months to go
: 137
192
'  -                                    192 and Rasputin play a game of chess as plays in the background
There is a  on the
Come in
, the bookmaker, enters
Ay, man
If you'd let him win once in a while we could take a little book on it here
He doesn't care if he wins
He just likes to play
And you
like to win
Which    is why 'm about visiting you
You've come on the board, man
There are odds on your making    it or not
How are they
(low) Not in your favor, my boy
Why are you telling me this, Jocko
When you come up on the boards, boyo, it's time to bow out
It's an omen
bow out you can't make book
, it's not a bet  want to collect
138
Tell me, Jocko, how high will the odds go on something like this
The shorter your time, the higher they go
With you probably ten, twelve, thirteen to one when you're short a month
When the odds hit the top put me in against all bets for two hundred quid
did not come here to solicit your bet
know that
appreciate it
But if you don't take it, someone else will
All  right
You're a bleery fool
And  'll be prayin' every night it's  the only bet  ever have to pay  off on
And so will
Jocko rises to exit
You should let him win once in a while
When he wins it won't be because let him
Rasputin says something in Russian as he moves a piece, excited to have taken one of 's pieces
turns and checkmates him
Checkmate
Rasputin laughs, speaks in Russian, and starts to set the board up again
Jocko exits
139
: 193
193 The elevator descends into the shaft
and his crew exit
There is a low sound of a blast, muffled, that stops them all
Did you hear a blast whistle
No, baas
Then after a moment the vague sound of a drill leaps through the rock
never heard a drill at night
The Africans get nervous
They chatter to one another
It's not a ghost
It's just some driller trying to squeeze extra pay
Come on
moves forward
The Africans follow him out of the elevator with reluctance
: 194
194 steps out onto the bars with Elijah and examines the debris
(whispered) Baas
There is a tremor of fear in his voice
follows Elijah's face upwards to a hangup
Not the first bloody thing
Bad sign, baas
Bad drilling's more like it
Come on
Let's get it going
140
Elijah goes back to fix the charge while  studies the hangup
He hears the Africans talking in the dark
When his light points on them they stop, turning their heads away
Elijah comes back with the bomb
(whispered) What's the matter with them
They say juju
Bad magic is in the mine tonight
heeds the warning, somberly
He takes the bomb from Elijah and starts to climb the wall
with  as he makes it up to the hangup
He quickly seals the bomb and drops the cordtex

He is growing more nervous by the moment as he fastens the fuse
: 196                                                          196 making it down the side of the tunnel
The hangup shifts
freezes
: 197                                                 197 peeking out of the safety tunnel, scared

making it back onto the bars
He carefully makes his way to Elijah as the hangup sends some pebbles down
She's playing with us tonight
Fuse set
Elijah nods
holds his hand out for the cheesa stick
Elijah lights the flare
He goes to hand it to notices Elijah's hands shaking
He sees the fear in Elijah's eyes
Go on
stay with you, baas
That's an order
Elijah, released from his responsibility, retreats quickly
stands holding the flare, a little distracted by Elijah's fear, wondering
Elijah sounds the

comes from the other side of the hangup deep in the stope
freezes, confused, and then a goes off
The hangups starts to give
And lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars toward the tunnel
The hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives before 's bomb ignites
The rock is crashing down
races the rock
The tunnel is within sight
The men yell for him to jump
is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up, and catches him in the stomach
He  loses his balance and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down
hits the wall of the lower funnel -- once, twice -- and then lands in the soft stuff -- the shale flake, cushioning the steel doors below

rock ledge carelessly left when the funnel was originally built
rolls under it
moment later fifty tons of ore in large chunks and small chunks and dust comes crashing down, burying
He lays there, semiconscious, buried but alive
: 201
201 The falling rock has stopped
The   funnel is full
The bars as well
Elijah and the crew   look out of the safety tunnel tremulously
Elijah   looks up the stope
His light catches a man at the very  top of the stope climbing out
Elijah pulls the
Five blasts over and over

204 Rasputin is timbering with his crew, fitting huge timbers into place, making new haulage, when he hears the whistles
He yells at his crew to grab the tools and he runs off down the tunnel

'                                        205 deep hole has been dug through    the rock piled in the lower funnel
Rock comes up in     a bucket and is carted off
Timber is passed down
crowd of miners, black and white, watch and help where    they can
#1 He's dead
No doubt about it
#2 You give me a fair odds on ten quid
#1 Four to one
#2 Make it a sixer and you got me
#1 You're on
#2 Anyone else
Six to one he's dead
: 206
206 Rasputin works like a man possessed, piling rocks in the bucket to be passed up, shoring timbers as they are passed down
: 207
207 Elijah is pointing up the stope to two Mine Managers as dozens more mill around, hauling the rock out, trying to help
observe Elijah and the managers
#3 He says someone was up there
Blasted it out on  from the other side
#4 Who's the driller
#3 Botha
144
#4 No one drills Botha's stope but Botha, and he only works days
The miners look at each other knowingly and return to work

He hears movement above, faint but perceptible
(strangled) Help
Help
: 210
210 Rasputin sends another bucket up
He stands, his chest heaving
He hears something
He drops his ear to the floor
He hears the
(
) Help
He starts tearing away at the rock, doubling his effort
: 211                                                               211 almost unconscious, hearing Rasputin's voice
He breaks into the smallest of smiles and passes out

Pk sits in the hospital bed, battered but otherwise in good shape
Rasputin sits in a wheelchair by his bed- side, his hands and chest bandaged, pondering the chess- board between them
Jocko enters
Well, look at ya now, boyo
Up and at 'em in no time
And rich as a fuckin' lord
He tosses a fat wad of cash on 's bed
What's this
Your ticket to ride
Two hundred quid at fourteen to one
But  didn't make it
'm a month short
Not according to managment
They cashed you out at twelve months for eleven worked
Last thirty days was bonus
And until someone shows me a calendar reads different, twelve months and a year are one and the same kind of thing
And the bet was for a year
So get yourself mended and get your ass out of here
There's someone  have to see first
Jocko grows uncomfortable
What do you want to go pressin' it for
You're rich, lad
You're whole
Why do you want to go pressin' it
Because  want to know
Know what
That the man has 146
blasted so much gelignite he's permanently deranged in the attic
That even the other drillers leave the bar when the man drinks, so crazed does he get
All right
He tried to kill you
But he didn't
You're alive is all that matters
Do us all a favor, boyo
Get out of here
Get on a train and don't come back
We've no liking to be burying someone we're all so fond of
No worries
The luckier you are, the longer you last
The longer you last, the luckier you are
Rasputin moves a chesspiece and bellows
Checkmate
Checkmate
He is ecstatic, bubbling with his joy
Laughter springs from him
Jocko and  trade a look
There's an end to everything, boyo
Even luck
Jocko exits
: 213
-                                       213 walks to the seamy metal gate dressed, healed
Rasputin, his hands still bandaged, walks alongside of him
Rasputin is concerned
Well  guess this is goodbye, my friend
'll never forget you
Rasputin speaks urgently in Russian
Botha
Nyet, nyet
Nyet, Botha
does not respond
147
Take care, my friend
He grasps Rasputin's bandaged hand to shake it
Rasputin takes him around in a huge bear hug, smothering him
Pk survives, a bit rumpled
He smiles at Rasputin and exits
As he walks away, Botha
Nyet
Nyet
turns the corner and is gone

214 walks through the huts of the drillers, massive to a man
Most of them are coming off shift
Some of them rub their temples, trying to soothe the pain of the powder
comes to one hut
He knocks
No answer
He knocks again
comes by
Who you lookin' for
Botha
The driller from stope number five
He's at the bar
Thanks
wouldn't disturb him
There's a reason he's there and we're here
The Driller enters his hut
absorbs the warning
: 215
'                                                215 The three  stand outside along with a dozen other customers
#1 You're not going to go in, 148
ja
Is Botha the driller in there
#2 Ja
Always we give him one hour alone before we open
You don't know this because you work at night, but it is the rule
Ja
In one hour it is pffft
He motions a man falling on his face
regards them for a moment and then enters the bar
: 216
216 In the murky light one hulking figure sits at the bar, drinking shot after shot of whiskey
enters and walks across the room to the massive man
Are you Botha
Botha does not turn around
Ja
'm
worked your grizzly
Ja
Why'd you try to kill me
Botha turns slowly to reveal his face, swollen with anger and drink
He tears the short sleeve off his left arm, revealing a crudely tattooed swastika
Because  missed the first time, rooinek
Jaapie Botha
149
Botha rises drunkenly
backs up
You remember, rooinek
Botha
It was thirteen years ago
Because    of you they expelled me
Because    of you my father beat me
Threw me    out from the farm
Because    of you
He throws back another drink and rushes  with a roar
sidesteps and heads for the door
Botha gets there first and bolts it
Botha
We've made a lot of money working together
Let the past be the past
You ruined the country, all you rooineks
You come and ruin the country
He rushes  again
Again  sidesteps
No, Jaapie Botha
It's hate ruining the country
Jaah
He swings at
ducks
Boer hate
Our country
At that moment the powder headache strikes
Botha bellows, grabbing his head staggering backward
runs for the door
As he reaches it a table slams against it, thrown halfway across the room by a powder-mad Botha
150
jumps out of the way at the last minute
Men's faces begin to appear at the iron-meshed windows
People start to bang at the door
, realizing there is no talking to Botha now, does his best to stay out of the charging giant's way
Botha charges him
sidesteps and hits him with a left hook
The punch has no effect
Botha swings out wildly
easily dances away
Botha picks up another table and heaves it at
jumps to avoid it, but trips on an overturned stool
He goes down
The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout
People start to make bets
Botha charges  as  scrambles up
Botha swings
The blow glances off 's shoulder and sends him flying, spinning over a table
Botha leaps at , driving him into the wall
grimaces, sagging
Botha picks him up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive arms
, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's ears with his palms
Botha screams as the powder head- ache accelerates through the top of his skull
He drops
rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's midsection
Botha is driven back
goes to swing the stool again
Botha catches it as if it were made of balsa
He rips it out of 's hand and flings it back at him, charging behind it
goes topping end over end
Botha gets a hand on him and lifts him from behind
He flings  over the bar
hits the floor, stunned
Botha pulls at the bar trying to get at
He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as  is trying to regain his bearings
Finally, with one tremendous rip, the bar comes away from its bolting
Botha pulls it aside
rises just as Botha moves in
hits him three solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels them
He grabs  and starts to squeeze him again
Face to face, Botha's crazed eyes watch the life fade from 's
217                                                          217 's eyes going blank

He dives into the water again
: 221                                                     221 The crowd yells and screams as Botha squeezes harder
Odds are called out
Blood starts to trickle from 's mouth
#1 (
) He's dead
He's dead
: 222                                                              222 as he swims to the last stone
He reaches it and struggles on top
He stands on the stone, trimphant
: 223                                                           223 squeezing again, bellowing
opens his eyes, draws his   head back, and butts Botha in the face
Botha's    nose shatters
The grip slackens a bit
hits him    in the face again
Botha drops  to the floor as he   screams at the unbelievable pain
Blood pours from his    nose
224                                                              224 catches his breath and is on Botha
He throws three hard punches to his face
Enraged, Botha howls and swings at
goes underneath his arm and hooks three times into the ribs
Botha grunts, hurt
He swings again with the other hand
152
: 225
-  -                  225 First with the head, then with the heart
Little defeat big when little is smart
: 226                                                              226 pounds into Botha's ribs under another wild swinging punch by the giant
Botha shouts and keeps advancing, swinging
backs up, peppering him, leading him forward
Left-right
He punishes Botha for each punch the big man throws, but always backing up
Botha, half blind, spitting blood follows
The crowd screams for him to move side to side
The betting changes fast and furious
glances over his  shoulder to the cement wall behind him
He takes two   more steps and then fires two jabs at Botha's face and  then stands stock still
Wild with anger, Botha throws  a huge right hand to 's head
: 227                                                            227 coming down on Maria's head

Botha's hand    smashes into the cement wall
His hand shatters into    a hundred pieces
The pain is so immense he is rendered    helpless
doesn't waste a second
He starts banging    away at Botha with hard, fast combinations
Want to see the wages of hate
Botha feels the punches
He steps back, faltering
pursues him
Here
Here is what hate gets you
hammers away, punching with each word, harder and faster
153
For my chicken
For Geel Piet
For Doc
For Mandoma
For Maria
Botha is out on his feet
For Africa
unleashes a final pjnch -- the hardest one he ever threw
It catches Botha square in the jaw
Botha goes over onto his back like a tree falling
The crowd outside screams and yells with delight
Money changes hands
collects himself and steps over Botha
He unbolts the door and steps outside
: 229
229 The crowd goes silent as  emerges
The crowd parts
, looking neither right nor left, begins to walk away
(
) knew as  walked out of the mines, out of Africa, that wasn't fleeing
That one day would return
Inkosi Inkosikasi was right
was a man for all Africa
Bound to her by my spirit
Bound by my dreams
And Africa had taught me the lesson  would take out into the world and one day bring back
Great changes can come from the power of many
But only when the many join together and create what is invincible
The Power of One
