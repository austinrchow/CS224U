Written by Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber Based on the graphic novel by Greg Rucka December 22, 2006 : Antarctica
Six million square miles of ice
The coldest place on earth
Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts
The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in check
There is no regular law enforcement
single
Marshal is assigned to the territory
- Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland
No buildings, no animals
nothing
: The hills are more defined
Rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses
fine `mist' of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice
: We track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice
on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then
, hooded and goggled in  (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out -- --    into camera -- locked in death
It's a man
Camera slowly starts to   to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes
We   further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood
And further and further
until all is dazzling white
: : () 2
: The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby
--  on '  digging up soft, white sand
The shadow of a palm tree cascading over top
Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an ring on the left middle finger, are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic calves
Deep
Soothing
Then -- on a door
The hands stop
Another
The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt halt
(
) (slightly annoyed) Yeah
Widen to meet  , late 20's
Cargo pants -- rolled up, and an exercise top
She's kicking back, but she's not at the beach
In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in
Two   stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage
fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body
She's pulled the earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world
The door opens
Leaning into the room is (20's), African-American
She's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans
Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion
Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology
Said it's urgent
Alright -- Jamie leaves
As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office
Half-packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor

: (2) hangs crookedly before a desk
Each day has been marked off with a large unmarked
Last space reads: -, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach
dart board is next to it with   pulverized with dart holes over the Bullseye
It's of a candy- striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags - the South Pole
Carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with (30's)
Looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him
: -  - An ugly sprawl of prefab buildings, power-lines and above ground sewage pipes
It looks more like a Siberian work camp than Antarctica's largest research base and logistics hub
In the background, smoke rises from Mt
Erebus
:      () : 2137   : -22 An icy wind , but the base swarms with - shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for winter
We      her as she strides down the icy, unmade street
Her hood is pulled up and she's not enjoying the cold
She reaches a row of buildings and checks the names -   #2
- until she reaches   #7 and pushes through the double doors into
#7 - are covered with   - , and
They are being nurtured and studied by  who look like homeless people - unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin
Carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket
Approaches one of the scientists with familiarity, who is in the process of  an -  from a stainless steel cylinder
() 4
: () Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe -- discover we're Alien life forms
Workin' on it
Which one's Sapperstein
Deschampsia Antarctica
He indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall grass samples across the room
, young, thin and bearded, is studying them
Okay, thanks
She crosses to him -- (cont'd) Sapperstein
He looks at her -- Yeah
Wanted to see me
His face tenses -- this is serious
-- Follow me
He leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a containing only  and a few One of the   has been smashed
(cont'd) They took it all
All what
Cannabis Sativa
She looks at him -- () 5
: (2) (cont'd) My weed, man
've been growing it all summer and they took it
() It was just budding, too
He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy- eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato chips, candy bars, and drinking beer
Stifling laughter
(cont'd) () It's not funny
Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh
Professor Sapperstein, 'd like you to read something for me
She pulls out a small   chained around her neck
Opens it up
Puts it in front of his face
(cont'd) What's this say
He's not sure what she's getting at -- (cont'd) 'mon, go ahead, read it
Carrie Stetko
Keep reading
United States Marshal
She closes the fold, lets it drop around her neck
Very good
() Now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic
He actually ponders the question for a moment
Carrie puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away from the others
() 6
: (3) (cont'd) Professor
are you planning on doing the winter-over
Not this year, no
Good
And how are you feeling right now
You think 'm crazy
Is that what you're saying
() No, no, not crazy
But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we
How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home
She pats him on the back
'  -  - Carrie enters
Walks by a mirror
Takes a glance
Is about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection -- what's the point
We notice a slight scar on her right temple
She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick  labelled,` '
She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading ": None
: None
" On today's page she fills in the blanks with "Theft of botany sample
" And "None
" pencil falls down onto the desk before her
Bounces
Then rolls off
She doesn't even flinch, or look up
Just stares unhappily at the binder
Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles
She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform
She and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday cake in front of her
Carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm
() 7
: As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a nearby box -- (
) You busy
She turns to see  , base commander, the guy on the
There's an awkward beat
What do you think
() know you weren't in the area
What's up
He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to it
got a pilot at  who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice
What flavor
Don't know
And we were doing so well
() Where
McClain Valley
This throws her
McClain Valley
What was he doing out there
That's no man's land
He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems amused
've got a plane heading to  in an hour with some supplies for Winter-over
() Can't get you back until tomorrow
He looks at her with a smile -- () 8
: (2) (cont'd) You leaving the dart board
No -- just the picture
: -  () -  - The red and white striped ceremonial south "pole" stands surrounded by international flags
: South Pole / Amundsen-Scott Station () opulation: 183                Temperature: - 55 Ice as far as the eye can see
In the background is the base
It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular shaped walkways
Off in the distance --   mounted with a plow, pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a It's been busy --    flank both sides of the runway
Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she deplanes a -130
-  rises up on the other side of the plane
The main  complex is before her
Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 -
Piles of packed equipment are everywhere
Half a dozen   wearing only boots and face masks blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around the South Pole, right past her, and back into
Carrie heads in -- Bottom of the frickin' planet
: 9
-  - Music cranks
Carrie knows her way
People come and go as she strides along a corridor decorated with and signs that read: `' ' -- comes to an office door with a small plaque on it that reads:
Pushes it open
'  -  - Carrie enters
It's smaller than her McMurdo office with a   that has a viewing window in the door fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer and lamp on top
map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub- station positions marked in block letters
window gives view to the South Pole
- Carrie opens the door
Single bed
Tiny dresser
No frills
She tosses her gear bag onto the bed
Closes the door
-  - Carrie pokes her head in
An examination table, cabinets with drugs and first aid equipment
couple of hospital beds
Moving boxes are packed up
Doc
Another door in the back of the room is open, but the light is off
Carrie turns to leave and -- -  - -- almost bumps right into one of the runners from outside, Aussie   (late 20's) coming down the corridor
He's naked, except for a towel wrapped around his waste
Sports a goatee
Couple tats
Flashes a cocky smile
Well, hello Marshal
() 10
: Keller
She leaves
He falls into stride with her
(cont'd) You seen Doc
Out back
What are you doing here
Checking the freezer for a popsicle
No shit
It got called in this morning
Who spotted it
Delfy, one of the pilots here
Keller half smiles
It's his first year down here
You know how that goes
My bet it was just debris, an old tent or something
Yeah -- probably
Here's an idea -- why don't you stay here with me and we'll party, just the two of us
Put those cuffs of yours to work
Were you the second guy from the front
Yeah
Not interested
() 11
: (2) They come to the end of the hall
Keller stops
Carrie goes right
- large room by base standards
Several windows giant map of  dominates one wall with the International stations and research outposts flagged with pins that have their countries flags on them
grid of of each  and  is next to it Tech is changing a few
Another  sits as a console, lined with comm equipment and computers
Others hustle about
Talking into a headset is the Station Manager, (30's)
Silky white skin
Irish
Long red hair tied back
Perfunctory
'll have them boomerang back and pick up the load -- just have it ready
The Tech at the console turns to her -- Guys got the science lab all shut down
Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins
Make sure we're not leaving anything out there
Rhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway
There's a flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional demeanor
(') Sam told me you'd be coming up -- how's the sleigh ride
Fine
need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle
'll have him meet you in the hangar
() 12
: moment of silence lingers as neither have anything else to say
Yeah, good
Carrie leaves
- Selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is  , 60
Looks seasoned
Bearded
Wears the only non-red parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from years of Antarctic service
In less than three days we begin Winter-over
The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months
Camera pulls back to  five  (first-timers); an Asian, French, Brazilian, Danish and an American
All are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably in the wind
(cont'd) The sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice
Extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land
You have chosen, for your own misguided reasons, to stay
And it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die
Doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts
The ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind- driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks
(cont'd) Time
The Asian holds a stopwatch
He stares at it stupidly
Three minutes
() 13
: Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees
You are shivering uncontrollably -- losing basic motor skills
You're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks
In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds
() Put your coats on
The class struggles into their jackets
Doc assists those who, in their diminished capacity, are having trouble figuring out how to put them on
(cont'd) Your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather
So be aware
There is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout
Don't get caught in it
Winds kick up snow that's lain on the ice for thousands of years -- can't see six inches in front of your nose
Temperature plummets to triple digits
We found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth
Carrie walks up
Doc's eyes brighten
(cont'd) Class, here we have another of the many hazards found on Antarctica
Say hello to Marshal Stetko
Through a disjointed, chattering chorus -- Hello Marshal Stetko
Always a pleasure to see you
Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here
() Social visit
wish -- We got a job
need you to take a ride with me
() () 14
: (2) (cont'd) () Might be a body out on the ice
Why's this crap always happen at the end of the season
Carrie pulls a Driver from Doc's golf bag
Lines up another pink ball
(cont'd) Too cold for driving
Carrie swings --
The ball shatters and pink bits rain down around them
So it is
-  - Carrie and Doc cross the interior, which houses Three double prop Twin Otters, two Snowcats, and six snowmobiles
Keller and two other employees are busy working on one of the Otters
What's your gut say about this body
My gut and  don't talk anymore
They continue, after a beat -- (cont'd) saw your boxes packed up
What was all that  last month about, "'m never going back -- 'll die here
Scatter my ashes over the pole"
He takes a beat -- People change, Carrie
Not you
Beat
() 15
: got a card from my Granddaughter inviting me to her fifth birthday party
You know, 've never even met her
Or mentioned her
grandchild
Doc, that's great
It got me thinking --  need to be a better Grandfather, than  was a father
It's time  deal with my life
've been down here a lot longer than  probably should have
They arrive at one of the Otters
, a baby-faced, African American pilot leans out the plane's door
You Delfy
Yes, ma'am
Where the hell they get these thumb-suckers
Delfy smiles graciously
Brooklyn
And unless your wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane,  think we'll be all right
Delfy disappears back into the plane
Doc looks to Carrie
--  want Keller
He's my pilot
() Keller, get over here
Delfy's taking us, Doc
He's the one who saw the body
'mon, you'll be fine
'll even hold your hand if you want
() 16
: (2) She ushers him in
: -  - The plane soars through a cloudless sky, the sun sparkling brilliantly on the endless ice sheet below
Carrie's in the copilot's seat, wrapped up tight in her , just trying to stay warm
Delfy's at the controls
Doc's in the back
What were you doing out there
went to evac a camp
Had to fly off route to get around a storm
Got down low to avoid some turbulence, and there it was
Carrie notices a picture of a young boy, around seven, wearing a Yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel
It's framed in popsicle sticks with written around the perimeter
That your son
He lights up
Yeah, name's Nathan
He's cute
Has your eyes
Lucky he got his momma's brain
Kid's smart
So why aren't you with him
The bonus pay
Trying to buy a house
Give my boy a yard
His own room
Stuff  never had
He looks at Carrie, all bundled up
() 17
: (cont'd) Don't like the cold, huh
Hate it
Then why are you down here
Carrie's eyes drift out the window -- We all make stupid mistakes
Delfy tips the nose of the plane down
The ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses
It's right up here
He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor
Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways -- Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction
(cont'd) don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight
() There it is
He banks the plane and slips down into a valley
(cont'd) Three o'clock
Yeah
Got it
It's a popsicle alright
Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to the crevice
(cont'd) Red jacket
He's American
- The Twin Otter is in the distant background
Carrie, Doc and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small crevasses
Mid-conversation
() 18
: It's always different when they freeze
Some curl up
Some stretch out
Some tear their clothes off
They get delirious
What was that guy's name
Linger
Yeah
He's lost in a storm
We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet
Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots
Delfy stops
Grimaces
Drops the gear bag
Jesus
The  is just ahead -- a frozen display of death
They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood
Delfy looks nauseous
Never seen a dead guy
Delfy slowly shakes his head, no
Carrie moves up to it
Takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away
Can't see the bottom
She walks around to get a look at the face
Blanches slightly
(cont'd) You know him -- So do you
Think his name's Weiss
We Wintered-over last year with him
Played cards a couple of times
The guy who cheated
Yeah
Geologist,  think
Doc takes a look
() 19
: (2) Damn -- Carrie pulls out a   from a pocket
Shoots a couple of pics
Doc takes a look up behind them
The ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders of ice
(cont'd) Looks like he fell from up there
Carrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem as convinced
Then where's his crampons -- his gear
Doc looks around -- she's right
Maybe down the crevasse
Yeah, maybe -- Carrie glances to Delfy
(cont'd) What's the closest camp
Brits -- about eighty miles west
(looking at body - Soto) What the hell where you doing all the way out here
Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't budge -- frozen solid into the ice
Ah Christ -- he's a sticker
Carrie unzips the gear bag
Digs out ice two axes
20
pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse
Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm
You going to be alright
No -- this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life
They all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground
Gonna give myself a Goddamn hernia
They keep pulling and --
The arm Doc is holding at the elbow
Lands on his ass
Delfy turns away and pukes
Oh yeah -- 'm really going to miss this place
: - is peering down at them from the top of an ice cliff
Widen to see   wearing a white camouflage parka
Lowers the binoculars
Goggles shield his eyes
He moves on
: -  - party is in progress
People are mingling, some have drinks, others dance
The  of the music dies, replaced by a repetitive emanating through the silence
People stop what they're doing, and focus on where the noise is coming from, which is -- () 21
: -- Doc and Carrie ushering a pushcart with Weiss' contorted, frozen body through the middle of the party
His dismembered arm rests across his chest
The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay glued to the horrific state of Weiss' body
Just as they pass , Rhonda steps out with the Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see what's going on
Her eyes immediately go to Weiss, then shift to meet Carrie's
Before she can say anything -- Who manages the Post Stations
Dinkle
Howard Dinkle
Doc and Carrie keep moving
Everyone else just keeps silent and watching
Squeaky wheel fades
-  - (
) One - two - three
Carrie and Doc set Weiss' body onto the examination table
(cont'd) How long to thaw him out
Carrie, let's just bag him and put him on a plane to McMurdo
She moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot water from a tap
It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet
Because maybe no one thinks he is
How'd he get out there
There were no tracks
Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again
() 22
: Carrie returns with the water
Goes to pour it on the zipper, but Doc gently puts his hand on hers, stopping her
(cont'd) Let's ask ourselves if we really need to do this
They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but -- Nobody wants to get out of here more than  do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has
She slides her hand away from his -- starts pouring the water on the zipper
: ' Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally, The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced skin
Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but can't
Grab that side
She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull
The jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding through the shirt
Doc's face sags
Carrie stares at the wound
: '  : The well defined chest of a man wearing a tight -shirt
dead center
Doc looks at Carrie with deep concern -- he's tuned in
Stirring up a few things
() 23
: 'll be alright
Both take a moment looking at the body
You know, this means a Federal Investigation, and we're witnesses
We may get stuck here
know
Doc looks to Carrie, gentle, like a dad would his daughter
We both want to do the right thing Carrie -- but we also need to get off the ice
Right now we don't have to say a word
When they find something later -- hey, we didn't know
We were leaving, the body was frozen, we didn't have time to examine it
No one gets murdered in Antarctica
Think about it
Dead is dead
He eyes her pleadingly
Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and  can't just pretend it didn't happen
() 'm sorry
Why did  know you were going to say that
- Carrie steps out into the hallway
Takes a moment, leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her more than she's revealed
She tilts her head back
The second it hits the wall -- : 24
-  ('  ) Carrie's beat to shit, soul weary
She's on her knees, full of blood
man is on the floor between two beds before her
She holds her gun at her side
He's dead
Carrie refocuses
Pulls away from the wall
Leaves the memory behind
: -  - Carrie has a  phone/walkie to her ear, making her way up the corridor
Moves past a couple of guys loading a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room
(
) What camp was he with
'm on my way to find out
(
) This is all  need right now
'm sure his family's thinking the same thing
(
) That's not what  meant
() 'll contact the  -- see how they want to handle this
She hangs up
Approaches a closed door
Name plate on it reads Dinkle -- -
and  -- great sex
Carrie rolls her eyes
Knocks on the door
No one answers
Moaning continues
She doesn't have time for this
Opens the door to see -- -- a large  playing a locker-room porno where a quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader with no top
Half a dozen guys, oblivious to Carrie standing there,  the action
() 25
: hate interrupting educational programming, but -- The  dies as everyone turns to see Carrie standing behind them
Only fake   remains
(cont'd) need to talk to Dinkle
Everyone gets up, thrilled for an excuse to leave
One of them nods to Carrie on the way out
Marshal
Chaplain
Carrie flips a nearby wall switch
Lights kick on
Small room
English flag
There's a Beckham poster and an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one wall
large map of Antarctica on another
proud assortment of tea bags are uniformly lined up along a shelf
One guy remains
Thirties
English
Bearded
On the heavy side
Am  in some kind of trouble
As he crosses to her, he flips the 8x10 framed photo back around -- it's of
'  - drops into frame onto a desktop, which is a map of Antarctica, under glass
File reads: Widen
Carrie opens it
Three photos are stapled inside
One is of Weiss, the other two have names written under them --  and Mooney is a runty looking guy with a mop of blond hair
Rubin is a skinny, thin faced young guy with a beard that hasn't filled in yet
What are they doing out there
() 26
: Collecting meteorites
() One One has an extremely old surface with low sediment deposition
English, please
Means it's a good place to look for meteorites
() It's right here
Dinkle points to a location on the map
Delta One One is labeled
Boasts an American Flag
don't get it -- Weiss was no where near Delta One One
She looks at Dinkle
(cont'd) When are they scheduled for evac
One sec -- He refers to a    hanging off the corner of his desk
Gets uneasy -- can't find what he's looking for
Finally -- (cont'd) They haven't arranged a pickup yet
Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over
He hates to say it, but -- Yes, it is
Really unusual, actually
() guess  should've contacted them, but -- () 27
: (2) -- You've been a little busy
Yeah,  can see that
She moves over to a     tucked up against a wall
(cont'd) What's their frequency
Seventeen
Carrie spins a dial to 17
Keys the microphone, drawing it to her face
(into microphone) Delta One One, this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over
Static crackles
(cont'd) Delta One One,  repeat, this is United States Marshal Stetko, come in, over
The dull constant static never wavers
She puts down the mic
Thinks for a moment
Suddenly, Carrie's   -- takes it off her belt
(cont'd) Stetko
(
) Marshal, it's Jamie
've got some guy holding from Vostok who won't give his name, says he has to talk to you
Vostok
() Patch it through
(
) You're on now
() 28
: (3) This is Marshal Stetko, who's this
(
) John Mooney
She's thrown
Mooney
(
) You know who  am
Carrie's eyes shift to his picture on the desk
What happened out there, Mooney
(
) You come to Vostok and we'll talk
Only you
Where's Rubin
(
) Come to Vostok
- Carrie is moving at a quick pace
Passes the open door to the clinic
Sees Doc looking through some boxes, a glass of Scotch in hand
She stops
Backs up
Getting drunk already
Just gearing my liver up in case have to stay the next six months
Murphy's contacting the Feds
He looks over to her
Raises his glass in a somber toast
You're making my day
() 29
: 'll do everything  can to get you off this ice, promise
know you will
() What's the hurry
Going to Vostok
He raises a curious brow -- (cont'd) One of the guys from Weiss' team called
Wants to talk
What's he doing in Russia
- Carrie walks in
Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another in her hand
Looks stressed
She's hovering over one of the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler
His focus is on a    that is heading toward , which is marked in
Other stations are marked as well
We're tracking it now
need a plane to Vostok
Rhonda raises her finger -- putting her on hold
Carrie doesn't like it
(into phone) don't control the weather -- you want to stay the winter, then don't be ready for your evac
She looks to Carrie -- (cont'd) Sorry, can't
All the planes are committed
() 30
: 'm not asking
What am  supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half
Tell them  took their plane
Carrie spins
Leaves
: -  - Squat Soviet-ugly buildings, some collapsing, others with boarded up windows, are barely visible through the driving ice
of different colors interconnect all the buildings
Carrie and Delfy, wearing full  gear, lean hard into the wind, making their way towards the compound
She's carrying a duffle bag
Can barely see the Twin Otter behind them
: Vostok Station (Russian Federation) Population: 46                Temperature: -73 -  - Carrie leads the way up a decrepit, dimly-lit hall strung with exposed pipes and wiring
Gaunt, malnourished faces look up from the rooms they pass
All stare
Silently
Looks more like death row
() What's with this place
The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore
They have to barter with other bases for supplies
Some of these guys have been rotting here for years
31
-   - Carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it out of the 70's: ancient computers and steel-cased radios fill one wall
One man welds equipment off to the side
Four more Russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking Vodka
They all take their time looking her over
Who's in charge
, a big bear of a man in his forties, gets up from the table
Huge arms
Scruffy face
Bloodshot eyes
(heavy accent) Who's asking
Stetko,  Marshal
'm here to talk to an American named Mooney
Yuri smiles
So many people come through Vostok
Is hard to remember
figured
Carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it
Yuri pulls it open
It's packed with steaks
The Russians react with smiles and the mood lightens
Yuri's grin widens further
Takes out a porno -- there's a Cheerleader on the cover
Mister Mooney, yes
remember now
He offers pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport
We give him very good price - because plane leaves a week ago
The Russians laugh
Where is he
() 32
: Red storm line
-   - Carrie is suiting up in her  gear, rope harness and crampons
Her jacket's open
Delfy has a steaming cup of coffee in his hand
He looks to her gear belt; cuffs, pepper spray, baton
You don't carry a gun
Against the law -- Antarctica's the only place in the world you can't have one
Part of the Treaty
Doesn't that make you feel kind of naked
All this crap on --  prefer naked
She zips up her jacket
He glances to a temp readout by the door
Gettin' worse
Minus eighty-one
Wind at a hundred and ten knots
He takes a sip from his hot coffee
Do you have to do that in front of me
He sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs to be fastened
Give you a hand
Sure
Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf
As he fastens it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask
They finish at the same time
() 33
: Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout
Nope
Thoughts
Yeah, hold on tight
Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel- lock in the center of the door
The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp, slamming open against the building
Wind knocks her back
The storm sings in an even
solid white wall of wind-driven ice blows past
The light is oddly dim
The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee
It rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor
Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot tether from her harnesses to a    attached to the side of the building
She steps into the storm
-   - Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking the wheel
Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is gone
Step after step, there's nothing but the guide line and the  of the storm
gust of wind lifts her off the ground
She's caught by her tether and smacked down on the ice
Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward
Finally Carrie runs into something
It takes her a moment to realize she's at a building
She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening the door
34
-   - Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the behind her
Pulls off her mask
Teeth are chattering
She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building
: -  - Carrie hits the lights: nothing
No power
Just a sliver of light stabbing in through a window
(calling out) Mooney
Hello
Only silence responds
The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in both directions
She draws a flashlight from her pocket
Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark
Something doesn't feel right
Slides her baton out from her belt
She decides to go left
Walking the hall, she tries door after door
Finally one gives
(cont'd) Mooney
She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an empty room
Moves on down the corridor -- hears , like someone trying to clear their throat
Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall
It's confirmed when she hears it again
Stops at the door
She slowly opens it -- Now she can hear ,   -- () 35
: -- Sweeps the inside with her light
It's a large lounge type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's coming from
Another cough
She enters the room
- Inching forward, she gets to the sofa
Looks over it to see   -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood
Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus
My God
She goes to him
As she kneels, he grabs her, for air, trying to tell her something
Carrie catches a    behind her in his eyes -- someone's coming at her
-- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as -- An   swings down at her
Just misses her head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the baton that goes clattering across the floor
The killer, wearing  gear with hood and goggles, takes another swing
She lunges to the side
Axe misses her, but sinks into Mooney
Game over for him
Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the baton, but can't see it
The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts around the sofa, heading back out the door
-  - Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run, retracing her steps
Her light zigzags
The killer emerges a few beats later on a run
It's going to be close
Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the Ready Room
Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's right behind
She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light getting smaller and smaller as she nears
() 36
: Gets there
Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all or nothing
She pulls open the door -- -   - -- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed
The killer    from the other side
She   the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock on the   behind her starts   at the same time
It's a race
' door slams open first and the wind hits her hard
She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind her bursts open
- Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm line and clipping in as she staggers forward
Glancing back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout
She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but moves erratically -- He's on
She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer materializing out of the whiteout right behind her
He's clipped into Carrie's line
He raises the axe
He swings
She jumps back, losing her footing
Hits the ice hard -- face first
The killer towers over her, raising the axe again
Carrie drives her heel into his knee, knocking him off balance
He drops next to her
He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off
She cries out as the   catches her face
The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking kick, flipping Carrie onto her back
from Carrie's world
There is nothing but her strained
The killer draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood
He swings
Carrie  her harness from the tether grabs her, and Carrie   -- the killer disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white
() 37
: Sliding across the ice, Carrie  into a pole
Grabs on
-  - Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no idea which way to go
Carrie glances up the post
Barely visible through the blowing ice are signs pointing different directions: "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles 15,641" She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the wind
Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her face
Falling, she gets up, and struggles on
Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat
rope catches her in the neck
It's another storm line
-   - Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm
Finally, she bumps into something
It moves
It turns to face her
'
He swings
She deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab the axe head
The killer tears the axe free, taking Carrie's glove with it
He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope, throwing him off balance
The axe cuts through the line
The killer hits the ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a pendulum
The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop
It takes everything she's got to get to her feet
She slowly struggles up the line
/
- More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands
Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around the wheel, she struggles to turn it
Finally it gives
() 38
: The door swings wide and she stumbles in
But she's caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal
Ripping it free, her  is lost to the wind
Carrie falls, collapsing against the door
Blackout 6 -  -  ('  ) single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror
She looks stressed
Her Marshal's badge dangles around her neck
Wears a shoulder harness
The bathroom door behind her is open
She catches a  of a shadow moving across the room behind her
Body tenses
As she turns -- Jack
No answer
She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the door
Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam --
Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam
Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror
It's brutal
Shards fall into the sink, as Carrie's   goes bloody
She drops to the floor -- '  -    stands over top of her
She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a frenzy, like a cat in water
(cont'd) Jack
Wo wo wo
It's okay, it's okay
The figure materializes around her
It's Delfy, holding her down
() 39
: Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again
: -  - She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets
An old, slowly lowers her wounded hand -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of water next to her
Her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights
runs across her arm
What happened
When   you didn't come back -- we went   looking for you
Found a dead   guy in the other building -- that   Mooney
Yeah
Someone got to him before did
Then went after me
() How long was  out
couple hours
Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her
(cont'd) He's been looking after you
He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth
Thanks
As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in Russian
She ignores him
He walks away, mumbling something else
She sits up
Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers are slow moving
(cont'd) need to get back in there
40
-  - Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights
She's starting to get her bearings back
Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke
They walk a few silent beats, then -- (cont'd) Who's Jack
It's a moment before she responds -- Let it go, Delfy
He lets it go
Same as before
Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa
Moves her light around -- searching
Passes over the blood on the floor
Until  met you,  hadn't seen any dead people
Now 'm at two
Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa
Low angles her light
Something reflects
Reaches in
Retrieves her baton -- -  - Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall
Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth - Shhhhh
She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but it hurts
She shifts it to the other
She turns off her light
Delphy does the same
Motions for him to stay put
() 41
: She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her back tight to the wall
Gets to the edge of the door
It's open just slightly -- looks in
Sees a man in an  jacket with his back to her, holding a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag with his other
Items are strewn
Another bag has been completely turned inside out
She enters
Baton cocked
Unless you want your head cracked, wouldn't move
His body tenses
Take it easy
-- Let me see your hands
He slowly raises them
(cont'd) Now turn around
He does
He's a guy in his 30's
Although he's clean shaven, there's a rugged edge about him
(cont'd) Who are you
Delfy comes up behind her
Robert Pryce
'm a United Nations observer for the Oceanic and Antarctic section
If you relax, 've got my
Let's see it -- slowly
As he reaches into his liner -- You must be Stetko -- This throws her
() 42
: (2) (cont'd) was heading to  to talk to you about Weiss when  was told you had come up here
He holds out his  for her
As she reads -- How do you know about Weiss
notified us
Your base commander called it in
Carrie lowers her baton
He stands
(cont'd) thought  might find answers in his gear, but there's nothing here but clothes
This is part of a crime scene
realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option
'll be sure to let the
know if  find out anything
She starts to walk away -- he follows, he's not done at all
Delfy brings up the rear
You heading out to Delta One One
Maybe
'll grab my bag
She stops
Don't take this personally, but don't need your help
() 43
: (3) If they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty
We think they were digging
That makes it my business
This stops her -- digging
You don't dig for meteorites
And you don't get killed for them either
This is now a
matter
am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if have to
He can, you know
She knows and her patience is running thin
Fine
But this is my investigation, understand
If you obstruct it in any way,  will have you detained
She continues with Pryce next to her
Fine
() Mind if  ask you a personal question
No, but  have the feeling you're going to anyway
Why do you smell like suntan lotion
: -  - Carrie and Delfy are heading toward the Ready Room
She has her phone to her ear
Two Russians trail behind with Mooney in a bodybag
() 44
: Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me
You have to shut down flights leaving  and McMurdo -- search for him
(
) That's not possible
We're still bringing people in and resupplying other bases for Winter-over
She thinks about it -- Sam,  think these guys found something out there at the camp
'm going to check it out
Until find Rubin, no one leaves the ice
Not yet
She clicks off
Carrie opens the door to the ready room to find Pryce standing there with a gear bag -- typing into a  (Treo type)
We ready
Guess so
He finishes entering his text into the
Sends
Puts it away
: - Delphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep, blue crevices
- Delfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp
There are and some scattered equipment - a , a of ,  of
The sky is dark with clouds and the wind
haze of wind-driven snow whips by
() 45
: Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents
Place looks deserted
What time is it
Pryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his jacket
Two thirty
or
Wonderful
(re: tent) 'll take this one
She moves toward tent one, Pryce the other
-    - Carrie peers in
It's too dark to see anything
She goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand -- stops herself
Reaches in with her right, extracts it from her pocket
Turns it on
-    - Her   plays over a litter of personal effects, then picks up a    leading to a cot between two others
Someone is huddled in a yellow sleeping bag on it
Her body tightens
Rubin
She steps into the tent
Moves to the cot
There's a pool of blood underneath
Her heart pounds
She uses her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag
It doesn't move
She pulls at it
and discovers      -- the   is soaked in blood
No corpse
She steadies her breathing
She pulls out a small baggie from her pocket
() 46
: Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen blood sample from the pant leg
Puts it in the baggie
Takes out her camera next
Starts snapping
Flash goes off
-    - Carrie enters with Delfy
Place is lit by a single dim bulb
This is a work space; two tables, instruments on top
Sample containers piled everywhere
Numerous photos of meteorites are stuck to a board
She finds Pryce reading the crew's
Anything
Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood
What do you got
Their daily work log
Delfy's drawn to a     ; it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower
circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box
Looks like my dad's old lawn mower
It's ground penetrating radar
Carrie moves over to a table with a The ice field is marked off into sections
Looks like they were surveying sections at a time
Areas labeled
Yeah -- He's flipping back and forth through the pages -- () 47
: At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one day
Carrie finds them on the map
(cont'd) 103 two days
Carrie finds it
(cont'd) 104 -- seven days
That was a month ago
They look at each other
Carrie finds it on the map as Pryce moves up next to her
Looks like they hit some really big meteors
How far
About four miles
Let's go see what they found
want to check something out first
-    - Carrie has Mooney's bodybag unzipped and is examining his left leg
No cuts
No blood
She thinks on this non- discovery for a moment, then zips it back up
: -  - The ' tracks  and  as it powers across the featureless ice - the loneliest place on earth
() 48
: Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving
Carrie is next to him with the map and her  in hand
She stares at a tiny blinking red light on the  -- : 6 -  -  ('  ) reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel
Several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance
Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations, watching as   Carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers
Her eyes are full of tears
She's put into the backseat of one of the cars
As the door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck
- Delfy's looking at Carrie like he's waiting for an answer
said "which way
" She glances to the
North
Pryce sees Carrie pause for a moment, massaging her gloved left hand
Hurt
Yeah, a little
He can see it aches more than she's letting on
How long have you been down here, Marshal
() 49
: Almost two years
What brought you to the ice
She pauses, humored
() The excitement, mostly
Everyone down here is running away from something
Some shrink tell you that
Yeah, and that  should call my mother more often And do you
Every Sunday
Where do you plant your boots
They got me working out of Christchurch, New Zealand
Beautiful country
But this -- crazy place to make a living
She takes a moment, gazing out the window to the endless landscape of white

met someone, decided to stay
He give you that ring  saw
Tell you he was going to marry you
No -- just gave me a headache
() () () 50
: (2) (cont'd) didn't see a ring on your finger
Flattered that you even looked
faint beeping noise emanates from her
This is it
All eyes go ahead as they drive on
Looking
Nothing but an icy plateau
After a couple of beats -- (cont'd) Stop
There's nothing here
Just stop
Delfy pulls to a stop
They exit the cat
- All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind
Carrie steps away from the Cat
Pryce does too
Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal
It's completely flat
Desert like
You sure this is right
Section 104
These are the coordinates
Maybe you wrote them down wrong
Carrie ignores him
Walks further away from the cat
Ice     as she keeps looking -- then, she stops
Something's not right
Looks
Kneels to the ice
Scoops some up
Checks it out
Perplexed
Pryce approaches from behind
This is shaved ice
() 51
: She gets to her feet
Walks further -- her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice
After a dozen steps, texture changes
Ice is now smooth -- like it's supposed to be
She turns around
Tries to get the bigger picture
Looks at the ground all around her
Realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick -- (cont'd) They were digging, Pryce
And they tries to spread the ice to hide it
She heads back across the area
Scans the horizon
Takes another step forward
In an instant, Carrie's gone
below the ice
Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced-over tarp
Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing
Pryce gets to the hole
Looks down
Carrie is precariously dangling in an   that slopes at a slight angle
She's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on
It slips off
Below her -- nothing but darkness
(cont'd) Grab me
Pryce lays flat
Reaches his hand down -- six inches too short
Delfy appears from behind
(to Delfy) Hold my legs
Delfy does
Pryce inches closer
'm slipping
Almost got you
'm losing my grip
() 52
: (2) He gets closer
Closer
Moves to within an inch from hers -- -- She
Falls away
Things become silent
Carrie
Can you hear me
Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss
() Marshal
(
) 'm okay
Saw a rope in the Cat
Delfy springs to his feet
- Darkness
flashlight clicks on
Reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up
Carrie gets to her feet
Sees that she's in a small dug out area
As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls on an   of some kind, maybe three feet high
Carrie shines the light to her feet
The ground beneath her is metal
- Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits
Delfy follows
Both take in the discovery
Carrie moves over to the hatch
Pulls on it
Opens easily
She and Pryce hit the interior with their lights
Find themselves staring into
- Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness
Place is tomb silent
() 53
: Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles -- victims of an intense
The plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious
Cargo plane, but  don't recognize it
It's an Antanov-74
Russian made - - late fifties
No one's put these in the air for forty years
Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit
Something  her leg
She spins
Shines her light - - which illuminates a , fingers in a clawed position - - as if in excruciating pain
She whips her light past the hand, up the arm -- captures the  of a man staring at her
It takes a moment to realize -- he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates
Delfy stands still
Staring
Carrie throws a look back over her shoulder -- Guess that makes three
She continues on with Delfy staying close
Her light targets the cockpit door
It's closed
- Carrie pushes the door open
The beam of her light reveals frozen blood across a   -- chunks of ice protruding through it
Continues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved
Each have a sidearm holstered around their waist
This isn't funny -- She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused
Where's Pryce
54
- Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing
Enter a cluttered cargo area
Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old  gear, and boxes of supplies
Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks
What is that
Delfy grins
Vodka
Carrie continues through the hold
Her flickers over more chaos of the crash -
Spots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead
Moves to it
() Find what you're looking for
Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a Incredibly strong
And inside it is a
Door is open
Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy
Just answers
() Those are fuel tanks behind you
This plane was outfitted for long range capabilities
And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important
Carrie moves in closer
Sees that the cage has been breached
() 55
: Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening
Discarded tools litter the floor
They put some serious work into this
There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood -- Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here
There's blood all over the tunnel
She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes where containers have been removed
Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide
The
(cont'd) What is that
The muffled  of a diesel
It's the Cat
-- the unmistakable sound of
Go
More
They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold
It's getting louder as they're getting closer to the source
Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the hatch as       covering it completely
Light fades
Sonofabitch
The continual sound of falling ice grows  and () 56
: (2) Carrie and Pryce both pull out their phones
No signal, you
Shakes his head no
(cont'd) Someone followed us
-    - Ice is flying
Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane
Efforts are big-- but the progress minimal
This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon
() We're going to suffocate before we get out here
How long do you figure we've got
Three of us down here -- 12, 15 hours at the most
Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped animal
No way
'm not going out like this
No way
The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade
Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going
Still fading
Light goes out -- -- Screen goes black
Can't see a thing
second later,     -- Pryce is holding it
Hands it over to Carrie -- () 57
: (cont'd) And when that one goes -- we're screwed
Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then -- What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice
Fire will burn the O2 quicker
What choice do we have
Pryce knows she's right
Delfy looks to them both
Desperate
Don't need my vote
Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light
Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her coat
Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate
Goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor
Stomps on it
It breaks
Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks
Pryce comes back with a couple bottles
Stops dead in his tracks
Carrie looks over to see him staring at two attached to the wall near the hatch
He's thinking
He moves to Carrie -- Hold these
He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight
He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the dark
What're you doing
() 58
: (2) All these planes used to have bail- out hatches
We came in through it
Pryce goes back into the cargo area
(
) Has to be more than one
It'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing
Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft
Found it
Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce
They follow his beam straight up to expose an   in the roof of the fuselage
(cont'd) With the angle of the plane, don't think we're that far from the surface
Give me a hand
Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over
They join, sliding it over below the hatch
He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area
(cont'd) These are explosive bolts
If we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice
Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us
We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death
Take your pick
Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight
She targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires
() 59
: (3) As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a of a   under his liner
(cont'd) This could work -- give me the battery from your phone
As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery
Hands over her phone
He extracts the
(cont'd) When  connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang
May want to take some cover
Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another
He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against the fuselage
(cont'd) You guys ready
Delfy nods
Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head
Pryce touches the last wire to the battery
Nothing happens
Hope freezes
Pryce tries again -- -- -
The hatch  , ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light
, , , until
, it buries itself edge-on, halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's width
They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a into the cargo bay like a gift from God
Hallelujah -- Pryce drops down
Moves to another crate
() 60
: (4) Delfy, help me with this
We'll need to get up higher
Delfy moves forward to help
The two of them push it over
It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other
Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing Carrie holding one of the '
Don't move
Pryce stares at her in disbelief
What's going on
Yeah -- what're you doing
Our friend here isn't who he says he is
She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster
Switches it with the one in her hand
Puts the Russian gun in her coat pocket
(cont'd) Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here
've been authorized because of what's happened
Stop lying to me -- She takes out her handcuffs
(cont'd) Delfy, cuff him to the wall
She holds out the cuffs
Don't do this
() 61
: (5) Man, the guy just saved our lives
He was saving his own
Do it
Delfy takes the cuffs from her
Cuffs Pryce to some exposed piping
Carrie lowers her gun
(cont'd) You know what was in that safe
() Now, who are you
She sees a moment of contemplation on Pryce's face -- (cont'd) swear 'll leave you here to die
Beat
Have you got an  for that too
Listen to me -- Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York
It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice
Damn,  knew that government eavesdropping was true
There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base -- a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties -- nothing was ever confirmed
() () 62
: (6) (cont'd) The fact is, before the treaty in `72 they were strip mining all over the place down here -- we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapon's use
It was the Cold War
No one knows half the things the Russian's were up to
This plane could be the link between rumor and truth
And if it is true, what's in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack
Why did you lie to me
Look, the
carries a lot of weight down here
Think about it - - if  had told you  was
, you would have been on the horn back to Washington in no time
This is a very sensitive matter
News travels fast down here, don't have to tell you that
() Besides,  didn't know if  could trust you
Carrie wrestles with her emotions
She looks back towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane floor
Makes a decision
: - Delfy wriggles out from the hole
He reaches back
Helps Carrie to the surface
Pryce follows
They look around
The weather has deteriorated - the sky is dark with fast moving clouds
The wind is
The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered
Delfy runs over, jumps onto the
Looks inside the cab
Keys are still in it
Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks in the distance
() 63
: Plane could've gone anywhere
There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over
Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem
Delfy starts up the Cat
Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his
She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the Cat
(cont'd) Rhonda
Walkie crackles
(
) () Where the hell are you
Heading back
How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours
(
) You expect me to -- () -- How many
(
) Fifteen
need a list of names
Carrie clicks off
You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo
He knows 'm on his ass, so he might
Anything's possible want to eliminate his options
She massages her gloved hand
Looks to Pryce who's talking on his  as he heads toward the Cat
() 64
: (2) ( ) Six cannisters, maybe four inches in diameter, about a foot high -- find out exactly what the Russians transported in something that size
He looks to Carrie -- (cont'd) You have a photo of Rubin anywhere
Back at  -- (to Delfy) How long to get there
When we get back to the plane, 'll get ya there in forty minutes
As Pryce climbs into the cat -- - And slides into the back -- (into phone) 'll scan a picture of him and get it to you
Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch
He's got some plan to get these off the ice
He hangs up
Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the plane's ski tracks
know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One
Pryce and Delfy wait for the answer
cont'd) He was dumped from a plane
() 65
: She closes the door to the Cat
: -  - Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce
They pass a window where we see that an -13O   is parked out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a massive beast
Move past several people, balloons and `Eve of Evac' signs
Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now
You need to get that looked at
'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done
Dinkle's pulling a   toward them
Sees Carrie and Pryce about to head up some stairs
Murphy's looking for you
Carrie stops
Murphy
What the hell is he doing Came in on the evac
She pulls Dinkle's two-way off his hip
Hands it to Pryce
(cont'd) Hey --  don't turn that in, have to pay for it
Carrie ignores him
'm on 30 if you need me
Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk
Dinkle shoots Pryce the stink eye as he walks away -- Make sure  get that back
() 66
: Of course
Pryce heads up as Carrie continues on down the main corridor
-  - Murphy and Rhonda are standing next to the  , who is sitting in front of his
The screen revealing the   of the storm It's grown and moving closer to
It's packing winds of a hundred thirty knots
Murphy looks stressed
Shit -- we've got to move up the evac
How much
Six hours at least
Jesus,  got crew that's still not in
Then get them in
Rhonda is thrown off by his tone -- (
) You wanted to see me
Murphy looks over
Sees Carrie coming in through the door
Where the hell have you been
She doesn't like his tone -- Buried under 2 tons of ice
You
() 67
: Do me a favor, you find any more bodies, mind not parading them down the main corridor
've got Newbies afraid to winterover, for Chirstsake
They want out on seats  don't have
And next time you want to take a Goddamn plane anywhere, you ask me
Sure thing, Chief
We don't have enough supplies for all of us to Winter-over if we get stuck down here
() And you wonder why it didn't work out between us
It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here
was stupid enough to be one of them
Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people
And 'm trying to stop it -- so fuck asking you for shit, Sam
This is ridic--- dropping onto the floor, sends a harsh reverb across the room
(
) Enough
Everyone's attention goes to Doc standing at the door
He's really pissed
Glares at Murphy
(cont'd) What the hell's wrong with you, Murph
've got bodies piling up in my lab, and she's the only one doing anything about it
() () 68
: (2) (cont'd) () Why don't you try helping her for a change
Murphy looks at Doc
Not giving in
Carrie calms down -- she's had enough
You know what Doc, it's alright
Carrie looks to Rhonda -- (cont'd) You got my list
Rhonda pulls it from her clipboard
Hands it to her
Carrie walks out with Doc
: -  - - watching Carrie and Doc from behind the crack of a door as they walk down the main corridor and right by
: -  - Carrie's sitting on the edge of an examination table as Doc slowly unwraps her bandaged hand
She winces from the pain
'm worried about you
Is it going to take another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down
She looks at him warmly -- You worry too much -- but it's what  like about you
Doc smiles, continues to unravel the gauze- (cont'd) Doc, did you notice if Weiss had a wound on his left leg
() 69
: striped him down to put him in a bodybag
There's only the puncture from the axe
No way, would have noticed it
Why
Then it's gotta be Rubin
() don't know
Any word from the
There's no way they're gonna make it
Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula
The gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle have turned   along with part of the flesh of her palm
Her ring looks strangely out of place
(cont'd) Oh God
Doc reaches over to a nearby drawer -- takes out a sterilized syringe packet
Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this go
He opens up the packet
When did  go to Vostok
Doc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh
Feel that
He pushes hard -- penetrates the skin
We see the worry begin to elevate further on Carrie's face
No
Doc tries the needle in another location
Now
() 70
: (2) Slowly shakes her head
He holds her gaze evenly
(cont'd) have to amputate your middle two fingers
() No way
Don't tell me that
The fingers are dead, Carrie
If don't do it now, gangrene will set in
You'll lose your hand
Carrie is sickened
(cont'd) 'm sorry
: - Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her
The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area where Doc works on her hand
She can't watch as his and thread, rises and falls with every stitch he makes
Carrie has her attention on piled up in a tray -- '  :     : The well defined chest of a man wearing a -shirt oozes dead center
This time we stay there a little longer, watching the -shirt absorb the blood around the wound
As the stain widens, so does the camera
slowly
bringing into picture   Carrie shot
He's wearing a '  around his neck
(
) There, finished
Carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down
Then slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand
(cont'd) It's going to be an adjustment
() 71
: He rises
Goes to a medicine cabinet
Selects a pill bottle
Shakes it
Only a couple inside
He returns with the pill bottle
(cont'd) Should ease the pain
'll look around, dig some more up for you
She stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to be
: '  -  - Carrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun next to it
She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a -shirt, but can't button it up with only one hand
Her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion that's trying to get out
She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed
Bag and gun go flying
Carrie slumps to the floor
Silent tears
After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway with some  in his hand
He's looking at her compassionately
stopped by the clinic
Doc told me
Carrie nods, pulling herself together, swallowing her emotion
Pretty tough Marshal, huh
He enters
Holds out her ring for her
(cont'd) (holds up hand with missing ring ) If you came to propose, now's not really a good time
He joins her
Hands over her ring
Takes a seat next to her
() 72
: (cont'd) Anything
Got Rubin's face all over Antarctica, but nobody's seen him yet
They sit in silence together for a moment
Carrie sees the Russian pistol that's ended up on the floor close by
Picks it up
Examines it like a relic
You ever kill anyone
Unfortunately
Anyone you ever trusted
No
Beat
hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years
() Wasn't supposed to need one down here
She looks at him -- (cont'd) You asked what  was running away from
came down here to forget my partner, Jack
Thought it would be better than any therapy
What happened
We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down
was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time
Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass
Anyway, guy's a no show
One hour went by, then two - - nothing
() () 73
: (2) (cont'd) Then Jack starting acting strange
Next thing  knew my face was being rammed into a mirror
My own partner was trying to kill me
Turns out the whole bust was a set up from the start
Jack was dirty, working with the guy we were after
Beat
(cont'd) Four years together
knew things about him that his wife didn't even know
() But he was my partner and  killed him that night
There's no changing that
Pryce takes it all in
Not the story he expected
(cont'd) Marshall service cleared me -- ruled it self-defense, but  had a real hard time getting over the betrayal -- how little my life meant to a guy  was willing to take a bullet for
Carrie shifts in her chair
Leans forward
(cont'd) Know what the kicker is -- Jack thought  was close to figuring him out
Thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me -- make it look like a bust gone bad
Truth is,  had no idea
() God,  was young and stupid, and in way over my head
She stands
Pryce joins her
(cont'd) You asked me why  smell like suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis, this cheap after-shave his wife gave him
Some of the guys down here wear it -- suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it
() 74
: (3) She notices the papers he's holding; faxed photos of (cont'd) What do ya got there
He shows them to her
One-by-one
It's what the Russians used to transport weapons grade materials in
They match the dimensions inside the safe
We're looking for six of these
As Carrie studies them -- (cont'd) Langley's thinking it might be Hexafluoride, which is a derivative of Uranium
It's a component for nuclear detonation
These beakers where really in over their heads
The  on Pryce's hip -- crackles
(
) Dinkle, it's Rhonda -- Pryce smirks
better get this back to him
And we have to find Rubin
Think you can you help me with these buttons, first
Sure
He moves closer
Starts to button her up
(cont'd) For what it's worth --  think you're pretty tough, Marshall
: 75
'  -  - Carrie enters
Light streaming in through the window hits her tired face
She reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall -- --     -- --   her away from the open door
It's kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's embrace
knife's brought to her neck
(raspy, deep) You Stetko
Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket
(cont'd) Don't
She stops
Who are you
He slowly turns her around to face him
-- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit
Deep cracks slice across his bloody, chapped lips
Peeling skin flakes on his face
Desperate, despondent eyes
Shaky, frostbitten fingers
He's having a hard time holding it together as he can barely get the words out
-- Did Mooney talk to you didn't hear from him -- he was supposed to call me after you talked
Carrie's confused
Mooney's dead
His eyes well
No
And so's Weiss
() 76
: He nods - he knew
And 'm next,  know it
It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down
His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a little easier
He sets it down on an empty book shelf next to him
(cont'd) Who's after you
Where are the cannisters
He stares off blankly -- Weiss didn't want to go through with it
Oh God
How did we let this happen
Rubin --  need you to focus for me
He tries
Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes -- he's trying
on her door
Rubin is spooked
Glares at her -- scared
Like a caged animal
(
) Carrie, it's Doc -- got those painkillers
It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you
It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife
She tries to stop him
Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair
She topples backwards
He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him
Takes the wind right out of him
Pills all over the floor
() 77
: (2) Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort
Carrie appears at the door
Catches a glimpse of Rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs
(cont'd) You alright
Doc nods
She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip
She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way
(cont'd) Pryce -- (
) Yeah
Rubin's here
He's on the run
Level one
White -shirt
Jeans
: - As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's three guys carrying boxes out of a room
Snaps a look to the right -- -- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway that leads into an   to another part of
(cont'd) (into walkie) He's heading for the Science Lab
Carrie kicks it into high -- : -    - - catches interval glimpses of Rubin through the small windows that run along the side of the tunnel as he dashes through
: 78
- Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as Carrie enters
It's lined with several free standing, empty bookcases
Rubin, wait
- Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway
Not a lot of light
Slows her pace
It's quiet
Dormant
Vacant lab stations
Room's been shut down for the winter
Eyes scan
Fall upon -- --
sign above reads: She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab stations to get to the door
Carrie gets to the door
Pulls on the handle
Won't open
Rattles
Looks in through a viewing window -- sees -- -- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing  gear off a rack mounted to the wall
: -60
He and Carrie exchange glances
Rubin --  can help you
He shakes his head
She tugs harder on the doors
Stuck
Looks through the window to see he's tied them together with some climbing rope
In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods half the room as the outside door is whipped open
in full  - stands in the doorway
He's wearing a   and
Holds an   poised, ready to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her
() 79
: Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and Carrie, but -- --
is buried into his shoulder, gaffing him like a fish
The pain's excruciating for Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man
into him, driving him back out the door
Both  down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder
-    - Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet
Takes off
Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria
Disappears around the contour of  before the other guy can get to his feet
His assailant rises
Goes back up a couple steps to retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so tight, it won't budge
Abandons it
- Carrie shoulders the door, but still doesn't budge
Hears
Turns to see it's Pryce
Door's jammed -- Pryce latches on to a heavy   filled with beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked against one of the lab stations
(cont'd) Pryce, it's not Rubin -- Off his confused look -- (cont'd) Someone's trying to kill him
Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door
Hits it like a freight train, busting it open
Cart goes crashing
Contents scatter like buckshot
- The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through the open exit door
() 80
: Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are vacant
Ice axe is still there
Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on
Carrie immediately closes the outside door
Pryce goes for the  wear
Scrambles to get a coat on
Carrie joins
Same thing
How long's he been out there
Thirty seconds
- Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins tucked against the base of the main building
The blood from his wound already frozen on his shirt
The cold -- it's killing him
Body's shaking
The sun's reflection off the ice is blinding
: '  - -- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are literally being burned by the intense light
He tries to shield them -- has little effect
He looks over his shoulder -- gets a   of his attacker not far behind
Rubin trips
Hands go to the icy ground to protect his fall
Still hits hard
Starts to get up, but his palms are frozen to the surface
Doesn't have time to care -- pulls hard, tearing the skin right off
Stands
Spins around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground
Continues to the end of the storage bins
Moves under , using the enormous    to conceal his movement
81
- Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope
He continues toward some storage containers and the   on the other side, where  ,    are finishing filling an insulated container with water from an insulated hose mounted to the Melter
snowmobile is parked next to them
He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice escapes
Help me
The guys -- oblivious
-  - Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in , exit the room and head down the stairs
Split up -- go opposite directions around the complex
- Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the container
Frostbite is chewing up his lungs
He's too slow, they take off
He coughs up blood
wa
wait
He turns around to check on his pursuer
Twenty feet away and closing
Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon -- anything
Sees the insulated hose on the
Heads for it
-   - Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow -- through their vertical slats, at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the main building
Sees the  guy closing in
82
-  - Pryce is moving under
Passes a hydraulic support leg
Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin
Also sees the  guy in pursuit
Heads toward them
-   - Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose
Grabs it, but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on
Throws a defeated glance over his shoulder to see -- --   in  gear right on him
Shoves Rubin against the tank
Grabs the hose from him
Turns it on - -  him head to toe
Rubin's clothes turn to ice
One eye freezes shut
Lips go cobalt blue
He tries to escape, but several stiff steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his ice-locked clothing
The man moves to Rubin
Grabs his head, and -  - breaks his neck
Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground
-  - Rhonda crosses the busy room
Reaches for a clipboard hanging next to the window
Something outside catches her attention
Sam
She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone
Murphy and the others join her at the window
They see Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view of the killer
: -   - The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and -- --
He's blindsided by a  to his head
Goggles shatter
() 83
: He drops
Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps the goggle from his face
It's
Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head
The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of him
Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine blade
Pryce approaches
Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck askew
Carrie is wound up
Keller's still recovering from the impact -- sh
sh
shoulda killed you at Vostok
Where are the cannisters
Go to hell
Wrong answer
Help me drag him over here
They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him back over to the Snow Melter
(cont'd) Keep him still
She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's neck
Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then whips off Keller's gloves
Tosses them aside
The cold makes him more coherent
Sees Pryce at this throat
Who's Tahir selling it to -- what's the intended target
Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her knife to  open his  jacket and pants, exposing bare arms and legs
() 84
: (2) What're you doing, you crazy bitch
Keller instantly starts to shake
Why did you kill those scientists, Keller
Was a four-way split too much for you
Fuck you
Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter
She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground as it freezes instantly
Where is the uranium
(almost smug) You have no idea what's going on here, do you
Keller begins to shiver violently
Hit the sonofabitch again
Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm
He screams
Pain is too much
He caves
The plane, they're in the fucking plane
Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind
It's Murphy
Furious
Two other guys at his side
Have you completely lost your mind
Let go of me
She twists free of his grasp
Gets in Keller's face
(cont'd) Where in the plane
() 85
: (3) Find them yourself
What the hell's going on
She glares at him
The cannisters are on the plane
She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy
(cont'd) Throw him in the holding cell
The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground
Carrie kicks it free
It's painful
Keller screams
The guys lift him to his feet
Haul him away
Murphy looks to Pryce -- Who the hell are you
Carrie looks at Pryce
Name's Pryce
Pryce looks at Carrie
He's with the
We have to search that plane now
Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare -- We don't have time
We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands
Pryce steps in -- It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch
Anything can happen in that time
Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground
() () 86
: (4) (cont'd) Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it
Just give us 10 minutes
Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly -- Sam, do what is right here
Come on
Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour
We'll need some help
'll send what  can
He leaves
: -130 - Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats
Pryce approaches
handful of  employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo
It's clean
Carrie gets to her feet
Pissed off
(cont'd) You check the cockpit
Nothing
That bastard
What the hell are you up to, Keller
don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way
He's stuck here
Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that -- He's buying time
Carrie races off the plane
Pryce tries to keep pace
87
- Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which is packed with  employees carrying their bags for the evac
Pryce is close behind
Out of the way
- '  - Carrie enters
Pryce at her side
Her face goes white
The door to the holding room is wide open
Keller's Shit
He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
Then it hits her -- He won't try
He's a goddamn pilot
As the two of them take off for the door -- -  - Delfy walks across the floor
Hangar is minimally lit
Still
Silent
Void of personnel
The Otters are lined up
The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side
He heads toward an Otter
-  - Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is still hanging on the console
Then, something catches his attention through the windshield of his plane
He sees a   running to another plane -- and it's pumping
Curious, he gets out of the Otter
Eyes dart about the hangar
Doesn't see anyone
Heads to the other plane
Discovers that a door is open on the other side
Takes a another look around
Doesn't see anyone
Moves closer
() 88
: Gets to the plane
Takes a look inside, and -- He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the head
Stumbles back
Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy
Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool chest
Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap
Unconscious
-     - Carrie and Pryce, dressed in  are making their way toward the hangar
-130 - Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into the plane
Get checked off a list by the
Toss their gear into a netted cargo area
Find a seat
Plane is nearly full
- Keller has the engine going
It's loud
Preps the console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar
Guns drawn
Shift their attention to the plane
Blades turning
They stalk forward
Slowly
Carefully
Eyeing for any betrayal of movement
Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in
Fast
Ready
Look into the plane
It's empty, except for a duffle bag in the back
Carrie nods to Pryce
Motions for him to go one way, she'll go another
Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat
It's door is slightly open
She heads for it
Gun poised
Pryce moves to check the next plane
Eyes dart to every dark corner
Carrie gets to the Cat
Springs toward the door
Inside's empty
() 89
: Pryce walks under   of the next plane
Spots Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest
Looks like he's stirring into consciousness
Then -- An   swings down from above, embedding in his Pryce's chest
Deep
It sticks
Gun goes flying
Keller drops down from the wing above
Pryce staggers
Keller kicks him hard
Pryce goes down
Keller grabs the gun
Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot -- Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover behind
Another rips into his shoulder
Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat
She fires continually, forcing him to stay behind cover
The shots go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right hand
Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots back, which -- -- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover beneath the plane
He's losing blood quick
Carrie keeps shooting
Bullets
They stop
Carrie has to reload
Keller makes his move
Fires at Carrie and sprints for his plane
Runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it
Slams it
The  immediately begins to  as winter is let inside
Keller keeps shooting
Runs out of bullets
Leaps into the idling Otter
Carrie makes her move
Dashes toward him, firing away
Bullets  in the , but can't penetrate -- glass is too thick -- protection from the cold
Keller throttles
Begins to move the Otter forward toward the opening doors
Carrie dashes to Pryce
Sees Delfy get to his feet
Face bloody
He moves to Pryce
() 90
: (2) She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over
He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce
He's bleeding profusely
She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest
Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open
didn't see him
His eyes flutter shut
Carrie slaps his face -- No
You stay awake
Puts her hand directly on the wound
Applies pressure
Blood continues to ooze
She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the hangar
Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding
(cont'd) Damn it
(to Delfy) Come on
We're getting him up
They lift him to his feet
Haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can
Go outside
- The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the ground
Carrie grabs Delfy's hands
Puts them directly on the bloody wound
Surprisingly, he stays focused
Press here
Hard
Hard or he will die
It won't stop
Looks Delfy right in the eye
He's not going to be number four
() 91
: Pryce moans
Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner
Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice
Starts packing it around him
Keeps repeating the motion
She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane moving toward the runway
The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake
() What are you doing
Get Keller
She holds him down
You're bleeding out
Freezing drops your pulse
We have to slow it down
() You hold on
Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick draw
Keys it
(cont'd) Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet
Beat
(
) No -- what's going -- Keller got out
He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad
Where's Doc
(
) In the clinic
About to bring the bodies out
What's -- Tell him to stay put, and  need your help getting Pryce there
We're at the hangar
've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters
Carrie doesn't wait for an answer
Gives Delfy the two- way
() 92
: (2) (cont'd) Don't let him die
Carrie stands
Determined
Sprints back into the hangar
- On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles
Coughs
Spits blood
Doesn't stop her
She jumps on one
Fires it up
Uses her left palm to steer -- blood starts to seep through the gauze
She quickly bundles up, then guns it
Rubber treads grip
Smoke rises
She races it across the cement floor and out the hangar
- Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the wind
Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to
Hits her light as she races in
- Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his guys as they head toward her
She doesn't even slow down as she blows right by them
: '  - Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto the runway
His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he gives it full throttle
Starts to pick up speed
Heads down his strip of freedom
: -   - funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before Carrie on the snowmobile
() 93
: She holds tight as she burns a big - around one of the berms and onto the runway
Heads straight for the lights of Keller's plane
' He sees Carrie
Crazy bitch
: She targets him like a Japanese zero
Hundred yards and closing
He's pushing to get airborne
Seventy-five yards between them
Gap narrows fast
Fifty yards
Stay on Carrie
Looks like suicide
She suddenly swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm -- He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get airborne -- until --      is Carrie's snowmobile
She bails, letting it continue right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she tumbles down the berm
Keller's pov - a   of snowmobile comes at him fast -- obliterates the cockpit
'  - Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways
wing catches the runway,  the entire plane into a cartwheel of disaster as it veers off the runway and -- --
Resume - Carrie slowly gets to her feet
The flames reflecting off her goggles
She heads to the wreckage
The cold and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly
() 94
: Carrie approaches
Only a sputtering of flame remains on the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit
The aft seems relatively intact
Carrie looks in
Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller
In the back -- the charred duffle bag
She moves closer
Reaches in through a broken window
Pulls it out to the runway
Unzips it
Is confused
No cannisters
Only survival gear
: - Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce in
Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the onto a cart
Doc
Doc quickly moves into the front room
The other two follow
Curious
Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves
Pryce's face, ashen
Get him on the table
They usher him onto one
He looks to Delfy who still has his hand on Pryce's wound
(cont'd) Don't move that hand
know,  know, he'll die
Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys -- You, four units -pos in the warmer
Second shelf, fridge
The guy heads for it
Carrie enters
She's still in her  gear
Heart sinks when she sees Pryce
() 95
: Doc leans over Pryce's pale form
Examines
As Doc gets an  going, he looks to Carrie -- (cont'd) What happened
Keller hit him with an ice axe
He get away
No
Murphy's walkie on his hip  to life
-130 - Rhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot, watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming at them like a tidal wave
Brings a walkie to her lips
Sam, it's Rhonda -- we gotta go
Now
(
) know
know
-  - Murphy looks to Doc
Can you do this on the plane
It's your call, but  need to know now
Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to Carrie -- she sees the answer's no
'll stay with you -- (to his guys) Grab the bodies and get them on the plane
() 96
: The guys head for the back -- As Doc looks at Pryce -- knowing he needs him
Leave the bodies -- you don't have time
Dead is dead
() Pick them up in six months
Go
Doc looks to Carrie, who's thankful -- 'm sorry
The guys after the bodies look to Murphy for a decision
Leave'm
Let's go
Murphy and Carrie exchange a quick look -- closure
Thanks
Take care of yourself
He takes off with the others
- 130 - The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men are just   about to board the plane
Murphy looks to the storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the second
He realizes they might not make it
-  - The -130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a skier
Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere in sight, until -- The -130 finally pushes out the front of it -- Takes off into the horizon, where we see that the sun is just about to set
: 97
-  - Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination table
He's been bandaged up
Eyes closed
Looks thrashed
An  drip hangs from a stand on wheels
She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been through a lot
He slowly opens his
Tries to smile, not easy
Hey -- Hey back
You get him
Um-hm
() The cannisters
She shakes her head -- Nope
They both think on it for a moment
What did we miss
Think Keller cut and run without the stuff
After all this, no way
Keller didn't have it on the plane because he's got it hidden somewhere
() Where would he hide something for six months
Somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look
If he had made it out, he wouldn't have been crazy enough to come back for it
() 98
: True -- what the hell was his plan
Pryce thinks hard -- he's got nothing
We've got six months to figure it out
in the back of the room draws their attention
It's Doc coming through with the cart -- a bodybag on top
Eyes open -- that's always a good sign
He continues pushing the gurney toward them -- Hey, Doc -- thanks
Thank her -- if she hadn't slowed your bleeding
Doc rolls the gurney behind her -- (cont'd) 'm going to hunt me down a bottle of scotch -- Carrie turns, looks at Doc as he wheels the gurney by
Need any help
'm good
She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' pressing against the bag
Although the plastic is clouded, she'd swear his   has a running down the side
(cont'd) You okay
His voice pulls her focus
She masks her startle
() 99
: (2) () Just thinking where it all began
Yeah, it's a damn shame, isn't it
Doc continues on out the door
Pryce sees that she's bothered -- What is it
Nothing -- 'll be right back
She heads out the door
: - Carrie slips in
We've been here before -- this is where she chased Rubin
Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining daylight   through the row of windows that run along the side
Carrie's plunged into inky black
She  the Science Lab door open before her -- peers through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her
Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay tight against the wall
Doc walks right by and out the door
She rises to her feet
Hurries down to the end
Disappears into the science building
- Carrie enters
Turns on the light
Illuminates the lab stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room
Heads for the freezer
-  -   - Carrie opens the door
Illuminates the interior with her light
() 100
: Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls
Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney, Rubin, Weiss and Keller
Carry goes to Weiss' body
Kneels next to him
Goes to unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a plastic cinch
Pulls out her knife
Holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch
Unzips the bag
Her light travels down his body to his left leg
She rolls it slightly for a better look
The truth hits her like a sledge hammer
There it is, like standing center stage in her light, the    holding a deep gash tight together
She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself
Thinks about that leg, those stitches
The fact that Doc lied to her
Pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor
Her light pans back, explores the rest of Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's run out from under his armpit
(to herself) Someplace no one would ever think to look
She raises Weiss' arm
More stitches
She cuts through them
Skin splits to reveal the that's been stuffed inside his chest
She reaches in and pulls it out
Even has rust on the bottom
Carrie's confused -- ' It look more like She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her hand on the top
Begins to twist
It loosens easily
Pulls the lid off
Looks at it
Whatever it is, it's frozen
Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a Can't quite figure it out, until she shines her light on it -- The freezer
The core sample is
She looks to the other two bodies
She opens Mooney's bag
Sees his chest is uneven -- more cylinders inside
Repeats the action with Rubin
Same thing
Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much
() 101
: (2) (
) If they had just gone along with it
She turns -- Doc is standing right
(cont'd) Those fools found a plane -- had no idea what they stumbled onto
Turns out the Russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties
And we thought it was nukes the whole time
Keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us
It was a hell of a lot of money
How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc
Weiss got hurt on the plane
They were afraid to move him, so Mooney called me
Keller and  flew out
But they couldn't get the safe open -- Keller found a way
Then Weiss got cold feet
It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One
Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc
Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing
() If those idiots hadn't panicked, none of this would have happened
He turns and walks out of the freezer
102
- Carrie carefully follows
Sees he's heading for ' in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted Pryce used to bust open the door
Doc -- stop
He does
Turns back to her
But there has been a subtle shift inside him -- something illogical
'll cut you in, Carrie
There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there
That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world
How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start
Well, this is it
Those beakers finding that plane was a sign
sign telling me it was time to go back
Now  have something to go back for
She has a realization
There is no granddaughter, is there
This was about greed, plain and simple
No one will ever know
It's just me and you
We can take care of Pryce
His callus disregard for human life rocks her
Dead is dead, right
Yes, yes, now you're getting it
What's happened to you
There are four people dead
Four
People we knew
Doc looks at her
She's not sure if it's registering
() 103
: (cont'd) Where you going to stuff my body too
Huh
Was  going to be five
He turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards it
She pulls the gun out from inside her liner, her mind a whirl of limited options and grim solutions
He nears the ice axe on the cart -- Carrie cocks back the trigger -- (cont'd) won't go through it again
Don't make me shoot you, please
Her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she wrestles with her emotions
It's either ignore all of this or kill me -- and you and , we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice
With that
he walks right past the   and into the She's confused
Doc, your not thinking straight
But he's not listening
Ya know, it's really warm
'm gonna take a walk -- try and cool off
The   on the wall reads: -82
He looks at her
Doc, please
Carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside door's latch
He musters a smile -- () 104
: (2) Remember, Carrie -- freedom's just a sunrise away
Using both hands on the latch, he pulls , filling the space between Carrie and Doc with violent winds and blowing snow
Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two steps out the door
Disappears into the blanket of white
Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who remains standing still like a statue
Emotionally drained
Numb
Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her cheeks
shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce
He's hunkered over in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the Ready Room
Latches onto the door
It takes everything he's got, but he manages to get it closed
Instant silence
Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket
Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed door
The effects of the chill and Doc's decision apparent
Pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders
Gently leads her away
: Super: '  - The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby as we -- on sand with a shadow of a palm tree casting over top of two pairs of feet -- intertwined
Slowly widen -- to see Carrie and Pryce, kicking back on lawn chairs, side-by-side
Two heat lamps pouring out bright, warm light
cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps -- throwing the shadow
Pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder
() 105
: Carrie lies back, rests, eyes closed
How's the weather where you are
Hot
But there's a gentle breeze
Fiji's beautiful this time of year
Yeah, St
Barts ain't bad either
They lie there quietly, relishing the moment
(cont'd) Six months
Six long months
Carrie turns over on her stomach -- lets the heat warm her back
Nah
Freedom's just a sunrise away
There's a new calender on the wall, where the days of Winter-over have been marked off -- long way to go
-  - Pull away from the building, which fades into the icy darkness and howling wind of the Antarctic winter
