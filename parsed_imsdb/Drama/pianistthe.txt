Street scene
People toing and froing man rattles by
: 1939 ,  ,  - plays Chopin's Nocturne in  sharp minor, Posthumous
He's twenty-eight years old, elegant and handsome
In the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen, an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast
Behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper taped on it as protection against blast
Without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and another
The whole building shudders alarmingly and the window in the booth shatters
The engineer and Szpilman exchange a look as a man enters the booth and talks urgently to the Engineer, then goes
The engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but Szpilman shakes his head, determined to play on
He plays, then glances at the booth
The engineer has gone, but through the shattered window he sees fires raging
Very near, a loud, terrifying explosion
The reverberations cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his face
And then a bomb explodes even closer
The glass screen separating booth from studio implodes, showering Szpilman with glass
He stops, frozen
,   - Pandemonium
Chaos
People rushing in all directions, many carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling
Some of the men in military uniform
The bombing continuous
Szpilman fights his way down the stairs
He has a small cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief
He has a dazed look
Halfway down the stairs,  young woman, , tugs at his sleeve: Mr
Szpilman
He turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved
His eyes light up
Hello
came specially to meet you today
love your playing, but what a day to choose
Who are you
My name's Dorota, 'm Jurek's sister
oh
You're bleeding
It's nothing
pushes in beside them and takes her arm
'mon, Dorota, you can write him a fan letter later, this isn't the best time, c'mon
Jurek, pulling Dorota, fights his way down the stairs
(calling) Jurek, why have you been hiding her
And he, too, is carried with the flow into the lobby
Debris everywhere
Szpilman fights to get to the main door, when another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, obscuring him and everyone else
- The Szpilman family in panic: coming and going out of rooms, packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings and boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters and candlesticks
The family consist of , in a state of great anxiety, , , twenty-six, , twenty-two, and , twenty-four, the only one not in movement
He sits by the radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station
No bombs now, just the distant sound of artillery fire
Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to Mother
What you think, should  take Uncle Szymon's photograph
Take it, don't take it, take what you like
Can't you see 'm worried sick
He'll come home, he'll be all right
He goes into his room
She can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and Szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity
Mama, Wladek's home
Mother dashes out of the kitchen
Thank God - Wladek
You're wounded
It's a little cut, nothing
've been worried sick
told her not to worry
You had your papers on you
If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd have known where to take you
The girls suppress smiles
Henryk, don't say things like that, God forbid, God forbid
(calling through a door) Papa, Wladek's home
Father appears in the doorway, beaming, clutching a violin case
What did  tell you
(looking around the room, bemused) What are you doing
What's it look like we're doing
The toing and froing continues non-stop
(to Henryk) They bombed us, we're off the air
Warsaw's not the only radio station
Pack, darling, get your things, pack
Where are we going
Out of Warsaw
Out of Warsaw
Where
You haven't heard
Heard what
Haven't you seen the paper
Where's the paper
She starts to look
The others continue to bustle and pack
used it for packing
(exasperated) She used it for packing
The government's moved to Lublin
All able-bodied men must leave the city, go across the river and set up a new line of defence, that's what it said
There's hardly anybody left in this building, only women, the men have gone
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence
Wander round lugging your suitcases
Pack, Wladek, there's no time
'm not going anywhere
Good
'm not going anywhere either
Don't be ridiculous, we've got to keep together
No, no, no, 'm staying put
If 'm going to die,  prefer to die at home
God forbid
Sssh
Crackles, whistles and static from the radio
Ssh
've got something, listen
They gather round
an important announcement
News has just been received through the  that Great Britain, having had no reply
(static) and therefore has declared war on Nazi Germany
(a collective gasp) next few hours
awaiting latest news
Henryk hits the set
but France is expected to make a similar announcement
(static) Poland is no longer alone
The Polish national anthem plays
All are still
- Father pours liqueur into glasses
The family are seated around the dining table, having just finished a meal
The table groans with the remains of the dinner
Szpilman has a plaster over his cut
(lighting up a cigarette) Mama, that was a great dinner
It certainly was
When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort
The glasses are handed round
Here's to Great Britain and France
They all clink glasses and drink
told you
Didn't  tell you
All will be well
- column of German Soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, march into view
On the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins, smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman and Henryk, and a little behind them, Father, craning to see
They watch, expressionless, as the Germans march past
- Regina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers
Halina is on a box, removing and replacing books
Mother sits at one end of the table, polishing a man's watch and chain
At the other end, Father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins
Henryk is deep in thought and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin
The apartment has less furniture now and the silver has gone
(finishing the counting) Five thousand and three
Is that all
Yes, five thousand and three zlotys, that's all we've got left
It's three thousand and three zlotys too much, (reading from newspaper) 'Re: Further restrictions regarding liquid assets: Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes
' What are we supposed to do with the rest
Deposit it in a bank
Blocked account
Banks
Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank
We could hide the money here in the window frame
No, no, no
'll tell you what we'll do
We'll use tried and tested methods
You know what we did in the last war
We made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there
And suppose they take the table away
What d'you mean, take the table away
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything
Do they
Idiot
What would they want with a table
All look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer is coming away at one end
table like this
He pokes his finger under the veneer
It snaps, revealing bare wood beneath
What on earth are you doing
There's a good place under the cupboard
No, no
Listen, 've been thinking -- That makes a change
You know what we do
We use psychology
We use what
We leave the money and the watch on the table
And we cover it like this
(covers it with the newspaper) In full view
The Germans will search high and low,  promise you, they'll never notice it
Of course they'll notice it
But look-- (lifts the violin fingerboard
) This is a good place for something
good place for what
(to the others') He's insane
Just shut up
(overlapping) My violin
They all talk at once
Quiet
Quiet
Order, please, order
She's a lawyer, she likes order
Listen, just listen
Let's come to an agreement
We jam the money in the window frame
The watch we hide under the cupboard
And the chain we put in the violin
brief silence
Will  still be able to play
Let's find out
They start to hide the things
- Szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone to answer his call
Then: Jurek
Wladek Szpilman
(filtered) Wladek
How are you
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you
(filtered) Fine, we're fine in the circumstances
But  can guess what you've called about
There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station-- (trying to interrupt) Yes,  know, but Jurek, Jurek
(filtered) not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles
But 'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended,  didn't call to discuss my future career
- Szpilman and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with bombed-out buildings and rubble
She flicks admiring, almost loving glances at him as they walk and talk
And he is smiling, touched by her
nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks
And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so  came and they bombed the station
You know something
Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful
Really
Yes
(he looks at her, smiles) It was
it was unforgettable
She's embarrassed
've always loved your playing, Mr
Szpilman
Wladek, please
No one plays Chopin like you
She begins to laugh
could accompany you, me on the piano, you on the cello
They become almost helpless, holding on to each other
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite
quite wonderful
Wladek, please
Amidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it
- The family are gathered around the table, listening to Father reading from the newspaper
The apartment has even less furniture now
The paintings are gone
(reading) 'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw District
hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw District will wear visible emblems when out of doors
This decree will come into force on the 1st December 1939 and applies to all Jews over twelve years of age
The emblem will be worn on the right sleeve and will represent a blue Star of David on a white background
The background must be sufficiently large for the Star to measure eight centimetres from point to point
The width of the arms of the Star (reading) must be one centimetre
Jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished
Governor of Warsaw District, Dr
Fischer
' Silence
Then: won't wear it
won't wear it
'm not going to be branded
(grabbing the newspaper) Let me see this
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves
Where will we get them
We're not going to get them
We're not going to wear them
Silence, each locked in their own thoughts
- Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts are a million miles away
He passes two
They stop
(a harsh shout) You
Father stops, turns fearfully and approaches the Germans
Why didn't you bow
(removing his hat) 'm sorry
German Officer cracks him hard across the face, catching his ear
Father reels, collects himself as best he can and starts to shuffle on - (calling after him) You are forbidden to walk on the pavement
Walk in the gutter
Father steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter
The German turn and go
Father walks on
- Szpilman composing at the piano
He plays, makes adjustments with a pencil to the manuscript, plays again
The flat is almost bare
Halina, enters with a newspaper
Have you seen this
(irritated) What, 'm working, what
She hands him the paper
He looks at it
His expression darkens
: the newspaper
map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller
' What is it
' That's where they're going to put us
' What d'you mean, put us
: She looks over his shoulder and reads
As she does so, the door of Henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused
'By order of the Governor of the Warsaw District, Dr
Fischer, concerning the establishment of the Jewish District in Warsaw
There will be created a Jewish District in which all Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside
"  And look here: 'Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the Jewish district by 31st of October 1940
' Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified
But
they won't get all of us
we'll
it's too small
there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw
No
Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy
He laughs but they're disturbed by a sound from another room, the sound of crying
They look at each other puzzled, then Halina opens a door and looks in
Szpilman and Henryk join her
: Father is asleep but Mother is sitting on the bed, holding a purse, crying
Halina sits beside her, puts an arm round her
Mama, what is it
Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note
Twenty zlotys
That's all we've got left
What can  buy with twenty zlotys
(breaking down) 'm sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes
She weeps
Halina tries to comfort her
Szpilman and Henryk watch
,   - Hands on the piano keyboard
Podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails
They play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight fingers
The hands belong to Mr Lipa, a dealer, early fifties
He sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer
Regina stands in the bow, watching him
Henryk is at the table, also watching intently
Szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to Mr Lipa
That's the price
That's what 'm offering
And my advice is to accept
You won't get more from anyone else
But
but it's a Steinway, Mr Lipa
Two thousand
My advice is to take it
What you going to do when you're hungry
Eat the piano
Henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him, a rough struggle takes place and during it Mother and Father appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled
Get out
You're a thieving bastard, we don't want your money, get out
We'd rather give it away
Get out
Regina tries physically to restrain him
(overlapping, warding off Henryk) Hey
Hey
What's the matter with you
Haven't you eaten today, what you suffering from
Hey
(overlapping) Henryk, stop it, leave him alone
(recovering, catching his breath, overlapping) You people are crazy
'm doing you a favour, two thousand, and 'm paying for the removal, 'm not even charging for the removal
Henryk subsides, glowering at him
You haven't eaten today, you're crazy
Suddenly: (turning to them, severe) Take it
- great column of Jews of all ages make their way towards the area that will become the ghetto
On foot, on bicycles, on horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings
great moving mass of humanity
They're watched on either side of the street by Poles
On a horse-drawn platform, the Szpilmans with their belongings
All wear armbands
Szpilman, Halina and Henryk walk beside the platform with Mother, Father and Regina seated on it
Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, close to tears
Dorota
didn't want to come,  didn't want to see all this, but  couldn't stop myself
How are you doing
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out
(stops, tears in her eyes
) This is disgraceful
Don't worry, it won't last long
That's what  said, it's so - it's too absurd
'll see you
soon
He smiles and runs to catch up with his family
He looks back, but Dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way
/
- Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen
The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence
Father pauses for a moment to take stock
To tell you the truth,  thought it would be worse
How will we sleep
'll sleep with the girls in the kitchen
You, Henrykc and Papa in here
(at a window) Look
Come and look
They all go to the window and look out
Their  - the street
Further along, men are building a wall across the street
- : ,  - Winter
Cold, freezing day
Slush underfoot
Great activity
People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover
Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing
Among the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books
He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by
Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk
Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other
They set off
As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food: You sell anything
Just one
Dostoevsky
The Idiot
Three zlotys
That's better than yesterday
Three lousy zlotys
And there are people here making millions
know
You don't know, believe me
They bribe the guards
The guards turn a blind eye
They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn
Suddenly, a  appears in front of them, barring their way
She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat
Excuse me, but have you by any chance seen my husband Izaak Szerman
'm afraid not
tall handsome man with a little grey beard
They shake their heads
No
(she is near to tears, then smiles artificially
) Oh, do forgive me
(as she goes) Goodbye, sleep well, if you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman's his name
She wanders on
Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way
And as they go: Sometimes  wish  could go mad
- stream of cars and trams
Jewish policemen and German soldiers much in evidence
Szpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting at a barrier to cross the intersection
The crowd is agitated, impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them through
next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot, taking off and putting on his hat
This is totally insane; why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area
Can't they go around
Don't worry about it, they're about to build a bridge, haven't you heard
bridge, a schmidge, and the Germans claim to be intelligent
You know what  think
think they're totally stupid
've got a family to feed and  spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through
Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz
Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man
Other soldiers are clearing a space
Two   pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space
Dance
The couple dance to the street band's waltz
At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples
The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused
One of them is almost hysterical with laughter
Faster
Go on, faster
Dance
The couples dance as fast as they can
soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more
Dance
Dance
Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions
- Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop
Uneasy
Good, they're here
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you, Henryk
Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man,  , unusual appearance, a man with red hair and a Hitler moustache
Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers
What's this about
Sit down, have tea, 'll start lunch when the girls get back
Henryk and Szpilman sit
They eye Heller suspiciously
So, what are you doing here
He brought cakes
Awkward silence
His father's back in the jewellery business and doing well, isn't that so, Yitzchak
Amazing
Jewellery
He runs dry
Another awkward silence
Then: We're recruiting
Who's recruiting
Don't be clever with me, Henryk
've come here as a friend
They're bringing Jews in from all over the country
Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto
We need more Jewish police
(sarcastic) Oh
More Jewish police
You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit
see
(eyes narrowed, dangerous) Someone's got to do it, Henryk
But why me
thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers
Look at my father, look at us, mean
(interrupting, flaring) Yes, 'm looking at you and that's why 'm here
Your whole family can have a better life
You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street
(a smile) Yes, please
(to Szpilman) 'm doing you people a favour
And what about you, Wladek
You're a great pianist
And we've got an excellent police jazz band
They'd welcome you with open arms
Join us
You've got no work
Thank you
But 've got work
Silence
Heller rises angrily
,  - On a platform, Szpilman plays at a piano, but he can hardly be heard above the noise of chatter and laughter
The large cafe is crowded, hot and smoke-filled
Well-heeled customers, pimps, whores, businessmen sit at little tables, eating, talking, laughing, almost drowning the piano music
Some dance
couple of tables back from the piano, a customer is doing business with a friend
The customer has a small stack of coins, some of them twenty-dollar gold pieces
He folds back the tablecloth to reveal a marble surface beneath
He drops a coin on the marble and listens but the noise is too loud
He sees the cafe owner, , fiftyish, and makes gestures, pointing at Szpilman
Benek pushes his way through to Szpilman
(whispering into Szpilman's ear) 'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop
(continuing to play) Who wants me to stop
Benek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture to Szpilman
Szpilman stops playing
The friend watches the customer intently as he drops the coins one by one onto the marble
He drops them, puts his ear close and listens
Two or three he discards, but he smiles when coins make a pure tone, and he keeps them
Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes eyes at him
Satisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman, who resumes his piano playing
- Szpilman walking
He passes emaciated children and beggars
He steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk
- The wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in half and narrowing it
Buildings on one side, the wall on the other
Szpilman walks along
piercing whistle from the Aryan side
Szpilman stops
Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall and look up
Two or three packages come flying over from the Aryan side
The women grab them and disappear
Szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole at ground level
The child wriggles through then turns, pulls a package after him and runs
Szpilman walks on, hears a noise, looks back to see a trying to wriggle through the same hole
But he's stuck
Angry German voices from the Aryan side
2ND Help me
help me
Szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might but the boy is jammed in the hole
From the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy
The boy screams in agony
Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through
The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible pain
Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate
Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through
The boy lies moaning
Szpilman takes the boy's face in his hands, tries to comfort him, revive him, but the boy has stopped moaning
His head lolls and his jaw sags
He is dead
Szpilman stands quickly and hurries away
- Szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard
'  - The noise of a mimeograph machine
huge, with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth
always say look on the bright side
You're in the small ghetto, intellectuals, professional people, you're better off than us
Here, in the large ghetto, it's a cesspool
But you, you're living in Monte Carlo
You could say you're privileged and that, of course, goes against my principles
Nevertheless
He laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers
His room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff
Dark, shabby, run-down
One of his sons, , is operating the mimeograph machine
The other, , is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller
, holding a toddler, is cooking at a small stove
finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made up of a few sheets
Ah, here
Today's news from the other side
You're amazing, Jehuda
No, 'm a socialist
have brothers everywhere
They bring me news and food
We care about our fellow human beings
Workers of the world unite
So, what's the news
(scanning the paper) The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov
don't know why  come here every evening, it's always such bad news
Bad news, you crazy
You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble
The news couldn't be better
The moment Hitler invaded Russia,  knew we'd be all right
Remember Napoleon
Same business
The Germans will freeze to death, please God
He beams
Szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the mimeograph
Jehuda, give me something to do
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up
You do enough
But  want to help,  want to
You're too well known, Wladek
And you know what
You musicians don't make good conspirators
You're too
too musical
He loves this, laughs, coughs
There are notices going up
The city's to be cleansed of undesirables
There are always notices going up
distinctive knock on the door
Szpilman tenses but Jehuda beams
To one of his boys: Symche - The boy opens the door to admit a short, neat man,
Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind, Jehuda
Working hard
He stops, seeing Szpilman
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe in the whole world
Wladyslaw Szpilman
Meet Majorek
(shakes Szpilman's hand) know your name
've never heard you play
Majorek used to be in the army
Brilliant man
He's got a mind like a searchlight
The only thing 've got against him is he's not a socialist
(he looks out of the window
) You'd better go now, Wladek
It's nearly curfew
(he hands over pamphlets to Majorek
) You see these, Wladek
You know how many copies we print of our newspaper
Szpilman shrugs
Five hundred
You know how many people on average read one copy
Twenty
That makes ten thousand readers
These will start the uprising
Majorek hides them in his underpants
And leaves them in toilets
Toilets
As many toilets as  can find
Germans never go into Jewish toilets
They're too clean for them
Jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough appallingly
- Summer
The windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto can be heard in the background
The family sit round the small table as Mother comes with a saucepan of soup and starts to serve
And, please, tonight, for once, don't want anything bad talked about
Let's enjoy our meal
Okay, then 'll tell you something funny
You know who  mean by Dr
Raszeja
The surgeon
The surgeon
Well, for some reason, don't ask me why, the Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation
On a Jew
They allowed a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew
He got a pass, that's all  know
Anyway, he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation
He'd just made the first incision when the  burst in, shoot the patient lying on the table, and then shoot Dr
Raszeja and everybody else who was there
Isn't that a laugh
The patient didn't feel a thing, he was anaesthetised - He laughs
No one else does
Henryk,  said nothing bad
What's the matter with you all
Have you lost your sense of humour
It's not funny
Well, you know what's funny
You're funny with that ridiculous tie
What are you talking about, my tie
What's my tie got to do with anything
need the tie for my work
Boys, boys
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them
blame the Americans
The others look at him
For what
For my tie
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us
What do they think they're doing
People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat
The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany
Suddenly, there's a roar of engines and a screech of brakes
Slamming of doors
The family rush to the windows
/
- Gestapo vehicle has entered the street and screeched to a halt
Helmeted, jackbooted  , led by an , pour out of the vehicle
The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch
Regina turns off the lights before joining them
They are all terrified
Their half-eaten meal still on the table behind them
- from Szpilman apartment: the building opposite
The  men pouring into the building opposite
Sound of the jackboots on stairs
Lights go on floor by floor
In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife, three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at their dining table
The  men burst in, machine pistols at the ready
The family is frozen with horror, remain seated
The  scans their faces
(in a towering rage) Stand up
The family rise to their feet fast, except for the old man in the wheelchair
The  bears down on him
Stand up
The old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair and tries desperately to stand
But he can't
Without warning, the  men seize the chair with the old man in it, carry him out on to the balcony
: Mother , Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him and Regina comforts Mother
Szpilman's and Henryk 's  - the apartment opposite: The  men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the balcony
He seems to hang in the air for a second then drops out of the chair and out of sight
But there's a terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter as the wheelchair follows him
: Mother sobbing
The others, still horrified
(softly, to Mother) Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be quiet
Then sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts
Szpilman and Henryk hurry to another window so that they can see what's going on
Their  from second window building opposite and street: Men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite
People watching from the windows but trying not to be seen
The headlights of the  vehicle are switched on and the Men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam
Run
Run
The prisoners start to run
The  men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle
People in the building opposite begin to
The prisoners are being shot down
They are lifted into the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead
One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment
The escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs with all his strength, putting distance between himself and the
He starts to scale a wall
He looks as though he's getting away
But there's a floodlight on the  vehicle
It flares into light, swivels and finds the man
volley of shots
The man drops from the wall, dead
The  men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies
: Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked
The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly
- Szpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano
The cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, the mood is sombre
- doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance
The doorman lets her in
- Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently
Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, threads his way through to Halina
She's shivering, almost unable to speak
What's happened
(almost incoherent) Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God
(shaking her) Calm down, what, what is it
They're hunting people on the streets
They've picked up Henryk
- Szpilman running
Streets crowded
Corpses
Szpilman, sweating, dodges and sidesteps
Then, suddenly, a woman bars his way
She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged, with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat
Excuse me, but have you seen my husband Izaak Szerman
'm afraid not
He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm
He's tall, he's handsome
He has a little grey beard
If you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman's his name, don't forget
Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on
- mob of men in front of the building being herded this way and that by Jewish policemen
More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos)
The mob constantly swelling
Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd
(to an elderly man nearest him) What's happening
They've got my grandson in there
They pick 'em up, they take 'em away
What do they do to them
've stopped believing in God
Szpilman scans the mob
The Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men
No sign of Henryk
Szpilman becomes alert
He's seen someone he recognises
Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton, driving men into the building
With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller
(yelling) Yitzchak
Heller doesn't hear
Yitzchak
Heller glances round
Here, please
Wladek Szpilman
Heller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach, but he continues to beat and manhandle people
Henryk's in there
haven't seen him
Believe me, they've picked him up
Tough luck
Can you help
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me
Can you help us
It costs
've no money
Then there's nothing  can do
He should've joined us when  gave him the chance
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence
Who told you
People  know
They said you're an important man
Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away
Szpilman stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn
,  - - Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building
Comings and goings
German Soldiers in evidence
The mob is smaller now
Szpilman waits and watches, and then a   passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a , dragging himself along
He's shivering with cold, his shoes with holes show his purple feet
The ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman
They struggle desperately
(screaming) snatcher
Help me, a snatcher
The can falls to the pavement and thick, steaming soup pours into the dirty street
Szpilman watches, rooted to the spot
The ragged old man stares at the can, lets out a groan, more like a whimper, and throws himself full length in the slush, licking the soup up from the pavement
The poor woman starts to howl, kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair
Then: ' Boys, keep your peckers up
And girls, keep your legs crossed
, a ragged, dishevelled little man, Chaplinesque, waving a stick, hopping and jumping, approaches the Germans outside the bureau
Don't let 'em get you down - He approaches a couple of Shupos
Bandits
Crooks
Thieves
He waves his stick at them
They laugh
One of them bows low
1ST Good day, Herr Rubinstein
If that means good day, 'm your man, you gangsters, robbers, pirates
2ND (tapping his head) Mad
Ich bin meshuge, you bandit
Almost in tears with laughter, they give him a cigarette and he goes on his way
Szpilman almost smiles, then looks again at the building
He waits
,  - Sun just setting
From the shelter of the alleyway, Szpilman continues to watch the entrance of the bureau
No mob any more, but people come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews
Almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams
Then, Heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and that and goes back inside the building
Szpilman alert
Again Heller appears in the entrance
He beckons someone inside
Henryk shuffles out
Heller shoves him into the street
Henryk stumbles, falls
Szpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet
(immediately on the attack, furious) You go to Heller, did  ask you to talk to him
You're out, aren't you
They start to walk
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach
didn't grovel,  asked him to help
What did you pay him
Pay him
With what
With what could pay him
Every zloty  earn we spend on food
can look after myself
They were taking you away
It's nothing to do with you
It's me they wanted, not you
Why do you interfere in other people's business
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad
That's also my business
They walk on
- wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small ghetto to the large ghetto
Few people about, mostly beggars and children
Szpilman and Henryk climb the stairs of the bridge, but as they reach the bridge itself Henryk stumbles, sinks to his knees
Szpilman gets hold of him, tries to help him stand
What's the matter
Are you sick
Hungry
- Szpilman supports Henryk, helps him towards the back of the cafe
,   - Henryk, finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread, sits at a worktop with Szpilman and Benek
The kitchen is small and busy with cooks, waiters, washers-up
What's that mean, no employment certificate
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise
Otherwise what
You'll be deported
So the rumours were true
They're going to resettle us
Send us to labour camps
In the east
And they're closing the small ghetto
Silence
- dense crowd of people crossing the bridge in both directions
Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and meets Jehuda Zyskind coming towards him, accompanied by the small man, Majorek
Wladek
Szpilman stops
thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York
(trying to smile) Not this week
They're buffeted by the crowd
In the street below them, cars, trams, pedestrians and German guards
have to say you look terrible
What's the trouble
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East
(dismissing him) Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek
've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father
've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but  need one more for my father
've been trying all the firms, the shops
Why didn't you come to me
didn't know you were in the certificate business
'm not, but Majorek is
(to Majorek) Can you help
've no money
Please, don't insult us
(to Majorek) Can you do something for him
Be at the Schultz Workshop, tomorrow, four o'clock
You see what a wonderful piece of luck you've had today
That's die historical imperative in action and that's why  always say, look on
(joining with him) the bright side, yes,  know
,   - The name 'Samuel Szpilman' being written on a certificate
The clatter of sewing machines
, a fat, sweaty German is filling out the form at his desk
Majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him and having a quiet laugh
In the doorway, Szpilman and Father
The small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where Jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter
Schultz stamps the certificate, hands it to Majorek, who gives it to Father
(doffing his hat) Thank you
(beaming, German accent) My pleasure
It won't help you anyway
- great mass of agitated people crossing only one way: from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings
German film crew records the scene
The Szpilmans among the crowd, lugging suitcases and bundles, Henryk with a few books, Father carrying his violin case
They struggle across the bridge
/
- truck backing up
The tail-gate is opened to reveal a huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, bedclothes
Three Jews inside the van start to unload the stuff, dumping it in the yard
Other Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among them the Szpilman family
Shupos and Jewish policemen supervise
Each has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother, clothing
The sounds of trains not far off
They carry the stuff into the warehouse
- Szpilman and the others bring their piles of things into the warehouse, which is crammed with similar objects, an Aladdin's cave
The activity continuous
,   - semi-darkness
large room with an improvised partition of blankets to separate the men from the women
Three-tiered bunks
On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, Henryk on the lower
Szpilman, stripping down to his underwear, is preparing to climb into the middle bunk
At least we've got work in the ghetto
At least we're still together
Szpilman nods, climbs into his bunk, settles down
Somewhere near, the sound of a train
Then a volley of shots, German voices shouting
Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it and comes face to face with a German  and soldiers
Out
Assemble in the yard
We're employed here, we've got certificates - The  cracks Szpilman across the face, turns and goes
Szpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding
The women are watching from behind the blankets, but Mother hurries towards Szpilman
She wipes his nose
Shots, shouts, a scream
- Still quite dark
The Szpilmans and about twenty others lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of German vehicles
The  goes along the line, making a selection, using his pistol to prod people into moving
When he gets to the Szpilmans he selects Henryk and Halina
Then, he turns to those who are left: The rest of you get dressed then report back here
Bring your belongings
Fifteen kilos only
Where are you taking us
The  turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her through the head
He marches off while she lies on the ground with blood spurting out of her
,  - The partition has been pulled aside
People, including the Szpilmans, are dressing or dressed, packing up their belongings
'm sorry,  did my best,  thought the certificates would save us all
Stop it, Wladek
Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off - Sounds of shots, screams, shouts, a piercing whistle
- Hot, fine summer's day
Jews, among them Szpilman, Mother, Regina and father, clutching their meagre belongings, walk towards wooden gates and come to a halt
Jewish policemen approach and order the people about, pushing and shoving them into line
(to a Jewish policeman) Where will we be going
#1 You're going to work
You'll be much better off than in this stinking ghetto
The gates are The gates are opened
#2 Move
They shuffle forward
- Szpilman, Mother, Regina and Father, with others, enter through one of the gates, which closes on them
They pause for a moment to take in their new surroundings
The Szpilmans and their : Their first sight of the large rectangle, walled on two sides and overlooked by buildings
Several hundred people
People walk up and down
Let's sit over there
But he stops again, and so do the others
Something they see causes them to stand stock still, expressionless
' : An unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where bloated, decaying bodies lie near to a wall
The wall itself is spattered with blood
Large flies walk over the dead
Nobody goes near
: Szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space
Later: Glaring sun
The Szpilmans have settled down on the kerb of a pavement and are waiting
Szpilman stands, observing the scene
Mother sits on a bundle of things, staring vacantly, her hair hanging down in strands
Regina, beside her, has her hands over her face and is weeping, the tears running through her fingers
Father walks nervously up and down, hands behind his back, four steps one way, four steps back
Near them, a begins to wail
Why did  do it
Why did  do it
young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying
Her cries continue at intervals
Why did  do it
Why did  do it
The sound of trucks
Everyone looks towards the gates
More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched through the gates
Mothers, children, old people, begging, most of them holding papers
Pandemonium
Later: The sun high, blazing
Szpilman is wandering around, occasionally greeting people
The place is crowded now, packed
Trucks bring more and more Jews at intervals
Old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether some of them are alive or dead
Women carrying dehydrated children drag themselves from group to group
One approaches Szpilman
He's dying, don't you have a drop of water
My child's dying of thirst, he's dying, he's dying, beg you
Szpilman shakes his head sadly
The woman with child wanders off to another group
' 'm telling you, it's a disgrace
Szpilman turns to see a man,
, haranguing Father
can hear you
Szpilman goes to them
(overlapping) We're letting them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter
Dr
Ehrlich, not so loud
Why don't we attack them
There's half a million of us, we could break out of the ghetto
At least we could die honourably, not as a stain on the face of history
Another man, Grun, joins in
Why you so sure they're sending us to our death
'm not sure
You know why 'm not sure
Because they didn't tell me
But 'm telling you they plan to wipe us all out
Dr
Ehrlich, what do you want me to do
You want me to fight
To fight you need organisation, plans, guns
He's right
What d'you think  can do
Fight them with my violin bow
The Germans would never squander a huge labour force like this
They're sending us to a labour camp
Oh, sure
Look at that cripple, look at those old people, the children, they're going to work
Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's going to carry iron girders on his back
loud cry from Mother
Szpilman and Father spin round
Henryk
(glancing up, shocked) Oh my God
Near the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, Henryk and Halina
Halina
Henryk
Regina and Szpilman also call and wave
Henryk and Halina struggle through to them
Halina falls into Mother's arms and they hug
We heard you were here
we
didn't want
we
we wanted to be with you
Mother comforts her
And so does Regina
Father smiles sadly
(shakes his head, almost to himself, a forlorn smile) Stupid, stupid
Why did  do it
Why did  do it
Szpilman stands and stares at her
Later: The sun lower but the heat still intense
The place is now packed to suffocation
People calling out names, trying to find each other
The wailing of women and the cries of children
cordon of Jewish policemen and  guards are, almost surreptitiously, ringing the compound
The Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book
Why did  do it
Why did  do it
She's getting on my nerves
What did she do, for God's sake
Grun leans across to her
(quietly, to Halina) She smothered her baby
Halina looks at him in disbelief
They'd prepared a hiding place and so, of course, they went there
But the baby cried just as the police came
She smothered the cries with her hands
The baby died
policeman heard the death rattle
He found where they were hiding
Later: Szpilman and Henryk
What are you reading
(a crooked, ironic smile) 'If you prick us, do we not bleed
If you tickle us, do we not laugh
If you poison us, do we not die
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge
' Szpilman takes the book and reads the title page: Very appropriate
(taking the book back and resuming his reading) Yes, that's why  brought it
Later: The Szpilmans seated on the kerb
Their attention is caught by a  who has a box of sweets on a string round his neck
And he's setting the sweets, pocketing money
Idiot
What's he think he's going to do with the money
Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over
How much for a caramel
Twenty zlotys
What
For one caramel
What d'you think you're going to do with the money
Twenty zlotys
(turning to the family) Have we got twenty between us
They search their pockets and handbags, hand over to Father what change they can find
He, in turn, hands the money to the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way
Father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger and examines it carefully
Then, carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six pans
He hands a part to each of the family
They all exchange a look, an acknowledgement of each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately
The whistle of a locomotive
Sound of trucks rattling over the rails
At once, a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the compound
- The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt
- cordon of Jewish policeman and  guards
Among the great throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train
Szpilman and Halina walking
Halina
What
Funny time to say this
What
wish  knew you better
(a smile) Thanks
: The Szpilmans near the train
The first trucks are already full, the people inside pressed close together,  men pushing them with their rifle butts
People in the trucks cry out in desperation
The Szpilmans are pushed along by  men along the cordon of Jewish policemen, past loaded trucks
Then, suddenly: Szpilman
Szpilman
Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon
It's Heller
The rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled
scuffle as Szpilman tries to resist
Another Jewish policeman shoves him
Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs
He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk and Halina clambering into the trucks
Father is looking around, bewildered
(yelling) Papa
Father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, smiling helplessly
He raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks
Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders
(desperate) Papa
Mama
Halina
Heller turns on him
What do you think you're doing, Szpilman
've saved your life
Now, go on, save yourself
Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified
Then he turns and starts to run
Don't run
Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates
Workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall
Szpilman falls in with them and they pass through the gates
- The doors of the trucks are closed
The train begins to move
Slow, laborious
From the trucks, the faint cries of the occupants
- Szpilman catches his breath by a building
An  man and Jewish policeman emerge
The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German
He points to the train - Well, off they go for meltdown
They laugh as they walk away
Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street
The cries from the trucks fading
He begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on
- Szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears
He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open, windows smashed
Furniture, torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered
Feathers fly
Desolation
He turns a corner
, '  - Szpilman comes into the courtyard
He stops, his face blank
Lying outside the door, the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs
Zyskind, their two sons and the toddler
Szpilman steps across the bodies
'  - Chaos
Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place
The mimeograph smashed
Szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation
Distant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries
He gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow
He lies down on the floor
He stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty
- Szpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe
No sign of life, but the door is wide open
He goes inside
- shambles
Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, broken chairs
Stops, looks about
Nothing
Distant shots, automatic fire
He turns and makes for the door
Then he hears an urgent hiss
He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it
He hears the hiss again
Now he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning to him
Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside him
Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden from view
,   - Thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs in the cramped space
(looking at him, mystified) Why are you here, Mr
Wladek
It's like this
we
all of them
He can't continue
Benek nods
Perhaps they're lucky
The quicker the better
(Brief pause
) It isn't over yet
We'll stay here for a couple of days
Until things die down
(Another pause) 've bribed a policeman
He'll come when it's over
- In bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded by two German policemen
They are being marched out of the ghetto gates
(to Benek) My God
haven't been outside for - it must be two years
(on the other side of him) Don't get over-excited
- Street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, vegetables, fish, tins of preserves
Women bargain with them, making purchases
Lively, colourful
Dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously
Gold, buy gold
Dollars
Roubles
Later: Szpilman, on top of a free-standing scaffold, Benek and the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers
They work slowly
smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop
They stare
The young woman is extremely attractive and knows it
The foremen, workers and the German policemen ogle her
Look - oh, do look
Her young man is puzzled; she points
Jews
Can't be the first time you've ever seen Jews
Embarrassed, she giggles and they go
Szpilman, Benek and the others continue to work
The foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the German policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers
Szpilman suddenly stops work
He has seen something in the square that alerts him
At the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall
Her name is
Surreptitiously, Szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch her attention
But he's frightened of alerting the German policemen and the foremen
Benek has noticed
Someone you know
Yes
Again Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him, doesn't see
beauty
Who is she
singer
Her husband's an actor
knew them well
Good people
'd like to talk to her
(playful) Don't forget, Mr
Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews
He goes back to work
The German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit
The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread
Szpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the stall
He comes to a decision
He jumps down, is about to dash towards Janina, but stops dead
Janina is no longer there
- As before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen
Suddenly: Halt
The column halts before a young  man, wild-eyed, with his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol
He talks excitedly to the policemen then turns, walks along the column dividing them up: some men to the right, others, seven of them, to the left
Benek he orders to the left, Szpilman to the right
Young  man turns to those on the left
Lie down
Terrified, they obey
He stands over them and, one by one, shoots them
When he comes to Benek, the seventh man, his pistol runs out of ammunition
He changes the clip, shoots Benek and marches off
,   - Szpilman, bent almost double, carries a hod on his back piled with bricks
He is mounting a wooden ramp that runs up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an extra floor is being added to a house
There are Polish workers, too, who don't, of course, wear armbands as the Jews do
There's a wooden hut serving as a store on the site
Halfway up the ramp, Szpilman hears someone whistle
He stops, turns to see, at the bottom of the ramp, Majorek, smiling and giving a discreet wave
Later: Szpilman and Majorek sip gruel out of mugs
They sit apart from the others who are also taking a break
How long have you been here
Since last night
was pleased to see you
Brief silence
They're going to start the final resettlement now
We know what it means
We sent someone out
Zygmunt
good man
His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw
He got to Sokolow
local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka
He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty
No transports of food are ever seen on that line
And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station
They're exterminating us
Won't take them long
We're sixty thousand left
Out of half a million
Mostly young people
And this time we're going to fight
We're in good shape
We're organised
We're prepared
If you need help
Whistle blows
little later: Szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back
The noise of airplanes overhead
- swarm of Russian bombers
Anti-aircraft fire
Puffs of exploding shells
- The workers look up
So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below
- You
An  man, - (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman
- Here
Szpilman goes to him
Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly
- (with every stroke, hissing through clenched teeth) Und-zick
Und-zack
Und-zick
Und- zack
After a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt
Zick-Zack nods, satisfied
- Get him away from here
Two Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away
Bartczak and the other man help Szpilman to his feet
Hope you played the piano better than you carry bricks
He won't last long if he goes on like this
'll see if  can get him something better
/
- Winter
Rain
Cold
The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets
Szpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has formed
Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site
worker puts his head into the store
(hissing) Trouble
Assemble
Fall in
Only the Jews
Poles go on working
Only the Jews
Poles go on working
The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an  Captain strides in
The  Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers
(in English) have important and good news for you
There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken
glance between Szpilman and Majorek
(in English) want to assure you personally that no such measures will be taken now or in the future
Posters will be going up also to this effect
As proof of our good will, we want you to select a delegate, who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy, on each worker's behalf, five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread, which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto
Now, why would we do that j if we meant to resettle you
He beams; no reaction from the workers
(in English) You can do good business on what you don't eat
Isn't that what you Jews are best at
Making 'geld'
Rubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction; his smile vanishes
(in English) Carry on
- Snow
Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site
On the barrow, five sacks
The Jewish workers are phased to see him
Majorek pulls the barrow to where Szpilman waits
(under his breath) The smaller one
At the bottom
Szpilman nods and starts unloading the sacks as Majorek moves away
- Szpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner
He kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the string around its neck
He puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out
He reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds something
Carefully, he removes a pistol, then another, both wrapped in oil cloths
He hides them under his jacket
/
- Szpilman and a Jewish worker distribute the potatoes to the other Jewish workers lined up with empty containers of various kinds
There are scales on the table, and they weigh out five kilos of potatoes, pour them into the men's containers and drop in a loaf of bread
- The Jewish workers, all carrying their parcels of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by two Polish policemen
Szpilman walks beside them
Ahead of him, Majorek near the front of the column
As the column nears the ghetto gates, Majorek tosses his package over the wall and when Szpilman reaches the same spot, he throws a similar package
The column marches on
- small room with several three-tiered bunk beds
The sound of men's heavy breathing and snoring
Szpilman lies awake, staring at the ceiling
He reaches inside his jacket, finds a scrap of paper and a pencil, writes something
He slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks, crouches down at the bottom one, where Majorek sleeps
(whispered) Majorek
Majorek is instantly awake
Have a favour to ask
want to get out of here
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard
know
But last summer,  worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square
saw someone  knew
singer
Her husband's an actor
They're old friends
( (He holds out the " piece of paper
) 've written their names down
And their address
If they're still there
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki
Good people
Majorek, you go into the town every day
Would you try and make contact
Ask them if they'd help me get out of here
Majorek takes the paper but says nothing
He turns over and goes back to sleep
Szpilman returns to his bunk
- Szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest sack
sound alerts him
He looks round
An  Lieutenant has entered the stores, sucking his finger, which is bleeding
Any fucking plaster
Szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First Aid tin, removes a plaster and gives it to the Lieutenant
' (while he applies the plaster to his finger) What were you up to
Nothing from Szpilman
' What the fuck are those
He indicates the sacks with his chin
(in German) We're allowed to take food into the ghetto
Five kilos of potatoes and a
The  Lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the smallest one
Open it
It's only potatoes and bread
Fuck that, you're lying,  can smell it
Open it
Szpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified and can't manage it
The  Lieutenant shoves him out of the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the string
The  Lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans
He glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again, produces a handful of oatmeal
You're all the same
Give a Jew a little finger, he takes the whole hand
He throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face
You lie to me again and 'll shoot you personally
He kicks Szpilman viciously and marches away
Szpilman catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition
He hides them under his clothes
- Freezing cold
The Jewish workers, with their bundles of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by the two Polish policemen
In the column, Szpilman, near the policeman with the moustache, and a little behind them, Majorek
Distant sounds of gunfire
Majorek falls in beside Szpilman
tried your friends
They're not at that address any more
But
You made contact
Be ready to leave in two days' time
Same place as last night
Sudden, frantic cries from the head of the column, which comes to a stop
Two  men, blind drunk, drinking vodka from bottles, are lashing the column with whips
One of them is Zikk-Zack,
Oh, shit
As the  men advance on Szpilman and Majorek's section, Majorek slips back to his place in the column
Szpilman hides his package inside his coat
Zick-Zack lashes out at the workers blindly
- Und-zick
Und-zack
He takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with Szpilman
- (shouting") 'll soon teach you discipline
Jew pigs
He is staring directly at Szpilman with glassy eyes
Szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible to cover his hidden package with his hands
moment of danger
Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the cottar
- Know why we beat you
No response; shaking him
- Know why we beat you
(tentatively, in German) No
Why
- To celebrate New Year's Eve
He and his comrade find this hilarious; recovering from his laughter
- Now, march
Go on, march
The column starts to march
- And sing
(he belches
) Sing something cheerful
(laughs
) And sing it good and loud
brief silence, then from the back, a solo voice starts to sing, 'Children of Warsaw will go to fight
' Szpilman glances back, sees that it's Majorek singing
Szpilman smiles, Majorek nods
Szpilman joins in
Now, so do the others
They march on, singing lustily
(singing) Hey, ranks unite And follow the White Eagle
Stand up and fight Our mortal enemy
Riflemen, hey
Let's give them fire and brimstone
We'll blow away The yoke of slavery
Punish and rout The rapists of our nation
We'll smash the knout To save our dignity
Soon we'll be proud Of our liberation - Hey, take your sights
Aim sharply at the heart
Hey, load
Hey, shoot
Hey, load
Hey, shoot
Give 'em a bloody start
Hey, load
Hey, shoot
Aim sharply at the heart
The column reaches the lamp posts near the ghetto gates
Szpilman his package over the wall
So does Majorek
/
- The Jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread
Szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes
Get on with it and fall in
Fall in
Calmly, Szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks past Majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes, are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into the ghetto
The Polish workers have packed up their tools and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the site but in a casual way
The  guards shout orders for the Jewish column to move off
Szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at the last moment turns and falls in with the Polish workers, beside Barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that Szpilman is in the middle of the group
Szpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket
The group walk into the darkness
- Dimly lit
Empty street
Szpilman walks fast to the corner, stops, looks round anxiously
Nothing
He takes the armband from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain in the gutter just as there's movement in a darkened doorway
Szpilman tenses
Then, out of the darkness of the doorway, a woman: She turns and starts to walk quickly
Szpilman, putting the collar of his coat up, follows, keeping pace pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays them no attention
Janina and Szpilman walk on
- Janina comes to the front door, opens it with a key, goes in
Szpilman, a little distance behind, catches up and follows her inside
,   3RD ,   - Janina waits as Szpilman closes the front door, then starts up the stairs
Szpilman follows
She stops, turns to him, smiles, kisses him on the cheek, then continues up the stairs
- , a handsome man, fortyish, tries to conceal his sense of shock at seeing Szpilman He holds out his hand and Szpilman shakes it
Szpilman looks around the nicely furnished, large apartment
He looks at Bogucki and Janina
Tears well up in his eyes
He fights it hard, not to cry
So does Janina
We haven't much time
,   - Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though he's in a trance
gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some clothes
He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed
You must hurry
Bogucki holds up a towel
Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself
We're going to have to keep moving you
The Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now
Jews, non- Jews, anybody, everybody
(handing him the clothes') See if these fit
And, Wladek, you'd better shave
Use my razor
In the cabinet
,   - The ceramic stove
Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned
Janina shoves the strips of clothes into the stove
Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while he spoons hot soup into his mouth
Thank you,  don't
You'll be looked after by Mr Gebczynski
He's on the other side of town
You'll stay there tonight
Then we'll find you somewhere else
Janina adds the last strip of clothing
'll bring you food
Let's go
- rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets
'  - The rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store
The moment it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast
'  - shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and then pulls down the shutter
Gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc
'll show you where you're going to sleep
He leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from a chair and a blanket
Szpilman follows
: Gebczynski leads Szpilman down the stairs
: Dark, shadowy
Shelves with taps, washers, pipes
Gebczynski leads the may to a particular set of shelves
He puts aside the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves
Szpilman, although puzzled, helps
Slowly, the shelves move to reveal a secret compartment
It's not going to be very comfortable
'll be fine
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon
He helps Szpilman into the compartment
We've got a flat for you
Near the ghetto wall
But it's safe
He hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that Szpilman is now hidden
- In the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out
With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, seeing something
In niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades, ammunition Szpilman stares, expressionless
,   - Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt
As they board: (quietly, to Szpilman) Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section
() - Gebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until they reach a chain and a sign: In the German section, only three or four passengers
Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles
Szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible
The tram rumbles on its way
1ST , 4TH     - Gebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door
Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in
/
1ST , 4TH ,   - charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan
Gebczynski leads the way in
Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out
' : He can see a section of ghetto wall below
Beyond it, inside the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings
Gebczynski comes up behind him
Must feel better this side of the wall
Yes, but sometimes 'm still not sure which side of the wall 'm on
Here
He leads Szpilman to the small kitchen
Gebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes, bread
'll come again
And Janina Bogucki will visit twice a week
Bring more food
See how you are
He closes the cupboard
Gebczynski makes for the front door, stops
Yes, now, this is very important
In case of emergency,  mean emergency, go to this address
He hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand and goes quickly
Alone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment
Then, he takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it
While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed
He goes to it, slips off his other shoe and lies down, testing the divan's springiness with his whole body
He smiles beatifically
He shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep
/
1ST  - Szpilman still fast asleep
Voices wake him
He opens his eyes
He's not certain where he is for a moment
He hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat
Intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the watt, puts his ear against it, listens
After a brief silence: ' (angry) Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot
' What d'you think  mean, Kitten forgot, that's what  mean
' You know what
You treat me like dirt
' treat you like dirt because you are dirt
' Pig
' Cow
' Pig
' Bitch
' Dirty pig
' You're a dirty pig
' Takes one to know one
Pig
Silence
Szpilman is enjoying himself
Then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling but a lot of wrong notes
' You play like an angel, Kitten
The piano continues for a moment, but suddenly stops: ' If  play like an angel, why don't you listen
' was listening, Kitten
' Liar, you fell asleep
Pig
door slams
' (wheedling) Kitten, let me in
Silence
Szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle shots and a huge explosion
He crosses quickly to the window, looks out
'  -
Deserted
Stillness
Silence
From the ghetto smoke drifting slowly
/
1ST  - Szpilman asleep on the divan
The roar of motor car and motorcycle engines
Sporadic firing
He wakes, rushes to the window
' : German personnel carrier, an open car carrying officers, and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street below towards the buildings at the far end
German soldiers follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun
Unseen marksmen fire down on the Germans from the buildings
As the German soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of them is hit and falls
The others rush for cover
-   - The German Commander and two officers alight from the car and take cover
The Commander orders the field gun to be trained on the buildings
Spasmodic firing continues
He gives the order to fire
The gun roars
The shell tears into the building
At once the German soldiers open fire with their rifles and lob grenades into the building
The gun fires again
The building begins to burn
Flames and smoke
German soldiers with flame-throwers advance carefully then unleash their fire into doorways and windows, and quickly retreat
At ground level, Jewish fighters try to fight their way out and are mowed down
The fire spreads quickly through the building
Smoke begins to pour from the upper floors
The Germans, less cautious now, stand and watch
woman struggles out on to her narrow third-floor balcony
She climbs over, holds on to the wrought-iron railings and hangs on for dear life
Shots ring out and she drops like a stone
From inside the building, screams and shouts
From another upper window, a man in flames jumps and falls to his death on the pavement below
The Germans have stopped firing
They stand, spectators, watching the building burn
/
1ST  -  - Szpilman at the window, watching, his mood downcast
The noise of a key in the door
He turns to see the door of the flat open
Janina enters with a parcel of food
She kisses Szpilman on the cheek
wanted to come earlier but
She hands him the parcel
Thank you
He goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents while Janina gazes out of the window
No one thought they'd hold out so long
should never have come out should've stayed there, fought with them
(turning to him) Wladek, stop that
It's over now
Just be proud it happened
My God, did they put up a fight
Yes, so did the Germans
They're in shock
They didn't expect it
Nobody expected it
Jews fighting back
Who'd have thought
Yes, but what good did it do
(passionate) What good
Wladek, 'm surprised at you
They died with  dignity, that's what good it did
And you know something else
Now the Poles will rise
We're ready
We'll fight, too
You'll see
she turns to look again out of the window
- The building burning
Corpses lie scattered on the pavement
The Germans stand about chatting and laughing
handful of Jewish fighters are lined up and shot
Satisfied, the Commander returns to his car
Another officer confers with him before the engine starts up and he is driven away
The building burns
1ST , '  - Blazing sun
The ghetto buildings now burned-out shells, the street empty
1ST  - '  - Autumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind
Szpilman gazes out
/
1ST  - Snow
Ice on the windows
The sound of the key in the door
Szpilman turns as the door opens and Gebczynski enters, distraught
Whispered, at speed: Get your things together, you have to leave
What's happened
Gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it
While he does so: 'm on the run
What's happened
The Gestapo found our weapons
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej
They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once
Where do you want me to go
Look at me
No, no, 'm not leaving
Can't  take my chances here
That's your decision
(Stubs out cigarette
) But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive
have poison on me, they won't get me alive either
And he goes
Szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering down the stairs
He sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs, smokes awkwardly
Later: Szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes
He tenses
German voices shouting and their heavy footsteps on the stairs
He goes to the window, opens it
He gets a chair, places it sideways in front of the window to make a step
He's working out how best to throw himself out
He leans against the wall near the door and waits
Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream
Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump
Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending door slams
He cautiously goes to the window and looks out
/
1ST  - '  -
In the street below, he sees  men escorting two prisoners and shoving into a car
The car speeds off
The street is empty
1ST  - Snow
Howling wind
Szpilman lies on the divan
He is cold, unshaven, hair filthy and long
He manages to rise
mess
Szpilman goes into the kitchen
From a bread tin he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps it
slice of bread, stale and mouldy
He tries to bite it but can't
He finds a knife and tries to chop a piece off the bread but knocks the bread tin, which falls to the floor with a clatter
He continues to try to cut the bread, when there's a loud hammering on the front door
Szpilman stiffens
The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looks around, confused, not knowing what to do
From the other side of the door female voices, words indistinct, and then: ' Open this door at once, or we'll call the police
He is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket, grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of his things, stuffs them into a paper bag
The hammering stops
Szpilman cautiously approaches the door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out
1ST ,    - He slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops dead
, young and fierce, stands on the stairs, blocking his way
Are you from the flat in there
You're not registered
It belongs to a friend of mine came to visit but  must have just missed him
(shouting) Have you got your identity card
Let me see your identity card
Szpilman hesitates; she shouts more loudly
want to see your identity card
On various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out to see what's going on
Summoning all his strength, Szpilman makes a dash for it, pushing past Kitty
(screeching) He's a Jew
He's a Jew
Stop the Jew
Don't let him out
Szpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor landing
Another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes past her and out of the house
- Heavy snow
Szpilman stumbles into the street and runs
He darts down a side street
- Szpilman lurches into the narrow street
No one about
He stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of himself
He puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his neck
He leans up against a wall
He removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper Gebczynski gave him
He reads it
- Szpilman drags himself along, trudging through snow and slush
Passers-by give him a wide berth
He tries to walk normally, with dignity, but he's weak and slips, and finds the going hard
He comes to a villa
,   - He goes to the front door, rings the bell and waits
' (from behind the door) Yes
Mr Gebczynski sent me
The door opens and Dorota stands there
She is pregnant
They stand for a moment staring at each other
(a whisper) Wladyslaw Szpilman
Dorota
Come in
come in
'  - Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room
Sit
'm sorry -  was given this address
'm looking for a Mr-- (He checks the scrap of paper
') -- a Mr Dzikiewicz
(nodding) Michal Dzikiewicz
He's my husband
Szpilman sits down slowly
need help
He'll be back before curfew
've been in hiding
need somewhere to stay
He'll be here soon
Awkward silence
He gazes at her
She looks away
How long have you been married
Just over a year
He nods
Brief silence
And how's Yurek
Dead
Again, the awkward silence
When's your baby due
Christmas
( pause
) This is not a good time to have children
But then
The door opens and Michal Dzikiewicz enters
He sees Szpilman and stops
Szpilman stands
This is my husband
Wladyslaw Szpilman
Marek Gebczynski sent him
Oh, yes
remember
He shakes hands with Szpilman
Mr Gebczynski said to contact you only in an emergency, but
Don't worry now
We can't move you tonight
Szpilman, dizzy, leans on the table for support
You'll sleep on the sofa
He and Dorota look at him
Excuse me, could  have a piece of bread
Yes, of course, we'll eat
'  - Szpilman asleep on the sofa
The sound of a cello
He opens his eyes
Listens
He swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and crosses to a door
Quietly, he opens it a little
Szpilman and his  - another room
Dorota, partially turned away from him, plays Bach on the cello
Szpilman watches her and listens
2ND  (4TH ),    - padlock being unlocked
Then, a key is inserted into the Yale lock, turned, and the door opens
Michal and Szpilman on the landing, enter the flat
/
2ND    - large room, sparsely furnished but with an upright piano and a bed
Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out
' : There are views of the city, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box
Michal comes up behind Szpilman
(in whisper) You're in a very German area
The building opposite is a hospital, taking in wounded from the Russian front
Next door is the Schutzpolizei
It's the safest place to be
Right in the centre of the lion's den
: Michal makes for the door
'll be locking you in
No one knows you're here
So keep as quiet as possible
He nods and goes
The sound of the padlock closing
Szpilman takes in the room
He sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it
He sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height
He opens the lid
cloth covers the keys
He removes the cloth
He gazes lovingly at the keyboard
He flexes his fingers
Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays
Silently
Passionately
- Snow falling
2ND  - Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then iheYdle
The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash
In whispers: All well
Thank you
This is Antek Szalas
Szalas and Szpilman shake hands
He's going to look after you
've given him a second key
He'll bring you food
See that you're all right
He's with the underground, a good man
Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out
He finds glasses and pours
While he does all this: You don't remember me, Mr
Szpilman
No,  don't think so
Warsaw Radio
was a technician
saw you almost every day
Sorry,  don't remember
Doesn't matter
You've nothing to worry about
'll visit often
And you'll be pleased to hear the Allies are bombing Germany night after night - Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin
And the Russians are really giving them hell
It's the beginning of the end
He gives the others their vodka
Let's hope so
don't know when 'll see you again
They clink glasses and drink
2ND  - Summer
Trees in leaf
Comings and goings at the Schutzpolizei building
And an ambulance draws up at the hospital, disgorging a couple of stretcher cases, who are carried inside
2ND  - very weak and his skin yellowish, drops four beans into boiling water
The Sound of the padlock being opened
Szpilman hurries to see the door open and Szalas enter with a small and grinning cheerfully
In whispers: Still alive then, are you
Here
Sausage
Bread
He hands over the package
You still got that vodka
Szpilman stares at the package
How long is this meant to last
Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses think 've got jaundice
He unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread
He takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly
You don't want to worry about that
My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice
(chuckles
) In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious
Drink up
Why didn't you come sooner
It's been over two weeks
Szalas goes to the window, looks out
Problems
Money
've got to raise money to buy the food
need things to sell, it' s not easy
Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas
Sell this
Food's more important than time
Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops
Oh, yes
meant to tell you
The Allies have landed in France
The Russians'll be here soon
They'll beat the shit out of the Germans
Any day now
He grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes
Hie padlock is locked on the other side
Szpilman enjoys his sausage
2ND  - Sunshine floods in through the windows
Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill
The sound of the padlock
He doesn't stir
Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed
In whispers: Wladek
Wladek
(to Michal) knew it,  knew this would happen
Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them
He mutters incoherently
'm going to get a doctor
You can't, it's too dangerous
'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician
He's still a doctor
She starts for the door
No, you stay, 'll go
He leaves
The padlock sound
Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow
He focuses on her, smiles
We came to say goodbye
We're going to stay with my mother in Otwock
The baby's already there
It's safer
There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now
Szpilman suddenly winces with pain
That man Szalas should be shot
He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw
Apparently, people gave generously
So he collected a tidy sum
He told us he was visiting you daily
She looks at him; barely audible
Oh God
Later: Szpilman looks up at Dr Luczak, who has a stethoscope in his ears
Dorota and Michal stand behind him
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder
Liver the size of a football
But he'll live
'll try to get hold of some levulose, but it's not easy
Can you visit him again
Who knows
Doctor, thank you
Don't speak
Rest
The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision
Dorota moves in beside him
Michal brought food
'll prepare something now for you, then we must go
Szpilman tries again to say something, but he can't, just lies there, distressed
/
- '  - Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window
Peaceful
few pedestrians
An everyday atmosphere
At the far end, at the -junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight
The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick
Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper
One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder
The sound of rapid firing, which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun
His two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the Schutzpolizei building
The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box
As if these young men have given a signal, now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire
The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who eventually manages to disappear inside a building
Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building
The firing intense
The three young Poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building
- battle raging
The Germans firing from the hospital
The three young Poles have been joined by other fighters and they the Schutzpolizei building
Grenades thrown, machine-gun fire exchanged
The sentry box blows up, splinters of wood cascading couple of Poles make a dash for it and enter a building opposite to the Schutzpolizei

2ND  - '  - Szpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite direction and sees smoke rising
When he turns back to look towards the -junction, he sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next-door building but on the floor below
The Panzerfaust fires
The shell hits the hospital
- The city in flames
Sound of firing becoming sporadic, less intense
Isolated explosions
2ND  - Szpilman, lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling
2ND  - '  - The interior of the Schutzpolizei building burnt to cinders
An ambulance is being loaded with patients from the hospital
horse-drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the street
/
2ND  - '  - Szpilman at the window, watching
The horse-drawn cab clatters out of his sight
He is about to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and woman walking with their hands in the air
Then, a German soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears
Suddenly, the man and woman begin to run
The man turns and disappears
The woman also turns, but the German soldier drops to one knee and fires
The woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position, and that's how she remains
Szpilman watches, aghast
Then, he hears voices outside his door, shouts, footsteps, panic
: He runs to his front door and listens
(confused) Where
Where
Just get out
Everywhere
Get out into the street
More clatter of footsteps
Then: ' Get out now
The Germans have surrounded the building
They're going to blow us to pieces
Footsteps descending stairs, more shouts, and: ' (further off) Everyone out, please
Leave your flats at once, please
Szpilman runs to the door, tries it but it's padlocked and he can't open the door
In panic, he runs back to the window
His eyes grow wide with terror
' :
German tank bringing its gun to bear on the building next to his
The gun jerks back and there's a great roaring noise
The whole building shakes
Szpilman reek back, falls, gets to his feet and crawls back to the window
He sees the tank turret swivelling slowly, bringing the gun to bear directly on a lower floor of his building
The roaring noise again
terrific explosion
His windows are shattered
Glass everywhere
He is thrown back across the room
Smoke begins to billow and fill the room
2ND     - Smoke filling the room
Szpilman gets to his knees, peers through the smoke and sees that the wall separating his apartment from the one next door has been partially destroyed, with a large hole blasted in it
He stumbles into the next-door apartment and out of the front door
4TH  5TH   - Smoke everywhere
Szpilman staggers up to the fifth-floor landing
There's a metal attic door
Szpilman pushes open the door and steps into the attic
- The roof space with laundry drying on lines
Szpilman enters the attic, closes the door, leans on it
Fourth floor, Fischke
He looks round, sees that the roof has been shattered, leaving a large, jagged gap
He climbs through the gap, on to the roof at the back of the building
4TH   - The attic door being kicked in by a German boot
German soldier, wearing his gas mask, bayonet fixed, enters the attic, looks round, sees nothing, then: At the double, Fischke
The soldier turns and hurries out
,    - On the sloping roof, Szpilman clutches the skylight and has his feet in the roof gutter
He listens - all quiet in the house
And then a bullet ricochets off the tiles beside him
Szpilman, terrified, drops, involuntarily catching a lower edge so that his feet dangle above a balcony below
More shots
He drops on to the balcony and looks back
,    - Two German soldiers are firing at Szpilman
,    - Szpilman clambers back into the building through the smashed balcony door
couple of shots dangerously close
- Smoke
Szpilman staggers down the stairs, stumbles over a corpse and almost falls headlong
- The sun is setting
Szpilman crawls into the backyard
He hears German voices shouting commands
He hides behind three garbage bins by the wall
He waits
Listens
Silence - Deserted
Buildings on fire but dying out
Corpses in the street, including the woman who was shot, still in her strange kneeling position
- Szpilman watches from the doorway
Then, dropping down, he crawls across the road on his stomach, threading his way through the dead bodies, now besieged by flies, and makes for the hospital opposite
German soldiers appear from around a corner
Szpilman immediately lies still, pretending to be just another corpse
Flies alight on him
When the Germans pass, he sets off again
,   - Dark
Szpilman crawls into a corner, rests
He's exhausted
He tries to take stock of his surroundings
He can make out the operating table
He manages to drag himself on to it
He lies there, his eyes grow heavy
He sleeps
- German soldiers dragging the corpses into a pile
sergeant douses the bodies in petrol, then sets them alight
The bodies burn
/
- '  - From a shattered window on the first floor, he looks at the burning bodies
Two German soldiers wander into his eyeline
He draws back a little but watches them warily
They sit just beneath him, chatting, and take out their food-tins, drink coffee and eat bread
,   - Szpilman wanders down the passage, sees into the wards, the empty beds, the broken furniture and medical equipment
,   - Szpilman opens cupboards, drawers, searching, but trying to be as quiet as possible
He sees the refrigerator, quickly gets to it, pulls open the door
Empty
He looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade and a box of sand next to it
The bucket is full of water, covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies
He drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the flies and, while he's doing so, he spots a couple of sacks
He opens the first: potatoes
The second contains barley
He tries to eat the uncooked barley but can't
Later: fire on the floor
Szpilman holds a saucepan over it and is cooking the barley and some potatoes
He manages to scoop out a spoonful, blows to cool it, then eats
/
- '  - Szpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground
And at the end of the street, a line of Poles, some with their hands in the air, others with hands on heads, being marched away by German soldiers
-
Szpilman lies in bed under several layers of blankets
Ice on the windows
He hears German voices shouting commands
He sits up
/
, '  - Szpilman gets to a window and looks out
German soldiers with flame-throwers are burning the buildings opposite
One soldier, with a bucket of white paint and a brush, numbers the building
Szpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street, then cross over and start on the buildings on his side, working their way towards the hospital
He pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital
- Szpilman goes to a window, jumps out
He twists his ankle
He's in pain
He crawls across the back garden and climbs over the wall
- Devastation, not a human being in sight
Nothing
Emptiness
He is alone
Szpilman hobbles away
- Cautiously, Szpilman limps towards the villa, a once grand building, but now partly damaged by shell fire
He makes his way in
,   - Szpilman enters the hall, still showing signs of its former opulence
Silent
Ominous
He looks round anxiously, then sees the stairs leading down to the basement
He hurries towards them and descends
,   - Dark, shadowy
Szpilman comes down a flight of wooden stairs that had directly into the kitchen
Immediately, he begins to search fractically, opening cupboards, drawers
He finds a can with a label illustrating pickled cucumbers
Desperately, he searches for something to open it with
He discovers a pair of scales with a variety of weights
He seizes one of the weights when, very close, he hears the sound of a car coming to a halt, then the car door slam, a German voice giving commands
He drops the weight but, holding the tin, he scampers up the stairs
,   - Szpilman, clutching the unopened tin, makes his way up the narrow, wooden staircase
,   - Szpilman, panting heavily, reaches the top floor
He sees a small door, tries it
It opens
,   - Szpilman enters, closing the small door behind him
He leans back, resting, recovering
And then he hears from down below a piano playing a Beethoven piece
After a few bars, the music stops
Szpilman listens anxiously
Silence
He looks around, finding himself in an attic space filled with junk, a ladder, rotting material, travelling trunks
Last light of day filtering through a dormer window
There's a ladder leading up to a trapdoor
Szpilman climbs the ladder
He crawls into a small empty space
With enormous effort he pulls up the ladder and closes the trapdoor
Exhausted and trying to catch his breath, he gazes at the unopened tin
He peers through the darkness but sees nothing
His eyes begin to droop
- Artillery fire
Fires glow on the horizon
,   - Szpilman wakes suddenly
He listens
Silence but for the distant gunfire
He sees the unopened tin of pickles, stares at it
He opens the trapdoor
,   - Szpilman, a shadow, a spectre, creeps down the stairs
,   - Szpilman has placed the tin and the weight on a shelf and is engrossed in searching again
He finds a pair of chicken scissors
Using the weight, he starts to hammer the point of the scissors into the tin making a perforation round the rim
The tin slips off the shelf and rolls across the floor coming to rest at a pair of highly polished jackboots
Szpilman stifles a gasp
On the stairs, in silhouette, gazing down at him, the figure of a  , the thumb of one hand caught in his belt above his pistol
(stern) Who the hell are you
Szpilman just stares at him
Who are you
No response
What the hell are you doing
(barely audible, in German) was
was trying to open this tin
Where do you live
No response
What's your work
am
was a pianist
pianist
He studies Szpilman for a moment, then with a nod orders him to follow
Szpilman picks up the tin and follows
,   - Szpilman follows the German Captain through a double door, hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in the centre, what once was the dining room
And then through another set of doors
The German Captain's boots echo
They come into a spacious room
Faint moonlight filters through the large windows
Fallen masonry and broken glass
couple of chairs
And a grand piano in the corner
The German Captain points at the piano
Play
Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid
He turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits
The German Captain stands and watches
Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays Chopin
The German Captain listens, expressionless
The pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man
Szpilman finishes playing
Silence
Somewhere, a cat mews
Distant burst of rifle fire
The German Captain stares at Szpilman
After a moment: Are you hiding here
Szpilman nods
Jew
Long pause
Szpilman just stares at him
Where are you hiding
(in German) In the attic
Show me
Szpilman hesitates, takes the tin and then shuffles past the German Captain towards the door
,   - Szpilman and the German Captain enter
The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder in place, leading up to the loft
Szpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him
Have you anything to eat
Szpilman shows him the tin
'll bring you something
He goes quickly, leaving Szpilman in darkness
Szpilman, overcome by relief, can barely catch his breath
- The German Captain strides out of the villa, down the front steps to a waiting car and a driver
He gets into the car
The driver starts the engine and the car speeds off into the night
- Szpilman hears the car's engine growing fainter
He starts to tremble and then begins to cry
He weeps uncontrollably
, ,   - Much activity: officers coming and going, orderlies typing
Officers king on field telephones
Desks, filing cabinets
The German Captain, carrying a bulging shoulder bag, marches into a room just off the hall and goes to his desk just as an orderly drops papers in his in-tray
On the desk, there's a framed photograph of him nth a woman and two children
German Captain glances at the papers, takes a pen, initials one or two and then goes
: The German Captain marches up the stairs purposefully, as if he's on urgent business
- The German Captain enters
He puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles
Open up
After a moment, the trapdoor shifts and Szpilman looks down
The German Captain takes a package from his shoulder bag and throws it up into the loft
He turns to go
Please
The German Captain stops
What's all that gunfire
The Russians
On the other side of the river
(Turns to leave, stops; with a touch of irony:) All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks
He goes quickly
Szpilman opens the package, finds bread and marmalade
Then he finds a tin-opener
- Snow
The sound of distant gunfire
The Germans are evacuating the villa
Men carry out boxes, filing cabinets, desks, papers and load them into trucks
They're careless, leaving a trail of debris
No sentries now
,   - Szpilman, listening and shivering with cold
He hears the whistle
He opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain in the attic, carrying a package
Come down
Szpilman descends
What's happening
We're getting out
Szpilman faces the German Captain
(in German) Are the Russians here
Not yet
He hands Szpilman the package
Szpilman opens it to find inside several loaves of bread
don't know how to thank you
Don't thank me
Thank God
It's His will that we should survive
Well
That's what we have to believe
Silence
Szpilman shivers with cold
The German Captain takes off his coat and gives it to him
What about you
've got another one
Warmer
(brief pause) What will you do when it's all over
'll play the piano again
On Polish radio
Tell me your name
'll listen out for you
Szpilman
Szpilman
(a crooked smile) Good name for a pianist
- Freezing weather
Empty streets
Then the sound of recorded music, as a car, with a loudspeaker and a Polish national flag, comes into view, the Polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker
- Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he recognises
He's astonished, puzzled
He comes to a decision and starts to leave
/
,   - Cautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots down the staircase into the empty hall
He goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously goes out
- Szpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly
German army
Polish soil liberated
Official
His excitement grows and he walks out into the street
He sees at one end soldiers serving soup from afield kitchen to a group of people
On the opposite side of the street, he sees a man and a woman who have left the field kitchen
The man carries a two-tiered canister
Szpilman rushes towards them, grabs hold of the man and tries to kiss him
The man, totally bewildered, tries to fight him off
The woman is terrified
German
German
She runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen
So does the man
Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him
Szpilman runs, the firing continuing
- Szpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building
He peers out to see Polish soldiers beginning to surround the ruined building, firing shots, lobbing in a grenade or two
(shouting) Stop, for God's sake,  beg you, 'm Polish
More shots and another grenade explosion
Don't shoot
'm Polish
The Polish soldiers: Two of the officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts
1ST He's Polish
2ND (yelling) Come out with your hands up
(obeying) Don't shoot
'm Polish
Please, please
'm Polish
1ST Yes, he's Polish
2ND (as Szpilman approaches') Why the fucking coat
'm cold
The Polish officers confer briefly in whispers
Then: 2ND Take him to headquarters
And they march him off
- Spring
Idyllic
column of men and women stretching along the length of the lane
couple of horse-and-carts
One or two bicycles
Some of the people wear concentration camp garb, others in tattered clothing
Four men walk together and when they come to a narrow junction, stop, seeing something Behind barbed wire, German prisoners of war, guarded by Russian soldiers
Desolate place
No shelters, no tents
The POWs sit or lie on the ground, silent, broken, shattered
The four men gaze at them
: 1ST Look at them - bastards
2ND German fuckers
3RD prayed for this, never thought 'd see it
The fourth man,  , approaches the barbed wire
Murderers
Assassins
Look at you now
You took everything  had
Me, a musician
(wagging his finger fiercely) You took my violin
You took my soul
He stands glowering at them, then sees a  rise from a group, wretched, shabby, unshaven
It's the German Captain, uniform tattered, a wreck
He comes to the barbed wire
(urgent) (in German) Do you happen to know another musician, a Mr Szpilman
pianist
Polish radio
Yes, of course,  know Szpilman
(desperate) helped Mr Szpilman when he was in hiding
Tell him 'm here
Ask him to help me
, inside the compound, approaches, grabs hold of the German Captain
(to Lednicki, in Russian) Hey
No talking to the prisoners
Get away from there
He drags the German Captain away from the wire
(as he backs away, calling) What's your name
The German Captain is being bundled away by the guard, who aims a kick at him
The German Captain shouts out his name but it's unintelligible
What
The German Captain and the guard have disappeared
Lednicki stands for a moment, then turns and goes
,    - Szpilman playing the piano
He looks something like his former self, fairly well dressed and groomed
He glances towards the glass booth and sees Lednicki with the technicians
He smiles
Lednicki nods, smiles back
- Szpilman and Lednicki looking around an empty field
It was here, 'm certain of it
It's not here now
shouted abuse at them, 'm not proud of it, but that's what did, and, 'm certain,  stood where you are now
There was barbed wire, and this German came up to me
You didn't catch his name
No
'll ask at the factory
They may know something
Lednicki goes
Szpilman stands, looking around the empty field
He is filled with sadness
He sits
He closes his eyes and put his face to the sun
: --   1952
6  2OOO
-
- Szpilman plays Chopin's Piano Concerto No 1 with full orchestra and conductor
He plays superbly
The music is glorious
