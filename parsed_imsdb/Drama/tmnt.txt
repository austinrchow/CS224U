The men part as we see- -
bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks up between them
Pantera leans down, face to face with her
We appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village

-  tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe distance
The Woman's  runs forward

Pantera sits in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the food
The Jungle looms ominous around them

Slams on the brakes
Pantera is thrown around
Idiota
Watch where you're going
There's a log on the road, senor

Well, what are you waiting for

Pantera and Driver look to the ground
- Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor

Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs  into the jungle

Suddenly- -a     open in the blackness behind him
n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end of a flurry of fist and foot attacks
His attacker is moving way too fast for the camera to keep up
Pantera falls back, panting heavily

) Actually
it's "Turtle", pal
Pantera swings around
Eyes wide

Muscular and strong
Further up
Arms to match
Rough skin
It wears a shorn
Inside are two white eyes and gritted smiling teeth
The poncho falls to the ground

Beaten blue bandana blowing in the breeze

Suddenly - - the sound of the  begins to rumble in the distance
The villagers panic and scatter
The Jeep flies out of the jungle and bounce-slows into the
Only there is no one driving it
and it still has the stolen food in it
And the stolen medallion dangles from the rear view mirror
It's a miracle
The village rejoices
The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks back at the Jungle
Something catches his eye
a small crouched figure on a tree branch
Barely silhouetted
His white eyes lit in the darkness
One of them as the boy smiles

softly) The Ghost of the Jungle

He takes out his katanas and lays them carefully on the ground

Shoes belong to a panicked , early 20's, as clamor after him
The Mugger is a jackrabbit - hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and doing anything he can to avoid arrest
ventually the  peter out
The mugger looks back
Smiles
Heh, heh
suckers
- His eyes suddenly go wide as -
- we see a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads, aiming directly for Mugger
Whaaa
The Mugger runs, but can't escape
The Driver is dressed in all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet
Scary and faceless
He quickly gains on the Mugger and  him by the collar in mid-stride
You crazy
Put me down, man
But Driver doesn't
Instead, he holds him lower without stopping the bike
and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue
' -
Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole
Driver veers left
He drags the Mugger into

Mugger down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage like he's a human bowling ball
- The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley
And then he stops
Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates
Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you
The Driver gets off the bike
Silence
Backlit by headlight
He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose
Mugger starts to really freak out
Driver picks him up by the collar and him to the back
-p-please
Don't kill me, man
Driver just cocks his head
Mugger can see his own terrified reflection his Driver's black visor
Driver reaches behind his back and pulls out a
He reels back and
Wh-wha-wha-   -

Driver doesn't notice as - --

It sticks in the '
- His grinning eyes suddenly   as Driver slowly turns around,
The Mugger is trapped as Driver moves toward him
and a   drops to his side

An  Police Siren chirps
- The police suddenly show up, cherries flashing
They run to , mouths drop

Purse hangs from his neck
He'll live, but never commit another crime again

Mikey's eyes continue to panic

we see a fake  spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron
In his hands, he holds two nerf-styled
(from inside mascot head) Okay - waita----
Suddenly         run in  and start beating on Mikey
a little too hard
Get him

You suck

You'll love their kids too

can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here
- They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a toddler street gang
One of the kids does a finger-point-then- throat-slit gesture
The mom looks and beams
The kids quickly smile to cover
(through gritted teeth) Such
angels
Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack of   through the fake head
Okay
Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga Carl

He   the fake zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head
His trademark orange bandana spills out
He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air
quiet beat until -    approaches, faint, in the distance
Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car whizzes by

Don monitors from a small dashboard cam
Man looks Left
Reacts
- We see Mikey beside him in the van
He's behind the wheel - face  in a goofy  like a ventriloquist to "hide" his identity
Don follows on a small surveillance cam under the rearview mirror
Yes
sir
(
) That's a good boy
All's 'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if  did one of these gigs every now and again
(
) But you add such
panache to the character
Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode
He rubs his sore neck
Well, if panache is French for "punching bag", 'd have to agree with ya

Don is jacked into every major security and surveillance camera in the city

- The Man is still looking - only now really freaked out - at the fully animated Mikey head
Aw nuts
Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight , frozen
He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly waves back
(ventriloquist style) Just get me outta here, dude
- He hits some switches
Monitors change
Traffic's clear eastbound for two blocks
Then hook up with route
- He's still waving with a frozen smile
(ventriloquist style) Righteous
Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and antics at the Man
Before the man can react, Mikey and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street
as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering along with his gaining speed

) You  to install the music too

) All part of the cover, my friend

dummy gate closes behind it, obscuring it from view

It slowly slides shut

But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training
He jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles with all four limbs

Atop entrance stairs

Furniture is jury-rigged and the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of atmosphere
If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair
Donatello runs up to Mikey
Mikey robotically hands him the wad of money from the party
Moneymoneymoneymoney
As Donnie walks away, Mikey
Don stops as Mikey holds out his hand
Don's busted - he peels off a few bills and hands Mikey his share
Domo arigato, dude
Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa
Hits a remote as a   lights up in front of him
Suddenly- (
) Mikey springs from the couch
Snaps to obedience
Yes, sensei

He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has the same sparkle in his eye
He approaches Mikey
Silent

Sensei

Here ya go, Master Splinter
Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece of
Splinter lights up
Ahh
Butter creme frosting
Donatello walks to Splinter
Holds his hand out, judgmental
Master
No cake
You remember your last cholesterol tests
But - (changes attitude) -Donatello
am your Master
Nice try, sensei
But you can still be my Master
with low cholesterol
Splinter surrenders the cake
As Don walks away, Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes Splinter a smaller wrapped piece
He-heh
You have done well, my son
Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it -  with dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers
He tosses it with the rest : - 22                                                                22 The street noise below is barely audible

April's disappointed
Same old Casey

Casey knows he's busted
missed you
April doesn't answer
She closes the phone
Casey slumps in his chair, shaking his head
Good goin', Case
Back at the dock, April is back to business

Get this on the truck for delivery
Let's go

He stands up and walks to '
He opens it
It takes only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open

Tinkering as always
Wild inventions line the walls, some finished, some not
Some pay tribute to past  adventures
Don, y'ever feel like you were meant for more
To  more
Like, mean, sometimes  feel like

(cont'd) like we never really left that glass turtle bowl when we were little dudes

He flips up side panels, blares out
Oh, hi Mikey
You say something
(sighs - to himself) Every day it's the same thing
Wake up
Birthday party gig
Drive home

Isn't it great

Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the He and the camera think he's alone, but before he knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged, still, and sipping tea
Michaelangelo
Boredom is never an indicator of your surroundings
It is a reflection of your inner heart
Fill yourself with excitement on the inside
and you'll live the most rewarding life of all
Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan

Then returns to flipping channels
He stops on a  program - " "
(
) And so yet again, police officials are baffled at a crime of retribution that can only be attributed to the mysterious figure known as "The Nightwatcher"
ikey lights up
On  is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing Beside him is a news photo of the tied up from our second scene
This is the latest in a string of vigilante acts that have been plaguing the city for the past year
() 18
(cont'd) Although the victims have been criminals themselves, the Nightwatcher's actions have been identified as destructive and overly-violent
verging on the edge of lethal
- Can't smile wide enough
He runs to his room, returns with a
He snaps a picture of the
He pulls it out, placing it in his  , overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the vigilante
Now ' what 'm talking about
Cruising the streets, busting those who hold themselves above the law
(movie announcer voice) But they aren't above
Don walks in, holding an in-process invention
He looks up
Mikey, the man's practically a criminal himself
Anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law cannot be legislated and needs to be reigned in
(
) Sounds like four turtles  used ta know
- Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where in sight
Whatta we talkin' about, boys
Soundin' a little too egghead fer my tastes
Ah, Raphael
Your brothers and were just discussing the vigilante Nightwatcher once again
(beat - concerned) Where have you been
You've been spending so much time away from home lately
Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already
His attention doesn't break from Donatello
joined a book a' the month club
(to Donnie) So just what's your beef with puttin' dirtbags behind bars, Donnie
Go ahead
enlighten me
19
Splinter watches the growing tension with concern
have no problem with the incarceration of those who deserve it, but if someone like Nightwatcher has ultimate power
then who makes sure he doesn't cross the line
Mikey picks up two   , twirling them around aggressively in mock battle
think he's
Of course you would
(in bg, oblivious) Keeya
Sometimes there are lines that even the police can't cross
Someone has to be willing to do what needs to be done
And to do that, fear becomes a weapon
You are such a Neanderthal
Raphael does the bully   at Don
Don reacts quick and startled, eyes wide
rest my case
() Raphael
If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with
(gritted teeth) Yes, sensei
(to Mikey) And quit touchin' my stuff
Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the second floor
20
(too-late-retort to Raph) That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of fear
Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above
Enters his room, slams the door and immediately
and it's some annoying pop - song

) ,
Then   starts playing to drown out his family silence sits in the room as a  flies out of Raph's room
Tense in the room for a bit

The big screen  is the only light source

The place feels different

Splinter is still awake
Expecting him
Kneeling on the floor
Very serious

Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter

That you are, my son
You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life

plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an
Leo is touched

jealous
've missed you, Leonardo

've missed you too, father
'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left
But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking
The family needs you
- He swallows that big pill very hard
Heh
Yeah
mean, yes sensei
(to doorway) Raphael, your brother is home
22
- Raphael walks out of the shadows
He's good
but not too good for Splinter
Splinter and Leo break and face the doorway
An awkward silence
Hey
Hey
Raphael eyes Leo
and then the medallion
So
congratulations
Thanks

Leo's home
Donatello wakes up, looks around
when he sees Leo

Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper snout
Really groggy
But  don't  pop out of the birthday cake, Mrs

You can let go now

Steel, screaming, trampling, and rumbling

We go  as we take in the ostentatious bedroom of  , a young mid-40's
Famous  entrepreneur
inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every sense
His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes, decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal
This guy is filled with adrenaline, power and machismo
(
) Mr
Winters, sir
- Standing there is a beautiful black-haired assistant dressed in full suit and tie with a clipboard
It's time for your morning workout
31                                                                31 Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and others), floor routines and bag work
He takes it all very seriously
Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung training block with his bare fist
He walks out of the room, grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant

His office is large and austere
Two levels of history in books, artifacts, warrior themed curios and power

(
) Mr
Winters, sir
- His Assistant stands at the large doors
The board is waiting
Excellent
He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city

Tell them 'm on my way down
He slowly
- Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up and down the front of the building, allowing him access to any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk
- see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish gated entry
true work of modern architecture

The ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the man and his company
inters' Elevator Office lowers into a balcony level building overseeing the main lobby
He walks down a stairwell and through the lobby, five Assistants following him

As he passes Mikey's room, his brother pops out with his skateboard
We follow them as they walk down to the  area
Leo
what's up, bro
Just enjoying being home
hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as -
- something explodes and smoke pours out under his door
(
) Mikey and Leo , leave the smokey area
Say, what's up with April and Casey
expected them to drop by after  got back
We don't see much of `em anymore
April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, dunno, "different" lately
Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together
They're living together now
They get to the living room area
Mikey walks to the edge of a jury-rigged - he built in an old water slough
Mikey continues as he skates back and forth
To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around
Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing
26
Dunno
Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost
"Nightwatcher"
That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey
walks in
Picks up Mikey's scrapbook as he passes the sofa and slugs it in Leo's chest
This should explain most of it
The legacy of the city's newest hero
Compliments of the fanboy over there Joke all you want, Raphy
But train hard and eat your veggies and one day, you too can be as cool as The Nightwatcher, dude
can only hope, Mikey
can only hope
Leo disapprovingly flips through the book
This guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up
Showboating isn't a replacement for justice
it's just self-indulgence
(looks back at book) Someone needs to talk to this thug
- He looks
dying to say something
But can't

Eyes blink behind it

The mask is pushed aside by Casey - Kid 1 was holding it
Nah, you know  work for a livin'
It's Star Center or nothin' else

Chubbier 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself

Let's get it on
They begin a boisterous round of hockey
Trash talk, gentle checking and all the requisite boy things
We see that the kids love Casey
And vice versa

Looks at the disappointed boys
Sorry dudes
Busted
Have fun with your mommy

She's dangling a   and a  from her other hand
Aw, c'mon April
We just started
April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock
Casey knows he can't win
2 Can't Casey stay and play for just five more minutes, Miss 'Neil
Pleeeeeeease
Not today, Nate
Mister Jones has to pretend to be an adult for a few hours
Awwwww
Man
Baaah
Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin
Later boys

April and Casey as they walk down the street
April's not really a hard-ass - she's just forced to be the "responsible one" in the relationship

(Arnold voice) Do you need my funtahstick muscles

yeah
Casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam rests and they walk into the distance
He pulls it back down

April struts in, owning the place
Casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the behind them

Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and April and Casey spill in
Miss 'Neil
You are a vision
Thirty days in a jungle, and beautiful as ever
He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her
Casey's eyes widen - is  what his girlfriend does

Actually, It's Ca- (ignoring, back to April) So how was your trip
You know, the typical - corrupt government officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a heart-pounding chase
Winters and April chuckle
Cam adjusts to show Casey between them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place
But it was all worth it

Winters , way too excited as well
April holds out her hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants

Oh
He hands it to April as she twirls up a - and cracks open the front panel
- The light gradually breaks in, until - - the front panel falls to the floor
- Winters' look
Pure wonder and admiration
He walks up to it slowly
April and Casey cautiously stay back
() the gods be praised
- We finally see the statue -   - a seven- foot towering wall of granite and obsidian
Eagle warrior armor reflecting a South American design
though not from a specific time period
Winters rubs his hand over the stone

Can  ask you a question
(not looking away) es
Of course
've been so grateful for the opportunities you've given me lately
'd probably be still selling antique curios if you hadn't visited my shop that day
(off of box) But  have to ask
why the fascination with these particular works of art
'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we met

Camera dollies around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing figure
His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits
Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed
Detail is hinted at instead of shown
Very stylized
(
) It was a time long before the Mayans, April
Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs
It was a time of legends
time of greatness
The true mother culture of Central America
Cool shots of Yaotl
His armor, his stance, etc
(
) There was a man named Yaotl
More a force of nature than man
And together with his Four Warrior- Priest Generals, they pillaged every culture in their path
The walk along side Yoatl
Possibly slo-mo
We will come to recognize them through their distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form
(
) And for every culture they destroyed, they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them
() 31
(cont'd) They became a warring hurricane, gathering more power and knowledge with each conquest
- Of five Warriors
High atop a hillside, finally stopped
Ready for battle
Their character-specific weapons are drawn
Around them is a small army of

An army of
Waving their weapons in the air
The opposing army
Yaotl's men pull out   a large - a "stargate" of sorts
Yaotl   and his men are unmoving
as they begin a ceremony
Yaotl   looks to the heavens above - as we see a       move into place
(
) As the army approached, Yaotl used the knowledge they'd gained in black magic and sorcery
Timing their attack with the alignment of the Stars of Kikin, they opened a portal to another world
- they stop dead in their tracks
Front-lit by the  portal
Don't know what to expect - -  crackling electric circle opens to another dimension
Suddenly -
Creatures of all varieties
Gnashing Fangs
Swiping claws
(
) They unleashed an army of monsters
- men getting slaughtered (in a nice  sort of way)
Quick shots
Intense
(
) The monsters knew no side   - they destroyed the enemy
as   well as Yaotl's own army
Men who   swore to spill their blood for his   cause
Yaotl had to do something   to stop more from coming through
inters  the portal, stopping the slew of monsters from pouring out
End on a scream
Dissolve to  in the battle

Desolate, destroyed battlefield
Smoldering
Bodies everywhere
No monsters
End pan on Yaotl on his knees
(
) In the end, there were no victors
And they were responsible for the eradication of the greatest culture that will never be known
The knowledge that was lost would never be found again
' Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his hand
line of  hangs from his mouth
April is fascinated by the story
She nudges Casey who does the slurp/half-snore wake up
("wake up" fast speak) was just resting my eyes
Quite the story, Max
concerned re: Statue) You don't think that this could be- Oh no, Miss 'Neil

And what do you do with it

The  slinks forward - clearly a woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask over her face
he takes it off, revealing  - the beautiful leader of the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three,
Your talents are commendable
As are yours
Most don't notice us until we decide they will
34
Well,  guess 'm just special that way
Winters walks over to his desk
The Statue looms behind them
So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed
must confess
still don't know exactly what we are to do for you
need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to
monitor the city for me over the next few days

As he passes a , he hears a low  come from it
He stops
- As the man looks in
Can't see a thing
Hand-held cam
He moves to leave
and the growl comes again
- Man stares in
No one on the street
Looks closer
closer

The requisite  jumps out of the shadows
Scares Man half to death

He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off

large burly   slams out of the shadows onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley
Quick caterwaul

further through the asphalt, then quickly hooks up with an air duct pipe
Zips faster and faster until we're in- 45                                                                45 - Leo feverishly works out

Dark and mysterious

Feels ceremonial

Readying to run a gauntlet of rooftop hazards
They spy a  off in the distance First one to touch old faithful over there- -does the other team's chores for a week
Leo and Raph glare at each other
/ Deal
'm with Leo
Actually,  think you and  should pair up, Mikey
You kiddin' me
mean, no offense Donnie, but you ain't exactly the biggest hitter on the bench
37
Don is grinning
Observing the subtle tension
Just trust me on this one
Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on buildings
The course requires them to work as a , throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle to obstacle
Leo accidentally slips,  Raph face-first into a brick wall
Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a billboard
The situation escalates at each juncture
Have you been avoiding me
Barely seen you since  got home
been busy
() see
So
you're definitely not upset at me or anything, right
Why'd you think that
don't know
your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home
Might upset me too
Are you trying to make me mad
'm just saying, 'd understand if you were upset
Their intensity
You wouldn't understand the first thing about me, daddy's boy -
hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball
They stop rolling, continue fighting
Is that what this is about
You think Splinter likes me best
You'd love that, wouldn't you

- Don and Mikey are already sitting there
So nice of you to join us, gentledudes
And by the way,  prefer the classic military corner tuck for my bedsheets
ikey and Don high five
Leo and Raph aren't amused
They stare down
Raph does his   fake-lunge
only Leo doesn't twitch
Suddenly- (
) Whoa
Whawazzat
The others rush over to the edge with Mikey
You dudes see that up there
- We see   moving with in a large - The movement is coming from one of the higher floors
So what now, captain
We need to come up with a plan
Later
Raph   toward the action
But Raph doesn't stop
All three look at each other
Then- Welcome home

They stand on a scaffold underneath the floor of the activity
- Deep   are carved into the steel, much like by April and Casey's loft
Don notices
Guys, 've got a bad feeling
39
Ahh, let's take a tiny peek
They scale to the top floor
Peering over the edge
Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya
from Turtles to activity on the floor
Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em
- Showing    and squaring off against a  -
It tosses them around like stuffed animals
(
) Bad news is 's kickin' the snot out of `em
- As they've all now crept up to the dark corner of the floor
gets clobbered and sails past them, and off the building
(safely to a scaffold below) An interesting conundrum
Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past
vote for sitting back and enjoying the show
(to Leo) Whaddaya say, leader boy
- He's troubled
The burden of "leader" shouldered
Nah
We kick butt
Raph jumps forward
Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles jump into the fray
The Foot are surprised at first, and the Bigfoot Monster is confused as well
- He stops when he comes face to face with Karai
Who are
- She pauses a moment
They exchange expert katana attacks
Stalemate
She gestures to the Foot as they use this opportunity for their escape
As they leap away, Karai looks back at the Turtles
40
The Creature immediately  the boys throughout the structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it, not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below
aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature
The boys have no choice but to help him
putting them in deeper trouble
The -Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact
The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many flights of floors
Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom floor to await the others
They fall into Raph's floor
Nice of ya's ta join me
But the Turtles eventually get cornered
And just as the Creature closes in- The creature stops
Confused
So are the other three turtles
What
saw it on a nature show once
The creature
Boys freak out
- As a large teetering pallet filled with dried cement and blocks to come
The Turtles are buried under the rubble
- The Creature is confused
until it's hit with a blinding light, and then an  -
We hear heavy footsteps thumping through the light
Shapes start to form until we see
Sporting - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings
Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through their stone cracks and piercing eyes
The Generals are all - - Mute and powerful Ape- themed costume (""), Eagle Leader (""), agile Jaguar ("") and the deadly snake-like female ("")
Large
Imposing
Completely bad-ass
The Creature  and  to no avail
41
- Silent
The Turtles start to , regaining consciousness
Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and stand up, groggy
- Through the smoke we can see silhouettes - a large hairy shape, along with
The sounds of freighter doors , engines revving and then a caravan of sorts pulling away
-    chirps
Approaching the now- destroyed site
Better hit the tunnels, guys
Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a
Don, Mike and Leo jump in
Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing
Raph
Save it for another day
() Raph knows he has to go
Reluctantly he enters the sewer
The lid closes as the alley is illuminated by
beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek
(
) 'know, it's not that bad, dudes
- Actually, the place is destroyed
Dented, torn and looking like a post-night raid in

Dimly lit
High ceiling
few odd silhouettes here and there
We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters
What seems to be the problem
Karai and six Ninja are already there
The "problem" is that we were hired to merely patrol the city and report anything "strange" to you
() 42
(cont'd) (grabs sword hilt) You never said anything about Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take the lion
He reaches to a satchel on the floor
The Foot in anticipation
Instead
Winters comes up with a (tosses money brick) So, your job duties were just redefined
Congratulations on your promotion
- Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid- air
Winters  and looks back over his shoulder
We may be hired help to you, but you should never forget
we are the Foot Clan
- Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'
Oooooooh
It sets the Foot off
They all grab their weapons, moving toward Winters
Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at Winters throat
as Winters stands still
and begins to
Slowly, the thumping of     lumber out of the shadows
Reveal themselves to be
They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of it all
The Foot Ninja leap back
Winters remains confident and unmoving
Generals  at Karai and the Foot
believe we made a deal, Karai expect you to honor it
(beat, stares her down) You do understand "honor", don't you
Karai stews
unblinking stare
Of course she does
So  don't care what part of "muscle for hire" you don't understand
hired your muscle
Now exercise the ones attached to your feet and
(closer - terse) get back to work
43
Karai slowly steps back
Winters smiles wide, reaches into the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to a Foot Ninja
Then another to a second Ninja
So  will double
no, no
your pay for your troubles
(stare down) Are we cool
- They just stare back, blank goggles
Probably seething inside
Winters is flanked by Generals
Are we
cool
The Foot don't move
Tense
Karai finally nods
Terse
Ninjas
No sense of humor
(to Generals) So how did we fare
- a hunched  undulating in chains is wheeled into the light
Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit pallet on the floor
We can barely make it out as being the from the -beam fight
(close, quiet) So it begins
It
Fights it's restraints
Tires
Breathing heavily
Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw
Creature suddenly lunges forward
Winters doesn't flinch
He merely grins at the creature
(to General Aguila) Were there any problems
speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice
He towers over Winters by a foot
Clearly the leader of the four
None, my lord
(to Karai) You see, now ' a good soldier
You two should compare notes
Karai and Aguila stare at each other
Karai obviously not used to being handled like this
44
Just what is this all about
Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt
(re: Generals) now have the power and know-how, but  need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own
Not to mention an organization that values discretion
But of course
You see,  have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon
Thirteen in all, to be exact
The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the floor ahead - into a  on the floor
- We see the top of a  inserted over top, creating a cell
But
why
Why here
Why now
Instinct, mostly
They're animals at their core
(looks off, distant) And they recognize something familiar in the air
in the stars
() What can  say
'm a lover of animals
The disk
we see that there are already some cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor
Filled by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad we don't fully see
Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness
So you go and get to know each other
And don't forget
play nice
The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door
They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand
Not now
Our business will be handled at a later time
45
After they leave, we pause for   on Winters
Quiet
Tired
Contemplative

Mikey comes in, looking the worst of all, and plops into his seat
Cam circles table
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night
Oi, my head
Don pours over a thick book on
Was it just me, or did that creature look familiar
We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner
Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first place
Well,  suppose that we shoulda let Mr
Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city
oh wait '
Good call, fearless leader
Come to think of it, it  pretty strange to see the Foot too
And who was that woman
dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money
(still fighting with Raph) This is my fault now, Raph
'm the only one who has to be responsible
Hey, you're the "trained master", not me
46
(quickly interjected) Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter
- Splinter walks in,  to himself
Good morning, my sons
Morning, sensei
Splinter makes himself a
Room is
- Raph and Leo  at one another while they eat
Don is pouring over a   while Mikey sits with his forehead on the table
If anyone needs me, 'll be watching my stories
plinter walks out
sound of the  being turned on
At the table, the glare continues
Hothead
Splinter-junior
(
) And in the latest of a string of strange criminal activity, a construction site was nearly destroyed last night
Authorities believe a violent battle had taken place earlier that evening
The boys react and rush into the
- a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the - In the daylight, we can see the building is twisted and dented from the night's fighting
The boys immediately
Mikey grabs the remote and ups the volume
My sons, what- Splinter's eyes go wide
He looks at his boys listening to the  intently
Mikey nurses his sore head
believe you boys have some explaining to do
47
Splinter looks at the Turtles
Busted, as we- - : 52                                                                  52 '  - The Turtles are kneeling before their sensei
Leonardo,  am most disappointed in you
You are the leader of your brothers
was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family
But Master Splinter, how can  be expected to do so when Ra- There are no excuses when you are the Leader, my student
- Biting his tongue
Hard
But the involvement of the Foot and their mysterious leader worries me
'm personally worried about a monster running around the streets of New York
But hey, that's just me
Don elbows Mikey back in line
We hafta go out and find who's responsible for this
There ain't no other solution
Raphael, there are better ways to use your skills in ninjitsu
Fact- gathering
Analysis
Observation
Direct contact should only be your last resort
Wow, sounds
exciting
Save the brute vigilante junk for that Nightwing guy
48
/ "Nightwatcher"
Whatever
Raph stands and exits the room
The others stay silent as we- : - 53                                                                53 - Nightwatcher gearing up
ightwatcher emerges from a
Walks to a long- forgotten and shadowed underside of a
He points up with a  - chirp
Slowly, his  begins to lower on retractable grappling hooks
- Explodes out of a   and into the night
/ - 54                                                                54 Various shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city
On bike and on foot
Angry
Trying to work it out of his system
He's swallowed it all up to this point
getting harder
55                                                                55 Aggressive and driving music
Various shots of the Stone Generals capturing a laundry list of  that are coming into the city
See the tech, detail and precision that the Winters' operation works
Foot Ninja act as living "tracking devices" around the city
- The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in throughout rafters above
The Foot try to help by blocking exits
- The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high- speed subway tunnels
The Foot maneuver the subway car
- General Mono takes on a large scale -like monster -sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse
- Close calls, as humans come close to seeing the monsters
but rarely do
We see small house pets swiped away
Fleeting glimpses of limbs, claws and teeth in the shadows all over Meat trucks torn open and their contents "stolen"
- Intermix quick shots of Generals and collars clamping, cells locking, etc
49
- See more cells being filled in Winters Basement
3 : 56                                                                  56 '   - Quiet part of the neighborhood
Their lights are fully on
(
) You sure you don't want to spar a bit
'   - 57                                                                  57 April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor mats
She twirls a wooden  as part of a floor routine
Wow - she's actually pretty good
Casey eats a bag of chips with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other
Nah
Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um
you kinda scare me
Suit yourself
(she stops - a beat) Case
Yeah
() Are you happy
mean, with your life
With me
Casey pauses a beat
Tries to be upbeat
Yeah
Sure
(beat - serious) You
April thinks just as much
Yeah
They sit on that for a moment
Casey leans in for a kiss
April doesn't notice
Awkward
Casey changes his mind
(walks to the window) 'm going outside for some air
50
Casey slips out onto the fire escape
April knows better
(to herself) Be safe
8                                                                58 - Casey climbs up from the fire escape
Checks to make sure he's alone
He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out - and his
He slips it on
Does a few warm up swings
Cricks his neck
59                                                                59 - All is still, until the panicked face of a  enters frame
Being held by his collar
'
-- ' ' -
- the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back, tripping over an / duct
He tries to shield himself- -
- Nightwatcher lands in the
Funny how you jerks don't care about crossing the line `til someone else does it
all over yer
Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it
Raph's loving this
Walks to the Burglar and picks him up
(almost in tears) '
'
Boy, oh boy, did  pick the wrong night to be a criminal
Night cocks his fist just as- (
) Hey champ
You think you're being a little rough on the guy
ight slowly turns around
Menacing
Casey's taken aback
51
Are you that Nightwatcher fella
(beat - unimpressed) little smaller than  expected
(inside helmet) Case
No way
(poking Raph with bat) 'm talkin' to you, pal
You think you own these rooftops
Well, lemme teach you a thing'r two
(takes out bat) Class is Pain 101
Meet your instructor
Casey Jones
It's getting serious
Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by Night's , and pulled down
Raph's visor flips up
() You keep on playing with fire, little man, you might just get burnt
Raph
Is that you
(scans costume) What-what are you doing
) Are you pretending to be
- His eyes look around for an answer
Nothing
Why would you- (finally gets it) -oh
(a beat) So that would mean
(then  gets it) -
Raph smiles
the first genuine one he's had in a long time
Yep
- The Burglar tries to get away
Casey and Raph both spy him
Look at each other
Mischievously grin as we- : 52
60                                                                60 - - The panicked face of the Burglar
to show him hanging upside-down
he's bound by chains and dangling from a street lamp
- the two old friends sit perched on a high tower, surrounded by gargoyles
They blend right in
Both masks are off
dunno,  just got tired of the "nothing"
Sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths
Of us battling Utroms and Triceratons or any other friggin' creature
when there was still some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet above the lair
Just didn't seem right
`Specially if we had the means to do somethin' about it
Raph twirls a billy bat between his fingers
Stops
And we did
but turns out  was the only one who was willing to do it, tho
So  just saved up, bought and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted the costume and began moonlighting
) Papers called me "The Nightwatcher", so  went with it
"And a legend was born"
So what was your handle before that
kinda liked "The Midnight Marauder"
(makes an "eww" face) Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy
() The guys ever catch on
Pfft
You kiddin' me
Leo's been away for, like, forever
And the other two are so wrapped up in that party business they'd never notice
) So what about you
How's things with April
Haven't seen ya's since you two moved in together
53
They're good
guess
dunno, seems like all  do lately is just make her upset
She used to laugh so much
now it's mostly just working all day, and coming home to point out how 'm a screw up
(points to hockey mask) She doesn't like me doing this
And know she's pretending to not know 'm out tonight
But she knows
And she knows  know she knows
(looks out at city) Life just kinda got complicated suddenly
y'know
Yer tellin' me
Casey looks at his old bud
Raph
Yeah
Nice to see ya, man
Raph acknowledges
The moment is broken by a
/ What was that
They both spring to their feet and run to the back of the roof
They hear the scream  off in the distance
For old time's sake
What the shell
- He stops, mid-replacement of his helmet
() Bro
Seriously
61                                                               61 The two run and leap across the rooftops
Two vigilantes searching for the source of the scream
They finally reach a point where they don't hear it anymore
- They look out
Silent
54
think we lost it
It's gotta be around here somewhere
-  large -  flies up from the alley below and spreads its 30-foot wings
/ It's about to attack when - -- - it's drilled with   from below
- grappling hook winds around its feet
The Creature struggles but is pulled down hard
' ' ,
Did  mention we ran into a monster last week
, ,
They inch closer to the edge
Peek over
- See the Four Generals putting a pounding on the Creature
They subdue it with all their hardware
The Foot stand guard, helping in the
The freakin'
(looks to Generals) What about the walking statues
Were you going to mention
Nope
Those are a first for me too
(gets cocky) We can take `em
One of the generals effortlessly picks up a and wallops the Creature with one blow
On second thought
The Generals put the Creature in a cell
Wheel it to a as it drives away
They're just about to leave when- - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from the ledge
It falls down -
- on a garbage can lid
55
- they turn around
Look up
- He scans the two
Organic Earth-based
Witnesses
Aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun
Raph dives in front of Casey, taking the hit himself
(to Gato) Fetch
Gato  as the other three board a Transport Vehicle
Not good
Raph takes out    and throws them on the roof -
When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there alone
Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off too
You ever heard of smoke pellets
Hey - you're the ninja, not me
- Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase
They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level
- 2                                                                62 Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying to escape the thing that's close on their tail
,
Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign
Then he sees it - 56th Street
Bingo
Raphael quickly dashes left through
-    - We see Gato bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run, occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds
true jaguar
It leaps through the traffic as well
56
- Raph points up and -
- hits a remote that lowers his
What are we gonna do, Raph - (sees bike) -hey, cool ride
Hop on
Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust
but not for long
Gato clamors along
keeping up with the weaving bike
In the fray, Casey looses his mask
as it gets trampled by Gato
It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General
Suddenly -
circular   lands in his wooden bat
He looks at it
Um, Raph
Raph sees the blade
They manage to switch positions in mid- ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back
Raph throws kicks and punches at their pursuer when he closes in
The chase takes them to a   as they circle upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails
- They're trapped
He doesn't have a hope
aside from jumping the bike to the next roof
hisiscrazythisiscrazythisiscrazy
He lets out the clutch as they make the jump
- Sparks and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage
They both look back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure
,
(Gato leaves edge) '   ,
and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato
Oh crap
Casey guns it -    '   - as Gato is in mid-air, taking off
Casey grabs the weakening Raph and drags him off
57
63                                                                  63 - Gato lands and patrols the roof
almost  them out
Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack
Suddenly -
- Gato finds them
He tries to smash through the steel door with his bare hands
Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort
He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam by Gato
Casey tries to help as well
Gato comes close to breaking in
Very tense
Then- -the  on his exo-suit begins to
signal signal to return home
He surveys quickly
then runs off
Casey and Raph fall out
Both shell-shocked
Okay, so it was great seein' ya again, Raph
() Raph
- He's got a dart in his shoulder, obsidian disks stuck in his shell, and has collapsed unconscious
Gotta get you someplace safe, pal
And then, then  need to go buy some new undies
: '   - 64                                                                  64 April is finishing up with her workout
She hears the fire escape outside of the building and the window slide open
Casey,  think we need to talk
(turns around) don't want- whoa
- Casey is standing there, bracing the near- unconscious Raph, now without his Nightwatcher garb
Could use a little
help here
() Hey April
how ya been
58
Raph passes out as we- : 65                                                                 65 - Splinter and the other three are finishing up dinner
They close the pizza box
My compliments to zee chef
() Le brrrraaaaaaapp
Mikey walks to the fridge of leftover birthday cake
Anyone for dessert
(sick of cake) The phone suddenly rings
Don rushes over to the jury-rigged payphone on the wall
---- Cowabunga-dude
(face falls) Waita-slow down April
What happened to Raph
() We'll be right there
: '   - 66                                                                 66 - One by one, Leo, Don and Mikey slip into the window
They spot Raph on the futon, being tended to by April and Casey
Mikey looks around
Whoa
am in the wrong line of work
Nice pad, kids
Don immediately starts checking Raph out
His vital signs seem to be okay
(opens his eye) Pupil dilation is normal
Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away
59
() Get the
frig offa me
Temper is normal too
(to others) He's going to be fine
Health-wise, mean
Otherwise, he's still the same old Raph
() Whoa
'  - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back with a Tranquilizer Dart
Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk with pliers
- Disk
It's beautiful and deadly
Don examines
Some sort of stone
probably obsidian,  think
() There's an engraving on it
Looks
South American
Aztec
No
It's definitely not Mayan
April swallows hard
It can't be
What can't be, April
April sits down on the floor with the disk
Trying to figure things out
Casey leans down to her
Would it help things if  said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that Winters guy
- Her mouth is agape
'd say that's a big ten-four
() It's just a myth
a legend
() It can't be
60
And  suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge, huh
- She slowly turns to Casey
Floored
What are you talking about Casey
Just some story this Winters guy told us
It all started down in South America
Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons
Azteks and Mayans
That's what i said
Sit down, Jones
(to group) So there was this guy call Yaotl
- As it passes a  element, the screen dips to black
We hear sounds of a violent
Monsters shrieking
Blades clashing
April's retelling Winters' story
: Everyone is gathered around as April finishes
Mikey, in particular, is hunched over, intent
Casey, like before, has fallen asleep
Silence for a beat
Then- Well
No one knows
The legend stops there
) But it's just a legend
Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of April's
The micro-tech of this dart is astounding
The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets
not to mention it's current stock is going for a little more than two-grand an ounce right now
() 61
(cont'd) (looks up) What
dabble in the market
So what do we have
We have someone with a lot of money
Access to technology
and the means to produce it to exact specs
Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters
and them four stone jokers
If you ask me, it all somehow points to Winters Corp
How do you figure that, Donnie
Donatello looks up with   on
Sarcastic
Hello
"Genius"
(a beat) Well, that, and the fact that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it
Do you think he's trying to recreate the events from back then
Well, what would you do with an army of monsters
Well, aside from having your own wrestling league,  dunno Do bad guys still try to do that
Yes, however they're usually mortgage re-fi companies
() What about it, April
You just finished working with the guy, right
Does it make sense
Guys
It's a legend
62
Is that "legend" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us
Or "legend" like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n' Casey
Okay
Fine
'll help for now
until we prove you're all insane
Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art
'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues
say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person
Raph, that would be the worst idea yet
We hang back
Analyze
Formulate a plan,  storm your castle
Are we clear
Tense stare off between Raph and Leo
Raph moves anyway
Casey stops him
Quieter moment
Raph
Don't do it, man
() spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world wish  could take most of `em back
Sometimes, just takin' a breather is the best thing to do
- She's listening to Casey
maybe her man-boy is growing up
Raph knows he can't win
Yeah
whatever
- and bolts out the door

really fast down the pipes
Raph into frame, running faster than us
He lifts up a He pulls it open, revealing his Night gear
- as he grabs an overhead  and flips up and outta sight

only now it means so much more to us , as we find ourselves- 9                                                                69 - Donnie looks through a thick book on
(
) Think this is all of them, Donnie
- April walks in, holding a 3-foot-high stack of yellowed documents
cleaned out my archives on ancient South America
Might have found something useful
She takes out a hand-drawn map
map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec Shaman
They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin
even though the names changed
For use in an Aztec calendar
(picks up map) So, if we can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec - -along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal could take place
(to herself) Max, what are you up to
64
Leo paces back and forth in the main area
Splinter walks in
Mikey plays video games on the main
Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our floor
Seriously, dude
We're all stressed
Try to chill
You're playing video games on the possible eve of Armageddon, Mikey
() But  never said  was having fun
Leo looks at the clock
Where's Raph
Leonardo, a true leader knows the virtue of patience
and when to stop exercising it
We're almost done, Leo
You might want to go get him
If you can find him, that is
Leo looks at Splinter, clearly feeling leadership pressure and Raph's absence makes it worse
He leaves the lair
: - 70                                                                70 Relatively peaceful
few freighters off in the distance
Tall dry grass rustles in the wind, as we see a- -   -  stocky middle-aged   with a clicking metal detector
Big goofy earphones cover his ears
() Monay, monay, monay, (really high-pitched, bad) monay
- Steadicam shot, watching the man patrol under the light of the moon
65
The clicking intensifies
He follows the signal for twenty feet
Drops to the ground and digs the sand
and comes up with a old unopened
Pfft
Figgers
He turns to leave the beach
Lousy metal detector
"Happy Anniversary" present, my big fat keister
He  the can of sardines over his shoulder
Only, instead of hearing a tiny  from it hitting the water
we hear a snarling  and -
The man stops in his tracks

Barely lit in the hallways of the top private floors of Winters Tower
The camera travels the long and ornate hallways
Decorated in a different sense than the main building
in a sense of family, tradition and legacy
ictures spanning centuries in age
Some photos
Some portraits
Families
Loved ones

Tired
Sullen
Sipping brandy
Looks above the fireplace and lifts his snifter in a toast
To picking up the pieces

Winters closes his eyes
Well, by all means then

Deep in thought and not sharing

He pauses
He lifts his visor to feel the night air on his face
He sees in the distance
practically egging him on

He suddenly hears a noise in the back

Runs to the source and looks down at Pete's Diner
Sees the commotion inside
Uses his bolo chain and a power cable to form a   down the street as- 67

He goes through the front window
He stands, cat- like
Ready for anything
The room is only lit by the neon signage behind the counter
Suddenly - Night creeps to the freezer
He can hear the  and the behind the thick door
He takes out a spiked brass- knuckle
Ready
Places a hand on the door
and opens it
- The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen meat
Chewing with pieces flying everywhere
Disgusting
It turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking
but "cute" in a bizarre kinda way
Music builds as go- - Night stands there
The horrible demon creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too
Face off with Raph as we realize- -it's only
Hey there little fella
All that commotion for just little ole y- The Demon
It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor behind a row of tables
(
) Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all over the diner as the Demon pummels him
- The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor
It lunges forward, mouth open as Night backhands it with a
The Demon jumps back and up, landing on a rotating

He fights back
Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up on cocaine

The creature has disappeared
Night knows he's there
He preps
Grabs his   from his pocket
And waits
until
the Demon swoops in for another attack
Mouth open, fangs bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside
-
The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and eyes
It shrieks, flying out of the Diner
68
(victory taunting) Yeah
That's what  thought
Don't mess with the Nightwatcher
Night turns
His helmet is still on
He hits his  on the side of his head to see through the thick smoke
He finds the   huddled behind the counter
Night looks scary
Pl-pl-please don't hurt me
Whattaya talkin' about Please, sir

Night looks around
He sees the   on the floor
He picks it up, puts it on the counter

Looks out the window

and over the green shoulders of

- He's fuming
Staring down at Nightwatcher
The frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him

Trying to figure out his next move
This night just keeps gettin' better n' better

Tense stand-off as
Night suddenly bolts out the back as Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit

Leo keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of his way
Night suddenly   into traffic
Jumping over passing cars from roof to roof
Nice try, amateur
Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his secrecy
Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming bus, and flips back onto a cable
e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap
Oof
You're a heavy boy, aren't you
They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top
Leo wastes no time in catching up

Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping up pretty easily
He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball, and Leo barely recovers
Okay, someone's been training pretty hard
It begins to spit rain - and becomes a

One side of the buildings has a    facing away
Fills the rooftop with silhouettes
No choice but to turn around
as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building
want you to know that appreciate your intentions
But you can't change the world like this
- All we hear is rain pouring
Raph can't hear Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him
70
(to himself in helmet) Oh god
He's lecturing
(now audible) so 'm going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense
Leo unsheathes his two katanas
Raph can't hear him
(to himself in helmet) Okay, Leo
Wanna play
Nightwatcher drops
He twirls them with expertise
then motions for Leo to fight
Charge at each other, running through the rain, weapons drawn
They fight
Hard
And with expertise
Two masters duking it out
It surprises Leo
It fills Night with more adrenaline
There's a break
They circle like tigers
Renewing attacks
Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn
What
How did you- then he starts goading him on
Pushing Leo
Prodding
Making him
and then Leo fights back
Night can't keep up
Leo uses every bit of his control, restraint and expertise
He surgically slices the bind under Night's helmet
He jumps on top of the vigilante
Goodnight, dark prince
Leo  Night, knocking his helmet off
His face falls

Leo pales

But Raph doesn't feel like explaining
Refuses defeat
He mule kicks Leo back
Leo tumbles back, still in shock
They yell at each other through the pouring rain
71
You're so friggin' smug
You think the world revolves around , dontcha
That we couldn't survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our problems,

For you
Why do you hate me for that

You're impatient and hot-tempered

Raph stops in his tracks
Reaches behind his back

Well, big brother, 'd have to disagree with you on that one
Raph takes a ready stance
Leo does too
And they fight

They battle
In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball of anger, unleashing everything on Leo
72
It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground
holding a sai Tense
Raph shakes
He looks like he's going to do it
then stops
He collapses back
Almost ashamed of what he's done
Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him
They pant heavily
The rain dies down
Raph  , across a few rooftops
Away from his brother
He suddenly  and looks back at Leo, small in the distance
-   suddenly falls over him
He looks up to see the   surrounding him
He tries to fight back
but is too wiped from Raph
- "reading" Leo on the ground
He frowns
It is neither monster nor human
- He manages a small smile
Then he shall perfectly serve our purposes
let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured
- He sees the commotion from afar
as Leo gets with the Generals' dart cannon
Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and drive off
Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother
eo
Hang on
But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph
Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof
The sun begins to rise
He has to return to the sewer

Breathing heavy
Falls in line - walking to Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father

did something really stupid, Master Splinter
Go on

(beat - calming down) lot worse
know you must be ashamed of me, father
Raphael is lost in his guilt
Splinter kneels in front of Raph
Raphael
You always bear the world's problems on your shoulders
It is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others
plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder
74
But you must realize that while, at times, you may not be my favorite student, it does not mean that you are my least favorite son
Raphael looks up
Having not thought of it that way
You are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault
These are the merits of a great leader as well
but only when tempered with compassion and humility
But Master Splinter,  messed up big tonight
mean
Splinter chews on this
Leonardo (beat, ashamed) Yes
Splinter is grim
Nods
But he moves on
Well then,  believe your brothers may be in need of a leader
Raphael looks up
Finally, his shot
He holds his  in one hand, and his   in the other
Ninja Turtle vs
Nightwatcher
He grips them both hard
He drops the chain
Thank you

So, the first time that this portal was opened, the Stars of Kikin aligned

Shots establishing the jury-rigged nature of Winters Tower

He holds the helmet to his side

Casey with his off- the-shelf sporting gear
April with sleek-looking Japanese combat gear and weaponry
They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill
Casey's jaw drops as we scope out April
Wow

You
like it
Oh
oh yeah
They share the moment
Seeing what they forgot about each other when they first met
It's enough for them to smile
Where's your mask

(faking confusion) Mask
What mask
April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands behind her back
She takes out a   for Casey - cool, crisp and a badass paintjob
No way
was saving it for our anniversary

Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss her

Yup

Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute
Doesn't even notice those around him

He draws his sais and thrusts them at Winters

) It was  who stood on that battlefield all those years ago
Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction
He looks shocked, surprised
falls over Winters body
He looks up - it's a ceremonial  from their enemies' camp
(
) And we had to pay a price
The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting
Winters is pulled up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see him become
grayer
- Same electricity
Different effect
They scream, slowly turned into
Cracks form on their bodies, light shooting out of it
(
) We were cursed that day
My four comrades-in-arms were turned into stone
() 85
(cont'd) Cursed to live on this Earth
immobile
yet fully aware at all times to ponder the crimes we've committed
- He stands on the battlefield
Alone
As he walks, the   around him
During this, we - between then and now
(
) My curse was to live
forever
To feel the pain of losing love time and time again
Of boredom
The pain
of time
Winters stops walking
We were doomed to live this way until, as the Shaman put it, "you corrected the mistakes of your past"
(gestures to the lobby) That's what this is about
Penance, Miss 'Neil
Finally getting a chance to right our wrongs
(
) Our master fails to include crucial points in his tale
- The Four Generals thump forward
He fails to discuss the petrified agony of three thousand years
Of the torture of taking to merely blink an eye
Of watching the erosion of your own body throughout centuries
So, while our great leader basked in the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air
we rotted in the stone hell that lasted throughout Wmillennia
My brothers, - Our brotherhood was broken the day that you condemned us to this eternity
86
-      as each one is barely forced open and dozens of Foot Ninjas pile in the lobby
Karai comes to  of group
Surveys as the scene continues
And now, our Master has tired of feeding on the nectar of life
Of loving his entire life
Of
(gestures to portal) So he prefers to end it all
End "misery" at the expense of ours
Aguila walks to the cells
The portal writhes in the bg, sinking into the floor
But thanks to his cunning, his technology, we are now capable of we have now become- (close, creepy) - gods
And we shall finish what we began all those years ago
We will finally have our victory
Even with one monster still free, the curse can never be broken
(to Winters) Join us
Join us Yaotl, and live a life eternal with us at your side
- He waits
beat
Never
This was our opportunity
We were wrong
Don't you understand
) And you are weak
(to Karai) Destroy them
Karai sees Winters' condition
Clearly getting screwed by the very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and her Foot Clan
She suddenly     - military/ninja style
87
What does  mean
It means we're going to help you
- 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building, leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind
My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster
And you will bring it back here
Hurry - we don't have much time
Karai runs off
April looks over at Winters
He nods, still hurting
April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind with the Four Foot
They run out into the garden, just in time to see the other Foot disappear into the night
got shotgun
- They move toward Winters
The Turtles quickly look at one another
Know what they have to do
They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his backstabbing Generals
Aguila moves forward to Leo
Raph steps in beside him, defiant
Then Mikey
Then Don
If you mess with one of us- (looks around) -you mess with all of us
Aguila smiles at their chutzpa
Challenge accepted
97   The Portal worsens behind them
Sound and sight
The Eight 97 are ready to fight
and the fight
The Turtles leap, pounce and strike with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had
Winters moves to help the Turtles
Suddenly a   across his chest stops him
They must face them alone
As brothers
Winters debates it in his head for a beat -
- a tentacle from the portal slams down next to him
88
Alright
We have more important things to do
-  small  makes its way out of the portal
Winters runs and flips through the air and then with his bare hands, sending it back down
He lands on the other side
Help me push the cells into the portal
Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal
: 98                                                                98 (
) This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with
- as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner
Tinkling musical notes chime along with the speed
Appropriately lame and embarrassing
- Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are crammed in the back
Awkward silence
So
anybody from out of town
, /
- The combatants all pair off for their final battle
Utter commotion
Mikey is paired with Serpiente
Donnie is paired with the General Mono
He uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue
Leo fights with Gato
He can't dodge him
He's too fast
Leo lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils -
Leo's knocked shell-first into a large    filled with swords and bladed weapons of all kinds
Come to daddy
-
- Leo steps out, ready for action
Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body
He pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight
89
Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the
It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be aware of their environment to avoid defeat
Sensei
How you guys doing
- The portal is pulling the cells in
About five more to go
Splinter also flips around and takes out another demon trying to escape
Splinter actually seems to be having
Wonderful, my son
- Rush the streets of
My troops have located the final monster
At the harbor docks
Oh,  got this one covered
Casey   for the pier, music tinkling until it reaches the pier over the harbor warehouses until we see - - the 13th monster
Looks like a land-locked
It appears unconscious - a hundred or so   sticking out of it's back
The Van pulls onto the scene
- Everyone is in shock
The ninjas look at each other
Huh
Now there's somethin' you don't see every day
They pile out of the van
(off of monster) Well,  guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower
We should tie it to the van and drag it back
Wow
You're
hard core
-  Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body
As he turns his head he doesn't see  '
90
- The creature stands up as everyone turns to see
The creature   his hide, sending the tranq darts flying everywhere
They slam into the walls like shrapnel
- As they dive out of the way
One gets hit with a dart in the chest
Looks down
Passes out
Incoming
- As they open the doors to act as shields as - - darts stick in the door
- He's now standing
and dying to chase something
It / as they all pile into the van
Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the creature smashing the pier in front of them
Get to the end and spin the vehicle around
Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away
- Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of alignment
Losing time fast
-   on Winters and Splinter
On the last full cell
-  pair of   are threatening to come out
In the , dozens of winged  fly around inside
They better hurry with that last monster
'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control
That's what 'm afraid of
-   '  - As he's screaming his guts out
', , ' - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as to attract the creature
It's working too
The creature pounces along like an awkward greyhound run
April drives
91
Casey is throwing   at it from his large hockey bag
The creature is catching and eating it all
- Casey slips in
What are you doing in here
Ran outta food
They all look out the back window as the creature pounds closer and closer
- The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill
Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals
Listen
'm the last guy to sound like a  cartoon, but  think we need to work together
Teamwork
The more you know
Don clocks Mikey behind the head
() Why Raph, no solo act tonight
Raph grins
They stand, backs to back
finally as a
They trust one another, and their efficiency shows
- More tentacles begin to come out
More claws surround the surface edges
- The music swells
The brothers act and think as one
The way they should
They way they will from now on
- As cam  , he stands up
Seeing his sons
As one
As
He smiles
Yes
Yes, my sons
The Generals can't keep up
It's enough to distract them to make mistakes the  take advantage of
- Sees the portal light beginning to
Because of the 's moves, the Generals are now on the precipice of the Portal, being pulled back
They struggle to stand
The brothers look at each other
The place is violent with a whirlwind and screaming Monsters
92
So who wants ta call it a day
'm in
Affirmative
Roger dodger, dude
The    launch into their   - perfectly in synch and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into the
They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils and   pulled back
The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal
Silent
Splinter runs over to them
My sons,  am so proud of you all
Then -
- the Generals'  slam onto the ridge of the portal -
The Turtles jump back
/
/
Silly children
We are immortals made of stone
The Earth has only to feel our wrath
The brothers are screwed
They can't stop the Generals
Until- - Glowing headlights grow larger
Closer
As - The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime and all, being trailed by the Creature
April clips a corner as the vehicle spins out of the path
he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor
It falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop
Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the Portal
The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into the Portal
- The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle
- It begins to close
The Generals struggle to get out, only now, we see they are
their curse broken
and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them
93
Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal
- - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion
thought he'd never shut up
- The portal  in a upwards funnel
Silence
The brothers high five one another
Splinter smiles proud
- Dusty and smoking
The door clangs open
Casey piles out
Karai comes next and accidentally  on Casey in a very compromising position
She slyly smiles
April falls out last beside them
(caught - looks at both) Oh
, uh - - Casey tosses Karai off of him
April's eye cocks
Don't try to tell me for one second that you didn't enjoy tha- Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss
Like they should have been kissing all along
They stop
Noses close
Smile
They pull apart, revealing standing there
Watching them all gooey-eyed
Raph and Leo look at each other
beat
Then hug
Brothers again
Dialogue would just ruin this moment
Splinter walks over to them
to show Karai and the Foot Ninja standing there
Silence
Finally, Karai steps forward - You are every bit the warriors was informed you were
You have passed
94
- they're confused
Passed what
You know us
've known  you for some time
(beat, to Leo's question) Savor your victory tonight
For soon we will have further business together
What kind of business
The kind that involves familiar faces from your past
- They all look at each other
She doesn't mean
They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have
Raph looks over at
He's hunched over in the corner
Can't tell what's going on
They walk over slowly
Winters
- Looks like he's sobbing
They get concerned
Then the sobs turn to
He stands up
His hand is spotted red with his own  from a cut on his cheek
'm never usually that happy to be bleeding
You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years
Winters looks at all the Turtles
Thank you
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
You've made a very old man, very very happy
So, um, what happens now
95
- He just
Content
Finally at peace
As he ages thousands of years in front of us
eventually turning to  and blowing away
Okay
just a little bit creepy
() Oh gawd
think he's in my n-n- , out of the building, onto the street
See the destruction
The clearing skies
: - 99                                                                 99 Raph comes to Splinter's room
You wanted to see me Sensei
Sit down, Raphael
Thank you, Master Splinter, for your guidance
(thinks, humble) can only hope that one day, will be able to begin the next stage of my training like Leo
Splinter smiles
Reaches into a box and takes out a similar to the one given to Leonardo
That, my son, you already have
() Our training works in mysterious ways
But the answer that lies in all our questions
is family
Raph beams as he accepts the "badge"
He excitedly stands up
Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's
They exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we- : - 100                                                            100 '   as we cap everyone's adventures
Splinter walks through the lair
It's empty
He walks past their "trophy room"
He places the ornate head of ' on the shelf
96
He sits down to meditate
But first reaches into his robe and pulls out a
He opens it up and smiles
Ahh
Double chocolate fudge
: 101                                                               101 - Mikey and Don are on the rooftops
Leo and Raph join them on top
Leo and Raph have an aside to themselves
So we're cool with the whole Nightwatcher thing
Yeah, we're cool
Our secret, bro
(checks for clear coast) You got rid of the stuff, right
- Nightwatcher's gear burning in a barrel
What about the bike, tho
(discreet/confessional) Okay, so  couldn't exactly destroy the bike
() Let's just say it's in good hands
What do you mean
mean, it's in good hands
(thinks, then realizes) Oh, you didn't
Raph sheepishly shrugs as we- : 102                                                               102 (
) As Casey roars down the street on the black motorcycle of Nightwatcher, barely able to hang on
97
He drives past   - now being converted to a 103                                                               103 comes into frame
Casey stops his bike
- It's April
She smiles
Casey hands her a helmet
'    - We see a small   taped to the visor
She takes it off
Beaming
Models it on her hand
She leans forward
yes
She wraps her arms around his waist and holds tight for the adventures that await
for a beat, then rises up the buildings to- - 104                                                               104 All four turtles are horsing around
They get geared up
and head off for a game of
The boys run, hoot and holler as they fly high on the rooftops
(
) So what makes a family
Personally, it's more than sharing a roof or a bathroom
It's sharing life
My father taught me that, and  think it's pretty much true
y'know, provided that you don't kill each other in the process
Or that no one touches your stuff
Or makes loud noises when you're trying to sleep
Or
They run close to the camera, once again, a family
(
) Hey, nobody said it was easy
