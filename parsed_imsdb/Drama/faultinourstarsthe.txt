Weber Based on the novel by John Green May 1, 2012 (16) lies in the grass, staring up at the stars
We're   her  and we hear: (
) You have a choice in this world, believe, about how to tell sad stories
a    : - Hazel and the  we will come to know as  "" (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place
[They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple
] (
) On the one hand, you can sugar coat - the way they do in movies and romance novels
- "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country
She rests her head on his shoulder
(
) Where villains are vanquished and
heroes are born and
- "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room
(
) beautiful people learn beautiful lessons
- "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together
They look deep into one another's eyes
(
) and nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song
Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars
Were those dreams or were they memories
Still unclear
(
) like that way as much as the next girl, believe me
It's just not the truth
Hazel closes her eyes
(
) This is the truth
And
We : (
) Sorry
: 2
'  - The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw
(
) Late in the Winter of my 17th year
There are, however, some key and obvious differences
First, you'll notice the   in her nostrils which help her to breathe
Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the grass
It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few years before
(
) my mother decided  was depressed
'm not depressed
Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table
Her mother  (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains to the : she eats like a bird
She barely leaves the house, 'm not depressed
she reads the same book over and over
She's depressed
'm not depressed
Off her look,  : , which play over: (
) The booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer
-
Filled with   - gossipping, laughing - being teenage girls, basically
And here's Hazel
With her Mom
And her oxygen tank
Just another day
3
(
) Depression's not a side effect of cancer
- '
She sits watching game shows in the middle of the afternoon
Her Mom brings her a sandwich glass of water
And then a whole host of prescription meds
Hazel eyes them with indifference
(
) it's a side effect of dying
-
Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter Van Houten)
She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of delight
has lifted a   over his shoulder playfully
He spins her around
Hazel watches a beat - goes back to the book
(
) Which is what was happening to me
And we   : '  - Frannie continues to talk to the doctor
Hazel continues to dangle her feet
some days she won't even get out of bed
The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking
may switch you to Zoloft
Or Lexapro
And twice a day instead of once
Why stop there
Hmm
Keep `em coming
can take it
'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids
The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head
Have you been going to that Support Group  suggested
Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom
4
She's gone a few times
'm not sure it's for me
If you're depressed -- () 'm not de-- ( ) -- support Groups are a great way to connect with people who are
What
() On the same journey
"Journey
" Really
Hazel
Just give it a chance, ok
For me
Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle
Who knows
You might even find it
enlightening
: - on  (30s, pony-tail)
He has a guitar
we are gathered here today - literally - in the heart of Jesus
on Hazel who just shakes her head
This is the lamest thing she could be doing right now
Who would like to share their story with the group
The basement is filled with
Hazel among them
Most are under the age of 18
: 5
#1 Jillian
15
Lymphoma
#2 Angel
17
Ewing sarcoma
Patrick
34
Testicular
It started a few years ago, when  was
As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear: (
) 'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer
Basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is - divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of Jesus - "literally" - to show us that one day - if we're lucky - we could be just like him
They all say: "We're here for you Patrick
" Hazel says it the least enthusiastically
She locks eyes with her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye patch,
He's also shaking his head
Who else would like to share
( ) Hazel
Oh no
Patrick gestures for her to speak
Reluctantly she stands, sighs
'm, uh, Hazel
16
() Thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs
Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down
And how are you doing Hazel
Hazel has no idea how to answer that
(
) You mean besides the terminal cancer
6
But that's not what she says
She says: Alright
guess
Isaac tries not to laugh at this
Hazel sits back down
"We're here for you Hazel
" Hazel exhales
This is not at all helpful
few more beats
Maybe now 'll play a song
- Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a book, waiting for Group to be over
She sees the church door open and puts the book away
Hazel comes out
Frannie looks at her like "well, was it great
" Hazel just exhales and gets in the car
: '   - "America's Next Top Model" is on the
Hazel sits on one side of the -shaped couch, flipping through her novel
Frannie and Hazel's dad  (40s, kind, doing his best to stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but trying not to make it seem that way
After a few beats: It's Friday night
Hmm
was just thinking
you should call your friends, see what they're up to
() That's ok
Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything
Wanna see a movie
Hazel looks up from the book
Sees her parents
Gets an idea
Why don't you guys go to a movie
(off their look) () 7
(') You haven't been out in a while
Go
Have fun
Take the night off
Frannie and Michael look at one another again
This is a really good show
Hazel sighs
And just like that, everyone goes back to what they were doing
: , which plays over: (
) And that was my life
- Hazel watching , book in hand
- Hazel in another doctor's office
- Hazel popping pills
(
) Reality shows
Doctor's appointments
Eight prescription drugs, three times a day
'  - Hazel and her parents in the kitchen
(
) And worse worse worst of all
support group
Ugh
You can't make me
Of course we can, we're your parents
Hazel frowns
Hazel, you need to get out of the house
Make friends
Be a teenager
If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group
Buy me a fake  so  can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot
You don't take pot
8
See, that's the kind of thing would know with a fake
() Get in the car
Hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible sword
: - small Episcopalian sanctuary in suburban Indianapolis
(
) And so  went
Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance
(
) Not because  wanted to or because thought it would help
But for the same reason  did anything these days
Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's assistance
(
) to make my parents happy
Are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time
Of course not, no
(she totally is) have errands to run
Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands
She doesn't press the issue
Ok
Love you
Love you too Mom
(
) The only thing worse than biting it from cancer - is having a kid bite it from cancer
As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter: 9
Make some friends
Hazel just shakes her head
: - Hazel walks towards the elevator
An holds it open for her
Hazel thinks better of it
'll take the stairs
The  nods
The doors shut
Hazel is reminded - it could always be worse
She turns to go, walking right into: Ooph
Sorry
(we will come to know him as )
Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue eyes
Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life
My bad
No, it's
For a brief moment, the Earth stops
They stand looking at one another
Hazel is speechless
Excuse me
With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face, Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into: - Hazel catches her breath
Shakes her head
Surprised at herself
She looks in the mirror
So doesn't like what she sees
The Earth starts moving again
: - Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick
Who would like to begin
No volunteers
Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy, sitting next to Isaac
He seems to be watching her, that same flirty smile on his face
She self-consciously looks away
10
Isaac,  know you're facing a challenging time
Perhaps you would like to say something
Isaac nods, rises
Yeah, um
'm Isaac
17
Eye cancer
() It's looking like another surgery in a couple weeks
After which, well, 'll be blind
Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's difficult
She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her
Not that 'm complaining or anything
know a lot of you have it way worse but, still,  mean, you know, being blind's gonna suck
As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from Hazel
Hazel finds this intimidating
And intimidation irritates her
So she decides to play the game with him, meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly
staring contest
My girlfriend helps
And friends like Augustus here
Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name - He still doesn't look away from Hazel
So
yeah
That's what's up
"We're here for you Isaac
" The staring contest continues another few beats until: And does your friend want to speak
This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away
Aha, he's lost the contest
Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up as if to say "Victory is mine
" He smiles back at her, the most radiant smile on the planet
He turns back to the Group
Hi
'm Augustus Waters
17
Had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago - lost this baby as a result
11
Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic
But really 'm just here at Isaac's request
And how are you feeling Augustus
Me
Oh 'm grand
'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend
Hazel smiles
Gus catches this
Embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away
Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus
My fears
Gus thinks about this
Oblivion
Oblivion
Hazel, intrigued
Yeah, see
intend to live an extraordinary life
To be remembered
If 'm scared of anything it's
not doing that
Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that
Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that
And Hazel's hand goes up
Even Patrick is surprised by that
Hazel
That's unexpected
Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts
Augustus watches her, waits for it
just wanna say
there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead
Gus is now even more fixed on her than before
12
It might be tomorrow
Might be a million years from now but
it's gonna happen
And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra
Or Mozart
Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right
The look on Gus's face is unreadable
Oblivion's inevitable
And if that scares you, well,  suggest you ignore it
God knows it's what everyone else does
beat
And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one
: - Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear
Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a redhead,  (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird
Between kisses, we can hear: Always
Always
And Hazel hears: Literally
Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her
thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus
Hazel smiles
Someone should probably tell him, don't you think
Jesus
Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart
Gus laughs
What's your name
13
Hazel
No your full name
() Hazel Grace Lancaster
Gus nods to himself, smiles
Still fixated on her
What
didn't say anything
Why are you looking at me like that
Because you're beautiful
Hazel is taken aback
No one's ever said that to her before
enjoy looking at beautiful people and  decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence
Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon
() 'm not beaut -- walks past them
Hey Gus
Hey Alisa
Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus
Of course they do
She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at each other
She hears: Always
Always
What's with the "always
" 14
"Always" is their thing
They'll "always" love each other and whatnot
Must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year
They continue to watch the show
It's pretty gross
Isaac squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn
He's gotta be hurting her boob
Let's watch a movie
Hazel is again surprised
Oh
Um
Uh
(yes
) Sure
Yeah
'm
pretty free this -- No  mean now
What
Hmm
What do you mean "now
" 've got a car
He shrugs
Hazel has never seen someone so confident
You could be an axe murderer
There is that possibility
() Come on Hazel Grace
take a risk
As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes
Hazel is in disbelief
He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between his lips
Oh my god
Oh
My
God
You're kidding right
(off his look) You just ruined the whole thing
15
Whole thing
What, you think that's cool
Oh you idiot
There's always a hamartia, isn't there
And yours is - even though you had   you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire Ugh
And you were doing so well
As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face
Hazel does not find it so amusing
Let me tell you
not being able to breathe
Sucks
Totally sucks
Hamartia
Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him
fatal flaw
Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face
They don't hurt you unless you light them
Sorry
've never lit one
Hazel turns back to him
It's a metaphor
See
You put the thing that kills you between your teeth
But you don't give it the power to do the killing
Hazel is floored
And impressed
Metaphor
Gus holds her gaze
And it's at this point Frannie pulls up
Hi sweetheart
Ready for some "Model
" 16
Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips
Cool as anything
Handsome as hell
She looks back at her mom
Can't tonight
(off her confused look) 've made plans with Augustus Waters
And with that, she walks off
Frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth
This could be trouble
Or awesome
Or both
And we  : '  - Hazel is terrified
Turns out, Gus is the world's worst driver
When he brakes, her body flies forward against the seatbelt
And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck snaps back in the seat
Gus sees the look on her face
failed the test a couple times
You don't say
Most amputees can drive with no problem but
yeah
Not me
'm surprised you have a license
Tell me about it
Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt
The fourth time  took the test
it was going about how this is going
and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, "your driving, while unpleasant
is not technically unsafe
" Aha
Cancer perk
Total cancer perk
few beats of silence
So what happened to you
Hazel takes a deep breath
She's told this story before but somehow this seems different
17
was 13 when they found it
And as she speaks, we see it unfold
: - 13-   has a biopsy
(
) Stage  thyroid cancer
- 13-   on the operating table
It's a nightmare
(
) had surgery first
- This poor little girl is taking a beating
And it's just getting started
- Radiation treatment
(
) Then Radiation
- Having her head shaved by Frannie
(
) Then Chemo
- With a  line in a chemo chair
(
) All of which worked for a while
-   looks at an -ray
He's not pleased
(
) And then stopped working
- 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe
Frannie runs her fingers through her hair
Dad calls 9-1-1
(
) And then my lungs started filling up with water
- In the , her parents standing over her
(
) That should have been the end
18
(through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie
14-Year Old Hazel nods
Michael can't keep it together any longer
He completely breaks down
(
) But it wasn't
- The sun shines in the room
14-year old Hazel eats ice chips, the color has returned to her cheeks
(
) The antibiotics kicked in
They drained the fluid from my lungs
And in time  got better
Stronger
- Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication
It's never ending
(
) even found myself in an experimental trial
You know the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working
-    examines a second -ray
(
) It's called Phalanxifor
Didn't work in over 70 percent of patients but, for some reason
The Radiologist looks surprised
(
) it worked in me
They called it "The Miracle
" And finally,  : '  - Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel
He was impressed with her before
He's totally dazzled now
Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since
() 19
(') Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, dunno, a while maybe
Wow
Yeah
So are you back in school or
Can't
Why not
Got my
college girl
Well that explains the aura of sophistication
He smiles at her
She smiles back
Shoves his upper arm playfully
They're easing into each other
Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway
We're here
He's as good at parking as he is at driving
: / '  - Hazel follows Gus inside
She quickly notices all sorts of engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times
" Hazel looks at Gus quizzically
My parents call them "encouragements
" (rolling his eyes) Don't ask
Gus's  and  (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner
Hey guys
' Augustus, hi
New friend
20
Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some random girl in their house
Hazel takes note of that
This is Hazel Grace
It's just
Hazel
' How's it going, Just Hazel
() Downstairs if you need us
Gus drags Hazel to the next room
As she's pulled: Nice to meet you
They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and weak lungs
Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom
There's a with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school trophies, framed images etc
) Gus sees her looking at them
used to play
Must have been pretty good
These are mine
And these
The rest of it's just cancer perks
Gus grabs a  from his stack of DVDs
Hazel sits down on the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier
Need to sit
Gus sits down next to her on the bed
Don't get any ideas
(catching her breath) All that standing
and stairs
and then more standing
lotta standing for me
understand
21
'll be fine in a minute
Unless faint
'm a bit of a Victorian lady, fainting-wise
Gus smiles
He waits for her breathing to slow down
In time: You ok
Hazel nods, smiles
So what's your story
already told you my story
was -- Not your cancer story
Your story
Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes
Um
Don't tell me you're one of those people who becomes their disease
No
'm just
don't know
un- extraordinary
reject that out of hand
(beat, Hazel shrugs) Think of something you love
First thing that comes to mind
"An Imperial Affliction
" Ok
What's that
It's a novel
My favorite novel
Does it have zombies
() What
No
Stormtroopers
22
Seriously
( ) It's not that kind of book
Sounds horrible
It's not, it's
kind of my bible actually
Interesting
What's it about
Cancer
(off his look) But not in that way, trust me
The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's
well, the only person 've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died
() In that case
am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers
And in exchange
Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf
all  ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game
Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella
She laughs
She's adorable when she laughs
She takes the book from him and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a brief, charged moment
Your hands are cold
Not so much cold as under- oxygenated
Ooh Hazel Grace
() love it when you talk medical to me
Hazel blushes
And off her completely smitten smile,  : 23
'  - Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella
Frannie stands in the doorway, notices the new book
That's different
Hazel shrugs
Frannie looks intrigued
Did he give it to you
By "it" do you mean herpes
Frannie rolls her eyes
Hazel's phone buzzes
She excitedly checks it - only to be disappointed
Frannie notices
'm sure he'll call, don't worry
'm not worried
Please
It's not like 'm waiting for him to call or anything
just
we hung out
No big deal
Frannie says nothing to that
Her silence says it all
Hazel rolls her eyes
: : Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call
We see her: - Brushing her teeth
And checking her phone
- Watching
And checking her phone
- Eating breakfast
And checking her phone
- Looking out the window on a rainy day
Trying not to check her phone
Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone
And checking the phone
Where is he
Did he forget about her
'   - Hazel at the dinner table with her parents
She's a little sullen, barely touching her food
Hazel's phone buzzes
She tries not to seem too eager to check it, what with her parents watching and all
She subtly looks down at her lap
And sure enough: a text from Gus
Her eyes bug out
We see: 24
"Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something
" Hazel smiles
Goes back to eating
Frannie and Michael share a quick glance
second later, there's a follow-up text
"Tell me  have  reached the end of this book
" Hazel smiles again
And then a third text: "  "
' " Hazel now laughs out loud
Michael clears his throat
Hazel looks up
Would you like to be excused
'  -  - Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone
Gus answers on the first ring
(
) Hazel Grace
Welcome to the sweet torture of reading "An Imperial --" At which point she hears a loud  coming from the other end of the phone
What the -- are you ok
(
) Me
Yeah
'm excellent
between Hazel on the patio and: '   - Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch
He's wailing like a banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown
( ) am, however, with Isaac
Hazel hears more wailing
Has no idea what to make of it
25
(
) ( ) Dude
Hey
Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse
Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on
Isaac
Focus
On
Me
Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on
Finally: (
) ( ) How fast can you get here
Hazel thinks about this
And on her face,  : '  - Hazel descends the steps
She hears an ungodly moan before she sees anyone
What has she gotten herself into
Gus appears at the base
(calling to Isaac) Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs
Gus waits for a response
None comes
He gestures for her to follow him into the room
Before he does: gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode
( ) You look nice, by the way
Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac sitting upside down in a gaming chair
Tears are flowing down his reddened cheeks
Empty soda cans and bags of junk food lie around him
How ya doing Isaac
Again, no response
Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation
Seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern
Oh 'm sorry
() Do you want to talk about it
Isaac starts to sob again
26
He just wants to cry and play video games
Fair enough
It doesn't hurt to talk to him, however
If you have any sage words of feminine advice
actually think his response is appropriate
"Pain demands to be felt
" (lights up at that) You're quoting my book
Gus winks at her
At which point, Isaac lets out another howl
Gus gestures for Hazel to sit
The two of them flank Isaac
He finally speaks
She didn't want to do it after the surgery
Said she couldn't handle it
'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it
Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy
kept saying "always" to her
Always, always, always
And she just kept talking over me and not saying it back
It was like  was already gone, you know
"Always" was a promise
You can't break promises
Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them
Right, sure, but you keep the promise anyway
That's what love is
Love is keeping the promise anyway
That could be an "encouragement
" It's silent for a beat
And then Isaac stands up, a funny look on his face
27
Isaac
Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room
Here we go
The chair lands against the bed
Gus hands Isaac something else to throw, a pillow
Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it against the wall
He dives on it and beings pummeling the pillow like a maniac
That's it
Punch that thing
And so he does
As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel, cigarette dangling from his mouth
've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but  have been waiting until  could form a coherent thought in re: "An Imperial Affliction
" ( ) can't stop thinking about it
know, right
The only problem is the ending
It is rather abrupt
It's torture
mean,  totally get that she died or whatever - Anna
But there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract
But that's part of what  like about it
It portrays death truthfully
You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence
But  do - God,  do want to know what happens to everyone else
Yeah like her Mom
The Dutch Tulip Man
28
Sysiphus the Hamster
Hazel beams
Gus totally gets the book
bond between them
Have you tried contacting this
Peter Van Houten
've written letters
He's never responded
Apparently he moved to Amsterdam, became a recluse
Hasn't published anything
Doesn't do interviews
Sad
() Hang on
(turns to Isaac) Isaac
Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand
Pillows don't break
Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball
You need to break something
Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission
Gus nods
Isaac holds it over his head and
The trophy breaks into a million pieces
Isaac almost smiles
Gus hands him another
Go to town, my friend
And Isaac does
Smashing them one by one
Hazel looks at Gus
've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that  kinda hate basketball
Think maybe we've found it
Isaac grabs more of the , smashing them to pieces
Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle
When there are none left Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage
Feel better
Isaac thinks about it
Shakes his head no
Gus puts his arm around him but looks at Hazel
29
That's the thing about pain
it demands to be felt
Hazel smiles
And on her face, we  : -   - Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents
Dr
Maria called today
The Scan is set for the eighth
Hazel nods
This could be a source of worry but she's not going to think about that right now
She's upbeat
And she's actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice
Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased
told you Support Group was a good idea
Hazel's phone buzzes
"Augustus
" She looks to her parents
By all means
'  - Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the stars
She rings him back and as she does  w/ Hazel in the grass and: '   - Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest
Hazel Grace
Hello Augustus
So  read it again
And  just kept feeling like
like it was a gift
Like you'd given me something important
() You're welcome
On the other hand
we need closure, don't we
30
What we need is a sequel
Yes
We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies
That's what  kept asking Van Houten for in my letters
But he never wrote back
That's correct
Because he's a recluse
Yeee-up
Utterly unreachable
Unfortunately so
Gus clears his throat, smiles
Hazel waits
"Dear Mr
Waters
am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April
Hazel sits up
Could it be
" am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book
" Augustus
found his assistant
emailed her
She must have forwarded it to him
(Hazel is stunned) Shall  continue
Keep reading, keep reading
31
" am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here  quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you
" Hazel pays attention to every word
"To answer your question: No, have not written anything else, nor will
do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me
However thank you again for your generous email
Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten
You're making this up
Hazel Grace, could , with my meager intellectual capabilities, make up a letter from the great Peter Van Houten
Holy hell
Indeed
Can
would you mind
() Go check your in-box
Hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow
: '  - Hazel sits at her computer, Van Houten's assistant's email address staring her in the face
The cursor blinks on a blank page
And then Hazel starts writing
(
) "Dear Mr
Peter Van Houten, my name is Hazel Grace Lancaster
My friend Augustus Waters, who read your book - at my recommendation - just received an email from you at this address
hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me
" 32
While Hazel reads the letter, we see a showing the next several days
They include: - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe
He's enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every moment of it
- Hazel helping Gus become a better driver
It's no use
(
) " was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions have about what happens after the end of the book
Specifically, the :" - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes
(
) "Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man up to something - or is he just misunderstood
What happens to Anna's friends
- Watching
Their bodies almost touching
But not quite
(
) Lastly,  was hoping you could shed some light on Sisyphus the Hamster
These questions have haunted me for years
And  don't know how long have left to get answers to them
" And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom
She finishes reading this letter into the phone
" know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but  would just really like to know
" w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening
(reading it aloud to him) "And of course, if ever you do decide to write anything else, even if you don't want to publish it, 'd love to read it
Frankly, 'd read your grocery lists
Yours with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster
Age 16
" Not bad
33
You think
Bit pretentious
But then again, Van Houten uses words like "tendentious" and
"bacchanalia" so  think he'll like it
Hazel smiles, looks at a clock
Is it really almost 1
Guess so
gotta get to sleep
Ok
Ok
Neither one of them want to hang up the phone
Ok
Ok
They both laugh at this
Perhaps "ok" will be our "always
" Hazel smiles
Ok
Ok
Ok
Gus hangs up
We stay with Hazel
Is it really possible this Beautiful Boy likes her
She thinks about it
She's not convinced
: -   - Isaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially blind
attends to him while Hazel sits by his side
34
She hasn't even visited
Fourteen months we were together
What kind of person
' You'll get over her Isaac
Just takes a little time
You'll see
The Nurse exits the room
Is she gone
Yeah
Did she really just say "you'll see
" (shakes her head) Qualities of a Good Nurse
Go
Doesn't pun your disability
Gets blood on the first try
That is huge
mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard
Three - no condescending voice
(lays it on thick) "'m gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie
" They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment
You doing alright, Isaac
don't know
To be honest,  think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye
Is that crazy
That's crazy
It's a little crazy
35
But  believe in love, you know don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love
Don't you think
Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain pump, self-administering morphine
Gus was here earlier
(trying to be nonchalant) Was he
Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in
Mmm
that's better
The pain
(off his slow nod) Good
Good, Isaac
(Isaac closes his eyes) What about Gus
But Isaac is already asleep
Whatever he was going to say about Gus is gone
Hazel nods, pats his hand
: '  - Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer
She casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's written her back
Holy shit
( ) "Dear Ms
Lancaster
cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to do so would constitute a sequel, which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet
Not that  don't trust you, but how could  trust you,  barely know you
" Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part: "Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure
Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten" Son of a - 36
Frannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem
What's wrong
(realizing she scared her) Nothing
Sorry
() Nothing
Everything
Look
Hazel shows Frannie the note
Frannie reads it
Can we go to Amsterdam
Please
Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat
Hazel,
love you and
you know 'd do anything for you, but we don't
() We don't have the money
The expense of getting equipment over there - love, it's just not possible
() No, yeah, of course
Clearly Frannie feels awful
Which makes Hazel feel awful
mean,  could talk to your father -- Mom, no
Please
Don't do anything
Forget  mentioned it
beat between them
Frannie walks out, sadly
Hazel sits on the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons
(
) Guilt is definitely a side effect of cancer
- Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk
37
Just use your wish
've used it already
Pre- "Miracle
" What'd you do
Hazel doesn't want to say
Gus realizes
Not Disney
was 13
Tell me you did not go to Disney World
(Hazel looks away) Hazel Grace
You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World
() And Epcot Center
(hands in the air) Oh my God
( ) We had fun on that trip
That is the saddest thing 've ever heard
met Goofy
Now 'm embarrassed
Why are you embarrassed
How can  have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes
Wait, what
The word "crush" has taken Hazel totally by surprise
38
What
She looks at him
beat
She quickly looks away, blushing
Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about is ""
She tries not to seem too excited
: - Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine
explains that she should hold still, try and relax, etc
But Hazel knows
She knows all about these procedures
She's a pro
: '  - Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls up
They're home from the hospital
He wears an Indiana Pacers  and carries a bouquet of bright orange
Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of the car
Gus rises to assist them
Is that a Rik Smits jersey
It is indeed
() Man,  loved that guy
Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him
Gus
Hi Hazel
() How would you like to go on a picnic
'   - Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs
Something to drink
'm great Mrs
Lancaster
39
Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date
She's put the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs
Gus sitting on the stairs
Michael next to him
You're a survivor yourself
(taps his leg) Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it
Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy
Legs are heavy
How's your health now
-- for fourteen months
That's fantastic
'm very lucky
Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror
Seems to like what she sees a lot more than before
Gus and Michael, downstairs: Son, you have to understand
Hazel's still pretty sick
She will be the rest of her life
on Hazel, who can hear all of this
She stops what she's doing and listens
She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs -- You ready Gus
Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence
: - Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens and Grounds
Hazel and Gus walk together
Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests
40
Every last one
() Probably why 'm still a virgin
Hazel laughs, elbows him
You're not a virgin
(off his look) Are you really
Gus picks a  up from the dirt
Draws a   in it
See this
This circle is virgins
Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle
And this
is 17 year old dudes with one leg
Hazel laughs
Point made
He grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill
Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the ground
They sit, looking out over a rather odd  - a set of    where children can jump and play
() "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout
He sounds Dutch
And he is
Much like Rik Smits
And tulips
Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus
He's sure taking this Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far
He removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket
Sandwich
Let me guess -- () Dutch cheese
And tomato
(she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican
Sorry
They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play on the bones
41
How cool is that
skeleton being used as a playground
You do love your symbols
Speaking of which
Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth
He clears his throat
You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey
It has crossed my mind
Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and  say this with great affection - you spent your Wish
moronically
was thir-- Hush
'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here
Sorry
Please, continue
You were young
Impressionable
The Grim Reaper staring you in the face
And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read "An Imperial Affliction" ever know that her one  wish was to visit Mr
Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile
Hazel nods in agreement
If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self
42
Gus stops talking
Hazel is confused
But
didn't save it
Gus smiles
Good thing  saved mine
Hazel cocks her head to one side
What is he talking about
Got it in exchange for the leg
() And  still have it
She starts to realize
Are you saying -- 'm not gonna give you my Wish or anything
But  too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it
(Hazel's eyes widen) talked to the Genies and they're in total agreement
() We leave on May third
Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a hug
Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it looks like something might happen -- Wait a minute
() Are you only doing this so 'll kiss you
beat
Gus blinks a few times
Cause 'd totally kiss you either way
And kiss him she does
He's surprised
And when it's over, they sit back, look at one another
magic moment
Seriously
why are you doing this
43
Because Hazel Grace
found my Wish
And Hazel is beyond touched
We hear: () Are you out of your mind
'   - Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case
It's too much, Haze
We can't accept something like that from a virtual stranger
He's not a stranger
Really
Don't be gross
It's still "no," 'm afraid
Can we at least ask Dr
Maria
'  - Where Hazel's oncologist
shakes her head
That's out of the question
You said the  scan was encouraging
The  scan is encouraging
We just don't know how long it'll stay that way
What if you get sick in a foreign country
They have doctors in Amsterdam
And cancer
Someone will know what to do
44
Be that as it may, without someone familiar with your particular case, can't -- (turns to her Mom) So you'll come too
What
The Genies can hook it up
They're loaded
-- You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom
And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to
Dr
Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point
Hazel smiles
And on that smile, we   : Over which, we : (
) And then this happened
'  - [Note: There's no sound in this sequence
Just images
] Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking and holding her head
Frannie and Michael burst in
Mom grabs her crying daughter, frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help
(
) People talk about the courage of cancer patients
And  do not deny that courage
He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok
Whatever nightmare this is, it's going to end
: '  - Still silent
Michael drives, trying to keep it together
Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap
45
Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or terror, we do not know
(
) 'd been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years and still  trod on
- Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room
They're practically running
There's still no sound
(
) But make no mistake
The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child
She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch
We stay with her and  : (
) In that moment  would have been very, very happy to die
-  - The sound returns
And it's the sound of a heart monitor
It's also the sound of a working heart
Hazel has made it through
Her eyes open
is there
' Hello
Hi
' You're ok, Hazel
Even Hazel seems surprised by that
' Would you like to see your parents
Hazel nods
The Nurse goes to get them
Soon they come bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly
So much relief
: Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her parents "comfortably
" They thought it was a brain tumor
It wasn't - thank god -- 46
So what happened
The usual
Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation
They put that in
There's a  in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hangs off her bed
Drained a liter and a half last night
(That's a lot of fluid
) The good news is
no tumor growth
No new tumors in your body
Hazel nods
That is a relief
We're all so relieved
Frannie embraces her daughter
This is just a thing Hazel
It's a thing we can live with
Hazel nods again
Only in the universe of Hazel Grace Lancaster is something like this just a thing
Meanwhile: -   - Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor
It's unclear how long he's been waiting there
He sees Michael walk down the hall
Races after him
Mr
Lancaster
How's she doing
Better, thank you
Much better
Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them
They won't let me in
Family only
'm sorry -- No  get it
Will you just
will you tell her  was here
47
Of course  will
Gus smiles
And sits back down
Though he won't get to see her, he still wants to stay
Gus
Michael really likes this kid
Why don't you go home, get some rest
Gus looks up
That might be for the best
: -   - Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table along with Dr
Maria and    - her whole "Cancer Team
" #1 The great news is
Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth
() The not so great news is we're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation
() So how should we proceed
Silence
Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to answer
No one does
Um,  feel like 'm not the most qualified person to answer that
#1 was talking to Dr
Simmons
(late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next
It's a strange case
Normally the tumors start resisting the treatment
But that hasn't happened here - yet
Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest
Unfortunately, the drug may be worsening the edema
48
But if we stopped it entirely, we're likely to face even graver dangers
So we're gonna do nothing
That's what we have to decide
The truth is
very few people have been on Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has
We don't really know the long term effects
That comforts no one
Can't  just get like a lung transplant or something
The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that one
" Eventually: You would not be considered a
strong candidate for a transplant
Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother her
Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a little bit
He grabs Frannie's hand
We're trying to prevent endothelial growth while at the same time preventing immunosorbent
As Dr
Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook, Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents
She hates what she's doing to them
And seeing them holding hands, crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory
: - We saw this once before
It looks like the end for 13-year old Hazel
Her father is weeping off to the side while her mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking: (through the tears) Are you ready, sweetie
13-year old Hazel nods
The doctors get to work
The anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under
But not enough
Cause she totally hears her mother say: won't be a mom anymore
49
She falls into her husband's chest
And we're  : - Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her staring at them
She tries to shake it off
Dr
Simmons is still talking nonsense when: have a question
Yes Hazel
Can  still go to Amsterdam
Dr
Simmons can't help himself
He laughs
Everyone looks at him
He clears his throat
That would not be wise at this juncture
Why not
Excuse me
Why not, Dr
Simmons
-- The doctors are trying to be delicate here
It would
increase some risks -- So does going to the mall -- Yes but an airplane
They have oxygen on airplanes
-- It's my life, right
You're Stage  -- 50
have this opportunity  may never have again
If the medicine's working,  don't see why -- Because, Hazel
() Look,  don't know any other way to say this
You're just too sick
And this is like a punch in the gut
'm sorry
Everyone feels horrible now
Dr
Maria, Frannie and Michael, and even Hazel
This meeting couldn't have gone worse
And we : '  - Hazel parent's bring her home from the hospital
She looks miserable
It's clear the last few days have been a big emotional set back
: '  - Her parents tuck her in
We'll be right outside
Hazel nods
Her phone buzzes
She looks at it
text from Gus that reads: "ok
" Hazel looks at it
And she doesn't write back
: '  - Hazel sits staring at nothing
The house phone rings
Michael comes in from another room with the phone in hand
Whispers: Gus again
Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no
Michael says into the phone
'm sorry Gus, she's asleep
Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed
51
'  - Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction
" Her phone buzzes again
"Augustus
" It just says "hello
" Again she ignores it
And then a second text
She looks at it
"The silence is deafening
" She puts the phone back down
Hazel's heart breaks
She can't take it anymore
She picks the phone back up
She texts the following: " don't know if you'll understand this but  can't see you anymore
mean  want to
just
" She thinks about the rest
She writes: "'m a grenade
" She sends the text
Waits
And then there's more to say
She sends a second text
"When  look at you, all  can see is what 'm going to put you through
can't have that
'm sorry
" She sends that text
Waits
He writes back
"Ok
" Hazel reads it
Writes back: "Ok
" beat
Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me
" Hazel smiles - she can't help herself
- but she must
She gets her emotions in check
Puts the phone away
: '  - An ugly day in Indianapolis
'  - Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather
The sky - and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day
'  - Hazel walks out back
Looks up at the clouds, threatening rain but not yet delivering it
She sits down in the grass, on the verge of tears
She looks at the old rusty that's been in her backyard for years
52
And starts to cry
Just for a few brief moments, she lets herself cry
Then she wipes the tears
Becomes strong again
And makes a decision
Hazel dials her phone
We hear: (
) Hazel Grace
Hi Augustus
(
) Are you crying, Hazel Grace
Kind of
(
) What's the matter
don't know
want to go to Amsterdam
And  want him to tell us what happens after the book and don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when  was a kid
It's just
everything
Hazel is on the verge of losing it again
few beats of silence pass by
(
) demand to see this swing set of tears
Hazel can't help but smile and we  : Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus
Which makes everything better
They both look at the swing set
see your point
() That is one sad swing set
Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder
Thanks for coming over
53
You do realize
trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you
Hazel says nothing
All efforts to save me from you will fail
Hazel looks at him
He's sure not making this easy
Is this about Amsterdam
Cause we ' -- It's not about Amsterdam
It's about me
It's about
Grenades
Hazel nods
get it
One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake
Exactly
There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy
Why add a third to that list
Am right
() That's why  don't have a hamster
Gus is silent
He can't argue
They stand there quietly a few more beats, looking out at the swing set
Until: We have got to do something about this frigging swing set
'  - Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post
Gus stands next to her
54
() "Swing Set Needs Home
" "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home
" "Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children
" Gus laughs
No
Gus laughs harder
Hazel laughs with him
That's why
Hazel looks at him, not understanding
In case you were wondering
that's why  like you
(beat, off her look) You're so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are
Hazel absorbs that
Her feelings for this boy in a tangle
: '  - Gus and Hazel watch as a  finishes loading the swing set into the back of his -
Gus salutes the swing set as the truck drives off
Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek
She shoots him a look
Gus throws up his hands
Friendly
She playfully elbows him away
- Hazel walks with Isaac out of Support Group
Do you like him
Of course  like him
55
But you don't want to hook up with him
Hazel doesn't know what she wants
It's complicated
'  - Hazel is at her computer reading a new email from Lidewij Vliegenthart
Clearly Hazel was not expecting this
(
) "Dear Hazel,  have received word via the Genies that you will be visiting us with Augustus Waters and your mother beginning on the 4th
week away
Peter and  are delighted and cannot wait to -- Hazel is confused
She stands and walks into the hallway
Mom
No response
Mom
( ) Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet
What is it, what's wrong
Sorry,
didn't know you were in the shower
() Bath
was just
just trying to take a bath for five seconds
What's the matter
Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off
just got an email from Peter Van Houton's assistant
She still thinks we're coming
Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel
Clearly unsure what to say
56
What
Frannie can't keep a straight face
'm not supposed to tell you until your father gets home
() We're going to Amsterdam
(still not believing) Really
Dr
Maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live -- () Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie comes to her and they embrace
After: 'm getting back in the tub now
When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone
Hazel sends Gus the following text: "   3
:-)" moment later Gus responds: "'
" Hazel is over the moon with excitement
She smiles, then tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing
(whispering to her lungs) One week, lungs
Keep your shit together one more week
- Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical equipment
Frannie makes breakfast as Hazel enters, now dressed and excited for the trip
Amsterdam
Amsterdam
And a moment later Michael joins them
57
Amsterdam
They're all going crazy with excitement
: - Michael finishes loading up the car
Kisses his wife goodbye
He embraces Hazel
She hugs him back and of course he starts to cry
() love you
'm so proud of you
For what
Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears
They look at each other
Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another hug
Hazel lets him, laughing
/   - The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes, another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc
Frannie pulls up to Gus's house
They get out of the car and head to the front door, buzzing with excitement
As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside '  yelling something unclear, followed by: (
) '  , Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly spins her back to the car
Mom
We can't eavesdrop, Hazel
Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait
Hazel unsure what that was about
Frannie politely honks the horn
moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling
travel bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips
( ) Always a pleasure to see you ma'am
() Hello, Hazel Grace
58
Ok
Ok
Ok
Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that
She just says, when they stop and look at her: Amsterdam
- helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and equipment
- They wait in line for the security checkpoint
When it's Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose
Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt
Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector
She seems determined to get through this without any help
But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these few steps without oxygen were a struggle
Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady herself
As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula back in place
Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and focuses on her breathing
She catches her mom looking at her, nervously
(with some difficulty) Amsterdam
- Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the : Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment
gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit
Oh that's not necessary
But they give up their seats anyway
Hazel and Gus take them
We see various Passengers watching
Hazel ignores the attention until a   (6, cute braids) appears
59
What's in your nose
It's called a Cannula
These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe
The '  swoops in, a little frantic
' Jackie
Oh, 'm sorry
() No, no
It's alright
Would they help me breathe too
dunno
Wanna try
Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it
Tickles
Right
think 'm breathing better
Well
'd love to give you my cannula but
kinda really need the help
The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly reattaches it
Thanks for letting me try it
They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to her family
She waves
Hazel waves back
(
) We will now begin pre-boarding Flight 144 to Amsterdam
For those passengers in need of extra assistance
think that's us
60
- Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at the window
He looks around, antsy
Have you never been on a plane before
Gus shakes his head, he has not
And he's nervous
He pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth
Within seconds a   rushes over
Sir, you can't smoke on this plane
Or
any plane
(cigarette in his mouth) don't smoke
The Flight Attendant shoots him a look
It's a metaphor
He puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him
( ) That metaphor is prohibited on today's flight
Gus nods and puts the cigarette away
"Flight attendants, prepare for departure
" The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards take off
Gus is getting more worried by the second
He grabs the arm rest, his eyes wide
Ok
Gus doesn't say it back
Hazel laughs
This is what it feels like to ride in a car with you
Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off
He looks out the window - they're flying
- and then back to Hazel
We're flying
Look
Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm
61
Holy -- look at that He's adorable at this moment
Hazel can't resist leaning over to give him a kiss on the cheek
(not looking up from her ) Just so you know, 'm right here
Sitting next to you
Your mother
We're just friends, Mom
She is
'm not
Hazel shoots him a look
Gus shrugs - "what, it's the truth
" Hazel just shakes her head
: Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep
Hazel and Gus watch the same gory action movie
Actually, he watches the movie
She just watches him watch it
He watches it with gusto
Hazel continues to watch him
Try as she might, she's falling in love
: : the  touching down
: /    -   - Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a
Americans
We're from Indiana
Indiana
They steal from the Indians but the keep the name, yes
Hazel and Gus share a look
Something like that
Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt tracks and the occasional concrete building
In other words, it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland
(to the Driver) This is Amsterdam
62
Yes and no
Amsterdam is like the rings of a tree
It gets older as you get closer to the center
Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to another universe but to another time as well
We see -   lined on both sides of a windy
float against the edges and everyone rides  down cobblestone streets
They're astounded
- Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room
We see a   of gifts - presents from the Genies - welcoming their arrival
Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed
'll be right down the hall
Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep
: - Some time later
Hazel stirs
Her Mom is seated in a sagging, paisley  across from the bed reading a
Good morning
Actually, it's five o'clock
How was the park
Never made it
Mom
What
like watching you sleep
Hazel shoots Frannie a look
Even in an exotic city, her Mom still can't enjoy herself
promise 'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner
What do you mean
63
You have reservations at a place called Oranjee
Mr
Van Houten set it up
Very fancy according to the Book
And romantic
Mom
'm just saying
16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery
is totally cool with you
Is that what you're saying
(beat, excited) Let's get you dressed
Hazel just shakes her head
: - Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored , cigarette dangling from his mouth
(calling to the bathroom) Hazel
Gus is here
( ) Looking sharp
Thank you ma'am
few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom
She wears a knee-length, pale blue
And she looks
Wow
() Am  under-dressed
You look gorgeous
Gus offers Hazel his arm
She takes it
They're ready to go
64
/  -    - Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the wind like a spring snowstorm
An   stands to give up their seats - this happens all the time
Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls on deaf ears
She and Gus sit
They look out the window onto the city
Excited
The night just beginning
- At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge
Hazel and Gus are shown to a  right next to the water
Your table, Mr
And Mrs
Waters
Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her
brings them a bottle of  as they sit
The champagne is our gift
Hazel and Gus look at each other
Is this a dream
The champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass
Ok
Hazel raises hers
Ok
They clink glasses and sip
Wow that's good
Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne
() `Come quickly,' he said
` am tasting the stars
' Hazel and Gus smile
Welcome to Oranjee
Would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice
Gus looks at Hazel
She shrugs
65
The chef's choice sounds lovely
(the Waiter nods) And can we get more of this
We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends
The Waiter leaves
Hazel and Gus look at each other
Thank you for coming to Amsterdam
Thank you for letting me hijack your wish
Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa
Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to
The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate: Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion
Hazel takes a bite
Oh my god
Yeah
Gus takes a bite
mean
That is just
There are no words
Meanwhile, down on the water a  passes, filled with merry, drinking
One of them raises a glass to them and says something in Dutch
( ) We don't speak Dutch
She says, "the beautiful couple is beautiful
" 66
Hazel and Gus smile
This night could not be going any better so far
: Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses
want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so  can take it to Vegas and marry it
Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather
like your suit
Thanks
First time wearing it
That isn't the suit you wear to funerals
Oh no
That one's not nearly this nice
(off her look) When  first found out  was sick - mean, they told me  had like an 85% chance to be cancer-free
Great odds, sure
But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail
() So right before the surgery  asked my parents if  could buy a suit, like a really nice suit, just in case  didn't make it
It's your death suit
That's what it is
have one of those
Bought it for my 15th birthday
Don't think 'd wear it on a date, though
Are we on a date
(cocks her head) Watch it
Gus winks
: Dessert on the table
As they euphorically eat: 67
God
Maybe
Angels
Undecided
Afterlife
No
Well
() Maybe  wouldn't go so far as to say no
just
'd like some evidence
( ) What do you think
Absolutely
Really
Oh for sure
mean, not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds but, yeah,  believe in something
Hazel is surprised
Something becomes of us
It has to
Otherwise what's the point
Maybe there is no point
refuse to accept that
() won't accept it
Hazel thinks about it
She appreciates his conviction but is still not sure she agrees
The hand they've been dealt too unfair
Hazel looks out at the water as she says: hope you're right
'm in love with you
68
That gets her attention
You heard me
-- 'm in love with you
And  know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and  know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and  am in love with you
(shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry
At which point, the Waiter reappears
More stars
Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on Gus
Eventually Gus answers for them
Just the check, please
No, sir
() Your meal has been paid for by Mr
Van Houten
Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel
This Van Houten guy is something else
- Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking out over the water
Seeds blow from the elm trees and the reflections of the city ripple in the water below them
Hazel leans into his body, just a little
They stay like that, savoring the best night of both of their lives
: -  - crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam
The buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in: 69
- Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room
really don't get that shirt
Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci 'est Pas Une Pipe
" ( painting of a pipe with words below that mean "This is not a pipe
") Van Houten will get it
Trust me
There are like fifty Magritte references in "Imperial Affliction
" () "This is not a pipe
" Exactly
But it is a pipe
No it's not
It's a drawing of a pipe
See
( ') All representations of a thing are inherently abstract
drawing of a thing is not the thing itself
Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself
Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed
When did you get so grown up feel like it was yesterday  was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue
You thought  was a genius back then
Why is the sky blue
() Because  say so
knock on the door
Gus pokes his head in
Who's ready for some answers
70
- Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house
'm so excited  can barely breathe
As opposed to other days
She playfully hits him
He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door
As they approach, there's a noticeable  coming from inside the house
It's the deep thump of a
Loud
Like, obnoxiously loud
Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks
They wait
There's no response
Maybe he can't hear over the music
Gus tries again, this time with more force
Still nothing
He tries a third time
Finally, the music stops
They wait
Still excited
moment later the door swings open
It's a    (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week-old beard
All he says is: What
Gus and Hazel look to one another
Could it be
Mr
Van Houten
At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces
Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react
Through the closed door, they hear this: (
) () --
'  (
) Are they here, Peter
So it is
Gus and Hazel can't believe it
(
) There are two -- () Who the hell's "they
" 71
'  (
) They are Augustus and Hazel, the young fans with whom you've been corresponding
Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names
Perhaps this will help things take a turn for the better
(
) The Americans
'  (
) You invited them, remember
(
) You know why  left America, Lidewij
To never have to encounter Americans
Get rid of them
Hazel and Gus can't believe it
This is terrible
'  (
) will not do this Peter
Be nice
At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way)
She virtually shoves Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel
And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten
One beat, two beats
No one knows what to say
Finally: Which of you is Augustus Waters
Gus raises his hand tentatively
Van Houten sizes them up
Without another word, he turns and walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar
Please
am sorry
Come in
Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes a step
Hazel follows
They walk: '  - Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile it's creepy
The walls are empty and white, there's a single couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair
That's it
Van Houten sits in the chair
Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and twist-tied
Trash
72
Fan mail
18 years worth
He never opens it
Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his slippers
He motions for them to sit on the couch
Yours are the first missives to which 've replied and look where that got me
Hazel and Gus take their seats
Scotch
Um, no thanks
Augustus Waters
It's 11am
Just me then, Lidewij
Scotch and soda
Perhaps some breakfast first Peter
She thinks  have a drinking problem
also think the Earth is round
Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it to him
He takes a sip, then sits up straight
So you like my book
Yes
We - well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you
Van Houten says nothing
Takes a long pull on his drink
Did you dress like her on purpose
(looks at her shirt) Kinda
73
Van Houten says nothing to that
do not have a drinking problem have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol:  can crack jokes and govern England and do anything want to do
Except not drink
He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass
Incidentally, thank you for dinner last night
( ) We bought them dinner last night
It was our pleasure
() You've come a long way so
what is it  can do for you
We have some questions -- Uh-huh
About what happens, you know
after
the end of your book
Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind
Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy -- () How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop
Hazel looks at Gus
Is he kidding
would say
limited
But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy's seminal album "Flacken
" Um
Lidewij
Play `Bomfalleralla' immediately
74
Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told
few seconds later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers
Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled
(yelling over the music) 'm sorry, sir
We don't speak Swedish
() Who the hell speaks Swedish
The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling
The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before Gus has enough
He gets up and turns off the music
Are you messing with us
Pardon
Is this some kind of performance
Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you
And  say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you
Hazel is really getting worried at this point
They came all this way for this
So anyway
when the book ends, Anna's mom -- (raising a hand to silence ) Let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise
Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats
Lidewij frowns, clearly feeling bad for them
Van Houten continues
The tortoise has a ten yard head start
In the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard
And so on, forever
() 75
(') You are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him, you see, you can only decrease his lead
Now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until Cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities
Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond
assume that answers your questions
( ) don't know what's going on
And yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr
Waters
(under his breath) Must be all that cancer in your brain
Peter
Gus could throw a punch right now
Hazel tries to calm the situation
Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec
mean, understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- 'm not interested in talking about that book
- but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right
said 'm not interested -- ( ) But you promised
( ) () 76
(') Mr
Van Houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here
We
need you tell me
Surely you've thought about it
mean, as characters -- Nothing happens to them
They're fictions
They cease to exist the moment the novel is over
This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear
She won't accept it
They can't
(again, has to calm ) mean,  understand
In a literary sense
But it's impossible  to imagine some future -- can't do this
Lidewij, get rid of them, please
(Lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to Hazel) won't indulge your childish whims
refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed
don't want your pity -- Of course you do
Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it
Peter
(on a roll) You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends
And we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines
We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough -- You are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives
() 77
(') You are a failed experiment in mutation
Lidewij has tears in her eyes
Gus has balled his fists
But not Hazel
Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit
She rises from the couch
Hey listen douchepants
You're not gonna tell me anything  don't already know about illness
need one thing and one thing only from you before  walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters
() cannot tell you
Bullshit
cannot -- Van Houten goes to take a drink but
Make something up
Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands, surprising everyone
After a beat: Lidewij
'll have a martini please
have resigned
Oh don't be ridiculous
No one moves
Van Houten realizes he's alone in this
'd like you to leave now
You're really not gonna tell us
would like you
to leave
78
Hazel is furious
Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is if to say "come on, enough of this guy
"  : '  - Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking
As they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say
Have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions
beat
Go fuck yourself
Van Houten doesn't have a response to that
He just shuts the door
And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional
Hey
It's ok
It's ok
(beat, an idea) 'll write you a sequel
(she cries harder) will
Better than any shit that drunk could write
With blood and guts and sacrifice
You'll love it
Hazel nods, then wipes away tears
She fakes a smile and Gus gives her a hug
Afterwards: spent your Wish on that asshole
You did not spend it on him
You spent it on us
They embrace once more
wanted
know
know
Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory
This gets a real smile from Hazel
That's when Lidewij comes outside
Clearly she's been crying too
'm so sorry
Circumstance has made him cruel
thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but
'm very sorry
79
Hazel says nothing
Gus holds her in a very protective way
Perhaps we can do some sightseeing
Have you seen the Anne Frank House
'm not going anywhere with that monster
He is not invited
- Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news
'm afraid there's no elevator
Oh, um, that's alright
No, there are many stairs
Steep stairs
can do it
-- can do it
Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today
They are going inside
: -   - plays on a  showing the Nazi invasion of Holland
Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of and  about to take the tour
Many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs
Shall we
Hazel nods
Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs
So far so good
They find themselves in an office space
This is the bookcase that hid the Frank family and four others
The  is half open
Behind it is an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time
80
Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs
Gus looks at Hazel - are you sure we should continue
She begins the climb, determined
Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen tank
Hazel moves very slowly
We are aware of her labored breathing the entire time
, watching and quietly commenting
Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages
Hazel arrives on the   - an empty room
She's definitely starting to struggle
She leans against the wall to catch her breath
Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow
You're a champion
Hazel smiles
When she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty
And another staircase, even more narrow and steep - practically a ladder
When Gus sees this he looks at Hazel: That's enough -- () 'm ok
Hazel very slowly begins the climb
Again we're aware of her every breath
It's dark
And it's becoming very difficult
Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through
Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the wall, trying to catch her breath
Gus crouches next to her
We're at the top
That's it
Hazel becomes aware that  look at her with concern
She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here
And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway
This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could
There's a   detailing their story
The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto, Anne's father
Gus takes Hazel's hand
don't know how you go on, without your family
81
Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit
Gus leads Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a details the last days of Anne Frank's life
Over it, we hear a  's  reading from the diary
The Travelers stand to watch and listen
Gus and Hazel do the same
The room is dark
'  (
) "At such moment's,  don't think about the misery
" Gus and Hazel stand very closely together
The video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day
Hazel watches it
'  (
) "
but about the beauty that still remains
" Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she watched him on the airplane
After a beat, she catches him
Their eyes meet
The emotions build
'  (
) "Try to recapture the happiness within yourself
Think of all the beauty in everything around you
and be happy
" And Hazel  Gus
most passionate, intense, you-and-me- against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've experienced or could even imagine
It seems to last for a small eternity
Eventually, they break away and open their eyes
They quickly notice all the Travelers staring at them
For a brief second, they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do
When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the whole thing
One  even shouts "bravo
" Hazel blushes, Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand
: '   - They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing
Hazel is very in the moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous
As they kiss: It's above my knee
She ignores him, more kissing
She takes off his shirt
It tapers a little and then it's just skin -- What
82
Hazel pulls away from him
My leg
() Just so you're prepared -- Oh get over yourself
Hazel kisses him again
Now he tries to pull her shirt off but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube
He can't figure it out
Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them
They shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical Hollywood movie moment
And yet, for them: love you, Augustus Waters
love you too, Hazel Grace
They resume kissing
And we  : - Gus wakes up in the bed
He looks around for Hazel but she isn't there
On the bed is a piece of paper
note
It reads: "Dearest Augustus
" Beneath that is a  , labeled "Virgins
" And in that circle is a    labeled "17 year old dudes with one leg
" We'll notice part of that circle is now outside the bigger circle
Gus flashes that signature smile
- Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at an outdoor cafe
They're re-enacting yesterday's events
"Get up you fat bastard
" " can't stand up, 'm too drunk
" said "get up
" "Standing is for fools
" God, what an asshole
They both giggle at the whole thing
83
It was awful, Mom
You can't imagine
And then what happened
Then we went to the Anne Frank museum
And after that
quick glance between Hazel and Gus
We just
walked around
Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it in check in front of her Mother
Sounds lovely
few beats later
Listen
'm gonna stretch my legs a little
Give the two of you some time to talk
(' ) Um
ok
As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and Frannie making eye contact for a brief second
Once Frannie has left them: That was weird
Gus doesn't respond except to say: Shall we
- They start to walk
Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack, sticks it between his lips
Hazel notices he's struggling with something
Augustus
84
There's something  have to tell you
They walk in silence a few beats
Just before you went into the hospital
There was this felt this
ache in my hip
Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming
Oh no
Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth tightly, trying not to cry
had a  scan
Gus sits down on a
Looks up at her
Tries to smile
Before he even says it, she knows
It lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel
Oh god
The lining of my chest, my liver
everywhere
Oh my god no
Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging him for dear life, her head in his lap
'm so sorry, Augustus
'm so so -- 'm sorry too -- It's so unfair -- should have told you -- It's so fucking unfair
beat
Gus still trying not to cry
85
Apparently the world is
not a wish-granting factory
And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful
But just for a second
Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears
Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace
'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time
She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly
He winces
Does it hurt
It's ok
() 'm ok
Ok
Ok
But of course it's not ok
Not by a mile
Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek
What
'm just
'm very fond of you
He grabs her hand and holds it
don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like 'm not dying
don't think you're dying, Augustus
You've just got a touch of cancer
Gus nods
Squeezes her hand
Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now
86
Hazel doesn't answer
She just kisses him, hard
And on the two of them, so in love, we  : - Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window, leaving Amsterdam behind
-   - As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing amongst the livery drivers
He holds a sign that says - instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and Gus)
" Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course
He kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug
Gus goes to shake his hand but Michael hugs him as well
: '   - Hazel sits with her father on the couch
Gus had a recurrence
() Mrs
Waters told us the night before you left
() 'm sorry Hazel
They sit for a beat
Tears form in Michael's eyes
You're not gonna say it
What's that
The usual
"Everything happens for a reason
" Michael shakes his head
don't know, Haze
() always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe
() that has not been my experience
Hazel understands exactly
: 87
'   - Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a  line now being fed through a port in his chest
Chemotherapy at work
Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company
How are your eyes
Great
Wonderful
mean, they're not in my head is the only problem
hate to one-up you but
seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so
Isaac nods
Tries not to get emotional but it's happening
He goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh
Whoa, 'm taken
Isaac laughs
(to Hazel, re: Gus) Did you write his eulogy yet
Hazel is confused
Dude
What
haven't asked her
Oh
() Oops
What are you talking about
My bad
( ) Augustus
Gus looks at her, grows a little serious
88
need speakers at my funeral thought maybe you and Isaac
but especially you -- Hey
Would you be kind enough to whip something up
(touches his hand) It would be an honor
They hold holds
You guys are adorable
Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm
How's your love life
Anything from Monica
Not a word
She hasn't even like, texted to ask how you're doing
He shakes his head
Gus gets an angry look on his face
That is so messed up
've stopped thinking about it
Moving on
There's a new girl in Support Group with these humongous - Isaac gestures to his chest
Hazel is confused
How do you even know that
'm blind but 'm not that blind
Hazel Grace
They turn to him
Do you happen to have four dollars
89
No one knows what that means
: '  - Gus is in the passenger's seat
Isaac sits in the back
Hazel returns to the car
With a
Ok now what
Gus smiles
: - Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring something down
Is it there
Oh it's there
they're looking at Monica's green Firebird
She's in the house
Who cares where she is
This is not about her
This is about you
(sticks out his hand) Hazel
Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg
Gus puts it in Isaac's hands
Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't see a thing - towards the Firebird
Isaac winds up and tosses the
It misses the car by a mile
After a beat: didn't hear anything
little to the left
My throw was to the left or should aim to the left
Aim left
Isaac turns his shoulders
90
Lefter
Isaac turns some more
Yes
Excellent
And throw hard
Gus hands him a
Isaac winds up and hurls it - missing the car again but hitting the
Bullseye
Really
No you missed it by like 20 feet
(hands him a ) Try one more time
Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight
Isaac's face lights up
Woo hoo
Isaac grabs for
Throws it
Then
He's a throwing machine
Most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself
Finally there's a   on the car door, triggering the alarm
Isaac pauses
Keep throwing, keep throwing
Isaac does
Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth
Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment
Eventually, '  opens the front door and comes out
' What in God's name -- Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks
Are you Monica's mom
' () am
Hello ma'am
Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge
We may not look like much
Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs
() 91
(') But we also have two dozen eggs
So If  was you,  would go back inside
Monica's Mom is very confused
beat
Without another word, she turns and goes back inside
The three of them celebrate
As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus on the cheek
And over we hear: (
) few days later, Gus landed in the hospital with chest pains
-   - Hazel bounds in to find Mrs
Waters in the waiting room
She stands to hug Hazel
They both sit down
How's he doing
He's had a tough night, Hazel
His blood pressure's low
His heart -- Mrs
Waters starts to cry
What about the chemo
(shakes her head) They're gonna stop the chemo
They both know what that means
Mrs
Waters gathers herself
Can  see him
() We have to be a family now
Hazel nods
She understands
We'll tell him you were here
If you don't mind, 'll just hang for a while
Mrs
Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy doors towards Gus's room
Hazel sits in the chair
Same chair Gus sat in while waiting for her
They've switched places
92
- Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a , to their spot on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones
"  second picnic, this time with champagne
Hazel pours some for them both into little Winnie the Pooh cups
She's trying to be upbeat - but it's difficult
Gus watches the kids play on the bones
What are you thinking about
Oblivion
Augustus
know it's kid's stuff but always thought 'd have a grand story to tell, you know
Something that would run in all the papers always thought  was special
You are
Yeah but
you know what  mean
Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side
Gus can tell he's said something wrong
What
do know what you mean,  just
don't agree
Hazel stands up, anger building
This obsession with being -- Don't get mad -- But  am mad
() think you're special, is that not enough
-- 93
You think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you
Well guess what, Gus, this is your life
This is all you get
You get me, and your family, and this world
And if that's not enough, well 'm sorry, but it's not nothing
Cause 'll remember you, 'll love you -- You're right -- And  just wish
just wish you'd be happy with that
You're right
'm sorry
(pulling her back down) 'm sorry
Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup
Raises his to hers in a toast
It's a good life, Hazel Grace
She softens
They toast
It's not over yet, you know
Gus nods
Of course it isn't
And yet they both know there isn't much time
: '  - Hazel is asleep
Suddenly, her phone buzzes
She looks at it - "Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am
pit grows in her stomach
quick panicked beat before she answers: Hello
(
) () Hazel Grace
() Oh, thank God
Hi
Hi,  love you
(
) 'm at the gas station -- 94
What
(
) Something's wrong
You gotta
please come help me
/  '  - Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually finding herself at the Speedway gas station
Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next to it
She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door, and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and blood
She gags from the smell
() Hi
Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to his belly
She sees something is leaking from the sticking out of it
() Oh, God, Augustus, 'm calling 911
No
Please
Hazel, listen to me
Do not call 911 or my parents -- 'll never forgive you -- Don't, please
Gus starts to cry
Please just look at it
Hazel lifts up his shirt
His  is bright red
think it's infected
Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up
Gus, what the -- why are you here
Why aren't you home
Gus throws up
He doesn't even have the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap
Oh, sweetie
wanted to buy some cigarettes lost my pack
Or they took it
() 95
(') don't know
They said they'd get me another one but  wanted
to do it myself
Do one little thing myself
Hazel doesn't know what to do
can't fix this
have to call someone
'm sorry
No, Hazel, please
But she must
She gets out her cell phone and dials
At which point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying teenage boy that he is
As Hazel dials, we hear: (
) wish  could say Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky
(to himself, shaking) hate myself  hate myself  hate this  hate this
(
) but that is not what happened
An  loads Gus into the back of an
Hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back
As the car starts moving, Gus grabs her hand
Read me something
Read you something
Do you know any poems
know one
Read it to me
"The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos Williams
(beat, tries to remember) "So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens
" 96
() Is that it
That is it
But there's another ten minutes of driving to do
Hazel thinks fast
No of course not
Um
what else
() so much depends/ upon a blue sky/ cut open by the branches/ of the trees
/ So much depends/ on the transparent -tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy
Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious
Hazel cradles his head in her arms
And continues
So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe
As Gus is drifting off to sleep,  : (
) One of the less bull-shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the "Last Good Day
" '  - Gus comes home from the hospital
He does not look good - but he lives
Hazel is there to help get him inside
'  - Gus no longer sleeps in his basement
Nor does he sleep in his own bed
He sleeps in a   set up in a guest room
Hazel is with him
They're watching sports on
(
) This is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours
'   - Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air
She sits there reading a book
Gus just sits there
His eyes staring off into nothing
Hazel waves to him
Gus looks over, as if waking from a dream
She manages a smile
He manages one back
97
(
) when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a minute bearable
'   - Hazel sits at dinner with her parents
She is barely touching her food
(
) The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing that your last good day is your "Last Good Day
" At the time, it's just another decent day
The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it
Hi, Augustus
(
) Good evening, Hazel Grace
His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it
(
) Quick question for you
Did you ever write that eulogy  asked you to prepare
may have
Excellent
Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes
Um
sure
Is everything -- (
) love you Hazel
The call ends
Hazel, confused, stands to go
gotta go
Finish eating first
can't,  have to meet Gus
98
You haven't eaten a thing
'm not hungry
You can't not eat, Hazel
am aggressively unhungry, ok
-- have to go
Sit down
No
Hazel, listen to your mother
Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders
You have to eat, Hazel
You're not gonna starve yourself to death just because Gus is sick
You have to stay healthy -- can't
can't stay healthy because 'm not healthy, Mom
am dying
am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and 'm sorry, but  can't do anything about it, ok
Just leave me alone
Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately regrets this
You heard me
Frannie has tears in her eyes
Hazel looks away, feeling terrible
You heard me say that to your father
Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter
99
Oh god, sweetie
'm sorry
was wrong, ok
It wasn't true
It's not something  believe
Michael sits across from them
As long as either of us is alive, will be your mother
Even if you die,  -- When
Even when you die,  will still be your mother
will always be your Mother
By now Michael is crying too
They all are
worry that you won't have a life
That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something
We're not gonna off ourselves
It's gonna hurt like hell to lose you -- Hazel
You of all people know it's possible to live with pain
She takes that in
It rings true to her
Hazel nods
don't just sit around, you know
Hazel is confused
Frannie looks at Michael like, "should say something
" She goes for it
'm taking some classes
Online
To get my master's in social work
You are
Hazel is stunned
So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always -- 100
Working or reading
If  get my ,  can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing with -- Why didn't you tell me
Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say
We didn't want you to feel -- Are you kidding
Mom, this is awesome
This is fantastic
Oh my god
Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug
'm so excited
You're gonna be so great, Mom
Thank you
That means everything to me
Mom and Daughter hug
And when it's over: 'd still really like you to eat
know Mom
And  will
promise
But right now
really gotta go
- Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his wheelchair
Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner than any young man should be
But for now, he's happy
Hazel Grace, you look ravishing
know, right
() So, um, what's going on guys
You're late
Late for what exactly
101
Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does
wanted to attend my funeral
By the way, will you speak at my funeral
Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses him on the mouth
Sweet
'm hopeful 'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure,  thought 'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but  thought 'd arrange a pre-funeral
Why now
No time like the present
(looks around the room) How did you even get in here
Would you believe they leave the door open at night
Um, no
As well you shouldn't
He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus
Hazel laughs
Isaac clears his throat
"Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard
But we forgive him
We forgive him
not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more
" 17
'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard
mean seriously
(back to the speech) "Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral
And he was pretentious
() 102
(') Sweet Jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production
And he was vain
But that comes with superhuman handsomeness
" Gus nods - that part is true
"But  will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on,  will tell the scientists to piss off, because don't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters
" Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate emotional waterfall
"And then, of course, having made my rhetorical point,  will put my robot eyes on because,  mean
robot eyes
" Gus has a big smile on his face
"So anyway, Augustus, my friend
Godspeed
" Gus nods a couple times
Thank you Isaac
This causes Isaac to lose it
He clings to the lectern
Goddamn it, Gus
Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus
Shit
Ass
Balls
Isaac sighs
Wipes away the tears
And another beat passes
Can  get a hand here, Hazel
Hazel remembers Isaac can't see
She rises, goes up to get him, walks him back to her seat
Hazel Grace, it's down to you
103
Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais
Takes a beat to ready herself
"Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life
Ours was an epic love story, and  won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears
() Like all real love stories - ours will die with us, as it should
'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one 'd rather have
" And that's all she can get out before falling apart
She lets it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together
(beat, composing herself) " can't talk about our love story so instead  will talk about math
am not a mathematician, but know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1
There's
1 And
12 And
112 And an infinite collection of others
Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million
Some infinities are bigger than other infinities writer we used to like taught us that
want more numbers than 'm likely to get, and God,  want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got
But, Gus, my love,  cannot tell you how thankful  am for our little infinity
You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that  am eternally grateful
love you
" Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes
: Over which we hear a
'  - Hazel turns on the  by her bed
Her   is ringing and it's 4am
She knows instantly
104
(
) Augustus Waters died eight days later in the
Hazel's head falls into her chest
(
) when the cancer, which was made of him, stopped his heart, which was also made of him
Her bedroom door opens
It's Frannie and Michael
This only confirms her worst fears
She starts to cry
Her parents embrace her in the bed
(
) It was unbearable
The whole thing
Every second worse than the last
'  -  - Hazel sits in the car in the dark
She's blaring the loudest music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the horrors of the world
Over which we hear this: (
) One of the first things they ask you in the  is to rate your pain on a scale from 1 to 10
'd been asked this question hundreds of times and  remember once, early on, when  couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, and the nurse asked me to rate the pain and though  couldn't speak,  held up 9 fingers
The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped
She falls apart nonetheless
(
) Later on, when 'd been feeling better, the nurse came in and she called me a fighter
"You know how know," she said
"Because you called a ten a nine
" '  - Hazel puts on her funeral dress
She looks in the mirror
(
) But that wasn't the truth
The reason  called it a nine was was saving my ten
105
- The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters
Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back, watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters family and extend their deepest condolences
(
) And this was it
The great and terrible ten
When Mr
and Mrs
Waters see Hazel, they open their arms
He loved you so much
Hazel nods
Hugs them back
He loved you so much too
More  approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in the receiving line
Her eyes turn towards the
She's not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath, wills herself to walk towards it
Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee
Immediately, Hazel breaks down
And immediately, she catches herself
It's ok, you hear me
It's ok
She leans forward and kisses his cheek
She looks around
Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of the coffin
approaches at that moment
think we're ready to begin
Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in the middle of the room
Augustus Waters fought hard for many years
His battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us
Hazel frowns
This is all such bullshit
And she hears: What a load of shit, eh kid
Hazel recognizes that voice
But it doesn't make sense
She turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten
106
Let us pray
Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes
Hazel keeps staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing
We need to fake pray now
Van Houten bows his head
Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected appearance
Now  call on Augustus's close friend Isaac to say a few words
Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help
Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten
Yup, it's really him
That makes no sense to her
Isaac starts to speak
Of all the things 've lost in my life, this hurts the most
And Isaac stops talking
It's unclear if that was the end or if he just can't go on
He returns to his seat
The Minister walks back up
And now we'll hear from Gus's
special friend Hazel Lancaster
Hazel stands, walks up to the podium
few titters in the room at the words "special friend
" was his girlfriend
Some laughter from the crowd
She takes out her notes
There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain
" Hazel continues to speak but we over it,   instead: (
) didn't believe a word, of course
But that was ok
Funerals, 'd decided, aren't for the dead
They're for the living
Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word
: 107
- Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground
Everyone but Hazel
She looks off into the distance
Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the burial
He's watching Hazel
: Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents
'll be fine
Are you sure
We can drive you -- No, 'd
'd like to be alone for a while
Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot
As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches
Could  hitch a ride
Hazel doesn't want to help this man
Just to the bottom of the hill
Hazel exhales
Fine
Once they're both in the car: How did you even -- The internet
And you just
bought a ticket
The drinks are free drinks in First Class
Van Houten removes a  from his coat pocket
Takes a swig
Hazel shakes her head in disgust
Starts driving
Omnis Cellula e cellula
Hazel ignores him
Your boy Waters and  corresponded quite a bit in his last -- You read your fan mail now
108
would hardly call him a fan
He despised me
But he was quite insistent  attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother
So here  am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula
'm so not in the mood -- "Life comes from life
" Goodbye Mr
Van Houten
You don't want an explanation
Nope
Thanks though
Have a great life
You remind me of her
() remind a lot of people of a lot of people
She was eight, my daughter
She suffered
beautifully
For so long
Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens
She had leukemia
Like Anna
Just like her, yes
Were you married then
Not when she died, no
was insufferable long before Anna, my dear
Grief doesn't change you, Hazel, it reveals you
Hazel takes that in
Well 'm sorry for your loss
109
And 'm sorry for yours
'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip -- You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole
We had an awesome trip
Hazel, 'm trying
'm trying
You asked me to tell you what happens and  wish  could do that
wish that  could
But  can't
No one can
No one knows, Hazel
They don't talk to us
Unless
Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper
He hands it to Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball
You think  care about that don't give a shit, Van Houten
Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten
You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure
And 'd like you to get out of my car right now so  can go home and grieve
() -- Get out of the car
Van Houten knows he's too late
He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road
He stands there as Hazel peels out
In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the , as if toasting her
She blinks away some tears and drives
: '   - Hazel lies in front of the
"Top Model" is playing but she's lost in her own world
Tears fall from her eyes and she can't do anything to stop it
Hazel gets up
- Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps
Soon there's a knock
110
( ) Occupada
(
) Can  come in
Hazel leans over and unlocks the door
Michael kneels down next to her, putting her head on his shoulder
Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more
Michael squeezes her tightly
And this time, he doesn't cry
'm so so sorry
() It was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it
Hazel nods into his shirt
Then looks up at her Dad
Gives you an idea how we feel about you
Michael smiles at Hazel
And he doesn't cry
Hazel draws strength from him
'  - Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window
They sit on the roof
Do you know if it hurt or whatever
He was really fighting for breath, guess
He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything
Dying sucks
( ) It just seems so impossible
Happens all the time
Are you angry
Very
111
Me too
(a few beats) Gus really loved you, you know
know
He wouldn't shut up about it
know
It was annoying
didn't find it that annoying
They sit there in silence a few beats
Did you read the note or whatever from your author friend
He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that
We talked at the cemetery
Said he came all this way to give you that
Yeah well 'm over it
never want to read another word of that asshole's again
Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus did
() What
That's what he said
Gus had written something, sent it to Van -- Hazel sits up
Her heart is racing
What
have to go
Are you
112
do it all the time
Go
As quickly as possible Hazel leaves
Isaac stays behind, enjoying the cool night
new day is coming
/  '  - Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her
She's about to give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath the passenger's seat
She reaches under, pulls it up, and unwraps it
As she reads,  : ' Mr
Van Houten, 'm a good person but a shitty writer
You're a shitty person but a good writer
We'd make a good team
don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what  saw you have plenty, please fix this for me
It's a eulogy for Hazel
Hazel is overcome with emotion
' She asked me to write one and 'm trying,  just,  could use a little flair
See the thing is
we all want to be remembered
She smiles to herself, remembering: - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other
- The staring contest in Support Group
' We all want to leave a mark
- Driving (badly) in Gus's car
- Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones
" ' But not Hazel
Hazel is different
Hazel knows the truth
She didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one
And she got it
Maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply
And isn't that more than most of us get
- And    reading the letter, tears in her eyes
' When Hazel was sick,  knew  was dying
But  didn't want to say so
113
- Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the
She sleeps
He kneels by her side
' She was in  and  snuck in for ten minutes and sat with her before got caught
Her eyes were closed, her lungs were intubated
Gus takes her hand and holds it
' but her hands were still her hands, still warm, and the nails painted this dark blue back color and  just held her hands and willed myself to imagine a world without us and what a worthless world that would be
-     reading the letter
She never knew that story, never knew he was there
: '  -  - Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen tank dragging behind her
She lays down on the grass and looks up at the stars - the same  that opened the movie
' She's so beautiful
You don't get tired of looking at her
You never worry if she's smarter than you cause you know she is
She's funny without ever being mean
: - The magical dinner at Oranjee
- The bench in which they sat overlooking the water
- The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house
- Falling onto the bed together
[All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the movie, only now, we  the oxygen tank, we  Gus's leg, we the fumbling and the difficulties etc
They don't make these images less beautiful
They make them twice as beautiful - because they're real
] ' love her, god  love her
'm so lucky to love her, Van Houten
() 114
'  (') You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a say in who hurts you
-    Hazel in the grass
She holds the letter to her chest
single tear falls onto her cheeks
' like my choices
hope she likes hers
Hazel
' Ok, Hazel Grace
beat
Another
Hazel
And she says to the universe: Ok
