She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side
She holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself

Knowing that  could be assassinated at any moment,  feel it's important that some people should understand my thoughts

Hey
'm Harvey
(so what
) Okay, Harvey
Today's my birthday
(Scott laughs) No, today is actually my birthday
Well, tonight
At midnight
Really

And, believe it or not,  don't have any plans
People took me out after work
(looking him over) Work
So, that would be
Let me guess
Ma Bell or &
The Great American Insurance Company
'm part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess, you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from Vietnam to diaper rash
You left out bad breath
Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth
Scott laughs
They both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor
, Harvey has to work fast
So
You're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you
(gently teasing) Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute for a suit
But  don't do guys over forty
Well then, 'm in luck
How's that
Because 'm still thirty-nine
(showing Scott his watch) And it's only eleven-fifteen

Ice cream, cookies, milk, berries
It's over the top and adorable
Where are you from
Jackson, Mississippi
Well, this isn't Jackson, but you still can't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform
It's too dangerous
Now you tell me
There's nothing tougher than a New York City cop
They're arrogant, and they're everywhere
'll show you the cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you'll be careful
little Scottie-san
Are you on uppers or what
No
This is just
plain old me
You're afraid of the cops
'm just discreet
know a lot of people here
If they found out, could lose my job
(meaning a closet case) Oh
You're one of "those
" (examines Harvey's eyes) think you need a change of scenery
New friends

need a change
(looks at the clock) You're forty now
(just the truth) Forty years old and  haven't done a thing 'm proud of
(re: the desert tray) You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty
(laughs it off) No
Don't you worry
won't make it to fifty
Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face
Harvey reacts
Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover
They kiss
The mess getting everywhere
Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair
(') (an idea, half-jokingly, -) Why don't we run away together
Where to
16
- '  -   - : Harvey speaks to the tape recorder
(Throughout the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is telling us things no one else knows
) In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go
To drop out
To fall in love
16A
-  - (1972) 8MM    of Harvey and Scott  - , long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving 7
through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into San Francisco
(
) But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up
Crime-filled
Drug-filled
The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley
Six blocks square
The Castro
17
- Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts   of Castro Street
:   , a  , empty buildings, boarded windows
Harvey points the camera toward The  of the Castro Theater, big letters spelling out
"
" Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray- haired,  of a liquor store
Harvey snaps  of his face, an expression of distrust
Harvey  a  in the liquor shop window that reads: "
" Harvey's  focuses on  , , , one puts his arm over the other
To Harvey's eyes it's a very new site
It's overt
Thrilling
Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a hanging out front

'  '   - The place is  with   from a record player
Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera
Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through the large, empty windows
cashed my last unemployment check yesterday
Well,  hope you did something useful with it
bought an ounce of pot
was just wondering if you had any () 8
(') plans, or thoughts
About us doing something to, you know, bring in an income
Don't move
Harvey straddles Scott
He begins   of him
suppose  can wait tables
No way
want you right here with me
Did you see place downstairs is for rent
Yeah
was thinking we could open a shop together
What kind of shop
One with very little overhead
Not too much work
little one, just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere, New York
20
-  (1973) Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a (with a few, not very impressive, products)
Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside the store's large window hanging a sign: "
" Just a little to the left
The old liquor store owner from earlier, , crosses the street to watch
Harvey gives him a warm welcome: (') Hello there
'm Harvey Milk
You're the new renters
Yes
Welcome to Castro Camera

Harvey extends his hand
McConnelly shakes, but is wary
(') want to join the, um
What is it
The Eureka Valley Merchant's Association
want to help in any way possible
'm no interloper
Jew perhaps, but  hope you'll forgive that
McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window
don't think your application will be approved, Mr
Milk
This is a family neighborhood
Your kind are far more welcome on Haight street
(trying to keep it friendly) What "kind" do you mean, sir
(not playing along) The Merchant's Association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors
Based on what law
There's man's law and there's God's law in this neighborhood and in this City
The San Francisco Police force is happy to enforce either
(to McConnelly as he walks away) Thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood
We pay taxes you know
Harvey grabs Scott's hand
keeps him from heating up, from pouncing
It's not the time for them to bite yet
21
'     -- Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is , totally energized
10
We'll form our own business association
Start with the gay- owned businesses
We'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film
We'll ask them what they want to see done here
what they want changed
We'll get money rolling into this neighborhood
Revitalize it
Can  come in now
(
) One more minute
(back to his new scheme) 'll go to the neighborhood banks
They must have some gay customers
Harvey
What's with all this political activist crap
thought you were a goddamn Republican
Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of food
He sets them out on a small dining room table, still rambling on to Scott in the bedroom
'm a businessman, Scott
think businesses ought to treat their customers right
Even their gay customers
For God's sake, this is San Francisco
Harvey
It's just like every other city in this country
People hate us
Big surprise
We should have at least one block in one city right
Start there and take over the neighborhood
(a smile) Okay, you can come in now
Scott heads toward the kitchen
The table is   with a home-cooked meal,  and a huge bouquet of
Wow
This is-- 11
Harvey     into Scott's face
Payback
Happy birthday
Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear some of the   onto him
22
- The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street Fair
The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate outside Toad Hall bar
:    -,   milling about, eyeing the scene skeptically
Harvey     with Scott, shaking hands
Thanks for the party, Mr
Milk
Thanks for joining the Castro Village Association
Harvey arrives at       winding out of the Irish liquor store (from earlier)
He squeezes past them, into the store, leaving Scott outside
(') Excuse me gentleman
ladies
(finding the shop owner) Hello
Mr
McConnelly
McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new business
(') just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing
Fine
So you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you
McConnelly grins, uncomfortable
The line of gay men is curious about the hubbub
Point made, Harvey does a 180
12
(') No
No
Just a joke
Mr
McConnelly here loves our kind
Spend away
(to McConnelly) Tell your wife Hello for me
Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and    , It's quite the show
They step back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing
Gay men watch
Some clap
Harvey grabs Scott and spins him through a sharp waltz
the pair at home in their new neighborhood
23
- '  -   - And people started hanging around our store
Not customers
Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home
26
- sign goes in the window: "We are  open
" 27
- are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings of Harvey's entourage
Harvey moves among them, sharing a clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the arts, and checking out the cute ones
(
) There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art student who 'd picked up at Toad Hall
Turns out he was also good at running the Camera Shop
something Scott and  found we had surprising little interest in
, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless
Opera is passe, Harvey
It's about street theater, now
What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions
Danny jumps up and  the     of an opera diva, making Harvey laugh
13
(
) (') Jim Rivaldo
great mind
great wit
Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro
including himself
flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of Harvey's desk
He seems to be looking for something to occupy his keen mind
sharply dressed young man, 20s,  , walks up to peek over his shoulder
(
) (') And somewhere along the line Jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin
Dick Pabich
And of course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids
hands Scott a
(
) (') And on occasion we actually had a real customer
But only occasionally
, Scott is waiting on a , he's out of place: straight, gruff, a union man,  , 40s
Harvey
This guy wants to talk to you
(approaches Allan) Welcome
What can we do for you
Hi, 'm Allan Baird
Teamsters representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California
Everyone, this is Allan Baird
He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves
was told you were like the Mayor of the Castro, said you organized the , you might know some people in the bars
14
do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet
What's that
The Mayor part
've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans
But if  could be of any use, 'm all ears
We can't get Coors to go union
These guys are like me, they can't be out of work too long
Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his nerves
It's Harvey at his best
'm just curious
Are we your first stop or your last
(clearly his last) It's been a tough one, Mr
Milk
Well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer
If we're going to fast for your sake,  think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you
() Is that what you really want
And allies
'll have Coors out of every bar in the Castro by the end of the week
Deal
(nods, sincere) Thank you Mr
Milk
15
: Allan is on his way out
Harvey walks back behind the counter to Scott
No more Coors beer
It's gotta come out of every bar
Gay and straight
What's he giving you
Nothing for me
That's a convert
convert to what
The cause
27A
- : Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps, throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons and tape up "Dump Coors" posters
(
) got "my people" to get Coors out of all the Gay Bars
30 million bottles worth in San Francisco alone
Coors beer immediately fell from number 1
They caved
One week later, union man Allan Baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive Teamsters trucks
We weren't just a group of pansies anymore
We had a neighborhood
We had the unions
And for the first time, we had a little bit of power
27B
- '  -   - Maybe that was the day someone first called me the "Mayor" of Castro Street
(a knowing grin) Or perhaps  invented it myself
28
- Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits of working within "the system" versus dropping out
Everyone is talking over each other
16
runs into the store
The fucking cops, man, they're up on Castro Street
Toad Hall
Harvey and the guys race out of the store
29
- Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one of the Castro   where crowding around the entrance
Clear the sidewalk
Some of the   move out of the ' way but some of them don't move
The  start  them
Harvey, Scott and the  try to break into the crowd, to get closer to the fight
To pull the cops off their friends
Danny  , snapping  of the event
Scott  his way past the cops down hard on '
30
'  '  - Scott sits on the toilet
Harvey rinses blood from a white washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's
if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests-- You're gonna run for Supervisor, is that the idea
(-) could go right for mayor, but think  should work my way up to it
You'll be my campaign manager
17
() Because  have so much experience in politics
Politics is theater
It doesn't matter if you win
You make a statement
You say, "'m here, pay attention to me
" Harvey, you do that every time you cross the street
Coors looks like it might cave
The union boys will owe me
Imagine if we get their vote
It'll be fun
Fun
Harvey starts kissing him all over
We'll make it a spectacle
31
- Harvey walks down to Market St
with a box
He waves, shakes, flirts with everyone
His warmest hello is from a gruff Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart
Harvey sets his box down right beside a

week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail
The charges, "Blocking a Sidewalk
" Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a blown up  from his shopping cart: (') --Let us have our tax money go for our protection and not our persecution
Worry about gun control and not marijuana control

(') School supplies, seniors, not what books  read-- Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine
Harvey does a well timed take

Scott unfurls three hand made "   " banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart

Harvey   anyone and everyone, shaking hands if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight people, gay people, even buttoned down  who cross the street to try to get away from him

/18TH   - Harvey hands out campaign literature to a
Public dental care for retired people

Harvey is distracted

At 18, he looks 15

Where are you from, kid
() Sorry old man, not interested
Where's home
Phoenix
'm Harvey Milk
'm running for Supervisor
What's your name
19
Cleve
Jones
Well Mr
Jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you
Fuck that
Elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation
Is that right
Do you trick up on Polk Street
(only half-joking) If  need the cash
But 'm selective about my clients
Tell me one thing before you get back to work then
What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix
faked a lung disease to get out of
So what
What are you, some kind of street shrink
Sometimes
But what 'm saying is, Phoenix can change
But we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors
(turns to go) Well, good luck with all that
You know what  think, Cleve Jones
That you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking
No
That you need to do what you're good at
Be a prick
Fight City Hall
Fight the cops
Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do

Sorry old man, 'm leaving for Spain tomorrow
Europe
Got all the cash  need in my back pocket

He used to come into my shop
Are there any witnesses
Just the "trick
" Jerry Taylor
Jerry wasn't a trick
They were lovers
Call it what you will
He's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers

There'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe
You're the Mayor of Castro Street now, right Harvey
You really wanna help
Get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh

Well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and other straight candidates they consider "gay-friendly
" Who cares about those old queens
Scott is laying down on
Why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting
'm beat, Harvey
passed out flyers for seven hours straight
In the bathhouse
(giving it right back) People in bathhouses vote
'm tired
'm taking a nap
Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment

Danny quickly gathers the and puts them back in the envelope

Just checking the exposure
That a new boyfriend
He's very cute
(taking the photos, embarrassed) Um
Thanks, Harvey
(to Jim) So who are these so-called "gay leaders
" And who appointed them
And what are you suggesting, Jim, that 'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement
, , opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching Harvey
-- We're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they hell are they
David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house-- mansion-- --in Atherton
(clearly shaken) Harvey, you should read this
as it goes from Thelma to Harvey

You will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off
" () 23
(') () 'm calling the police
They probably wrote it
(off Scott's anxiety) Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, 'll get the sympathy vote, right
Could be just the push we need
You think this is funny
Look at it
Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott
It's a complete joke
No rhythm
No humor
It's insulting
: Someone has drawn a   of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc
Harvey makes a : He sticks the  to the refrigerator, the first thing he'll see in the morning
Don't do that
If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier
Now it's there
We'll see it every day
It can't get us
All this energy
to make yourself a target
And what for
Something we have no chance to win
Harvey wraps his arms around him
keep telling you, it's not just about winning
38
'  - Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a allowing his entry
Scott, even scruffier looking than Harvey, stands next to him
(
) The "top gays" in San Francisco were David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes
David was a () 24
(
) (') rich old queen who'd bought the biggest gay magazine, The Advocate
He had it delivered to subscribers in brown paper bags so no-one would know
That's how he lived his life, covered up, discreet

was very discreet
But someone spotted me at the opera, sitting in a box, next to my lover
And  was fired
That's when  decided to do something
So bought The Advocate
And  use my money and my influence in quiet ways, to do what  can
Endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us
Yes, if they're friendly to our cause
() Politics is complicated in San Francisco, and Supervisor is a citywide office
Political alliances need to be built
You can't simply move here from across the country and run for office
But  am running for office
'm on the ballot
have the union rank and file, the seniors, and  could use your magazine's endorsement
25
Harvey, we're like the Catholic church
We welcome converts, but we don't make them Pope the same day
And why haven't you run
It's too early for a gay candidate for Supervisor
Especially one from the Castro
It's bad for the community's image
Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and sopping wet
What's wrong with the Castro
Nobody works there
It's all sex and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own problems
The cops come into our neighborhood and beat us
They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered
Then we file a lawsuit against the city
We go to our political allies in City Hall
There are no real gay allies
Yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it
It's not life or death for them
We need our own in office
You can't demand acceptance overnight
Why not
How can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, David
26
The more aouta you make us, the more you incite them
Step back and quiet down
Go back into the closet
Is that what you're saying
Because  know the closet
lived in it for more years than  care to remember
(rising to go) don't need your endorsement
'm not asking anyone for acceptance
don't have time to ask
For you, politics is a game, a lark
Like putting on a rock festival or staging a "love-in
" You're too old to be a hippie, Harvey Milk
Harvey turns around, ready for a fight

The movement is the candidate
There's a difference

Young, old, gay, straight
but a weight hangs over the day
(
) When the vote came in on election day

Not cute

You're not fooling anybody

For two
Lily, is this from one of my kind
No, no
You won't run into the owner

" And this time we weren't running for City Supervisor
This time it was bigger, California State Assembly
50
/   - It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos
It's a racket
It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force
It's Racist
Homophobic
How many people do you consider enemies, Harvey
've counted five already
Art smiles
Chuckles flutter through the audience
You're right, Art
And many are your closest friends
You see, don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine
Machines operate on oil and grease
They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator
Mr
Milk, 've worked for years as a social worker in this city know Sacramento

Agnos

You replaced Scott with a lesbian
Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North
She's very organized
How do you know she's not a plant from Rick Stokes' campaign

(cheers from the audience) Now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the-- Not in my mind they haven't-- That's it
In your mind they haven't, and 'm wondering why-- Mr
Milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal
But it's not illegal to be a homosexual in California
And your law goes even further
Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired-- True
But, gay people don't have children of their own
If they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away
That's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them
( ) How do you teach homosexuality
Like French
was born of heterosexual parents,  was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society
So then why am  homosexual
And no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their () 82

Same thing with  Harvey, we put out publications about  so you can avoid it
(with a grin) But you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group
So why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers
Boos from the conservative audience
We are not talking about homos
child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual
If we took heterosexuals out  homosexuals out, you know what-- (') --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers-- --No child molestation
So you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation
(getting more lost) No, no, 'm not saying that at all-- 85
That's what you just said
No
'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group-- Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument

Harvey takes the opportunity to rip into the State Senator: (directly to Briggs) --Sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed
How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop
The crowd boos, rails
This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange County
In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by the level of hatred
Harvey tries to maintain his composure

It feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey
All 'm really saying is, if we don't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they can't refuse to hire him

Anne is behind him
He picks up the phone
It seems urgent
Hey Jack, what's wrong
123
'  - Nothing
just want to know when you'll be home
You just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance
Did you do this on purpose, Jack
It's poop, Harvey
Aren't  more important than poop
Yes, but
don't know when 'll be home
Maybe 6
6:15
Fine

Harvey hangs up
His patience is slipping
He looks up in time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase

/ '   - Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out
Dan
How's the baby
You didn't bring up Supervisor pay raises
In fact,  heard you plan to publicly oppose them
heard you planned to vote against them too, Dan
Were you trying to set me up
(parrotting Harvey ) () 87
(') It's not a good time for me to bring it up
Politically
Dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and 'll consider backing pay raises
(suddenly very dark) don't trade votes
unlike you, the way  was raised, we believe in right and wrong
Moral and immoral
Black skin and White in your police department
(Dan steams) Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out against Proposition Six
You're looking more and more out of touch
If  come out against Prop Six, it's only for the invasion of State's rights issue
(smiles, trying to lighten) And the potential witch hunts against you "straight people," right
Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response
He can't
His behavior is alarming
He sets down his briefcase
You underestimate me, Milk
You're very, very wrong about me
don't know what you mean
moment
Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears
(') What is it, Dan
You can tell me
You don't
You can't humiliate me
And you will not demean me

Anne appears down the hall
Dan has more on his mind, but the moment has passed
He picks up his briefcase and walks out of the building
Off Harvey, concerned
125

shouts: You're the asshole that just passed that dog shit thing aren't you
What the hell do you have against dogs
(with his trademark charm) Sir, blind people can't see "shit
" What the heck do you have against blind people
The young folks surrounding the  laugh and hoot at Harvey's joke
Even the harassing  can't help but crack a grin
Harvey beams
126
'  - Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans
Pushing through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up the stairs and through his apartment
Odd notes are taped to the walls
They all lead to a black velvet curtain with a note attached: "' , ,
" Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose

He is mesmerized
horrified
He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down
He cuts through the rope and     with the 127

Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled by Cleve and Anne
Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up
Harvey
Look at me
Look at me
You did everything you could
No,  didn't
Not everything
89
What else could you have done
could have come home at six o'clock, not six-fifteen
Scott puts his arm around Harvey
Harvey buries his head
Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes
Cleve quietly reads a prominently placed one: "Beware
The ides
Of November

Jack was gone

There was no choice but to keep on

Several other   are in chairs beyond him
Harvey turns to the make-up artist
With sincere enthusiasm: Thank you for this great honor
But do you think once the magazine is done snapping pictures, maybe could keep the suit for a while
129
- Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the streets of San Francisco
He waves, smiles, poses for photos with tourists
It's a rare moment of grace
He jumps on a trolley headed toward Castro
He instantly captures the imagination of a small  wearing a knit hat
(re: their hats) Would you like to trade with me
No
What the heck are you
Oh, me

He makes a show of it

Jim fills up a map on the wall
San Bernadino is coming in

Of course not
How not good

Same in Fresno
Dear God, little Lotus Blossom
Harvey is stunned
Other districts follow with similar results
They go up in red on the map
Imperial is 69% "for" so far
Put it up on the board
Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss
He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot
Cleve comes up to Harvey, concerned
(') The whole world is watching this
This is San Francisco we're about to lose
Are you ready
can have 15,000 people in an hour
But there's gonna be riots if this thing passes
(darkens, pointed) There goddamn better be
(stops, a beat, then:) What are you telling me
91
can't say it because 'm a public official, but for God's sake, if this thing passes, fight back
Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words
Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone
Don Amador down in
(reluctantly answers) Kind of a bad time, Don
(
) No sir, this is Paul
Don just gave me the phone
Paul who
(
) You talked to me on the phone a year or so ago
'm from Minnesota
'm in a wheelchair
: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end
(a beat to take it in, then:) thought you were a goner, Paul
'm sorry
should have called
When  read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat,  got a friend to put me on a bus to
Who did you know in Los Angeles
Nobody
That's the uh
just didn't want to die anymore, sir
(Harvey's at a loss for words) met your friend Don down here turned 18
voted today against Prop Six
Thank you, Mr
Milk
No
You did this all by yourself
92
don't think 'd be alive right now without you, sir
You were right about
It's like gay Disney World
Then you have to see San Francisco
Okay
will
Don wanted me to um
congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight
Congratulations Mr
Milk
Harvey turns back to the map
Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in county with green
On the other end of the phone, Harvey's friend in , Don Amador, is back on the line
(
) It looks like we've taken County, Harvey
By 65%
It's huge
gotta go, Don
Thank you
(frantic, to the room) by 65% put it up
Put it up
The tone in the room is changing
Jim storms up
The polls were off
Briggs is going down by more than 2 to 1
The only district where it's leading in San Francisco is Dan White's
Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map
Anne, Dick & Jim, all the volunteers
What this apparent win means to him, to his people
To Cleve: Well crap Cleve, now what are we going to do tonight

93
To the gay community all over this state
my message to you is
so far a lot of people joined us and rejected Proposition Six, and now we owe them something
We must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them
We must continue to speak out
and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out
() Tonight
Tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us
And now that they do, they see we are not sick
they can feel we are not wrong
and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there
to all those afraid of this wave of hate
to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns
tonight we know there is a place for us
My brothers and sisters
we can come home again
The crowd goes

Moscone walks up onto stage and lifts Harvey's hand
Harvey is now a member of the political elite
Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps off and disappears into the crowd

Cleve catches up, looking at Harvey, probing: What's the matter
You ever heard of sore losers
Well, 'm a sore winner
thought we were goners
(-) 'd started looking forward to the riots
94
told you,  don't "do" losing
think maybe we're best with our backs to the wall
It's too quiet
(a new idea, what's next) think we should march on Washington
next year
Milk, you're a decent politician, a mediocre businessman, but you're a lousy gay man
(Harvey knows what he's getting at) Take some time off
Fifty's right around the corner
(a devilish grin) Nobody will want you after that
can handle
(smiles, incredulous) The people voted for us, Cleve Jones
They did
There's nowhere to march tonight, Mr
Harvey Milk
Lets go back inside
Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame

It's addressed to Moscone
He seems oddly calm
Could you give this to the Mayor for me
As soon as possible

There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from most passersby
His newfound political muscle is evident
He comes face to face with Dan White
Morning, Dan

just resigned
Congratulations
'm sure you're pleased
Harvey doesn't know what to say
Dan's right, it does make him happy
But it's not that simple

Something bittersweet lingers

He looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window
They make eye contact
It bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost
139
- Something's snapped
With adolescent frustration in evidence, Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters
It was a major decision on Friday that  had to come
to arrive at
But since that time, people unknown to me, plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office, that they support me
So 'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people
140
/  '  - Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk
He gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding his job back
What do you think they promised him
Or worse, how did they threaten him
97
man has the right to change his mind
Give me some peace
How many of our propositions has Dan shut down
We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense
Cement rent control
It's his vote on this Board that stands in our way
get it, Harvey
've been lobbied all week
Enough
Let me just remind you that you're up for re-election
If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote
They listen to me
You won't get elected dog catcher
(stern, silent, a beat, then:) 'll make my decision on Monday

He dials the phone

Finally, a voice picks up on the other line
Hello
: Scott, half asleep
Sorry to wake you up
What's wrong
went to the opera tonight
Guess who my date was
Who
Bidu Sayao herself
She was in the first Puccini  ever saw
The crowd went wild
It was like  was young again, seeing my first live opera
If you go to the opera again, you should call me
Really
Scott gets out of bed, considers his words
It's intimate
99
Yes
'd go with you

Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection
An unexpected tear rolls down his cheek

That'll really shake up the Board, huh

If Dan shows up, just avoid him
We don't need a scene today, right Harvey

It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people
Write that down
Tell President Carter we're coming after him next
'm going to deposit this

Harvey is with a , preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway

Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office

Oh no

Harvey turns away
Another bullet rips into his chest, and he falls to his knees, now facing the window
He staggers toward it
The moment is extended as we see Harvey's  of the Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it

If there should be an assassination,  would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise

1978 - Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal: 103
of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality, sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones
up Market Street to the palace Harvey dreamed could be his own: City Hall
(
) --If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door
And that's all
ask for the movement to continue
Because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power
it's about the "us's" out there
Not only gays, but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's
Without hope, the us's give up-- As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place their candles around the statue of Lincoln

So you, and you, and you
