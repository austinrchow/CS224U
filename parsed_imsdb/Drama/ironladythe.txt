It's nearly all familiar faces, William, Michael and his lovely wife- Jacqueline
smiles, clearly reassured- And then there's Peter, James and James  and that very nice man- Yes- - we met last year
Yes  remember- think he's bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit
We're rather short on women - but 'm sure we'll manage- 've always preferred the company of men- gestures ahead,  nods, reticent, yet forcing herself on, she hesitates at the door, her hand trembling on the handle

They'll be nationalizing the bloody air next
Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's government property
So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts
Oh, yes, to his core
And Mayor of Grantham
And a grocer as well
Yes
Ears prick up around the table
The Host is lost for something to say
And did you help, err, in the
shop
Oh, yes
It was a family business
very good starting point for the political life, 'm sure
That and a degree from Oxford
The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to smile

She remains unruffled and goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork, working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres

The  of conversation all around- 1949
Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her theme
What  do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet
Yes we help people of course we help people
But for those that can do, they must just get up and do
And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and  something about it, change things
The female guests exchange glances
half-chuckle from someone
With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham- Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too
Really
general sense of quiet incredulity
know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income
Just like the man or woman on the street, when  am short one week,  have to make economies the next
Nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility
22 man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping
'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need
They see industry being nationalized, the unions on the up, the pound on the slide
whoever can sort that lot out - he's my man
Or woman
Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and hostess exchange looks
He signals `Get them out of here'
The men rise
Ladies shall we
Miss Roberts, do join the ladies
The ladies scurry to the sitting room
Margaret is the last to leave

As Margaret closes the door to the dining room - (

That's told us
The men laugh raucously
She turns to the ladies who are regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with suspicion

She is flushed and nicely mellow surrounded by mainly  - So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you'd been Prime Minister

No, uhm, yes - we have always lived alongside evil
But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion
So, would you - Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age
Unimaginable
Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening party- The Prime Minister gave a very good statement  thought
Yes

Quite a smoothie
Laughter- says final farewells to a guest

You were remarkable
hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself

Now its about trying to be someone

Well anyway,

Good night to you

26 Yes

You are a grocer's daughter- (fiercely) -And proud of being- He grabs her hand, silencing her
