Written by Rob Festinger & Todd Field : ' We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers
long rutted road stretches into the distance
Faintly at first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with laughter
We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a hill
Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years younger, in hot pursuit
Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient apple tree
We rise out of the grass and see the two young people under the tree
They are entwined - in a deep embrace
We see them in glimpses: Their eyes - Lips - Hands Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest
She reaches out and strokes his hand
He stares at their fingers mingling together
The woman sighs
Love it here
know you do
can feel my life - ya know
He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd

You have been listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game
This broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and cannot be-" - - The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year old clapboard two-story affairs
'  - Standing
on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from the opening scene,  , prett - eautifl actually with a little more sleep
She stands wit two small boys who are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air
Her son 8 , and his brother  4, who has his face buried in his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen
The truck comes to a stop and two men get out
One is young, early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his face full of warmth
He walks over to Natalie and gives her a kiss
The young man from the opening scene, rRANK
The other man leans back against the passenger door
He is in his early 50's
Kind face, good looking, athletic in his day - Frank's father,
He smiles at Natalie
Natalie smiles back
Morn'in Dr
Fowler
Morn'in Natalie
How you doing boys
Great
Jason starts for the truck
Matt opens the door and the boy climbs inside the cab
Frank kneels down to Duncan
Hey buddy
you upset that you're not coming
Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder
Duncan pulls away
Frank looks up to Natalie for help
He can come if he wants
we can manage, really
She smiles and shakes her head
ahead
He wants to stay here
Don't worry Dunk
You can come next time
,Qy Natalie kisses him and they're off
-  - Jason in the middle
He glances over to Frank - a trace of hero :worship in his face
&   - Sardines are processed at lightening speed
We follow them on their journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into cardboard shipping boxes
They are taped shut by a young man we will meet later (, 3 )
The tops read  &
- - double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping
Several men turn their bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs to their equipment, and so on
scribbles some figures on a wall that has been used as a scratch pad for years
Two scales are emptied of   into a
- pair of    shuffle down a gangway
The bucket sways directly over them
small hand struggles with the weight of the thing
pair of   waders appear - the shoes stop
strong hand grabs hold of the handle - the shoes pick up the pace
- Matt & Frank prepare the rig
Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in
field of stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a collection of  ,  and coiled stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem exotic
Jason's eyes find the hull of "" an old Boudreau built lobsterboat
Starboard side covered in barnacles
'mon up Jace
Hold on a second
Need to know if he's ready first - Jason, can you tell me what's important
Jason hesitates
on tell h () " shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark afternoon, a note in music-- He takes a breath
and the way the back of a baby's neck smells if its mother keeps it tidy
" ( ) You taught h' well
Jason beams
- come aboard sailor
Matt reaches down to give a hand up
Frank turns the engine over
It roars to life
The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "" glides out of the channel and past a  that sits Just off the point of a good sized
Jason shields his eyes with his hand
He gazes out at the island
Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap onto his head
The crown reads
Thank you
Ever been over there
No sir
It's beautiful
Isn't an island anymore though
It's a city
They have electric lights
Artesian wells, even a jail lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's run by a computer When  lived there, had no ferry then` so we didn't even have cars, can you believe that
How'd you get back
Off the island
Jason nods
We rowed
Matt smiles at the memory
Then we got a little outboard
That was great
seven and a half horsepower it was - we lived there until  was about your age - then we left and became "harbor people"
Jason seems to be digesting this
a "harbor person"
Matt hides a smile about to form
Yep, Jason - we all are
Jason is full of questions
Matt knows the answers and doesn't talk down to him
Something the boy is grateful for
At the helm
His eye s inted from glare and cold
He cuts back on the throttle s and heads for the winch
pull up a -  and slide the into the
surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge
He opens the doors
His hands work quickly and efficiently
He tosses a   back into the water, pulls out a and measures the back
Too small
Then a nice sized is pulled out - it's missing the
He hands it to Matt
Baits the trap
Throws the winch and the next pot surfaces
Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap
He reaches into a of   with a   and bands the crustacean's remaining
Jason stares at the disfigured creature
Oh boy you see what happened to this poor fel ow
what
Well, the trap has nylon nets called heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the lobster can crawl in
The "Bedroom" head inside, holds the bait and keeps it from escaping--you know the old saying "two's company three-s a crowd"
Jason nods
Well{ it's like that
You get more than two in a bedroom and chances are something like this is going to happen
That's why Frank can't leave these traps for more than a day
Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up
There are black balls on both sides of the tail
Now the older females like this of gal, are the most dan erous - especially when they're growin' eyries
Berries
Eggs
one of these can take out two males easy - Then you wind up with lobster you can't sell - and as for this fine lady, she gets off easy, the state says you have to let her go
Matt throws her back in the water
Holds up the other one to Jason
Can you handle this
Jason nods
() You sure
He really isn't
Matt hands it to him
Go ahead now, put it in the tank
Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough
- Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot
The grass is manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in their garden
In the middle of this sits a two story cape, post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful, d you on't freeze in the winter
The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops the gate
Resting on the bed is a   wit a line drawing of a -
Hey, dad can you give me a hand
The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame
Frank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set
Higher
are everywhere
serious Super Soaker Squirt Gun fight in progress
a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs & burgers
spatula flips a patty
The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able radio
, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works the grill
Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for forty plus years
Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie
Sets it down and searches through a plastic bread bag
Willis looks past him, distracted
h, Ruth hates this kind
What
bought the wrong buns
Maybe we can borrow hers
Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction: She-s bent over to wipe the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap)
Ah, what  would give to have back my youth
Willis, you never had that in your youth
The woman turns around and catches Willis staring
It's Natalia
Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag
Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts,  , 50-- Father
You made it
Hey, if  don't see you fellas here, don't get to see you at all
He backwards-hugs Natalie
You want a beer
think 'll see if your Mom needs any help
Good luck
She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and escapes inside the house
Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream
Jealous
Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly, nods
-   - Natalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine a half finished   that sits on a card-table next to a jigsaw puzzle
She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink
She takes a breath and starts there
- Frank reaches into an old Westinghouse refrigerator
He pulls out a case of Schaeffer's and a six-pack of Moxie
He loads it all into a metal tub filled with ice
YO0 Frank, hunched over as he works, loo

Over the left sply
hair-net nests on his head
Thanks for coming by
Wooo, is that new cologne
You really oughta take a shower when you leave that place
Very funny
Take off that head dress, chief, and give me a hand
Tim reaches up and pulls the hair-net off his head
-   - Tim and Frank lug the heavy cooler around the house, heading toward the backyard
So, Mr
Strout mentioned you again
bet he did
Seriously, man
He still talks about you coming back
Says you're the best can packer he ever had
Be nods
He always was a nice guy
() Are we there yet
Tim and Frank emerge from the side of the house
Willis cuts them off, grabs two beers
Excuse me boys - an offering
Catch Father
He throws one to Father Oberti who sits talking with Willis's wife 50's, she is tal ing the priest's ear off
Becky went to the hairdressing academy after high school, but aft she got married and had the boys, she decided she wanted to stay home - she still loves doing hair though
Where do you go Father
just go to Super Cuts
10 You can't request the same girl at Super Cuts - you have to take what you can get
They don't know your hair - how can you get a good cut i they don't know the air
Father Oberti has the patience of
well,of a priest
- 50, attractive, is washing and arranging vegetables on a plate
Natalie chops carrots on a cutting board
They barely make eye-contact
Natalie attempts small talk
Can you hand me that bowl dear
She does
Thank you
'm looking forward to the concert on Labor day
The music is so
unusual haunting really
Ruth keeps chopping
Natalie chooses her words carefully
How did you learn about that particular style
At Faro y thesis was on Eastern European
folk music
Natalie's lips tighten uncomfortably
The topic seems to int date
() thought o becoming a teacher
Why didn't you
The answer to Ruth's question (Duncan) wanders in
His cheeks as big as Dizzy Gillespie's
What are you eating
Duncan's mouth is so full he can hardly speak
nothing
The two regard each other How is it
() Good
He tugs on her shirt
Swing me, Swing me
Okay, okay Dunk
She gets dragged out of the kitchen
The screen door slams
Ruth finishes arranging the plate
Matt enters, and starts opening up the cupboards loo king for something
He squats down, burrowing into a cabinet
It was nice of you to invite the boys
She hasn't brought them before because she's embarrassed
She shouldn't be embarrassed
Matt looks up from the floor
( ) Nice view from down here
She ignores him, but smiles
- is hunched over, with his arms gentl wrapped around Jason, coaching him on the finer points of Kitting
While Tim pitches
There you go 0
good, hands up, higher
That's it
Be - your knees - Duncan is being pushed by Natalie, Ruth, watches from the kitchen window
- : Ruth, staring out the window
12 don't know why you had to put that monstrosity up
You're just going to have to take it apart when they leave
Matt rises, a bottle of lighter fluid in hand
'mon, Ruth, he's a kid
What did you expect
"Happy Birthday, here's a box
why don't you drag it around for a while
" He s a kid
He wants it now
Something across the yard catches her attention
Oh, no
- Matt exits the house
Duncan jumps off his swing and sprints
who has just arrived
He stays at the far end of the yard
Duncan does a running jump into his father's arms
Daddy
Frank with Jason, looks up
Jason sees his father
He doesn't move
Natalie walks over to Frank, they exchange glances
'mon Jason
No
Now
Shedgrabs his hand
Straining to appear casual, traverses the Richard play-boxes Duncan
Duncan looks up at his mother
Daddv's takino us to the arcade
13 Richard, eating Duncan's hot dog, rises to meet Natalie and Jason
Hey there buddy --
Come on over here Jace- Jason looks away
( ) told you held come uttface- Jason reaches over and whacks Duncan on the head
() Hey Jason - Don't do that to your brother
You want me to do that to you
He probably has
Jason backs away
Frank makes his way over to Natalie
Matt watches on- absently flipping burgers
Ruth comes over to h ' - Ruth shakes her head
Richard, Frank and Natalie are talking, but there are long pauses between words
Tim wanders over and says something to Richard Finally, Richard smiles, turns, and exits
Alone
Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard
Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly
Matt takes a breath, and exhales
He turns to Ruth with a comforting smile, but she's just entering the house
The screen door closes behind her
-   -  - Ruth is at the counter pouring dressing onto a salad
Frank comes up behind her and hugs her
Thanks for doing this mom
Are you alright
Sure
Natalie and  want to take you and dad out tonight
Oh that's very sweet dear, but we already have plans
You going over to the Grinnel's
Ruth shakes her head
() Your father's taking me to the Strand
Oh, what are you seeing
The first film we ever saw together
- Matt & Ruth sit watching
The duel between Barry Lord Bullingdon is on screen
Bullingdon's pistol misfires
Sir Richard this pistol must be faulty - must have another
'm sorry Lord Bullingdon but you must first stand your ground and allow Mr
Lyndon his turn to fire
That is correct Lord Bullingdon - your pistol has fired and that counts as your shot--Mr
Lyndon are the rules of firing clear to you
- Lord Bullingdon are you rsdy to receive Mr- Lyndon's fire
-
o yes - 15 very well then - Mr
Lyndon cock your pistol and prepare to fire
Bullingdon is overwrought
He looks like he may vomit
Ruth leans over to Matt
Let's go
Ruth gets out of her seat
Matt looking confused follows
- Ruth heads out the doors with Matt on her heels
What's wrong
don't remember it being so tragic
h h always felt sorry for Barry
Please
No,  mean it - maybe  relate to him
What are you talking about
Well, we both married above our station
Don't start that again
moment
He takes her in his arms and kisses her
Looks into her eyes
Happy anniversary
() Happy anniversary
He buries his face in her hair
9 ` love you
know - 16 - Ruth sits at her bureau facing the mirror
She be ins a nightly ritual of removing the pins from her hair once ma e from the shells of tortoises and now the plastics of Dupont
Matt lies in bed reading
He lowers his book and watches her brush her tresses with on y, delicious strokes
She sets down her bsh and turns
Matt ooks back to his book
She climbs into bed next to him
She's not divorced yet
It's the same thing
Maine has crazy laws, that's all
he likes the boys
You don't think he's thinking about- No
he's not going to marry her
Then what's he doing with her
She probably loves him, Ruth
Girls always have
Why can't we just leave it at that
Hmmmm
He won't listen to me
asked him three times to dismantle that swing-set
Oh, let it stay up
Looks like a young couple lives here
He needs his head in school
Not in her
So to speak
Ruth pinches his shoulder
it would help if you were my side
() 'll get on your side
She laughs and pushes him away

He pauses to catch-up on the latest exploits of  &
The nurse,  40's, calls out from the alcove
Mr
and Mrs
Adamson

Matt finishes bandaging his elbow - then listens to his chest with a stethoscope
He is careful and thoughtful
Alma looks to him
Worried
You can put your shirt back on now
Alma stands and helps her husband dress
Yesterday he was up and around all afternoon, but toda - he tumbled
He's fallen down twice
have all  can do to get him up
He's weak and the longer you lay in bed - the weaker you get
Elwyn, you need to do those exercises, you promised me, twice a day
know you miss the work - important
but it's ) Man idn't have ache nor pain--he's just gave up-said when he couldn't work no more, he didn't want to live
For a while he'd sit and just mend on nets - but he can't do that anymore
(speaks with difficulty) How's your dad Matt
'm sorry Dr
now Elwyn you remember Jesse Fowler passed on somi&ime back, we were at the funeral
Remember
Elwyn nods
18 Matt knows
He's heard this before
Sometimes he feels more like a mechanic than a doctor, working on old cars with parts that have long been discontinued
He nods sympathetically
' Matt pulls on his jacket
He passes Janelle in the hallway as he heads for the back door
'll be back in an hour
Forgot my lunch
Starting to become a habit
can get you something from Willis's
He's already out the door
- Matt trots down the gangway and up to where the "" is moored
He looks in
No sign of Frank
from a new 35ft
- it belongs to   50's
Just missed him Matt, he went home for lunch today
Right
forgot he's got that interview
- Matt enters
Looks around
Calls up the stairs
Frank
Frank
Hello
Dad
Matt turns around, and sees Frank, Frank
What are you doin
Thought you were driving to Boston for t at interview
rank slowly nos
His clothes are rumpled
yeah - he we rescheduled
() uh huh
19 - walks out, from a room in the hall
She combs her hair through with her fingers, but her skirt, on backwards, is somewhat of a giveaway
Frank rolls his eyes
Hello, Dr
Fowler
Hi, where are the boys
() with my mom
Then
( )) oh-Like coleslaw
Matt sits across from Natalie and Frank
Sandwiches, iced tea and coleslaw are laid out
Frank looks to Matt for some kind of acknowledgement of his lunch-te activities
Matt seems more interested in the slaw
'  - Frank is sandwiched between Matt and Ruth
They are surrounded by dozens of young parents
Ruth doesn't look too tilled to be here
Wave you guys
Matt and Ruth follows Frank's gaze, to: Natalie has her hands full adjusting Jason's uniform while Duncan clings to her
She is waving up to the Fowlers amidst the chaos
The Fowlers wave back
%, Matt 's suddenly inspired
He leans in past Ruth, to Frank
Did you tell your Mom how good it was
20 How good what was
Frank had quite a time this afternoon Loved your coleslaw
Ate enough for two
That's what it's there for
Frank leans back behind Ruth to give his father the evil eye
He gets a grin from Matt for his trouble
Ruth almost catches it
Matt rises, shuffles past Ruth and Frank, whom he gives a firm pat on the knee
Hot dogs
'll take one
Ruth puts her arm around Frank
(re: Duncan and Jason) So, how are the kids
Frank's caught off- guard
He shakes his head
things okay
Fine
Good, good
Then
How'd your interview go
( ) Great
Oh, good
Ruth watches Natalie below
She's such a brave girl
That's it
You' re driving e nuts, Ma
Really
've had lots of girlfriends
don't understand why this one is any different
know you don't
Were not serious, Mom
No
No
It's a summer thing
She would like to believe him
see
'  - Natalie drives down Emerson Road
As she approaches her house, she sees a Brown Suburban sitting in her driveway
She looks confused
'  - Natalie enters with groceries
Richard is seated at the kitchen table
He's finishing the first half of a sandwich
He drains a glass of milk
Natalie sets her purse down on the counter, and starts cleaning up his mess
How'd you g et in this time
( ) chimney
She takes the carton of milk that Richard, no doubt, left out
She pours the final drops into his glass Thank you
She throws the carton out
She takes a seat, and stares at him like a teacher counselling a troubled youth
22 What can  help you with
He kicks back the last of the milk, wipes his mouth
was just dropping that off for Jason
What
That
He points to a   sitting on top of the microwave
inscription bears his name and "Rockland High School 1982 Regional Championship
" didn't know where you'd want to put it
It was about time he got it
What am going to do with it
Richard's wistful gaze stays locked on the trophy
For a moment, Natalie's and slips away
think it will mean a lot to him, Richard
He's really been improving lately
(a sharp turn) So 've heard
It would have been nice if you'd come to his game
just got your message
Where are t with him
That's none of your business
see
They're my kids but they're none of my business
You know what  mean
-
Richard presses his fingers to his eyes
He takes a long, heavy breath
- -  was thinking about moving back
Here
With you and the boys
23 What are you talking about
What  talking about
'm talking about moving back, that's what 'm talking about -  know what you're thinking, but it's different now
Oh reall
How's the job
Your father t ake you back on at the cannery
() That's funny
You're still getting checks aren't you
She ignores him Ya see my new rig out there
Natalie looks annoyed
Yeah - it's real nice
It's not exactly new,  traded David the truck for it
It's got room for all of us - a good grocery gettin car
moment
You wantta take a ride
() Jesus - you don't change, do you
Change
No,  don't change
Everything around me changes
You change
You take my house, you take my kids, you fuck this other y- No,  don't change at all
It's not your house
Oh- No
o
No- And as far as fucking oes -
who was it that answered your phone t %e other morning
She
2- don't care
Really, you can just stop now
It's not working
He takes a breath
just want
-a chance
For what
To fool them for a few days into thinking they have a real father, and then it's back to (cutting her off) their father
() No, Richard
You know what defines a father
It's what he does, not what he promises
It's being a positive, consistent presence
Richard eyes her suspiciously
13 (mimicking  her ) "Positive consistent presence
" Wow
What does that mean
just don't get it
But 'm not fucking a college boy, am
Look
can you just go now
really don't want you here when they get back
Oh, no, wouldn't want that
He doesn't budge
You have to leave
Finally, as if struck b some small discove
Richard places his large hands on the kitchen table and pus es himself up
He heads past Natalie without looking back
He closes the door firmly be ind him
'
'   -   -, Frank's truck parked out front The lawn is littered with the boy's various plastic weapons a small wading pool
25 children's television show is heard from inside
Natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge, nursing a beer, and sharing a cigarette with Frank, who is on his hands & knees finishing an elaborte structure with a set of  wooden blocks
You know 've been ignoring our difference in age, but if you keep playing with those blocks, 'm gonna start to worry
They're not blocks - they're gifts
'm sorry  know they're a gift and a very generous one
'm gust concerned that Dunk
might think e's a little old to be playing with them
They're not for playing - they're to learn about unity & balance
Froebel called them "Gifts
" This is the second gift - a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder
five year old can learn the difference in form depending on how they look at them
Why didn't he say so in the first place
Oh ou said second gift
How many are are there
Twenty
moment
You've been pla in with these - excuse me, working wit t ese for how long
Since  was about Dunk's age
My mom took me tough all twenty
So that's what a good mother does
oh
0 Come on down here and take a look
She sets down her beer and Joins him
The small wooden structure looks like a home that could have been built by Lautner or Wright Frank looks pleased
Natalie is distracted
26 Your Mother gave you these Frank -  feel funny Duncan having them
Don't be silly, it was her idea
() Really
You're not looking at the house - look
It's not all mine, it's part Mack
Frank speaks excitedly, as he makes a quick sketch on a colored piece of construction paper using one of the boys' markers
See the whole ideal of what Mack was trying to achieve was a common area in the middle of the house
mean - a large, common space wasn't uni e to Mack, but the idea of separating the family so that the kids were on one side and the parents on the other, so they would all spill into the center
He looks over to Natalie, checking in
She smiles, and shifts her gaze
'm boring you, aren't
() No, not at all,  was just
just thinking
About what
About you
,school, 'd rather talk about our house
know you would
What if  wait a year
year's not going to make a difference
27 You can't do that, Frank
've thought a lot about this
But you told me it takes forever just to establish yourself
Exactl , so what's a year in forever
Know w at Duncan said today
She can't suppress a smile
You wouldn't be changing the subject would you
Yes
What now
He said, "Frank,  don't think Jason really understands girls
" () He didn't
He did
"understands girls
" What did you say
said, "give him time, Duncan
" They both break up
didn't know what to say
if this is how he is now - boy are we in trouble- He stops short
The word - We - hangs in the air
They watch each other, unsure of how to react
Changing the subject quickly
Frank reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys real musclebound superhero
Somewhat grotesque
(reading the tag) Richard gave it to Dunk for his birthday
28 Frank sets it down
The     rake across - Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's classroom
Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess
The girls are in shorts and -shirts, one with a picture of the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther
Bri ht bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s: This afternoon they were sw' ng
few look sleepy enough to be in bed already
Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping time and controlling the dynamics
single girl sings "The Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices
They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice
" () Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool water
There is my dear village and in that village, the prettiest girl
Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their ease they whistle
The music transports these girls - who are normally pre-occupied with images of  and Brad Pitt, to a place of pure self
The song ends
That was really good
it's 7:30 we should stop
The girls gather up their things quickly
Remember when you sing these words- The way we feel about the harbor, is how the Balkans felt about the river Sava
The girls start out of the room
Listen to your tapes "Moilih Tan is still very rough and we've of a 40 minute program to get ready by Labor Day
-  - Ruth enters
She's beat
She starts to put her purse down, when : Matt, kneeling in front of the reclining chair
It's back is to her
Just hold still
29 Ruth drops her purse and quickly comes around the recliner
Something stops her
Oh my God
Matt holds Frank's jaw
He gently turns his face toward the lamp
Frank has stitches over his right eye
The blood under the white of the pupil oozing
Both lips are bright and swollen
Come on, Frank
Hold still
Ruth hovers, in shock
This was her husband, wasn't it
Frank nods wearily
Ex, he dropped in
He takes the compress from Matt and gingerly applies it to his forehead
Press charges
No
What's to stop him from doing it again
Did you hit him at all
Tell me you hit him
Enough so he won't want to next time
don't think  touched him
Matt pulls up the skin around the bloody eye
Jesus, Dad
Ruth stares at the Hospital band around Frank's wrist
8 -` So what are you going to do
() Take Karate
30 That's not the problem
You know you like her
like a lot of people
What about the boys
Did they see it
They were asleep
Did you leave her alone with him
He left first
She was yelling at ham believe she had a skillet in her hand
Oh for God's sake
( ) Did you call the police
Not yet
You didn't call them
When was  going to call the police, Ruth
He just got in
Ruth scans the room
Where's the phone
hold on a second, Calm down
Let's just talk about this
Ruth wavers
Now the cops'll go to her place first -- and it'll scare the hell out of the kids
Matt
%, We have to call them Frank
It wasn't that serious
31 Of course
Just like the relationship isn't serious
Ruth, this is not the time
Well, when is the time
After he knocks him into a coma
This is stopping
Now
Oh really
Come Fall, you're on a plane
Are you taking them with you
How- do you think the boys will feel when you disappear
This isn't just some sweetie from Vassar, that you'll see on holidays, Frank
You're not in this alone
Frank rises and leaves the room
Please listen
The sooner you end this thing the better
Ruth exhales
She returns to Matt, who is leaning against the recliner, chin in hand, deep in thought
What are we going to do
Matt deliberates
don't know
you've got to talk to him
don't ow
,, think he's right about scaring the kids
Why don't we call it a night
We'll deal with it tomorrow
Matt are you going to call the police or do  have to
You just
s- Bd me what  think
if you want to call them
call them
32 Ruth looks at him, stupefied
Without warning, Ruth leaves and goes upstairs
-  - Ruth lies on her side reading
Matt comes in from the hallway
He stares at her
She ignores him
Finally, she turns over and faces him
It's not the first time she's played around
Matt seems relieved that she's talking to him
He sits on the bed and starts taking off his shoes
She's not with the guy anymore
mean from before
What are you talking about
Oh, come on - you've heard the same things  have
think you forget
don't take my lunch in the teachers lounge - Maybe he still loves her
Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the hallway
He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs
He gets up and closes the bedroom door
'  - Frank enters the room, pulls off his -shirt and drops it on the floor
He walks over and faces a wall mirror
He seems nonplussed by what he sees
'   - Henry Czar sits holding court with Jason Frank, whose facial bruises have all but healed, the stitches replaced by a butterfly bandage
They eat cod tongues and cheeks
Drink soda pop from bottles
33 Best part of the cod - but most outsi ers, they won't touch it
The shack is too warm and smells of cordage and paint, spilled beer and male sweat
Jason is in heaven
The summer fishermen, the part-timers, like Frank here - get in your hair
There's as many as 80 of em with licenses now - should put up a sign - "Fish your own backyard or lose your traps0" Frank smiles at Jason
lobster is simple enough Jason
But if the guy going after him is even simpler well he might as well give up
Don't hurt my feelings any
Easy to talk Try fishing in the winter, cold as hell 10, 12, 20 below - no matter Go, go, go, you've gotta go
You want your bread & flour, you gotta goo Henry's just sore cause  catch twice as much as he does, with an old second hand Boudreau
Don't you listen to him son - that boat is fine
She was my first
Takes a sip of pop
Kinda miss her sometimes, and that truck you're driving
when you headed back to school Frank
- For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they crack up
Not Jason, he seems concerned by the question
Frank sees this
- Jason heads off down the pier on his bicycle
He passes Matto Hi, Dr
Fowler Matt waves
31+ "" - Frank is hosing down the hull, as Matt makes his way down the gangway
What'd you pull
Frank glances up, then continues with his work
Not too bad, about forty pounds
Haven't caught sight of you in days
You know where to find me
When you coming home
Frank turns off the spigot
Has it come to this
He jumps back into the boat and retrieves the bait bucket
Come to what
Frank hops back onto the dock and sets down the container
() You having to run errands for Mom
Matt ignores the jibe
Frank starts stacking holding crates
'm thinking of building a couple hundred more traps - see if  can do better than break even
Matt doesn't comment
He picks up a crate and throws it up top
it'll take you two years to get a licence to fish off-season
Right
unless Henry takes me on as his ster an
% They continue stacking
You think he'd do that
35 Maybe
it's as good a life as any
Good enough for your father - sometimes things skip a generation
(trying to sta calm) 'mon Frank - you ow ycu need something more
Why
So  can have an Ivy Lea e education like you
Christ, i it's so great - how come you sneak out of that office everyday to come down here
like spending time with my son
() Frank lugs up the last container and takes a seat on the stack
He's worn out - takes a breather
Frank shakes his head
() don't know dad--- don't know
Matt takes a seat next to him
moment
She's a wonderful girl
see that
Frank looks lost
The silence is broken by a loud voice
Franks how lon you gonna be parked there 'd like to un oad
The two of them regard each other
( ) Give me a hand
() Sure
36 -  - Ruth comes down the stairs, wrapping her bathrobe around her, The Dining room light is on
Frank sits at the t lea His drafting tools are out
He's fully immersed in a sketch
Ruth enters quietly
Your father is snoring
Don't mind me
She takes a container from the fridgge, smells it, makes a quenstioning face, then puts it back - grabs another container and opens a cupboard
Pulls out a loaf of bread
She quietly places a sandwich in front of him, and takes a seat
Eat---you must be hungry
Frank doesn't look up
his tone is flat, removed
'm not hungry
Coffee
He doesn't answer
Ruth sits there, awkwardly
So---you talked with her
Yep
d-,,how is she
() Oh, she's great
just wanted to tell you that we - liked her, Do like her
She's a Frank finally puts down his pencil,',-and looks at her, You're not reall going to have this conversation wit me now, Ma
Are you
Frank returns to his work
He doesn't look up again
37 She leaves the food for him
Like a zoo keeper
- Frank hauls traps
He appears lethargic, dull - the hands a little slower
The eyes tired
The joy of the work, replaced by dread
'   - Hen sits alone at the wooden table
There are three plates of cod, and 3 soda-pops
Frank comes in exhausted
Henry looks up
You're nn'in late
Frank nods
Takes a seat, and starts in on the cod
Henry looks at the empty seat next to Frank
Where's our boy
Frank ignores the question
'  - Frank drives
Traps stacked in the bed
He slows down to gaze out his window, as he passes '
The truck crawls to a stop
He takes the moment, storin each detail: Folded up lounge chairs
Scattered toys on t 9e porch
tipped-over tricyle
He idles, as if waiting for someone
After one last look he drives off
-  -
g The sightsand sounds of men gathered around a poker table regular game
Everyone well into their umpteenth beer, with the exception of Matt, who nurses a can o Moxien, Matt frowns at his hand
He glances over to Frank r also at the table
Frank stares at his cards, but his nd is elsewhere
You can't hypnotize the cards into changing, Matt
, late 50's, peers above his readin glasses
He is a lobster man by trade but fancies himself a poet
38 For Christ's sake bet - or you know Carl's gonna start
Carl is indeed
"The be gar's do and widow's cat, Feed them an thou wi t grow fat
The gnat that sings his s er's song- Collective groans
Poison gets from slander's tongue
The poison of the snake and newt- Is the sweat of envy's foot
The poison of the honey bee
Is the artist's jealousy-" Alright Carl
Two bucks
Matt throws his two bucks in
Carl, you've really got to get off this Blake thing
you're in a rut
Frank tries to smile
Don't get him going Matt
When  do my own stuff, you guys bitch & moan
That's not true
No
we like your stuff
The place breaks up with laughter
Everybody in
Frankie you in
Frank calls
Hands are shown
All eyes to Frank
( ) Guess 'm the winner
More groans, as Frank pulls in his winnings
Always the quiet ones
The game continues --
39 Frank walks down the hallwaytalking on a cordless phone
His tone casual but serious
He jots down notes in a sketch book
Sure
Right
get in on the sixth
Oh, 'll send that out tomorrow, sir, no problem
Well, compared to your models no, they don't compare to your models () He enters the: and plops down at his drafting table
'm getting another call
Can you hang on a second
Thanks
clicks on the other call
Face
Jace is that you
What's going on
He listens
'll be right over
() Just stay put
-  '  - The house looks like a storm hit it: chairs tipped over, toys scattered, papers strewn across the floor
Frank looks around the room
Natalie, her hair atangled mess, her face streaked from tears, paces nervously
She looks up at Frank
looks to el-e
He
just pushed me - he didn't hit me
Oh, he didn't hit you
Should we throw a party for him
rank
40 Enough of this
We have to call the police
'm airs ht, Frank
don't know what to do,aoka  hate this
hate the kids seeing this
Frank eraces her
She buries her head in his neck
Its okay, now
Listen to me, 'm not going anywhere
'  - Jason looks down from the window
He sees Richard's Suburban pull up front
Mom
Natalie gives a horrified look to Frank
Get them back upstairs
But
Now
Come on, you guys
Natalie hustles the boys upstairs
Frank moves to the
He's about to check the doorknob when from the other side
It's locked
Richard, just get away fr here- Silence
Frank turns, his eyes lock on - Frank races across the living room, just as eves burning, marches in
' The boys huddle around Natalie
is wailing- looks terrified- strains to hear- - starts to the door- Listen kids - Stay here
won't let go of her sleeve
He starts to move with her
() said stay here
He lets go and, takes him up in his small arms
( ) It's  Dunk
--Mommy's coming back
hesitates - then heads out the door
We    out the bedroom to the, She slowly steps down the stairs
She moves quickly down the stairs
-2 Cautiously - she looks over the landing
: From above, Richard stands, his back to her, his head hung
in his hand
a 9mm Pistol
Natalie lets out a plaintive wail
Emotionless, Richard turns to her - looks down at the floor then starts toward the kitchen
Natalie races down the steps and stops
'
'
She's paralyzed, a scream trapped somewhere inside
She turns away
() () '
Richard sits at the kitchen table
The gun rests in front of him
His right sleeve splattered with Frank's blood
: - att's face appears distorted behind the surface
() Matt
He lowers what we now see to be
Ray and kills the light
' He hesitates, presses the blinking hold button, picks up the receiver
Hello
Hello
Natalie
The blood drains from his face
- Matt stands in the hallway outside of the auditorium that is Ruth's classroom
banner across the hall reads ,
The choir finishes the last strains
Ruth is happy the rehearsal has gone well
She smiles in a way that expresses the simple joy she will never know again
Great
The girls gather their things and start out, laughing and running after each other
Matt stands in the hallway as they rush past
: - Frank's casket is lowered into the ground
large gathering of relatives and friends stand before Father Oberti as he finishes the eulogy
Matt's arm is tightly interlocked with Ruth's, beneath her eyes - swelling from three days of suffering
Their hands c enched to ether make one fist, both parents keeping the other uprig t
The rain glides down their faces, mixing easily with tears
Matt steps up to Frank's open grave
The gathering watches as Matt peers down into the hole, silently speaking to it
He reaches down, grabs a fistful of dirt
Then tosses it into the open grave
Matt pauses, staring down, into the hole --- He steps back, as Father Oberti delivers the end of his eulogy
Matt looks blankly around, noticing the family's many friends includin ; Carl and Henry from the game, Willis and Katie, and Frank's friend, Matt's eyes linger on someone behind , away from the crowd
Natalie
Their eyes meet
Matt, almost imperceptibly, nods
-   - large casserole is placed on a long table with many assorted dishes
, scoops up some of the casserole onto a small plate, and carries it to standing in the middle of a much larger gathering, the reception after the funeral
Matt stands in the downstairs hallway
He looks around the room, as if it is all a dream
Children getting soda pop
Others in conversation
The odd person looks up at him, then turns away
Willis steps up to Matt
His wife, Katie, stands nearby
Matt doesn't seem to notice Willis
Willis puts a gentle hand on his friend's arm
() Can  get you anything
Matt suddenly looks up at them, as if confused
ere-s Rut h
She went to lie down, Matt
He turns d heads upstairs
Willis and Katie watch him go
Matt approaches their bedroom
The door is a He steps in, to Ruth, who is on the bed
Her back is to him, a arently sleeping
Crumbled tissues litter the bed, the f oor, Matt ietl moves to her
He reaches down, about to touch her head
Something stops h 1-5 He turns, and leaves
Frank's room is facing him
Instinctively, he goes to open the door, then pauses
' Matt slowly enters
He looks around, as if freezing the room in his memory
The place is untouched
Frank's many sketches are still pinned to the wall
Some clothes lie scattered on the floor
His fishing cap
Matt starts to pick up
He takes Frank's clothes from the floor and places them on his bed
He looks at a dirty -shirt in his hand
He brings it to his face
He inhales deeply, able to smell his son's lingering scent- Finally, he sets the shirt on the bed
Wanders around
Strays near Frank's drafting table- He reaches out, touching the table, grazingthe topogra h of scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it- The Froe e Gifts
He takes a seat at the table
Feeling its frame, the sketches, the seat below- And without warning he is overcome
He lurches forward, burying his face in his hands
The sobs come unrestrained, violently, like a sudden tidal wave
-  -  - 2 - fills the air
Ruth in pajamas and bathrobe, watches a stand-up comic on
She sips tea from a mug
Matt appears at the door, kettle in hand
Some more
Ruth looks up and nods
- Matt stands atop a ladder underneath a large Maple, he struggles with a pair of pruning shears
At war with a large br c - the branch seems to be winning
46 - Ruth, still dressed in her robe, pads down the hallway
Stops to glance out the window at - working
Ruth stands transfixed : QuJ glimpses through branches, of a small boy scampering up a tree
Flashes of arms, legs, a smile
We can make out the  of the child, but they are distorted, wobbly, as if deteriorated by memory
The tree shudders as the boy climbs higher
Okay - watch it now, Frank
Frank, listen to your father
That's high enough
The tree continues shaking
Ruth allows the memory, then turns back and pads back down the hallway
'  - Matt sits behind his desk catching up on some paperwork
Janelle appears in the doorway
'm going to lunch Dr
Fowler-- alright She continues smiling as though ting to extend her tenderness
Matt avoids eye-contact
cie Leaves
Matt looks relieved
'  -  - Willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer in the Vietnam War
The theme, if there is one, is definitely nautical
Snapshots of longtime customers are stapled on the walls between the booths and tables, two are framed, and prominent
They are from Willis' - -, days; The first an entry photo of    front of the ha f
The second a sun faded color photo of : att and Willis
Both ook to be in their twenties, both dressed in Navy Whites
The trade here is mostly ve early breakfast, and then lunch for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories
47 news show plays on a ceiling at the far end of the booths
sign on the wall reads  your "Forget about lunch" breakfast
Willis carries over two plates with omelettes, parks them on the table, and takes a seat across from Matt
Don't worry,  didn't make em
Matt takes a bite
He winces
What
Oh, that's mine
He switches plates
Sorry
Matt takes another bite
Better, You got back to work so quick, Matt
It's not too soon
can't stay home
So, how's business
Oh,
you know, same old crap
Got held up again, you knew that
No
didn't
yeah
they got seventy five bucks
Were you on the till
Willis chuckles, shakes his head
They would have gotten something else if 'd been on the till
Matt nods
How you doin', Matt
You on't write, you don't call
Where'd the love go
'0-' Nag nag nag
Matt glances at an old clipping from the   stapled to the wall
It's a photo from the 67 Redsox dream to 48 Petrocelli, Yaztrems i and Reggie Smith, each hold u two fingers, they are s ling after hitting consecutive omeruns
Matt remembers
Happier days
They set the bail hearing yet
Sometime in the next few days
ye , Are you going
don't ow
Davis says it's a formallity really
haven't talked to Ruth about weather she thinks we should go or not
If it's too much for Ruth, 'll come with you Matt
Thanks, but 'm sure it'll be alright- Davis says it's a formallity really
The criminal trial set yet
October
October
That's what they tell me, anyway
Christ, they take their time
yeah, well, he's in there now
They're keeping him busy, 'm sure - You know where they'll move h once he's sentenced
Matt shifts the focus to his omelette
You have any Tabasco sauce
Willis pauses
He looks around, ca `out to the kitc hen
Hey, Pete
Tabasco
Pete
Ah, shit
He heads to the back
Matt looks out the window
refrigera ted truck with the  logo on it's side pulls to a stop at the light
Willis returns with sauce in hand
49 He takes a seat
Shifts his tone again
Next weekend Matt- We really want you to come up to the c p- Katie's insisting
Not to pressure you or anything
But if you don't come se's going to invite her sister and that idiot and  know 'm going to wind up insulting him again
Matt considers this
The future of my family is in your hands
Let me ask Ruth
You know, your seat is getting cold at the game
We have Carl's kid subbing for you
Not that we mind - he loses every time But we'd rather take your money
() Thanks
Matt stares aimlessly out the window
Willis goes back to his eggs
Both men comfortable enough with each other to be silent
How's Ruth doing
Alright
Her
her car broke down
Always something
: - The phone continues to ring
Then sto s- Ruth lies on the couc , dressed in her robe
Her hair looks neglected
She stares at the television
ad for Su ay Chevrolet comes on the screen - a testimonial from a bald man saying "The best thing about the sales people is they're not pushy
"  large graphic nla s over the an' s face   -   a c ul into t e driveway

Ruth looks interested
The front door opens and Matt comes in with groceries

Matt carries the bags into the kitchen
Fine
Saw Willis- My day was fine, too, thanks
Matt comes out of the kitchen
Sorry
,how was your day
Tried calling - thought you might have gone out
The Grinnel's invited us up to the camp next weekend
Said 'd check with you, if we had other plans That sounds fine
He turns, a little surprised
We don't have to
She looks up at him
You don't want to go
() No,  want to Great
Tell them yes
() thoug t you might be busy getting the girls ready

She's back into her show
The sink still has the plates and cups from breakfast

The court is obliged to hold a bail hearing within two weeks of incarceration , which is the purpose of our procedings here today

Matt and Ruth glance over at , 62, sitting directly behind Richard
Nathan's two other sons, both big men like Richard, sit at his side
Nathan feels the Fowlers, stares
His eyes stay focused on the front of the room

Mrs
Strout's police interview is already documented, the defense has a copy of it
There's no reason to waste anymore of the court's time

Your Honor, we just want to review exactly what s
Strout saw on the afternoon of July 17th
Isn't that why we're here
The Judge nods
overruled
( ) Please continue
Natalie tries to recapture her place
Keyes nods
() So you were bringing your children up to their bedroom
Natalie's glance wanders to the gallery, to Matt and Ruth
She,sits on her hands to keep them from shaking
0 Right
was in Jason and Dunk's room didn't know what was happening downstairs
was getting worried
asked Jason to read Dunk a story
He didn't want a story - He wanted to come with me
so  sat him back down on the bunk and  left them in the room
You left "them"
My boys
She starts to cry
() Of course - 'm sorry

closed the door
moved down the hall looked back to make sure they weren't behind me
had just started down the stairs, when  heard the shot
ran down
deep sob
and Richard
53 'm sorry, can we just back up
You said you "heard the shot"
Yes
You "heard"
s- Strout, did you witness the accident
Prosecutor Davis jumps up
b`ection
There are no grounds to in icate this was an "accident" The Judge nods
( ) Please strike "accident" from the record
(to Marla Keyes) Ms
Keyes, please rephrase the question
Marla Keyes hasn't taken her eyes off Natalie
They both know what's next
() Mrs
Strout
did you actually see the sidearm discharge
'  - Davis hands a cup of coffee to Matt, who sits on a faux leather couch with Ruth
(to Ruth re: coffee) You sure you don't want
'm fine
Davis takes a seat across from them
You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just not set up that way
- -y You let that bastard walk out and we're supposed to just sit here
Don't tell us there's nothing to do about this
It's not us, s
Fowler
The state's bail code is to ensure future court appearances 54 In this case Strout's family was prepared to put up a substantial amount of property as bail - That, along with his ties to the community made it hard for us to convince the judge of a serious "Risk of Flight"
Oh -  see
It's not just your case
Now you can file a civil suit
recommend it
But not now, wait till after the crimminal trial
Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk
It is one of those things that were popular in the 70's
little man chasing an ambulance
It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer
" And when will that be
Next week, next month
Well
honestly - anywhere between twelve and eighteen months
thought you said there would be a jury trial sometime in October
If he was incarcerated the udge would move for an October date - basically to save the County the cost of housing and feeding him as an inmate - But with bail the court date, unfortunately, is always later
Oh my god, oh my god
Matt jumps in
But you're confident you'll be able to put him away for good then
Right
Davis looks uncomfortable with the question
Ruth sees this
She gathers herself
The things she said in there
what is the damage
Manslaughter
55 What
Oh, Jesus Christ
The wav this is going, that'd be my bet - especially since Nathan Strout brought up that barracuda from Boston - she's very smart
This was no accident
Be killed our son in cold blood
Ruth
What
How long would he be sent away for
Hard to say really
Anywhere between five to fifteen years
We think we have a good shot at the max - fifteen
Even with good behavior, he'd do a full ten
Ten years
Five years
Are you out of your mind
He killed my son
Does anyone know this
Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis
Davis sits back, a little shook up
'm sorry, s
Fowler
understand
Unfortunately, in situations like this when there is no eye witness, there
well, there's not a lot we can do

Ruth looks out the windshield
Both in their own worlds
Ruth turns to look out her side window

You took the whole day
Matt nods
- handful of reporters and photographers lingering on the lawn, are galvanized by the arrival of the Fowlers
Ruth is just entering, jostled, relieved to be home
She turns
Matt's not there
She looks out the front door to surrounded by reporters
#1 Dr
Fowler, how do you feel about Richard's Strout's bail
#2 Do you plan to take any further legal action, Dr
Fowler
#3 Dr
Fowler, have you had any contact with Mr- Strout
Matt stands paralyzed, a deer caught in the headlights
Matt enters as Ruth takes the plates to the sink
She keeps her back to him
He pulls off his coat
Can you believe this
ask those idiots to leave
No one budges
Not one
What the hell are we supposed to do, bring them sandwiches

Tell them to leave

He turns to the s clock

He stands there eating them, the door of the cupboard is long, the kind you see in old capes
Matt stares at the inside of the door
His finger slides down the length, he kneels down
We see what he's looking at
Pen and pencil marks straight lines each about two inches apart - each with Frank's name and aqe
Matt sits in his chair
The plays, muted
He s looks at it, but he's not watching

Matt enters, fully dressed in jeans and a sweater
He winces at the smoke
You slept late
For you
Matt pours himself some coffee
took one of your pills
58 You never do that
She turns the page, absorbed in an article
Shaking her head, she slaps the paper down
Well there it is in black and white
You should read some of the things he says
Unbelievable
Matt takes a sip of coffee
He glances down at the paper
He nods, without really looking
yeah
He checks his watch
should get going

It's Saturday

He bends, kisses her lightly on the cheek

Natalie quickly double bags the woman's groceries
There is a break in the customer flow

The Man places a 12- ack of beer on the counter
Natalie looks to Matt, who shakes his head no
Natalie steps back to the register and rings up the beer
Her chin quivers
She makes a mistake on the register, has to start over
few more customers gather on line
( ) Can  get you anything else
She rings him up
Makes change as another customer steps up
Matt steps near her, trying to maintain privacy
() How are the boys
Are they okay
Natalie, choked by emotion, cannot respond
Near tears, she puts her hand up, unable to speak
Matt reaches out to touch her arm
His gesture is interrupted as: She pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack
The Man pays
Matt stays a moment longer
There's nothing else to say
He leaves
She returns to her job
We see Ruth from a good distance away, watched from afar
She places some potted daisies on a grave
She kneels down
- Ruth walks through an empty lot and heads for her c ' She opens the door
Suddenly there
-
hand on her shoulder
She is startled
She turns around
It's Father Oberti
61 Ruth and Father Oberti sit smoking on a bench
It comes in waves,
and then nothing
Like a rest in music
No sound - but so loud

don't know what to do
Father Oberti nods

Louise McVey lost a child a few years back
Maybe you remember
() mmmm she had four - it was the youngest girl, wasn't it
Yes
She told me about a vision she had when she found out her daughter had died
she saw herself at a great distance from the earth encircling it, an endless line - as she got closer she saw that it was made up of mothers traveling forward
She fell into line, and began walking with them
When they reached a certain point, the line divided
She said she knew - that all the millions of women on her side - were the mothers who had lost children-she seemed to find great comfort in that
Ruth doesn't react
How did she die
drowning
some kind of swimming accident
oh
- mower moves across the lawn, spitting up a shower of grass
Matt pushes the mower
62 '   - small bouti e frequented by mature women
Blouses with a flair, pantsuits, an nice dresses han from the racks
The sort of place a woman can still buy a pair Joze a white gloves
The front of the store is devoted to footwear
Ruth sits while , 45, kneels in front of her, holding Ruth's stockinged foot
She slips on a dress shoe
Oh, they're beautiful on you Ruth
Ruth stands up, takes a few steps
She stares at the shoes
They are a rich black
Do you have them in brown
think so, let me check
Yvonne disappears into the back
Ruth walks to the front of the store, browsing
She moves to the display window and brings a pair of very young pumps u to her nose, and inhales
She smiles and sets the shoes bac on the ledge
Something  catches her attention
'   - The    , walking down the sidewalk, can be glimpsed in the window, their movement   ' a    holding hands with a dark haired, young he turns to smile at her
We see his face
Oblivious to Ruth's presence
61    - -" Ruth looks disoriented
'm sorry Ruth - there's only the black
63 She turns from the window
Yvonne stands next to her, an open shoe box in her hands
-  - Two Hefty bags are dragged along the walk
Matt tosses one next to a garbage that sits just inside the garage
He picks up the other bag tossing it inside
The bottom splits and grass spills out onto the drive-way
He goes inside and returns with a broom
He sweeps the rass into a pile
Picking up handfuls and refilling the gay
He takes the broom and sweeps what's left back toward the la
He stops, stares down at his feet
;  child's handprintsand writing, Frank 82 Ruth's car pulls into the driveway
She gets out, almost slamming the car door
Without a word, she moves past Matt, and into the house
Matt continues sweeping
-  -  - Ruth wakes to the sound of metal on metal
She looks over to Matt, he's not there
() Matt
She steps to the window, pulls back the shears and looks out
Through the window, in the dark, alone, flashlight in hand
Matt is dismantling the swin set
-   - four room dwelling, surrounded by a wrap around porch that looks out over a canopy of forest below
The place was built before insulation was practical
Planks, beams , and studs are exposed
There is a bathroom, two bedrooms, and a common room consisting of a kitchen/dining area, and living room, with a ge, river stone fireplace
There are two oil burning 1 ps hanging from cross beams at each end of the room
Ruth sits next to Katie at a table in the middle of the room
Katie is ouring over a stack of snapshot books, descibin her chid "h and r dchildren in eac pose
The photos, w ile many, are all from a single trip that the family made to Florida
There is a clear dif erence in vernacular between the two women, Katie also has a voice that has been trained to reach anyone who might be in the f corners of her house
9 + s lil Charles down at the Oh and here' pool - He figured out how to get down to the pool on the elevator all by himself
() He must of been very proud
Oh yeah
Oh here's Shannon waitin in for that rollercoaster - You know the one
Ruth has no idea
() Were the lines very long
Well some of em
yeah - sixty minutes and upward-Unless of coarse ya got the "Fast-Pass
" What's the fast pass
" Well ya got all the different "Kingdo - there---and so you take the fast pass it's a kind of a laminated card and you put it intah a machine and it tells you what time to come back - so you can go right in without waitin in lane
You guys ever go down to Florida
Ruth smiles at the thought and shakes her head- 0 -
no0 How many grandchildren do yo u have now
Katie turns from the snapshots and takes a breath while holding up her fingers to count-She is genuinely unsure
(under her breath Well there's lil Charles, Shannon, the three older ones and the babies
eleven
That must wonderful

Katie smiles and nods - it is a (by rote) " Well
Willis always says guess there's no danger of us dying off - 65 She catches herself
Too late
She looks at Ruth
Embarrassed
'm sorry -  wasn't
Ruth waves her off good naturedly- wanted to have more
abut we had Frank, and Matt was just starting his practice
- - - guess it made sense
() Well sometimes  wished  was an only child - let me tell you
When  was little, my big sister could get me to do anything
More than once she got me to throw m self down the stairs by telling inc the blanket she wrapped me in was a magic car et- Naturally, not being that swift,  believed her
Plus which, on this trip to Florida, we was in one of the Kingdoms there, and she was going on about how's we had to go on this one ride that was in this sort of mountain
said -" as long as it's not a roller coaster- on account of my back-" Well, we get strapped intah the little car there she starts laughing - Oh it's a rollercoaster alright - that one there
She points to the pictures
(') ride in the dark, no less
- great, endless, expanse of Fir trees
We are f up, looking out at this timbered landscape that seems to stretch forever
Matt stands before the edge of a cliff, d

He takes a deep breath of the ( ri
-ountain steady  rhythm is heard in the background
Matt turns
Willis is chopping the last of some firewood
How much of this is yours
Willis plants his in the stump
() You ask me that eve t e
You know the cove, the other side of the c in
yeah
All the way to the other shoreline
Matt turns to him, grinning
Almost three hundred and fifty acres
Know what it went for when  bought it
You don't want to know
Matt continues surveying, awed
Willis turns, starts walking back to his chore
Come on, 'll let you help me
Matt joins him
Together, they bundle up the wood
- Matt and Willis load the wood into a small trailer attached a    500
Only got 1/2 a chord of Oak left at home and you know how much that bastard Daniels charges - least  can stack this up to the cabin
have something to burn this fall
-  - Matt sits behind Willis on the  as they pull the wood up road
The trees clear and we see the cabin is parked in front
- Willis, Katie, Matt and Ruth, sit around a copious holiday spread, well into their meal
It's a wonderful product and the treat you pretty good
It was on account oz, selling Mary Kay, that we got the new Subaru
( ) The ride up was very comfortable
It's a very nice car
67 Well it's not really a car, it's got four-wheel drive
It's a little
The Grinnel's custom, is to loudly, and with very little effort, finish each others sentences
This is how they have fun
What the hell is that  crap
Sports utillity vehicle
(to Matt and Ruth) It's a little jeep
, ,  - what's with all these
--
She searches for the word
Little help
Anyone, anyone
( ) Acronyms
Yeah, guess it's too much trouble to just say what something is anymore
(to the table) What does  stand for
Yeah well, was an army brat
grew up with jeeps
Willy is just uncomfortable that  know more about one masculine thing than he does
Just one
The pty chuckles
Thanks, buddy
Matt hel s himself to the last of the wine- Re se s to have a ite bit Ruth watches as he drains the bottle
She shoots him a look
He catches it - ,  o-, moment
68 (  ) You've done a suc a nice job here, Katie
Don't tell me you made those drapes yourself
is that antique linen
() Sort of
She walks over to the window and fingers the fabric
They're pillowcases from our first house
Ruth smiles at the memory
Katie sits back down at the table
Oh, 've saved every knick=knack & whim-wham we ever had
- post stands proudly at the end of a dirt and gravel road
Attached to it are two signs
One reads
The other,
It butts up against two lanes of blacktop - a small logging road
Headlights cut through the early evening
Willis's idea of a  a green,  , kicks up some rocks
it pauses briefly before taking a right onto the pavement
/
-    - The car is stopped behind a wooden guard arm
swing bridge opens for a large fishing boat
The bridge is operated by one man
Be uses a long metal tool, that he loops into a pulley system, which lies beneath a grid in the center of the bridge
-  - Ruth asleep in the back seat, it-s been a long weekend
Matt glances over at her, then up to the front We are outside the car as it waits for the Drawbridge to close, so it may continue
We hear the following from perspective
1
0`1 How's David doing up there in Castine
Well he dunnit want to go overseas - oh no
he told them he'd Reep doinit as long as he could stay in Maine or Vermont- 69 (  ) But David says if theyy want him to go out to New Mexico or California, he'll go back to infantry - he don't care
Long as he stays out here
He's not about to-- Course he don't like working in recruitment anyhow's - Christ he gets them bo s come down to to the office at the mal - he gets them half-way processed and they decide they want that delayed entry thing - Christ  could't do -- Or they decide not to join up at all and-- Well, like that one kid - he had him all the way through the works and then - Oh - His folks called David and said that the boy wanted out so bad -- that he'd taken his own life
They all look at each other
How did this conversation get so depressing
Yeah well something like that gets to you Christ,  couldn't do it
-  - Ruth is at the table, alone, dressed for rehearsal, hair done
She finishes her breakfast as she pours through the weekend's mail
Matt in a suit, steps in to say goodbye
'm going now
She looks up
() Okay
You ready to go back
70 (  ) You loo nice
Who looks to Ruth for some kind of reaction
Nothing
Matt heads out the door
Ruth continues sorting the mail
She stops on one piece
Seems stunned, repeatedly reading it
It's from Publisher's Clearinghouse
In oversized block letters, it reads, ,      $10,000,000
She stares at the piece for a long time
Looks off
Smiles
And starts giggling
She can't stop
The giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit, harder and harder as the tears rain down
'  - Matt is in his office, on the phone
( Well that's totall unacceptable isn't it
- Well what did he say
uh huh well, we can't allow that m  guess we're gonna have to show him how the cow eats the cabbage
Janelle knocks on the door
Hold on a second
He puts his mouth over the speaker and lowers the phone
Nods to Janelle and she enters
Dr
Fowler, 'm sorry
There's someone ' Ryan Collit
His mother` brought him in
He doesn't have an appointment but-- 'm sorry bL _; you'll have to re-schedule
Janelle's a little taken aback
71 He's Ann Collit's son
thought
Well, you know, thought you might want to (into the phone) 'll call back later
He hangs up
He gets up and grabs his jacket Sorry Janelle, 'll be back at four

Matt leaves her standing there
'  - William Davis's secretary, , 40, sits at her desk
She is on a call, Matt stands waiting
( ) 'm Sorry, Dr
Fowler, you just missed him
really need to see him
He go to lunch
That's right
She senses something in his tone
He's across the street
kUURRET bustling dining room, packed with businessmen
The nice place in town it's lunch hour
The doors open
Matt enters
He scans the room
His eyes set on sitting at a table with colleagues, sharing a laugh
72 Matt makes his way over to the table
Davis sees h' Hey, Matt
Matt stands awkwardly, as Davis' companions look on
() Have a seat
Matt hesitates, takes a seat next to Davis
Manages an obligatory smile to the others
The conversation resumes
-     - On the street outside the restaurant, walking
We're doing all we can, Matto  promise you that
What can  do Bill
There's nothing
Matt takes Davis' arm
It can't be manslaughter
There's got to be something - isn't there something you can find
piece of evidence
That happens - doesn't that happen
He realizes he's holding Davis' arm
He lets goo Davis looks at Matt sympathetically
We really are doing everything we can, Matt - But 'm not going to lie to you - We've got no witnesses - only Strout - who claims there was a struggle - and forensic can't determine if there was a struggle
because of the condition the house was in when Frank got there
Matt says nothing
, They come to the corner
Matt steps under an awning and into the shade
73 Davis stops
He shifts feet a couple of tes
Pla ing with the change in his pocket, the way people do when they're uncomfortable
'm sorry att
if it helps, we all want this guy put away
We have kids, too
Matt nods, without looking at him
Matt looks at Davis's hand moving the change
He becomes hypnotized by the sound
Davis continues talking
Matt can't hear a word of it, though
All he hears is the clinking of the coins in the pocket
- Matt stands in the wheelhouse, he brings the helm about,
cuts back on the throttle and heads for the winch, the stern is stacked with four high rows of Frank's empty traps
Matt pulls up a string of pots
Opens the door and pulls out a young male
He flinches and drops it
His finger goes to his mouth
Loaded up to the gills with pots
She turns toward harbor
- Matt at the wheelhouse heading in
His hand on the wheel, blood trickles from his finger
He sucks on it again, reaches down underneath his feet and pulls a band-aid from a box and applies it to the finger
"" Matt unloads Frank's traps onto the landing
He stops
Seems to sense something
He looks back up the gangway
Jason sits on his bicycle watching
The two regard each other for a moment
Then without a word Jason rides off
' '  - Willis dries a glass
He keeps an eye on Matt sitting at a booth in the front
f the diner, silhouetted by a window
He pushes a half-eaten burger away, drains a bottle of beer
It's not the first
Willis sets down a cup of coffee for himself
Takes a seat across from h' They both gaze absently out the window
- '  - Ruth is alone at her desk, she wears headphones and is busy making notations on a sheet of manuscript paper
There's a  on her door
She doesn't look up
(taking off the phones) Yes
There's a pause, then the door slowly opens
Natalie takes a step in
Ruth looks up
If she's surprised, she doesn't show it, - -a  hope this is okay
Ruth says nothing
Natalie moves closer
've been hoping we might be able to get together - to talk
Ruth watches her as she approaches the desk
Natalie bends and cautiously extends her hand for Ruth to hold
just want to tell you how -e- And in a flash Ruth  Natalie across the face with her open hand
Natalie springs back, paralyzed with shock
She tries to catch her breath, staring directly at Ruth
Eyes ablaze, Ruth says nothing
- The two women look at each other for a very long time And final , as if she finally somehow got the resolution she came for, lead held high, Natalie turns and walks out
& cyclone fence surrounds the lace
sign reads "Strout "- it is the end of the day
75 grow of workers file out, gabbing, starting to strip the eves of their smocks and hair-nets
Tim, Frank's friend, exits with his co-workers
He climbs into his mini pick-up, and pulls out of the lot
few seconds later, from outside the lot, Matt's car pulls - &  -  - crowded working class tavern
Video oker machines, beef jerky at the bar, Schaeffer's on tap
We're in fuck
it's happy-hour
Tim sits around a table with a couple of buddies, laughing
We lost a few strings and we had a fair idea it was him who was doing it - so's just flat out asked him "No wasn't me
" You should of seen what he tried to pull last wintah
He was up to the island there - and he claimed our traps were in his part of the cove - Bobb was up to the tavern on the head and e d him shooting his mouth off about how he and his stet an was gonna take a bat to the old man & me - so's  told the old man about it and he says "Don't hurt my feelings none
"He says "Go on down to the Walmart and buy a couple of plastic bats
" Next day the old man walks intah the office at the market - near the scales - where he know's the son of a bitch is gonna come in with his catch
He's got two six penny nails a hammer, and the bats o'coarse, so he nails those things right intah the wall
The guy at the scales looks at him like he's nuts "Whatta ya doing there Ivan" he says "Just sending a message" and the old man walks out
come in and  could see what he wrote across them things
The door to the bar opens
What
"Here's the bats - if you got the balls
" Tim and the others crack up
Didn't touch our traps aftah that
stops mid sentence
76 Matt is passing by his table
Dr
Fowler
Matt flinches, "surprised" to see Tim
Matt and Tim have moved to another booth
Matt leans heavily on his elbows, listening to Tim
No - no,  don't even see Richard anymore
And he'd never tell me anything, believe Me
Matt takes a pull of beer
Sure, of course
was just wondering, you know, maybe there was something you heard, through the grapevine, maybe one of his buddies said something --- ( ) No -a- was thinking, Richard's brothers, they're still working with you, right
They must talk
Tim throws a nervous look over to the table where his friends ea They're oblivious to the conversation
He looks back to Matt, shifting in his seat
Matt leans forward
He speaks in an intense whisper
'm just saying, Tim, if we could find something, something concrete
If you could just
it could be just a slip of the tongue --- Tim looks into Matt's eyes, feeling the torment
'll keep my ears open
Matt looks at him, dissatisfied
It's funny running into you here, Dr
Fowler
Matt looks at Tim blankly, then finishes his beer

-  - Matt drives end of highway
Matt pulls into the left-hand turn lane and signals
There is a car in front of h Above the licence plate is a yellow sticker which reads "Student Driver-" The plate itself is a vanity plate it says  Y4US- 73  - truck eases to a stop in the right lane, next to Matt's car
Matt glances over, for a moment he half expects to see Frank
He cracks the passenger side window, for a better look
He stares at the driver's window
Their window rolls down
attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at Matt
Lost in the absurdity, he doesn't look away
The light changes
The girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss, before continuing through the light
Matt watches her go - he smiles - as if somehow relieved
The car behind him gives a polite toot - Matt makes the left
-    - Ruth enters, passing the empty front register
She strolls down an aisle, pulling some items from the shelves
from the next aisle
#1 0-- yeah, man,  - d better get back to the grind --- #2
Alright, pal --- #1 0-- Just don't ste al anything
, 301S, wearing a clerk-s apron, price gun, and plastic tag tha: says , rounds the end of the aisle
As he does, he spots - 78 , moving down the aisle toward him
He freezes nervous smile - He throws a quick look to the other aisle
(a little too loudly) Good evening, s - Fowler
Ruth pulls out her purse as Nick rings her up
Oh, and a pack of Marlboro Lights, Sure, As  reaches up to the overhead cigarette area, he can't help but glance past Ruth
Ruth catches this, she turns, and sees - appear from a far aisle - he makes a    , he leaves,  , -   '
It's a long time before Ruth moves
Finally, she turns back to Nick
He looks at her, embarrassed, awaiting her reaction
She just stares at h -  -   - Hatt sits comfortably, feet up, beer in hand, deep into the book   by - Rowers, He  the front door He doesn't move
most immediately, he hears the banging of cupboards opening d closing
79 Ruth is putting groceries away, ignoring, or trying to, Matt who has appeared in the doorway
She puts milk in the refrigerator and stares into it for a long time, trying to decide what to do
He can feel her judging ' 'inall ,
having resolved something in her mind, she closes the refrigerator door- revealing, taped to it, several newspaper articles on the case, gathered by her, no doubt, including one with a picture of Frank
How did it go today
She doesn't answer
Something wrong
She doesn't turn around
Wrong
Like what, Matt
What could be wrong
She continues "straightening up", starts recklessly washing dishes
Matt doesn't leave
plate  in the sink
This stops her
She stares at it, then feels his presence
She turns around
What do you want
He looks unsure of himself
want to know what's going on
Right
You're obviously upset
If there's something you want to talk about
Talk
Who, us
Oh, you mean to each other
What if somebod waked in
They wouldn't recognize us
They'd think they had the wrong house
80 Matt takes this in
He breathes deeply
Do you want to talk or not
("" ) Talk, talk
oh, you must mean about our dead son
No, we haven't before, why should we bother now
They stare at each other across the kitchen
( ) What can  do, Ruth
Ruth looks at him for a long time
Forget it, Matt
Why don't you just go
() What do you want from me
want you to stop acting like nothing's happened
That's what  want
Why
because 'm not bouncing off the walls
No, Matt, That would require feelings
We don't want you to hurt yourself
Do me a favor, Ruth
You want to have a grieving contest, go find someone else
He starts to turn
yeah,  know how you grieve
have another beer
He spins back
You know nothing
You know nothing about me
What  go through every day - ever lousy, stinking day
No,  don't know, Matt
don't know what you go through, or if you go through ything
But that's your choice, dear, not mine
81 You're goddamn right it is
My choice is to not scream at the world
Maybe one of us has to be reasonable here, did you ever think of that
Reasonable
e, Matt,  don' t know about you, but  ss my son
'm glad you have time for reason
That's what you imparted to Frank, That sense of reason - Oh, he thought you were very reasonable
What the hell is that supposed to mean
She is about to say something, but stops short
Nothing
She turns back to the dishes
He moves in on her, seething
What are you really trying to say anyway
She says nothing, picking up the broken plates
that 'm the one responsible
She drops the pieces back in the sink and exits
He's fast on her heels
She heads for the bedroom
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
She throws the door closed behind her, but he bangs it open with his palm
You of it backwards
know what you think
That  was too lenient, that  let him get away with
Everything
Everything
She exits into He's right behind her
82 Oh, really
Why do you think he never came to you
He wouldn't talk to me, Matt
He didn't trust me
You made sure of that
Why would he talk to you, Ruth
You never listened
No
But you did
You were winking at him the whole time
You encouraged him
You wanted what he had
Her
You've got to be kidding
You know it
Come on
You wanted it, and you couldn't get it - that's why you didn't stop him so you could get your kicks through your son
You know that's what happened
And now you can't cope with it
You can't admit the truth - To me, or to yourself - You can't admit that he died for ygur fantasy piece of ass
Matt, stunned, reels for a second And then, finally, explodes
You want to know why our son is dead, Ruth
He wasn't with her because of me, he went there because of you
Because you were so controllins, so overbearing, so angry that he was it, that he was our only one
That is not true
It is
From the time he was little you were telling him why he was wrong
Everything he did was wrong
What was wrong with him, Ruth
She stares at him, dumbfounded
1 011 You are so unfor ivinge You are
That's what he said
Ana you're playing the same shit out with me - That's a horrible way to be
Horrible
You're bitter, Ruth
You can point your finger at me all you want 83 but you better take a good look at yourself first
She already has, of course
( ) just wanted to talk about what happened, Matt
You expect me just to open up to you
Embrace you
You scare me
How can  talk to you
can't even look at you
They suddenly become aware of the , ringing, over and over
They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath
The continues
( ) That's probably
the police
Matt opens it
There is no cop, just Kristen Gellar, 12, a young gymnast who'd like to compete in Hawaii
() Hi there
'm Kristen Gellar from the Rockland Gymnastics Association - Today we're selling brand name candy
Each purchase is matched by the Tandy corporation to help us meet our goal of travelling to Oahu to compete in the East/West conference
Matt's in another world
He stares at her

'll take some
Terrific, how many
We have a special today, 6 bars for ten dollars
Ok

if by rote, Matt pulls out his wallet and hands her a ten
Great
" particular brands you like

Anything is fine
81+ She finally hands him an assortment
Okay --- He's about to close the door
if you could just sign this
have to give you a receipt
'm sorry
this pen-- Matt hands her one from his pocket
Matt waits as the girl fills out and hands him the receipt
He closes the door before she can thank h Ruth is curled up on the couch
Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go
He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his hands - sets it on the coffee table He takes a seat at the other end of the couch
Ruth
() Yes
Ruth
001 had no right
what  said -0
no one, no one should ever have to hear that
( ) 'm so sorry
He looks at her, as she starts to cry
He moves closer to her
It's okay
No, you're right, Matt, You are am-
horrible
-` Please--
85 don't blame you, Matt
just
that girl came by
She came by the school, and  couldn't forgive her
was so
She lets go, crying hard
He lifts her head onto his lap
He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from her forehead as she sobs into his lap
'm sorry
have been so an -  keep seeing him, Matt
've seen him
Matt nods, but he's not really clear
() Oh  know - up in his room - Sometimes swear Frank's in there - on the way home just now - at a stop light - for a second '-- () Not Frank
Matt freezes
Then
Richard
She breaks into sobs
and  don't know what to do
Where did you see him
Eve here - Downtown, and the market saw at South End
He smiled at me, Matt -  keep running into him
he s led
Matt still strokes her hair
But he's in another world
86 -  - The game has just started
Willis deals
Henry, Carl & Willis pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on vacation; but he can see the affection an courtesy
in their eyes
The ne of the game is Texas Chase' He groans
Is there a problem
Why do you delude yourself with that crap
What are you talking about
Look we're not in Vegas
It's five card draw, or seven card stud
( ) That's what  said five card draw - jacks to open - Carl
Asshole, Matt smiles
He's missed these guys
'll open with a dollar
Raise a buck
The bet's to Matt
He stares at his cards for a very long time
Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm
This stops him
Matt looks up
He sees the patience they are all exercising for his typical indecisiveness
This bothers him
He stares back down at his cards
Stalling, waiting for someone to bust him
He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl
They all sort of smile uncomfortably
He can't take it
Oh, for Christ sake say something
This wakes them up
87 Quit pussy footing around me d 't
You just gonna let me stare at these cards all night
No one wants to make the first move
This upsets Matt even more
fine
He stares back down at his cards
Finally it is Carl who speaks
There are things of which  may not speak; There are dreams that cannot die; There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, And bring a pallor into the cheek, And a mist before the eye
And the words of that fatal song come over me like a chill: boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts
Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes
The two men regard each other
-   - The game has ended
Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway
Matt is about to leave
Just climbing in the front seat
When Willis puts a hand on his shoulder
Come back in for a drink
-   - Willis and Matt step back in, closing the door behind them
Honey, are you coming to bed now
Willis moves to the steps leading upstairs
Soon baby, Matt's still here
0
11 %-
: Oh f hi Matt - Hone , would you mind bringing me my pit s
They're downstairs from when the kids were here
'll be right there
-  - few minutes later
Matt sits alone in the room
Be gets up to examine a picture hanging on the opposite wall
He's not particularly interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing time
corner of the room devoted to Naval memories pristine version of Matt's
cap serves as the center piece
Willis comes down from upstairs
She's all set - now what can  get you
'm fine thanks
Willis nods and takes a seat
- you back on the wagon
He is
Sit down Matt you're making me nervous
Matt takes a seat
'm glad you came tonight
Me too
Boy, Carl really laid on the verse huh
() ye
ye he did
Got me thinking - e stops himself
What
don't know - sort of silly really
'mon what is it
89 This thing with - with Frank when he was about three,  guess
We were over at my folkls house
Mom always liked little dogs - this one was a - Pekingese,  think
remember hearing this yelp, and then a scream
Frank ran out pointing to his finger looked at it couldn't see an thino
Mom said Frank must have "cornered the dog" and  knew she was probably right
We were driving home, and Ruth noticed Frank itching his a
she pulled back his sleeve, and there were these two deep, bloody, puncture marks
Why do you think he pointed to his finger
Matt shakes his head
() cruess he didn't want us to ow
He stares into his hands, as the memory crystallizes
Willis looks confused, and somewhat uncomfortable
He gets up and heads to the bar
( ) had to put that dog down
Willis throws some ice in a tumbler
was thinking just the other day about the last time Frankie was- Matt cuts him off
His name was Ar k
Not Frankie
Willis looks stunned
'm sorry Matt
don't care
he just never liked being called that
90 Matt nods
He looks away
She didn't tell me, Willis
She never said a word - She saw him at South End
Christ
She's seen him before
It's killing her didn't think about bail
thought wouldn't have to worry about him for - You know what  heard
He's tending bar up to Old Orchard Beach
Matt looks up
For a friend
Ever notice even the worst bastards have friends
Nobody knows him over there
If theydo, they don't care
They drink what he mixes Willis sets a can of Moxie down in front of Matt
(referring to the can) don't know how you drink this stuff it's what drove me to beer as a child
He sits down with his own drink
moment
hate him, Matt
My boys went to school with h He was the same thei
,- Know what he' 11 do
Five at the most - And then you' 11 e bumping into h all over ow
Remember that woman about seven years a o
Shot her husband sopped him of f t e bridge in the St - Gac-: with a hundred pound sack of cement and said the whole way through it nobody helped her
Know where she is now
She's in Sears ort now, a secretary
And whoever helped her, where the hell is he
91 it'd break my heart Matt, it would, but - you ever think about just - moving away
Matt nods
Stares into his hands for a long time
, yeah, we have
Finally, he looks up, his eyes meeting Willis  s
It wouldn't matter
- - The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet
We turn to find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll
steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk as the sun dies
Looking around we see an ancient gazebo - then stairs leading up to a stone library -  boulder at the foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us - The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae Mama
" The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening
The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an - which faces the harbor
Ruth stands at the bottom of the proscenium - her arms up - directing the choir
The place is filled with half the town
Trying to take it all in
But not really present
Suddenly he turns and leaves
- The town goes to sleep for the night
The signs businesses power down
- ' The establishment's various Beer Signs & interior lights turn off
' - Turns the tumbler of a deadbolt lock
Two cars are all that's left
emerges from the bar
Richard is fast on her heels
He exits, making conversation as he quickly locks the doors
92 Hey -o- wait up
Good night, Richard
See ya tomorrows She starts to walk to her car- He catches up to her, accompanying her to her car
You want to come over for a drink
Just a drink
She stops in front of her car
No, thanks
Maybe some other night
He stands in front of his Brown Suburban, watching as the Waitress gets in her car, pulls away and leaves
Fuckin' bitch
He turns and freezes
Matt Fowler stands a few feet away, an Ortaies calibre 7
65 automatic directly at Richard's face
His gloved hand poin grips the gun tightly
Dr
Fowler
Don't talk
Unlock it and get in
He
wait a minute
Let's, let's just calm down
Matt  the gun
Alright
Shit
Richard obeys
He unlocks both doors
Matt opens the back door, but stays planted, the gun trained on Richard
Richard gets in the driver's seat
Matt climbs in the back
He presses the gun's muzzle against the back of Richard's head
0-, Is there any one at your place
() 93 Good
Drive there
Richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up
Matt aims at his temple, but does not look at his eyes
Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive
Drive slowly - don't try to get stopped
' Matt can see the ocean
He uncocks the revolver
Matt cracks the window
Matt leans down in his seat
He transfers the gun into his left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg
He puts the glove back on, gripping the gun
Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street
/
- They drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding the beach
on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off, that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and pizza houses
The street itself empty of traffic
He was making it with my wife
His voice is careful, not pleading
Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head
Richard flinches and moves his head forward
Matt lowers the gun to his lap
Don-t talk
/
'  - The Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front
Matt leans forward
Th
muzzle grazing Richard's head
Drive it to the back
91+ You wouldn't have it cocked, would you
For when  put on the brakes
Matt  it
It is now
Richard tenses
He drives around the side of the building
'    - The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and brakes
The engine shuts off
Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard
He gets out and shuts the door with his hip
All right
Richard looks at the gun, then gets out
He moves across the grass
Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on either side of them and scattered tall trees
He glances from house to house
Looking for signs of one insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching the all-night channel from Boston
All is quiet
They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door
Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door
It-s pitch black inside the duplex
Turn on the light
Richard flips the wall switch
in the light
Matt stares at his wide back, and long reach
'  - Richard stops just inside the kitchen
Matt closes the door softly behind gim
Where-s you r suitcase
Richard almost turns around
My suitcase
95 Matt grips the gun tighter, straining to keep it from ling
Where is it
in the bedroom closet
That's where were going then
When we get to a door you stop and turn on the light
They cross the kitchen
Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator clean and white
Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's drawings taped to its door
Wait
Richard stops
Matt looks conflicted
Doubt has crept into his face For a moment he seems to have lost his resolve
() Jesus
Matt looks to Richard with a renewed sense of purpose
keep going
light flicks on
They take the hall past the living room
Matt doesn't want to see anymore of Richard's life
But he can't help h elf
He takes it all in: Magazines and newspapers in a wicker basket, clean ashtrays, a stereo, 's neatly shelved next to it
They continue down a hallway
Richard stops outside a door
There's no wall switch
Where's the light
the bed
96 Let's go
Richard steps into the darkness
Matt is careful to stay a pace behind
Richard leans over by the bed
Matt braces
lick
small bedside lamp turns on
The bed, a double one, is neatly made; the ashtray on the bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no photographs- prob ly so the girl - who is scae
- won't have to see Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs
But because Matt is a father and a husband, thou h never ex- husband, he knows (and does not want to ow that this bedroom has never been theirs alone
Richard turns around; Matt looks at his lips, his wide jaw
wanted to work things out with her
Try to get together with her again
But  couldn't even talk to her
He was always with her
Dr
Fowler, 'm going to jail for it
am going to jail
If  ever get out 'll be an old man
Isn't that enough
You're not going to jail
Pack clothes for warm weather
What's going on
You're not gonna let me go
Matt looks away
He doesn't answer
Dr
Fowler
You're jumping bail
Dr
Fowler
Matt points the pistol at Richard's face
The barrel trembles a little
Richard reaches up into his closet and pulls out two large canvas bags
He places them on the - He pulls a third bag, a small, red, woman's suitcase, Natalie's no doubt, next to the others
He moves to the bureau
It's the trial
We can't go through that, my wife and me
So you're leaving
've got you a ticket
My wife keeps seeing you
can't have that anymore
97 He was making it with my wife
'd go pick up my kids and he'd be there
Sometimes he spent the night
Duncan told me
He doesn't look at Matt as he speaks
He opens the to ewer
Matt steps closer so he can see Richard's hangs
underwear and the socks rolled, the underwear folded and stacked
Richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase
The kitchen the livin room the clothes
Matt is struck b this man's sense of order, o iscio ine
Matt watches the absurdity of Richard sorting clothes by season
He even packs a small instamatic camera
He packs the things a man accumulates and become part of him
(re: the suitcases) Okay, that's enough
need some things from the bathroom
alright
Richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops
Keep going
Gotta pee
Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy
He pushes him into the room
Takes a step back and pulls the door so it is only slightly ajar
He keeps his foot between the jam and the door
He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror
He can hear him make water
He looks like he wonders about allowing this courtesy
Mattes glances at: picture on the wall outside of the bathroom: Natalie Richard and their two boys, in front of someone's house
Smiling
She looks happy
looks around the room frantically - his eyes find nothing that will help his situation - he flushes the toilet - Matt swings the door fully open - Richard fills a travel kit with toiletries
98 ' Richard tucks the travel kit into a bag
Matt keeps the gun on him
Richard closes the suitcase, and faces Matt
He looks at the Matt moves around behind him
Now Richard is between Matt and the lighted hall
Richard carries a canvas bag in each hand
Matt pulls another glove from his pocket
He uses it to turn off the bedside lamp
Richard now d'_lhouetted in the doorway
Let's go
Richard steps into the hall
Matt follows, carrying the small suitcase in one hand, the gun in the other
They start down the hallway
Matt turns off lights with his elbow as they go
Past the living room into the kitchen
Wait
Richard tenses, he stops at the kitchen door
Matt sets the suitcase down
He uses that hand to reach into his jacket
He pulls out a red, white, and blue piece of paper
He drops it on the counter top
Words on the paper read
Matt picks up the suitcase again
He steps closer to him
Presses the gun into Richard's back
open the door
Richard's reaches down and carefully turns the knob
He slowly pulls the door open
Matt takes a step back
Get the light
Richard reaches down and hits the switch
Click
The two men now in silhouette
Richard exits first
Matt close behind
- Matt sets the case down, reaches bacjcan gently closes the door
They walk down the two brick steps to the lawn
s the cross the lawn
Matt's eves and ears once a ain alert for any sign of life
Not Eng
They reac the garage walk to the back of the Brown Suburban
Richard drops the two bags near the rear bumper
99 Matt keeps the gun steady as Richard pops open the hatch and loads the bags
Matt sets the small suitcase at Richard's feet
He reaches down and loads it last
/ Richard gets into the driver's seat
Matt in the back
Richard looks up in the rear-view
For a moment, Matt connects with the desperate eyes
They'll catch me
They'll check passenger lists
didn't use your name
They'll figure that out too
You think wouldn't have done it myself if it was that easy
Silence
He starts it up, slides into reverse
He looks back over his shoulder as they back down the driveway
Matt averts his stare
Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face beyond it
You were alone
We've got it worked out
who's we
Good estion
Matt doesn't answer though
Richard shifts into drive
'  -   - The Brown Suburban pulls out of the lot and onto the street
- There's no planes this time of night, Dr
Fowler
back through town
Then north on 73
The airport's South
Somebody's going to keep you for a while
They'll take you to the airport - turn on the radio
Find the game
100 It's after three They run it again
Matt leans back, quietly uncorking the hammer
No more talking
Richard tries to read Matt s face in the mirror, but it -s now in shadows
Richard fumbles with the radio, surfing the stations
Matt is right
The game is on
Nomar Garcia arra hits a long drive to left with runners in scoring position " cinch to collect 200 hits this season
" Richard sets his eyes on the road
-  1  - The Brown Suburban heads away from Old orchard, onto a small two lane rural hi hwayy
The road is flanked on both sides by open fields, and lonely capes
Few cars on the road
/ They come up over the high bride over the channel: to the left the smacking curling white at the breakwater and beyond that the dark sea and a full moon, and down to the right the small fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove
Swirling colors from behind catch their attention
Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view
state trooper's car with its gumballs flashing races up in the distance behind them
Matt jams the gun into Richard's ribs and slouches down
(Trying to stay ca ri ht take it easy - pull over to the shoo der
Matt & Richard sit tight waiting for the inevitable
The light gains in intensity, as the cab fills with crimson
The cruiser tears right past them
Quickly fading into the distance
e - Matt leans back he looks shaken
Richard watches his chance 101 - the vague outline of mountains, It is almost pitch black
Onl hi d' the moon
Then, from far off, a pair of headlights move tow us, fighting through the thick night 73 Richard sees the sign for the 73 North
He glances back at Matt in the rearview mirror
He makes the turn
'   - The Brown Suburban makes the turn
- Matt & Richard check out their surroundings
- The Brown Suburban drives across a small steel bridge that covers a salt river
The tires make a low thumping sound on the grid
-     ( ) - They have left the 73 and are driving on a small rural route
Matt leans forward, the gun rests against the top of Richard's seat
He looks around, trying to get a bearing
Turn around
Why
We missed it
Turn around
back and turn in at the last road
-  - Richard slows, and makes a -turn
His lights illuminate - and   signs
He takes a right, onto a dirt road flanked on both sides by fir trees
We track with the Brown Suburban as fir trees strobe in the foreground
1 02 /
- There's nothing back here Dr
Fowler donut understand why you don-t just It's for you're car
You don't think we'd leave it at the airport do you
,
They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the headlights shining into the dense woods
The road seems endless
Richard cringes as they bounce over a bump
Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield
Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin come into view
is parked in front of the place
Stop here
The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop
Richard keeps the engine running
Matt presses the gun hard against his neck
He straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror
Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel
Turn it off
Richard does
The ball game disappears, and the silence is strangely a anent
He continues to hold the w eel with both hands
He ooks in the mirror
'll do twenty years, Dr
Fowler, 'll be fifty-four years old
That's two years younger than - Matt gets out and kcks the door shut
Richard opens his door
He doesn't move
Just sits in the interior light
His face now pleading
Matt can see it in his lips
Get the bags
- ( ) Where are we Dr
owler
103 Almost there
Richard carefully gets out
Instinctively, he raises his hands about shoulder level
They move to the back of the Brown Suburban
Richard pops the hatch
He pulls out the two canvas bags
He sets them on the ground
He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase
We hear a   slam shut
Richard looks surprised
He turns back to Matt
'mon now
Richard reaches down and picks up the bags
He struggles to carry all three
Matt grabs the small suitcase from him
That way
Richard lugs the bags toward the cabin
We hear
Richard stops
He nods to Matt
Mr
Grinnel
'll get them, son
Willis takes the bags from Richard, turns, and carries them up the long path back to the cabin
r '
He waits a moment, u-sure of what to do
Finally, he starts wal'-
ing up the path after Willis
Wait
Richard stops, d-step
He tenses, waiting
You can carry this one
Richard turns
He reaches out to take the bag from Matt
Matt keeps it at his side, and takes a step back, his gun trained on Richard
'
'
'
'
,   ,
,
Matt stands there motionless
We hear
Willis runs up to Matt
'
() The two men look into each others eyes
Matt seems to be somewhe re else He looks back down at the body
This isn't what we talked out, He tried to run
Willis looks at the gun still in Matt's hand, the little suitcase in the other
We were going to wait, and take him out in the woods
Matt raises his head
He looks at Willis flatly
105 coul t wait
- a d in a  , is suddenly dragged away by the
It es quite a racket
We follow it as it scrapes along, the road back into the woods - They have roved the body from the  and are now draggin it deep into the wood
The only sound is the breaking of brans es and their continual grunting
The stopat the top of a small knoll, panting and sweating
Wil is quietly removes a small mass of branches, revealing a o t large, well-dug hole
Together, they drag the body t he edge of the hole
Move behind it
Lift the legs, and push it in
-  - Willis and Matt come up from the woods
They carry Richard's lug age
Willis drops the canvas bags into the hole
Matt loo s at the suitcase and then drops it in
Willis takes a couple of steps away, and grabs two shovels leaning against a small birch
He hands one to Matt
Together, they begin filling in the hole
-  - Matt holds the flashlight as Willis sprinkles leaves and branches over the hole
Willis freezes, as if he has heard something
Matt cuts the light
They hear some footsteps approaching, closer, then they see it - not 30 yards distant watchin them  Buck with a splendid rack, a deep chestsnowy white, a l of him in his prime His flag up d twitching
His eyes u Quin Then he bounds off and is gone
- The walk through the woods
The light on the ground
They bot look up through the trees where they end at the lake
Neither of them speak, only the sounds of their hea breathing and clumsy strides through the low brush and over fa len branches
106 Wide and dark, lap ing softly at the bank, a small island near it's middle, with black, tall evergreens
Matt, gun in hand, takes two steps back, he strides with the throw and goes to one knee as he follows through
The dark shapeless object arcing downward, splashing
,
/
-   - Matt in the Brown Suburban, is stopped behind the wooden and arm, Willis in his own car behind
The swing bridge is open for the 5:00a
m
fishing boats
The operator uses his long metal tool, the bridge swings back around
The arm rises
Seems somewhere else
() 'mon g  tt
Matt drives the Brown Suburban over the bridge
The operator gives him a friendly nod
Waves to Willis in the Ford
- - Willis's truck & Richard's  travel towards us away from Wiscasset
On their way to Cheesy Town Island
-    - - Willis watches out his windshield as the Brown Suburban parks in the stations lot
Matt gets out of the Brown Suburban and locks the drivers door
Be walks the Ford, and gets in the passenger side
They drive off
/-    - Willis's car moves slowly over the channel bridge, back to Wiscasset
Matt rolls down his window
Be tosses Richards keys over the side of the brad e
The trim shapes of lobster boats and smal craft anchored in t he hExbor below, loo like old toys in a bathtub, He rolls up the window as the car continues across
Both men silent, lost in thought, staring out the windshield at the road ahead
107 {) What time is it
Matt checks his watch
Ten to six
We lost an hour
Sorry
Willis's jaw tightens
(almost losing his temper) Yep
high tide
Can't stop people from fish'in Matt - uck'in brides Matt looks over at Willis
'm sor Willis
Willis looks at Matt
He knows
Eyes back to the road
( ) Stopped in to his little shed there once place reeked
the guy's spilled more whiskey than we've ever drunk
Just pray he's already three sheets to the wind
Matt doesn't reply
Katie's pill will be wearing off soon
/
- They drive down the empty streets of a sleeping Rockland
,    , 3TONNE' Something catches Matt's attention in the store front
The anne ins in the window They seem to be staring at h 108 & - - ' The Ford pulls up to the curb
Matt gets out
Willis drives away
Matt starts walking
- The   suddenly turn off',
The world is waking up now
- In the distance, Matt can see his house
The birds all seem to wake at once
Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue
The surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep
He picks up his pace
-
Matt enters
- He roves his tennis shoes, his pants, he starts unbuttoning his shirt
Now in his -shirt and boxers, he examines his clothes and shoes carefully, before putting them into the washer - He pours detergent inside - and starts the cycle
He steps to a little sink and washes up
The light has been left on, he kills it and heads upstairs
-
Matt slowly walks down the hall, to - And stands in the doorway
He pauses, seeing only the orange ember of Ruth's cigarette, in the dark
109 () Did you do it
He doesn-t answer
He walks in and comes to bed, climbing in as Ruth moves over
Are you all right
He lies down
,
She is on her side, she props herself up on her elbow - watching him
He waits a longtime before speaking There was a picture with Natalie and the boys hanging on his wall - Ruth looks at him strangely
() what is it, Matt
- the way she was smiling
What
don't know - Ruth looks at the back of Matt's head
Matt
He doesn't move
He says nothing else
She continues to stare at him
Uncertainty beginning to form on her face
She looks lost
If only things cou d be as t ey were
Then
at  thinking - you must be hungry
She waits for a response, but gets e
She gets out of bed, leaves the room and heads down stairs
downstairs in the kitchen
110 0
Matt
Matt just lies there, in another world
Matt dear, do you want coffee
Be doesn't respond
Instead he looks at his finger
The bandage wet from washing up
He slides it off easily, like oversized ring
The skin has healed
Sun light creeps in through the curtains, onto Matt's face
Ruth lies sleeping on his chest
breakfast tray at his bedside which he hasn't touched Matt is cede awake
He stares at the ceiling Reliving it His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness
The lids heavy
If only he could sleep
But he won't
Not today
There is a small crack in the ceiling
He'll have to fix that
