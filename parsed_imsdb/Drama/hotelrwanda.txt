Written by Keir Pearson & Terry George : : burning white sun high in a clear blue sky, : rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat
mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a   blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on
:  white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line jumping
,
: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm
The van stops next to the policeman
Mr
Rusesabagina, good morning
In the passenger seat  , late 30's, flashes a smile
He is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie, it is a matter of pride)
quick shake of hands
Money passes from one to the other
The van parked by the runway tarmac
African music plays on the radio
Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch
, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously
An airport baggage handler approaches the van
Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour
Thank you
(to Zozo) He can get the beer
2
(suddenly worried) Rutaganda's place
What's wrong
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu
You are safe there
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry
Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off
The white van, marked "   ," whips its way through Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets
Zozo works  , weaves in and out of traffic
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir
It depends where you sit Zozo
In coach it is like the bus to Giterama
That is why they call it coach
Maybe
But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates
(impressed) You have taken business class
Many times
Suddenly, Zozo slows
Paul looks up, : a gathering on the side of the road -- a large crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts
They're members of the  - the Hutu Militia
3
(Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road, obstructing cars, threatening the occupants
Several of them perform a rhythmic dance - the  war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox
(') Turn off
Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind
There is nowhere to turn, sir
As the van approaches, Slow down
The van pulls up beside the Militia
(') Boys, do you know the way to Mr
Rutagunda's warehouse
Some Militia approach
They are suddenly friendly, helpful
#1 It is one more mile on this road
Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars
This is thirsty work, let me treat you to some beers
As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved
' At his desk in front of a fan
, late 30's, huge, gold chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same Interahamwe shirt
He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso
Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer
George holds out his massive shirt
You will join us at the rally today
Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee
4
will try my best George but these days have no time for rallies or politics
Politics is power, Paul
And money
Paul studies his watch
Time is money, George
We need extra beer today
Business is good at the hotel
Very good
am always glad to see you Paul
George leads Paul out into the warehouse
As a forklift lifts   , George angers
(') Hell man, that is not beer, put it back
But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind
Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch
(to Paul) won't charge extra
Thank you
The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and  onto the floor: , hundreds of them, spill out
An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades
bargain buy, from China
Ten cents each, 'll get a dollar
At least
Off Zozo terrified
5
Sabena airliner lands
Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase
Paul's van pulls up by the luggage belt
large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt
It has Brussels - Kigali destination stickers all over it
As Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid
The ice has melted
Zozo goes to open it
(') Don't
Let's go
Paul slips money to two customs officials
The van speeds through traffic
More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the sidewalk
Then at an intersection they see
- a mass of young men and women, most in the same colorful uniform
Line after line, waves all performing the war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears, wooden imitation guns
large banner reads, "Hutu Power
" flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music
On it dances the  and waves a machete to the crowd
Zozo sinks down behind the wheel
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know 'm Tutsi
The parade passes
As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George gave him, peels off a few dollars
Here, Zozo, for your trouble
Zozo takes it
6
The van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway and  twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs
An   rushes from his booth and lifts the gate
Perfectly timed
The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes
sign on the guard house reads "     "
Lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an exotic African paradise
The van heads to a magnificent colonial building
(
) Pull up at the front door
valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked
It's unheard of for a service van to stop out front
(') (urgent, to the valet) Help Zozo
Paul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful blend of Africa and Europe
Guests stare as water sloshes and spills from the crate
, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look of disapproval
Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him
(re: spilled water) Gregoire
Take care of this
Gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul
(') Gregoire
See to this right away
The elevator door opens and reveals  the Belgian hotel manager, mid- 40's, reading some reports
He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying the box as they step in
Bik looks puzzled
(') It's an emergency, sir
Now Bik sees the wet floor
7
Paul
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me
The elevator doors shut
Bik's left standing in disbelief
The crate is hefted onto a counter
The top pried off
crowd of cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in
Any of them make it
Into the sink
They hoist up one end of the crate and  spill out
Many make it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall onto the floor
The cooks sort the living from the dead
Twelve are dead
How dead
The cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no
(') Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill them will ah, a stuffing, something local
Cassava, and Tipali
Yes
Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a cassava and Tipali crush'
Paul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved
/ Paul inspects the tables' fresh flowers, sparkling crystal glasses
He looks to the bar - Grolsch on ice
8
The sound of African drums fills the air
Paul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume - Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of European dignitaries
The male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in similar ceremonial dress
The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale
The guests break into
Paul flings open double doors to a reception room and the crowd moves in
Mr
Ambassador, please come in
Thank you, Paul
Colonel, , middle aged, Canadian,follows the  Ambassador
The Colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of  Peacekeepers
(all troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets, white helmets and arm bands) Colonel Oliver, you are very welcome
The Ambassador shakes the Colonel's hand
Colonel
'd like you to meet Mr
Colson, of our Regional Aid Division
, crew cut, military build, is obviously
(') Colonel Oliver is the liason officer for the
peace keeping forces
Paul backs away unnoticed
/ then marches into the busy kitchen, claps his hands toward a gathering of waiters
Please, serve the hors d'ouvres now
waiter whispers to him
9
General Bizimungu wants to see you
Paul heads out of the kitchen
luxurious lounge/club called the Kigali Club - an African Casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla, grand piano in the corner
Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle freely
The few tourists stand out
heads to a table
The center of attention and conversation is General , 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control
Paul, this scotch is exceptional
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie thought you'd like it
Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please
Paul heads for the lobby
He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi reporter  who covers the political scene for the local independent newspaper
Paul, Paul, a moment please
Yes, Benedict, what can  do
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception
'm sorry, it's a private function
Benedict takes out his reporters notebook
At least tell me who is attending
The newspaper will be grateful
Paul laughs
10
will be grateful if you keep my name out of your newspaper
Wait here and you will see who has attended as they leave
Paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock room hatch
(to the coat check) Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase
Yes, sir
Take it to the bar storeroom
Put three bottles of Glenmorangie
he writes it down on a pad) ---, into it
Paul moves off as the coat check scurries away
(
) Oh, Paul, Paul An American woman,  , rich, blonde, surgically enhanced, stands by the door of the tourism office
Paul walks into the tourism office
It is decorated with posters and photos of Rwanda's single most important economic asset - the rare silver back mountain Gorillas
There's a picture of the real-life Diane Fossey next to the movie poster for "Gorillas in the Mist"
Numerous books and video cassettes
's older husband, , and four American friends wait
Paul, Paul
Our trip has been cancelled
Yes, 'm sorry Madame Denver, it is because of the rebels
Rebels
What rebels
11
Don't be stupid for Christ sake
The Watusis are invading the country
told you not to come here
The Tutsi rebels are far away on the border
And soon there will be peace
Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you
But  came here to see the gorillas
will try to arrange something
The luncheon is in full swing
Paul glides in the background
Close on: The Ambassador in deep conversation with Oliver
Things will calm down when the president signs the peace agreement with the rebels
Our intelligence, Mr
Ambassador, is that the Hutu government has been stockpiling weapons and are preparing a massacre
That's not what  hear
Excuse me
Paul
Paul comes over) Colonel, you know the house manager, Paul Rusesabagina
How was your meal, sir
Magnificent
reads) Scottish lobster, in Rwanda
You see General what a genius this man is
You want anything, this man can get it
How about a battalion of
Marines
12
Now, General, don't ask for the impossible
Paul smiles
have heard, Mr
Ambassador, that they have discovered oil here, under Lake Kivu
Oliver bursts out laughing
You're right, Mr
Ambassador, Paul knows how to get anything, even
troops
The ambassador takes Paul's hand, shakes it warmly
Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul
Paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him
General Bizimungu gazes through glass into the reception room, Paul shake hands and joke with the Ambassador
(He's impressed
) Paul notices the General
The General raises his briefcase and waves
Paul waves back
Another favor rendered
It is night now
Floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow
Tiki oil lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among the trees
Wild birds
Paul walks to the employee car park at the rear
He sees Gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing Zozo's pillbox porter's hat between them with Zozo trapped in the middle trying to jump and catch it
Gregoire thinks this tease is great fun
13
Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some of them can fly
he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat sails over Gregoire's head and lands at Paul's feet
Zozo scampers to pick it up
No
(points to Gregoire) You pick it up
Gregoire doesn't move
(') How are your dish-washing skills, Gregoire
Gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to Zozo, who walks away quickly
Gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel
(') Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand
(
) Cockroaches
Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard
(') Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul
sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to disappear inside
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis
That's what  came to talk to you about
Excuse me
The Hutu-Tutsi thing
The  faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords
And the
wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony
Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish
14
Leave it to me
Bik leans slightly closer
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times
Of course
Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat next to him
Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali  along to music on the radio and eating chocolates from the box
He passes bicycles laden with produce
The song on the radio ends and local news comes on
(
) Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware
The dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is near
Watch your neighbor
Identify these cockroaches
Then rise up and stamp out this murderous infestation
Paul turns the station
Finds another with music
Lights burn in windows
Kids play soccer in dusty lots
Paul's van turns onto a residential street and slows
He  twice
The metal gate to a walled compound swings open
(old, peaked hat, bare feet, pathetic) stands just inside
Paul waves to him and pullsinto the courtyard, two cars are already parked there
' neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall
Paul parks and gets out
runs and greets him,
Down, Pealiss
15
His wife, , a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand
This is , their family doctor and close friend
(') Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time
asked Odette to take a look at little Anais
She has a rash
Your brother's here
Yes, with Fedens and the children
e wants some advice
Good to see you, Paul
Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana
(') must go, Paul
You will not stay for dinner
No thank you, Tatiana
My best to Jean Baptiste
: ' The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off
' (a sigh) Thomas wants advice
He wants your wisdom
Let's have dinner first
16
Of course
His brother-in-law  and sister-in-law  come out to greet Paul the Patriarch
They hug
Kids run everywhere
Paul spots his twin nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old
He scoops them up, one in each arm
Hello, Anais
She laughs
am Carine
You are not Anais
am Anais
Oh, Carine, that is a shame
have a present for Anais
Anais reaches out her hand
Paul sets them on the ground, takes a chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine
Anais jumps up and down
It is for me
Goodness,  cannot tell
guess  must find another present
He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the   chocolates to his children who are gathered around
' crowded family table
Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine
Roger, your turn
Paul's eldest, , 12, bows his head
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc
Dear Lord, thank you
17
Thank you, Roger
Food is passed around
Roger gobbles his down
(') Why the hurry, Roger
Simon has a new pet
Can  go see it
No,  don't want you going on the street
Please, papa,  have a secret path
Who is this Simon
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy
Homework
It's done
And he did extra chores
Wash your things, and be back soon
Roger takes off at a run
' Roger runs to a wooden fence, gets down, moves two boards and squeezes through into a path, almost a tunnel in dense reeds
' (') Roger crawls along his path
There's a gap a little way down, and Roger shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard
He runs to a back window of the house and taps on it
Soon , 12, appears
He slides it open
Let's feed it
18
Simon lets Roger in
' (') Roger holds a    in a jar
Simon has a bag of bugs
Waves the bag in front of the snake
It's forked tongue goes wild
Let me
Simon hands him the bugs
Roger lifts the lid, drops one bug in, and the snake strikes
The boys jump back, laugh
' After dinner coffee for the adults
Tatiana, Thomas and Fedens at the table
Paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like Solomon
've heard bad things, Paul
My assistant says we should get out of Rwanda
Why should we leave
have a new job, things have never been better for us
What good is it if we are murdered in our bed
Your assistant, he is Hutu
Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia
He wants your job
No, he is a friend, but he tells me to listen to the radio
All day they talk about the great slaughter
That station is filth
has listened, now he decides to speak
19
Today  talked to my friend the American Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the United Nations
They are preparing a banquet for the peace signing
The are flying in their best reporters
The world is watching
There will be peace
Don't listen to this man
Solomon has spoken
Fedens smiles, Tatiana rubs Paul's arm
' (') Roger crawls along his grass tunnel
Then he hears something
He looks through the reeds toward the street
: Military boots, a cluster of Hutu soldiers in their crisp Khaki uniforms
He hears whispering
'  (
) That house
' Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car
They say good night to their guests
Anais and Carine sleep in the car
Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate
Just then Roger emerges from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid
There are soldiers
Where
On the street
Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside
Thomas and Fedens grab the sleeping twins from their car
Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap between the gate hinge and the gate post
'
: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around jeeps, they whisper and point
It's a raid
20
Now they move rushing out of view
The sounds of  ,  , ' , Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's
It's Tatiana
What is it
She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the street
He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog
(') Oh, my God, it's Victor
Why do they want Victor
They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep
At this point Victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to die
It's a horror
(') Do something
What
Call your friends in the army
Call someone
Victor is harmless
This is a mistake
Please, be quiet
Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle
'm going to talk to them
Paul grabs her
No
We must do something
Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house
21
What would you have us do
Argue with these madmen
We cannot interfere
' Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears
You better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets
Tatiana hides her anger
'll fix a bed
' Paul lies in bed unable to sleep
The clock reads 3:00 am
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army
couldn't help
You could have asked for a favor
No,  could not
What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals
All day long  work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist
To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help  have powerful people  can call upon
Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor
He was not family
Family is all that matters
Do you think if you or  were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us
22
They do not have your connections
Connections
have no connections, only favors
If  call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool
He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody
" Then my hard work is doubly squandered
insult the General and  do not get to use my favor at all
Please leave these things to my good judgment
His turn away indicates the discussion is over
Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house
:  6th, 1994
An army jeep is parked just inside
General Bizimungu is in the passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie
The General gives an 'll see you soon wave
The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white  jeeps, foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a  repair van unloading monitors
Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the  men unload
Welcome, gentlemen
The lobby buzzes with activity
At the reception, Gregoire is surrounded by a  news crew: , young, chic female reporter/producer, and , tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and his local sound guy Peter
Gloria is upset
We reserved five rooms not two 'm sorry, ma'am, but  see only two here in the computer
23
Jock sees Paul
Paul, how the hell are ya'
am delighted to see you, Mr
Daglish
They moved you from the Diplomat
Promoted
House Manager
Good for you
(moves closer) We're having a little trouble, Paul
We booked five rooms, but
Paul moves behind the desk
Let me check
He punches into the computer
Ah,  see the mistake
You were reading - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of  Gregoire
Close on the computer: It clearly states  - two rooms
Gregoire looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger
Of course, the , five rooms
(lies) They are being prepared as we speak have ordered fresh flowers and complimentary champagne
Gloria picks up her bag
Great,  really need a shower
Just give me a moment to get your keys
Paul better come up with three rooms fast
Then he spots the reporter Benedict hovering at the door
24
(') (to Gloria) Excuse me for one second
Paul hurries over to Benedict
(') Benedict, you should meet the  people
They could use your expertise
Benedict is delighted
They head back across the lobby
(') (whisper) Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here any moment
The  should talk to him
They join the  team
(') Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of our best journalists
He covers all the big stories
thought you should meet
Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm
Benedict, beautiful name
'm Gloria Fleming
Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure
There are no more rooms
Give me the phone
Gregoire hands it over
Paul dials
(') Madame Denver
have very good news have a present for you, in return for the cancellation of your gorilla expedition have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu lodge
wonderful experience
No, no extra charge
luxury coach will leave in one hour
'll send maids up to help you all pack
You're welcome
Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire
25
(') Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him need three rooms
And send a team of maids up to the Americans
want those rooms turned around in twenty minutes
heads for the glass doors and sees: General Bizimungu, briefcase in hand, gives the tv interview, He's confident, controlled Benedict stands close by as Gloria interviews
There are rumors, General, that your army, the Hutu army, consider these peace accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels
(laughs) Nonsense
At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces
Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement
Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing
Thank you for coming to Rwanda
(on the move)
You will see what a beautiful country this is
Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the  luggage
He puts his hand out
Gregoire hands him keys
Paul does his rounds
He double checks the banquet room where technicians install several  monitors and test the signal
He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity
He wanders behind the bar
Everything is 'under control'
He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage
26
Forgive the hurry but  do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake
It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa
Lunch
All we do is eat
thought there was famine in Africa
Exactly, we can't have our guests starving
What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States
Gen
Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty briefcase
Keep that cockroach Benedict away from me
As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check, hands her the briefcase
Same as last time
She nods, hurries off just as the  crew appears
Paul hands out keys, greets each
(') The fifth room is your broadcast room
Good
'd like to book a massage
Of course
Jock, the Scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes his key
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you
You know
'm sorry, Mr
Daglish, this is the Mille Collines
No working girls here
Can we phone them in, Paul
27
'm afraid  can't do that, Mr
Daglish
Ah, Zozo
Paul calls Zozo over
(') You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat
Jock gets the code instantly, as Zozo smiles
Zozo
The very man
The Scot and Zozo greet, then hurry off
Paul supervises waiters hanging a banner
It reads "Peace, Love, and Brotherhood
1994"
Reporters watch rows of TVs
All broadcast the signing of the Arusha Accords
(Reporters have political chatter
) : the TVs as President Habyarimana signs
As president Habyarimana signs a peace accord between the Tutsi rebels and his Hutu army there remains strong doubts that the extremist Hutu Power will abide by the accords
But for now hope has returned to Rwanda for the first time in many years
All the African reporters in the room
Fireworks go off outside the hotel
Colonel Oliver raises a glass of champagne and leads the room in a toast
To Peace
The room as one raise their glasses
: Paul as he nods to a member of the tribal band on the small stage
Then, African drummers hammer out a fast uplifting beat as the full troupe of ceremonial dancers skip into the room in celebration
28
Paul checks out the banques
They appear empty, then a voice
Paul, join us
It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a shiny blue suit
bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone
Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby
Have a drink
He pours
George points his glass toward the Europeans
Look at them, they want to see the tribes dance to their tune
Here is our dance
Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the Hutu Militia War Dance
(') Come on, Paul
Show them our dance
Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then   appears to stumble and shoulder bumps the big man
George falls into his chair
Forgive me, George, my step was off
Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts: To our president
May he find peace
As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu smiles at some insider joke
Reporters and crews pack up their equipment
Paul shakes hands, orders porters to pick up cases
Then a porter whispers a message to Paul
Excuse me, gentlemen
29
Paul emerges, discovers Fedens and Thomas - they look embarrassed to be in such exulted surroundings
Forgive us, Paul
We must talk
What's wrong
We are leaving Rwanda, Paul
Go to the terrace,  will join you
Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas
My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we should get out now, that soon it will be very bad
Paul stifles his anger
Give me this man's name
His name is Naramaranga, but please, Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is a friend, he likes me
He told me there is a signal
It is "Cut the tall trees
" When they hear the signal, the militia are to go to war
Please, let us take Tatiana with us
You are Hutu, you will be safe
Thomas, Fedens,  am a man who looks after his family
If there were danger would be the first to leave
- a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the city
Fedens jumps
30
What was that
Calm yourself, it is fireworks to celebrate the peace
Please, Paul, tomorrow  will bring you my car
You will sell it for me and get a fair price
We will go to Tanzania until there is real peace
Excuse me, Paul, you have a call
Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone
ello
Tatsi
Yes, they are here
Yes know but  want them to calm down
and Fedens listen
(') Already the press are packing their bags
The  man told me there's no story here
We are boring now
'll be home soon
He hangs up
(') Let us all go home and sleep
Paul escorts Fedens and Thomas to their car
Call when you get home
And don't worry, Thomas
Good night
' Paul's at the wheel, driving
thick mist
Barely a car on the road
Shadows dart past faint house lights
The windscreen clouds
Paul switches on his wipers
Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears from the mist, speeds past
Paul switches the preset buttons on the radio as he drives
He can only find fevered drum-based
31
' Paul turns onto his street
The houses are dark: windows shuttered; gates closed; not a soul about
Paul stops before his gate twice
The gate doesn't open
He hops out and opens it with a key
Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car
He hears the far off sound of gunfire
Distant explosions light the night sky
' Paul drives in
His compound is curiously dark
His headlights sweep across his pitch-black house
: The gates swing shut
We   as Paul turns and faces his house
Paul whistles for the dog, nothing
He goes back to the car, gets a flashlight, heads for the front door
' The door slowly opens
Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch, nothing
He listens
The only sounds are distant explosions and gunfire
The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating: magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys in a basket
' Paul continues his search
Scans the counter
There's food on the stove
The table is set
He hears a , quickly cut short, from one of the bedrooms
' Paul shines the light into a room
Looks for a second, then closes the door, and walks to the next
He stops and listens with his ear to the door
Nothing
He pushes it in
' Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates: Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back
:  dark figure behind a blinding light
The dog breaks free, runs to Paul
32
Pealiss
From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief
Paul
Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room
Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste
Jean Baptiste
Our house has been burned
What is going on
The president has been murdered
Murdered
By whom
The radio says Tutsi rebels
Nonsense
Why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace
Tatiana pulls Paul aside
Where are Thomas and Fedens
sent them home
Go and call them
tried already
The phones do not work
Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio
Our great president is murdered, by the Tutsi cockroaches
They tricked him, then they killed him
We must cleanse this country, Good Hutus of Rwanda
We must clear the brush
Clear the brush of all cockroaches
Clear the brush
33
The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window
Everyone jumps, children whimper
Paul is shocked but tries to pull things together
Come on, everyone out of this room, find a seat in the living room
He holds the door open, they file out, frightened
Tatiana is last, he stops her, steps back in, closes the door
(') (in hushed anger) Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here
They came through the bushes, over the wall
What could  do
Send them home
We are not the police
What do we have to protect them
Please
Let them stay 'til morning
The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence
They know you are Tutsi
The door knocks
Paul gets up, angry
Please, Paul, 'til first light
Dawn
Then they go
Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest daughter
Forgive me, Paul
Danielle says that Roger has gone
Tatiana comes over instantly, worried
Gone where
Tell me, Danielle
Their daughter Danielle answers
34
Next door, mama
He was afraid for his friend Simon
He went to fetch him
Roger crawls between the shrubs
He hears
He peers through the long grass
Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet
And among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a length of chain  on the ground
' Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her
Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth
Shhhhh
next door
Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car
beat
More Paul takes his hand from her mouth
She's sobbing
' Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs
Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate
Engines rev
Roger crawls from the bushes
Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle
Then stops,  ,  ()
' Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate
Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he pulls it back, clambers underneath it
Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry
Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel
35
Then he hears
He moves toward the sound
Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes
He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles
Ssshh
Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house
' Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down
Tatiana is beside them
Roger
Paul turns the flashlight on Roger
Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood
Her , stifled by fear
(') Oh, my God
Where are you hurt, son
oger stares blankly
Odette is beside them now
Get his clothes off
Hands pull and tear his clothes off
Towels wipe him down
Odette looks all over his body with the flashlight
Despite the blood Roger has no injuries
What happened, son
Where did you get this blood
But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized
Children cry
He's not injured
His paralysis freaks the women in the room
Paul turns angrily to them
Leave us, give us some space
36
He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door
(') (to Tatiana) The neighbors must go at dawn
Tatiana hugs her son
The faintest grey of dawn over the city
Then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance
millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a grenade explosion, echoes
The birds dart, in another direction as the  of a machine gun rips the air
' sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window
Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk
Will you take a little milk
Nothing
Let him sleep
The door knocks
The old guard calls in frightened
(
) Mr
Paul
(to Tatiana) It is time for the neighbors to leave
He heads for the door
' Paul steps out, closes the door behind him
small delegation of the men wait nervously
It is true
37
He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the  World service, a crackly Brit voice
(It's Gloria the reporter
) (
) The Hutu president's plane was struck by a ground-to-air missile as he returned from signing the peace accord with the Tutsi rebels
There were no survivors
The Hutu government has already blamed the Tutsi rebels
The rebels have denied the accusation
Already there are reports of reprisal killings on the streets
As they listen, a young woman lets out a , and flees the window where she's been sitting
(
) They are here
Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom
Paul manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees: sits on the high wall by the gate
He pulls another up beside him
anic in the room now
Paul turns
Shut up
' : The soldiers drop into his garden
They draw pistols
(
) What is it, Paul
Stay with the children
' : The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open
Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed , sit in the drive like many-limbed beasts of war
Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his garden
The soldiers jump out
: Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms
Paul is frozen at the  of rifles on the door
The door gives,  flood in
They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised, 38
Out, get out now
Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier
Who is in charge
Captain is at the door
Who are you
am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu
We are looking for you
He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside
' The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard
Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded together
What is this about
Let me see your identity card
Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain
: Paul's  - it reads Ethnicity:
The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off
(') You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president
Yes, it is a calamity for us all
You work at the Hotel Diplomat
No
work at the Mille Collines
39
The Captain looks confused
Paul quickly: (') used to work at the Diplomat
Do you know how to open the safe there
(Paul nods) Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe
You must open it
Of course
Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see what is going on
(') Captain,  must take my family
It is not safe here
Where is your family
Tatiana is beside him now
(interrupts) This is them
Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors
Paul is stunned
All of them
cannot take them
No, no, good Captain, you do not have to
We have the car and our van
She points to the Mille Collines van
he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent message
He listens
Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van
In a second, they are all clambering in
Let's go
40
Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van
Neighbors are jammed in like sardines, 15, more, inside
Tatiana and their kids are squashed together on the front bench
The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the street
The Militia men wave sticks, machetes
- Paul looks back as they speed off down the street
Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway
As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a  and push a stove on a child's skateboard
has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head
The convoy speeds through the deserted streets
Slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes, nailed clubs and spears as they dance
: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing the windshield, the windows
Inside a family huddles together in terror, waiting for the windows to give way
In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies
(to Tatiana) Don't look
The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel
There are other jeeps, and several staff in a panic
The janitor, , sees Paul, bursts into waves of joy
Mr
Paul, sir
Oh, Mr
Paul
We must open every door right now for the government
Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep
(to the Captain) The safe is in the manager's office
41
The Captain nods to two soldiers
Go with him, get the keys
Paul runs through the lobby
The staff look petrified
' Paul bursts into the room
The two soldiers follow
He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination a few times, tries the handle, clunk
It doesn't open
He's forgotten the number
The soldiers look at him impatiently
Paul improvises
Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate, and maybe a few beers in the fridge
Don't let them go to waste
The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge
Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk
It opens
He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal
He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over the beer and chocolates in the fridge
s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door
(') 've got them
He is about to leave
1 Wait
Paul looks back at the soldier
1 (') Sit down
Paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into their pockets
42
Paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance
Paul emerges to see: All of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their knees, with their hands on their heads
The Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul
He marches toward him and    on the face
Traitor
Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet
The Captain snatches a bunch of  cards from a soldier, hurls the cards in Paul's face
(') They are all Tutsi cockroaches
Let me explain
He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling captives
The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers, shoves it into Paul's hand
Paul looks at him
Please,  don't use guns
There is nothing to it
The Captain raises his own pistol and  it
Everyone jumps with fright
(') Shoot them now or you die first
The Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head
Cocks the hammer
43
Captain, what could  pay you not to do this
The Captain laughs
You want to pay me
Why not
These are not rebels, look at them
Soon they will be worthless to you
Why not take some money, for your work
How much
Name a price
Ten thousand francs for each one
don't have that much
The Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them
(') Wait
Wait
Paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars
(') Here, here, a thousand  dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family
To let us drive off to the Mille Collines
How many in your family
Six
The Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes
Pull your family out
Paul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls
Odette kneels beside Tatiana
Paul whispers
Have you any money
44
Nothing
Paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain pocket the dollars, move toward the line
Paul, don't let them die
(urgent) Get in
Paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for all the courage he can muster, then turns back
(') Captain, let these people give you some money, whatever they have
The Captain hesitates
Paul sees this, runs over to the line of neighbors
(') Give me everything, everything you have
pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry falls onto the ground
Paul scoops it all up
he Captain looks at it, takes it, then: There is only enough for one cockroach
The Captain raises his pistol
(') Pick one to take with you
Now each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging
Wait, wait
Paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids
(') Ten
And four children
45
'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them
The Captain points the gun
Give me it
don't have it here
At the Mille Collines
can get it for you
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the
swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house
will get the money, you keep them outside
The Captain smiles
will keep your family outside
Let's go
The convoy pulls up at the outer gates of the Mille Collines
It's manned by
he Captain walks to Paul in the van
Go with my soldiers
And hurry back if you want to keep these cockroaches
The Captain nods to Paul's children
Paul jumps into the Rwandan army jeep
(to  Peacekeepers) am the manager
Open the gate
Chaos -  jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened Tutsi refugees
46
: Bik, the Dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees Paul
Paul,  have to talk to you
But Paul ignores Bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the parking lot
Paul rushes in:   The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared white tourists
solitary receptionist, besieged by anxious guests, is relieved to see Paul
Oh, sir, please can you
Paul rushes to the accounting room behind the reception desk, closes the door
Paul pulls bundles of dollars from the hotel safe
Paul pushes through the mob at the door
Bik comes up
Paul
grabs Paul) have to talk to you
'll be back
Paul breaks free and hurries over to the Army jeep
(') (hops in) Let's go
Paul jumps from the jeep
Waves to Tatiana in the van, then gives the money to the Captain
47
Now let them go
No response
Money in hand, the Captain eyes Paul with malice
(') Don't be foolish
There's more money to be made here
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju
The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off
Paul runs to the van and jumps in
Jubilation, in the rear of the van
Odette is in tears
Thank you, thank you, Paul
Paul doesn't reply
Tatiana hugs him
He gives her a look - a mix of relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family
Paul's van arrives
Bik hangs from a minibus
(shouts) Paul,  have to go
The staff have fled Kivu Lodge
have to close it
He flings office keys to Paul
(') While 'm away, you're in charge
Bik's van takes off
group of tourists hears Bik's words
Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want to get a flight
Paul looks at them
They're in your safety boxes
We need them right away
48
Come inside
At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed
(
) He's in charge, that's him
Paul goes behind the desk
Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists
(staccato) to the airport
my embassy tried to call
the airport is closed refund
this is outrageous
Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost
Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists
Please,  am the house manager
Return in thirty minutes and we will deal with all your requests, thank you
Paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty
(') What happened to all the rooms
Finally he finds a key, pushes through to Tatiana, hands a key to Odette and Jean Baptiste
(') Take this room
Tatiana, bring the children
Paul starts to lead his family away
(re: neighbors) What about them
Paul looses it
Them
They almost got us all killed have done enough for them
We cannot look after them anymore
49
What are you going to do
You cannot drive them out onto the road
They can stay with me
What
will not have them on my conscience
They will stay in my room
(to Zozo) Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms
Put these people in them
Yes, sir
Paul hurries his family along the corridor
Rwandan refugees wander aimlessly pulling their meagre possessions
(calls out) Moses, Moses Seradungu
Can  help you
'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room
What is his room number
don't know
Go downstairs,  will help you
Paul finds his room and opens the door
leads his family into a one-bedroom suite
The kids drop to the beds exhausted
Tatiana picks up the phone and dials
50
What are you doing
Trying Thomas and Fedens
We've got to get them here
Paul paces the room
The maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a newspaper is scattered across the desk
(re: room) This won't do
It will do just fine
So Paul tidies the place
As he does, Any luck
No answer
Please send someone to get them, please
'll try
Paul leaves
Paul waits, then a car pulls up, an Indian businessman, Mr
Garindi, gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken
Terrible times, Paul
There are bodies everywhere
cannot stay here
need a great favor
He hands Mr
Garindi an address
(') need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family
No, no
This is a very dangerous part of town
cannot do this
51
This would be an enormous favor to me am a man of means, Mr
Garandi
When this nonsense is over  will be most grateful
will see what  can do
Mr
Garindi climbs back into his car
Paul stops just shy of the lobby
Around the corner is a mob of angry guests
Paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie; button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder
Then he takes a breath and steps around the corner
Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen
Now, how can  help you
The mob rushes him
: Paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him
Zozo emerges from the office with two tourists
(') Where are the receptionists
Where's Gregoire
He has taken the presidential suite
What
Paul storms off
- :  door with a placard reading "Presidential Suite"
Paul knocks
The door opens
Gregoire answers, half-naked
(surprised) Mr
Manager
Gregoire, what are you doing here
52
'   (
) Who is it
What do you want
Get out of this room and get back to work
don't have to listen to you anymore
am in charge now
Get back to work or 'll fire you
Let me ask you Mr
Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches
If  were to leave this room, 'm sure  could find this smell
know people who could cleanse it
(stares) But maybe it doesn't bother you
Why is that
Are used to this smell
Not me,  need a clean room to escape it
Gregoire closes the door
Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle will have to wait
Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance  and his family
Paul, you know who this is
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here
(to Xavier) Paul will look after you
will need a suite
53
Of course
He moves over to Zozo
(') Get the key to suite twelve, take these people there right away
There's a commotion by the door
Paul goes over
valet stops a group of Tutsi refugees from entering
(') What's going on
Sir, they have no reservations
Paul studies the group, - a ragged bunch, no way are they Mille Collines guest material
#2 Please, sir, we have nowhere else to go
They're hunting us
Wait over there
#3 We need a room
said everyone go over there
Paul sees:  Colonel Oliver giving an interview to the  in front of the hotel
Paul approaches the  reporter Gloria and Colonel Oliver as their interview concludes
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president
No
But  fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels
54
We've heard reports of reprisal killings
Will the  intervene to stop the bloodshed
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role
If the  changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed
Yes
With some re-inforcements 'm confident we could impose order
Have you requested re-enforcements
Yes we have
What was the response
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me
Colonel Oliver shakes Gloria's hand then moves off toward Paul
(') Paul, 've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room
Yes sir, but these people (points) they cannot stay here
've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium
'm sorry,  can't possibly take them Paul
'm overrun with refugees
As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them
moves to the door, where Jock and Gloria argue beside a saloon car with the word `press' spelt out in tape on the wind sreen For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there
We need to get out and cover it
55
We're not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car
That's the ground rules
Ground rules
Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection
She walks off
Paul works his way through the crowds in the lobby, sees a trolley of dishes by an elevator, looks around, can't see any staff
Disgusted, he pushes the trolley himself
Paul pushes the trolley into the deserted kitchen
At the back door, several cooks listen to the radio
'Good Hutus, we must destroy an infestation of cockroaches at the technical college
' Turn that off
We have a hotel to run
The cooks halfheartedly slouch back to the sinks
The lobby is overflowing with refugees
Paul stands with phone to ear
Zozo walks up
(to Zozo) Where's housekeeping
They won't pick up
Sir, no one wants to work
They say the boss has left
56
Paul heads for the back office
' neat corporate office
Paul picks up the phone
' Several executive officers sit across from Sabena President around a speaker phone
Can  have your name again
(
) Paul Rusesabagina, Mr
Godefroid
The house manager
met you on your last visit
Yes, Paul,  remember
The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena
Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over
This is really bad news
Paul can't allow them to close
Sir, that would be very bad for our reputation
We are an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers
What would they think if Sabena deserted them now
(lies) assure you the United Nations has everything under control
He looks at the others
Very well
But if this thing gets worse, we must close
If there's anything you need, call anytime
There is one thing  need right away
57
' Paul waits by the fax, then it spits out a single page
Every member of the hotel staff is gathered together
Paul addresses them as Zozo hands out copies of a fax
This is my letter of appointment, signed by Mr
Godefroid, the president of Sabena
The Mille Collines is a five star establishment, we will run it that way
If you don't want to work for me, then leave now
No one moves
(') want the hallways cleaned now, a menu prepared for the dining room
Where's the pianist
hand goes up
(') want you on the piano in the Kigali Room tonight
Back to work
Paul emerges to find more refugees, some settled on the lawn, others gathered in clumps by the doorway
Paul calls over to the valet
Take these people to the rear car park, they can't stay here
Suddenly women and children on the lawn scream and run in fear
Behind them bushes shake, then suddenly a bloody figure wearing only boxer shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the driveway
It's the journalist, , covered in blood
His ear has been chopped off
As Paul runs to him, calls to Zozo
(') Get Odette
58
Paul grabs Benedict, tries to calm him
(') What happened
They're killing everyone
The Lady Minister
The  soldiers
They're at the gate
He points down the driveway
This sparks many of the women refugees, and white guests, to flee inside the hotel
Odette arrives with her bag, leads Benedict inside
Jock has been filming all of this
Now Jock runs, camera still on his shoulder, toward the gate
Paul takes off after him
More Tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear
As Jock films, Paul arrives by the gate house
soldiers watch the outside road
Engines roar, then
convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate
Drunken Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco wig, waves a cordless power drill
The drill bit is red with blood
In the next truck,  Militia  triumphantly taunt the  soldiers as they hold blue  helmets high on sticks
The helmets are shot through with holes
#1 We kill
We kill you next
cock their weapons, aim
armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway
The back door opens,  Colonel Oliver jumps out
Hold the line here
Do not shoot
The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by
Paul approaches Oliver 59
What's happening
They murdered my soldiers
Ten Belgians who  sent to get the lady minister
Where is she
Oliver shakes his head
He helps Paul clamber into the armored car
Paul follows Oliver as he marches through the lobby
Several reporters surround them
Is it true about the Belgian soldiers
Are all ten dead
Paul watches the  command disappear into an elevator
Paul is in the corridor, talking to Tatiana
Has Roger spoken yet
No, Odette says he's in shock
How can we help him
He needs to be in a safe place
(a beat) Have you heard from Mr
Garindi
Give him time
There's a clank of metal
Paul looks and sees: waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door
He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves Paul and the waiter in
60
The room is set up as a make-shift broadcast center
Gloria is on a phone to the  in London, she hangs up
Okay, we're feeding through live now
She fixes her outfit, sits straight up in the chair
Behind her two monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads
Okay London
and five four three two one
That's correct Tom
Today's gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian patrol has left the  peacekeeping force in a state of disarray
Its commander has called for re-enforcements
However, the General Council is deeply divided
The United States, still smarting from the 's disastrous Somalia mission, has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce
Meanwhile, the slaughter goes on
Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda
Gloria on the phone, listens
And, cut
good, give me a call guys, let me know you've got it
Jock turns to Paul
Perfect timing
This goes out live
Jock points skyward
Satellite feed
( ) Great
(listens) No kidding,  When will they be here
Excellent
Yes, call then
She hangs up
61
(') The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force
When will they be here
Very soon
Thank God
Jock's is at the window scanning with his camera, getting b roll, then he sees something
Hey Peter, hook me back into the monitors
Jock's filming as Peter makes the connection
(') Holy shit
Holy shit
What is it
Jock focuses On the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill
: Of a crowd hovering close to a group of Rwandan Tutsis seated on the ground
Two Militia emerge from the crowd, waving machetes
They  their way along the line, savage, powerful blows, butchering people like cattle
(Author note: we will use real news footage of this) (') You fucking see that
(shock) Oh my God
On Screen: The crowd run off, waving machetes
Gloria snaps out of her shock, snatches the phone, dials
62
(') It's Gloria
Listen we've footage, unbelievable footage
massacre
Machetes, murderers, dead bodies
You have to lead with this
We'll send it through right now
Wait 'til you see this
She puts the phone down, turns to the others, triumphant
An embarrassed silence in the room
Jock is disgusted by her glee
He picks up a plate from the trolley
(to Gloria) Here, have a sandwich
Fuck you
She storms out
Paul fills the embarrassed silence
'm glad you filmed this
Now the West will have to stop it
Excuse me, gentlemen
The businessman Mr
Garindi knocks on room 211
Paul opens the door, sees him, then turns back to Tatiana
Tatsi, come
Tatsi appears at the door with several of the kids
(') (to the kids) Go back inside
The kids do as they're told
Paul and Tatsi shut the door and join the businessman in the hall
(') Did you find the twins
Tatiana clings to Paul, fearful of the news
made it to the house but it was empty
It had been robbed
Oh God
63
Was there blood
No blood
As  left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me
went to her house
She has the little girls
They are safe
My brother, his wife
Did this woman know of them
Did they leave the children with her
The businessman shakes his head no
Tears run down Tatiana's face
She holds Paul's arm to stop from falling to the floor
This is not bad news, Tatsi
Perhaps they fled or could not make it home
There is hope
(to the businessman) Please go back, bring the children to us
(frightened)No ma'am,  cannot do that
The roadblocks are everywhere
They are looking for children
They shout, "Kill the babies to clear the infestation
" Leave them be, they are safe
have to go now
Paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the businessman's hand
Thank you for your help
He leaves
Tatiana pulls Paul to her
My sister is dead, Paul
They would not leave the children
No
They are not dead
Stop this
Paul and Tatiana push through the French tourists and  workers running across the lobby
64
Mon Dieu, Merci
Cheers break out
Paul and Tatsi peer from the crowd and through the lobby window see: French and Italian special forces pull into the parking lot, standing tall in their jeeps, macho western super troops, triumphant
Salvation
Wild cheering, flowers draped around necks, kisses
Westerners, Rwandans, dance and sing in celebration
Paul : Colonel Oliver off to the side, with the commanders of the French special forces
: You have a battalion, you could stop this now
The Hutu army is no match for you
Those are not our orders
Oliver pulls off his blue beret, throws it on the ground, points his finger at the French and Italian officers
You will remember this day for the rest of your lives
He walks off, returns, picks up his beret
Paul watches as he storms into the lobby
Paul follows
Paul follows the Colonel into the Kigali Club
The place is empty, the bartender missing, gone to celebrate
Colonel, what can  get you
Paul gets behind the bar
65
Anything
Strong
Canadian Club
Oliver cracks a weary smile
Paul pours two drinks, slides one across
He raises his glass
(') Congratulations, Colonel
You have saved us all
(raw cynicism) Congratulations
You should spit in my face
Excuse me, Colonel
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless
don't understand
Don't bullshit me, Paul
You're the smartest man here
You have them all eating out of your hand
You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing
Paul doesn't answer
(') You're fucking black
You're not even a nigger, you're African
(downs his drink) They're not staying to stop this thing
They're gonna fly right out of here with their people
(shocked) Their people
They're only taking the whites
66
' Paul opens the door
Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave
Children, go into the hallway
Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled
(') (to the kids) Please, go
The kids leave
What's wrong
Paul takes her hands in his
All the whites are leaving
Tatiana's grip tightens
(') They are being evacuated
What about us
We have been abandoned
Tatiana clings to hope
The soldiers will stop the killers
Paul looses it
Listen to me woman
said all the whites are leaving
The French, the Italians, even the Belgian  soldiers
But who is left
don't know
Colonel Oliver says the has three hundred soldiers for the whole country
Black soldiers, Pakistanis
67
He looks up at her
(') The most the Colonel can spare for the hotel are four men, and they're not allowed to shoot
He takes her hand, makes her sit down
(') If anything should happen, if the Militia arrive, you must take the children and go to the roof
Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear
What for
Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana
Do what  say, woman
You hear me
will meet you there
He storms out
: :  chaos of luggage, white tourists,  agency people, Italian and French soldiers, elite, slick
On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful
torrential African rain storm soaks everything
Porters with big umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses
French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards
Jock films the evacuees boarding buses
At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,    listens to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill
68
Why should  pay to stay in a, in a holocaust
Tell me
Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole
You are not staying sir, you are leaving
Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded onto buses
Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away from frightened Rwandan coworkers
in the rain
cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep
Jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young
One girl begs Jock to take her with him
Please, please, they will put me on the street
They will chop me
Darlin', believe me, if  could
He digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes
Everything he has he gives to her
Then he pulls her toward Paul, digs out his wallet
(') Here
Here
He pushes two Visa cards into Paul's hands
(') Give her what she wants, room, food, anything
Charge it all
Don't you put her out, Paul
would never do that
know that, Paul
'm sorry
Here take this
69
Jock pulls a Rolex off his wrist
This is a Rolex,  can't take it
Take it for Christ sake
wish it was a fucking aeroplane
Jock embraces Paul, tears in his eyes
Gloria watches from the doorway
Embarrassed by Jock, She becomes officious
Let's go, Jock
(turns on her) Go
What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war
'm ashamed
Are you
Well, are ya'
You're drunk
Gloria marches onto the bus
(to a French soldier) What are we waiting for
We have to evacuate some nuns from a convent
They are on their way
Jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus
Then there is a disturbance on the driveway
group of French nuns, along with maybe a hundred Tutsi women and children come running up the driveway
They are all terrified
One nun leads them with a French flag
French soldiers run forward
commander orders them to form   a line, blocking the refugees
French soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd
Several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling Rwandan children with them
Panic breaks out among the crowd
70
/ Jock grabs his camera, pushes off the bus
Nuns cling to young children
French soldiers wrench the nuns away, lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus
films, as    screams at him
The last nun is dragged onto a bus
Jock looks to Paul, then gets on the bus
The convoy - French jeeps, buses, Italian jeeps,  jeeps takes off, through the refugees, turns a corner, gone
Paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests: Weeping women, frightened children
The convoy passes the gate house
Across the road, two jeeps of Rwandan Army soldiers watch the convoy leave
They get on the radio
Where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy Europeans and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers
Paul picks his way among them
Zozo catches up
What do we do with all these people
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there
And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it
'
Paul enters, drops to the bed
Tatiana curls up next to him
You could leave, Paul
71
What are you saying, Tatsi
Your card says Hutu
Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks
Get them out
Please
Enough of this
We stay together
Let me rest,  will feel better then
Paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl of Don Williams singing
Close on: Paul as his eyes droop and to the music
kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as Close on Paul's face, as the music plays
His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing Paul's , an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around
The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears
You are the manager
Yes, sir
What is wrong
Everyone must leave the hotel now
Why sir
It's an order
Get everyone out now
ah
need some time
Please give us twenty, thirty minutes
People are sleeping
The lieutenant is not impressed
(') Please, have some cold drinks
will be as quick as  can
'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes
72
We will be outside, ten minutes
The soldiers march off
Paul goes back inside
The kids, sensing the menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor
Suddenly Tatiana notices Roger is missing
Where's Roger
Danielle points to under the bed
: Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears
Come on son, everything is all right
He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to Tatiana as he phones the front desk
(') (on phone) Who is this
Zozo
know
Get them beer
He turns to Tatiana
(') Go to the roof now
(terrified) What for Paul
(forceful) Do as  say
will be there soon
He hurries out
Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner
The corridor is empty of soldiers
Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from their rooms
group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are gathered in the hallway
Paul spots one man holding a pistol
He runs up
(to the man with the pistol) Are you mad
They will gun us all down
73
Better to die by the bullet than the machete
Paul pulls the gun off him
Wait here, please
Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off
' Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials
( ) Good day, General Bizimungu please
Do you know where he is
Please ask him to call Paul Rusesabagina
It is urgent
Phone again
: increasingly frantic calls
(') Colonel Bagsora
Where
Can you find him
: (') Who would order such a thing
: (') Did you find the General
Paul hangs up the phone defeated
He looks at his watch
His head flops onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo
He sees it
' The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches
If British Airways abandons the route we should bid for it
His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then
74
( ) 'm sorry, sir
have a call from Paul in Kigali
He says it's urgent
The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button
Paul
Are you alright
(
) We have a big problem
The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel
The president is baffled
Out
Where are you going
do not know, sir
think they will kill us all
The president can barely form words to reply
All
What do you mean all
The staff, the guests
The staff and guests
How many
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff
have ten minutes left
wish  could have done more, sir
Please, thank all my friends at Sabena
You have been good to me and my family
(panicked) Paul, wait, wait, 'm going to put you on hold for one minute, stay on the phone
He hits the hold button
Looks to the other executives
They are stunned to silence by Paul's profound farewell
' Paul listens to music on the phone
75
Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones
Get the prime minister's office
Call General Chareaux
Louis get the
Tell them this is Belgian property
' The music is suddenly interrupted
(
) Paul, are you there
Yes, thank you Mr
President
(
) Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call
Paul thinks
The French
They supply the Rwandan army
(
) Paul, do everything you can to buy time
will call you back
Paul hurries from the room
Zozo at the computer, printing something
Paul walks up, sees: The Hotel's Registry printing
Paul grabs it, studies
What are you doing
The lieutenant wants the register
He pushes Zozo toward the elevator
Go and get more beer
Now Paul is on the computer, typing
76
: The register shows that day's date: April 13
Paul hits a few keys
: The date above the register is April 4
Paul hits the print button
The printer clicks to life
Paul with the printed registry and Zozo with beer walk to the jeeps
The soldiers don't wait for the Captain's order, they mob Zozo, grab beers
The lieutenant marches up to Paul
Where's the guest list
Paul hands him the printout
He studies it, reads
(') Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier
What is this
The guest list
It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president
The lieutenant grabs Paul by the shirt
Are you trying to make a fool of me
There are no Europeans left in that hotel
Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there
That will take time
You don't have time
If  do not have the names, so that  can pick out the traitors, then  will kill everyone here in this car park
Get in there now
Paul turns to walk back in
The lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground
One soldier comes running to him with a radio
Paul watches
The lieutenant listens, then calls to Paul
(') Hey you, come here
Paul returns
77
(') Who did you call
Call, sir
Don't lie to me
What's your name
Rusesabagina
Paul Rusesabagina
will remember that name
(turns to his soldiers) Let's go
The soldiers roar off down the driveway
looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look
Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the neighbors sitting huddled together
(They do not know the soldiers have left
) Tatiana is frozen to the spot
They have gone
Tatiana grabs him
Tears of joy
Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him, thank him like a messiah
This effects him
He seems genuinely moved as he shakes hands and hugs them
Sir
The president of Sabena is on the phone for you
' Paul arrives behind the front desk
Paul hits the button
They are gone
Thank you, sir
What did you do
78
' Gotfroid is at his desk
managed to get the President of France on the phone
(
) Thank you, sir, you saved our lives
Paul,  pleaded with the president to go in and get you all
He told me it will not happen
Why
can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans
Silence
(') You have to get out of there, Paul will do whatever  can
: ' The elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad, are gathered in the office
There will be no rescue, no intervention force
We can only save ourselves
Call any foreigner you know, tell them what will happen to us
Say goodbye but when you say goodbye, say it as though you're reaching through and shaking their hand
Let them know if they let go of that hand, you will die
(silence) We must shame them into sending help
The others look stunned
79
(') Get on the phones while we still can
At least we can say they heard our cries
Zozo come with me
Paul leaves
: Paul looks around the lobby
It resembles a refugee center more than a five star hotel
He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits  and erases the register
He picks up the phone, calls
Send two of the housekeeping carpenters to the lobby
Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo
(') Everyone gather together now
Zozo get them all together
They herd together quickly
(') No one can remain in this lobby any longer
have rooms available
Who can pay
The rental is six hundred francs per day
About fifty percent of the hands go up
cannot pay
Go with Zozo to the ballroom
We will find you bedding
This is a hotel
No one will be allowed to stay in the lobby
The carpenters arrive beside Paul
(') Good
want you to go around and take all the numbers off the doors
80
What shall we put in their place
Nothing
want no numbers on the doors
Paul going door to door, knocking
The rooms are all packed with Tutsi refugees
door opens
Good day
Here is your bill for the last week
If you cannot pay, or think you will not be able to pay, go to the ballroom
Zozo will take care of you
: Paul knocks on a door
The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees that it is Paul
Come in Paul
beautiful two-bedroom suite
Xavier lives in comfort compared to the other refugees
'm afraid you will have to move room
Move
Where to
'm going to put you on the third floor
The third floor are low class rooms
Yes they are
However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms
81
(to his wife) Pack the bags, we have to move
Also, this is your bill for the last week
Paul leaves, Xavier looks shocked
: Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict (with a bandage over his missing ear), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes all around the world
We see this  and ;  and  -- hen Odette on the phone
Yes, that's right
helped set up the treatment center in Nairobi
'm in the Mille Collines Hotel right now with my husband, Peter, and my two boys
If you do not help us we will be murdered
Zozo arrives
Sir, General Bizimungu is here
The pool patio is deserted except for General Bizimungu and three soldiers who lounge at a table
Gregoire and his girlfriend sun on reclining deck chairs like movie stars
Paul and a waiter with a tray of drinks join the General
am glad you are well
Paul hands the scotch to Bizimungu
'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie
As long as it is scotch
(drinks) Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul
82
The United Nations are still here
(laughs) The United Nations
Madmen are on the streets, Paul
But  will take care of you
(chugs his drink) Your cellar is well-stocked, right
Yes, General
am glad you came by overheard something that  think you should know about
What did you overhear
discussion between an American Embassy official and a  Colonel
What did they say
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything
Watch everything
How
They are gone
Paul points surreptitiously to the sky
The General looks up
Satellites
Satellites
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder
And what will they do with these satellites
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command
The high command
Our high command
83
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial
Lock them all away forever
No political risk, and big publicity
' That's what he said
(a beat)  thought 'd better tell you
The General looks again to the sky then
The Americans
Who are they to put us on trial
Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man
Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders `we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us
' What do you think would have happened
No different
(') Indeed, general
Excuse me momentarily
Paul fills Bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of beer to Zozo
Paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably dwindled in stock
Where has all our beer gone
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers
How much beer
Many beers
Paul arrives back at the pool, hands Bizimungu his briefcase
Zozo gives the beer to the soldiers
am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel
Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us
The police are very busy
84
understand General, but when  last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded
Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition
He did
"Well rewarded" Those were his words
If  were to spare a few policemen, where would  station them
The front gate would be best, General
They could check all guests
will see what  can do
admire you, General
How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness
am strong, Paul, like a lion
wish  were like you
Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one
Paul nods over toward Gregoire
He is staff
he General gets up
Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him approach
The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and throws it into the pool
As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass
(') Get to work, you slug
Gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend
85
The General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow
(') Make sure, Paul, your guests are generous
Benedict greets Paul in the lobby
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office
We, who is we
delegation
' Paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste
Paul's puzzled, there's an air of tension in the room
Yes
brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks
You have no right to charge us rent
Why not
This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery
That is not true
Another accuser speaks up
Yes it is
He charges for food, for everything
Where is all this money going
We hear he has a deal with Bizimungu
86
#2 It is said that you work for the murderer George Rutagunda
Murmurs of agreement
Paul has heard enough
confess
( a beat) It's true  have a deal with General Bizimungu
He was just here
worked out another money making scheme for him
New arrivals will be taxed at the gate
Silence
(') Do you know what my deal is with Bizimungu
pay him and he keeps you alive
Anyone want to take their money back
pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it
(') Here, here take it
And you don't have to pay your bill
will move you into the ballroom or out into the gardens
He walks among them
(') And, yes,  work with George Rutagunda
buy rice and beans, beer and soap will have to visit his warehouse soon because we are running out of food
Who wants to come with me
Paul holds the door open
(') Anyone who wants to come with me stay behind
If not, please leave
They hurry out, duly chastised
But Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste remain
(') (laughs) You are most certainly not coming with me
You will get me killed
You can't go to that place, they know what you are doing here
87
George will not hurt me,  am too profitable to him
What if he is not there
Paul hasn't got an answer for that one
He leads them out
' Roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on the floor
: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates the Gregoire story in whispers
As soon as the General left he came running back
(mimics Gregoire) Help me, sir,  have been possessed by a witch
(Paul's own voice now)  witch you say
(mimics) Yes, yes,  did not know  was in that room
The president's room, why would  be in the president's room
(own voice) Indeed, the General asked me the same
(mimics) Asked you what
(own voice) Does Gregoire think he is president now
mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear
(laughing) Stop, stop, we will waken the children
Paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more
Lynch Bages, 84
Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef
So where is the lamb
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it
They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over him
What's the matter
88
We're running out of beer and other supplies
She kisses him
The foreigners abandon us and you do inventory
You are so conscientious
She kisses him again, tries to cheer him
have to go out to get food
Go out
Where
To Rutagunda's place
It is close by
No, no
have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide
You cannot go alone
'm not going alone
'll take Gregoire with me
He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now
The lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed
regoire it is good to see you back to work
Please, except my humblest apologies
Don't worry
have a job this morning must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda
You know George
Gregoire nods, impressed
89
(') Fetch the van
thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge
(fearful) Where are we going, sir
For supplies, you drive
The fog is too heavy, sir
Just drive, Gregoire
They pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box
The van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over broken glass, the fog swirls around them
Then Gregoire hits the brakes
In front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across two oil drums
They wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one
We should go back, sir
Paul wants to agree, but can't
He opens his door
Paul gets out, tentative
Hello
Nothing
He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the ground, hurries back to the van
90
Let's go
They drive past the barricade
The van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets
hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress, shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner
' The fog still hangs like a cloud
As they pull up, a group of young Militia emerge from Toyota trucks
#1 What do you want
We are to meet Mr
Rutagunda
#1 The commander is not here
He will be here
#1 Show me your Paul and Gregoire hand over their  cards
The Militia man studies them, then pockets the cards
Excuse me
#1 What
Our cards, please
#1 What cards
You have our cards
91
#1 No
But  make cards
Would you like me to make you two cards
How much
#1 One thousand francs
Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up
George Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out
he Militia man pulls out the  cards, hands them back
#1 (') apologetic) joke
Rutagunda strides over
Paul
My old friend
Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors of the warehouse
They walk in
' The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars
George points to the stacks of beer
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that
need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey Beer yes, but no whiskey
You have no whiskey
No whiskey, no spirits
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch
Anyway, have bled that cow enough Paul
92
Paul counts out the Rwandan francs
What do you mean George
Their money is no good to them
Soon all the Ineysi will be dead
(incredulous) ) You cannot kill them all
Why not
We are half way there already
Paul's stomach heaves
He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the van with Gregoire
George comes to the passenger window
(') Let me give you a tip my friend, our generals in the army say 'do not go near the Mille Collines or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here'
But the generals are about to leave, and we will be in charge
It is time to butcher your cow for the meat
(a beat) You can help us Paul
You have some very important traitors at your hotel
The politician Xavier
The liar Benedict
If we were to get them, then maybe we could let one or two cockroaches get away
You understand, Paul
Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully
Let's go
Take the river road back
It is clear
The van takes off
The fog has gotten thicker
They can barely see a yard ahead
Are you sure this is the river road
saw the sign
93
The van begins to bump erratically
Bump, bump, bump
Stop
You've driven off the road
You'll put us in the river
The van jerks to a halt
Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls
And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own death - an African Munz's Scream
Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies, men, women, children
he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them
breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet
: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as Paul can see
Paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog
Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van
Go back
Go back
Gregoire throws the van into reverse
hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another horror
The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance
Paul hops out, turns to Gregoire
Tell no one what you saw, do you understand
Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van
94
Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes
Beyond him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool, laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in Central Park
watches
Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a flood, he buries his face in his hands
Then a voice
(
) Mr
Manager
Paul wipes his eyes, turns
little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm
(') Mr
Manager, sir
Then Paul sees what is wrong
The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the muscle of his arm
Paul studies it
That's a big one
(pinches the thorn) Here we go
Paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch
Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in
' Tatiana feeds the children - rice and beans
Paul arrives
Good evening, Papa
Roger, you have no greeting for me
Roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes out, as though he has forgotten
Tears form in his eyes
(') There, do not worry, no tears
He hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes Tatiana's hand, leads her to the door
95
(whispers) Where are we going
They slip out
Tatiana stops
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof
It's alright
This is the only place can find some peace
Paul slips out onto the roof
Tatiana follows
Artillery and mortar fire rumble in the distance
Flashes silhouette along the far hills above Kigali
He leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of wine
They sit
He opens the wine
(laughs)  hear we must pay for everything
How much for this
kiss
They kiss
You are a very good man, Paul Rusesabagina
he kisses him again
have a confession
When we met
In Ruhengeri
Yes, when you worked as the nurse
Yes
96
had you transferred to Kigali
What
bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali
Why
To be closer
So that  could marry you
What was the bribe
(silence) What am  worth to you
It was substantial
Tell me what it was
car
What sort of car
What does it matter
want to know
Volkswagen
Volkswagen
he slaps him playfully
(') hope it was a new Volkswagen
She kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately
97
Paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance
The  armored car comes up the driveway
Colonel Oliver gets out, strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand
Great news, Paul, we're going to get you out of here
The sweetest words Paul has ever heard
Oliver is on the stage, all the refugee guests are crowded into the room he has a list in his hand
The  has been notified that the following families have received travel visas from the following countries
He reads
(') Abukesu - Tanzania, Arumangu -Zambia, Bawroanga - Kenya, : Elation among the chosen families

voice calls out
98
Colonel, sir
Why not take us all to the airport
We can wait there to obtain visas
can't do that
Our camp at the airport is overwhelmed already
We could not defend you there
You are better to stay here and work to get an exit visa
Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd
Paul's : Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated
He pushes through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the list
Colonel, Odette Camundu
she must be on the list
Oliver shakes his head no
Paul, only those  called can get on the trucks
do not want to have to pull people off, you understand
Paul nods yes
Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside
will not leave without the twins
We have to get out of here Tatiana
Please, please try one more time
'll try but we have to leave, with or without them
want you to promise
She reluctantly nods yes
Mr
Garindi waits nervously in the lobby
Paul arrives
99
It is dangerous to be here
The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches
need one last favor
Go back and get the twins
(emphatic) No, it is impossible
That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting
The children are dead
How do you know
Everyone is dead there
The dogs eat the bodies in the street
have to go
will give you my house
The businessman turns back
(') It's a fine house
Here is a paper
Paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator
He runs to her (') Madame Kawunda, please
Paul leads her over
(') need you to witness this signature
(to the businessman) Madame Kawunda is the Minister for Agriculture
She is a very reliable witness
Paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman
(') Please witness this deed
She signs
Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand
(') There, now go and find them
They have no papers
No one knows they are Tutsi
They will be alive
100
The businessman heads for the door
(') You must be back by 7:00a
m
tomorrow
Paul watches him go
(') Seven, remember
The Mr
Garindi leaves
Paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn
The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns
The grounds are a mini refugee camp
Paul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the pool
Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next list
arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave
Tatiana grabs him by the arm
Sit with us Zozo
No ma,am,  am too busy
Zozo you are family, join us
Zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits
(') You are my dearest friends
promise you before God that  will not sleep until have you out of here
All of you
He embraces Jean Baptiste It is good that you are going, Paul, because now we know we have one person who will save us
Odette hugs and kisses him
101
We owe you our lives
Paul takes Zozo in his arms
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother
will get you out of here
Thank you, sir
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people
unbreakable bond of faith with each other
: The lucky families are gathered: Tatiana and all her children; Xavier and his wife; Benedict; and others
Some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom officer stands in their way
Back
Everyone back
Only those with letters of acceptance in the lobby
The  convoy waits outside
Tatiana waits nervously as Paul   checks his watch
little longer, Paul
We wait until 7:00
If he is not here with the twins he is not coming
We leave
That was your promise
Go help the children
Paul is in a horrible mood
The refugees in the ballroom try to push by the  officer
Paul joins him
102
Back, please
Stay back
Zozo, tell those people to get back to the ballroom
They can not be here
Zozo scampers off
(') What are we waiting for
Come on
Paul herds the convoy people toward the door
: Gregoire watching from behind the front desk
Through the doors we see the trucks being loaded
Zozo returns
Sir, the others want to speak to you
Reluctant, Paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers
Yes
Good, sir we have letters, please take them for us
Paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses: President Nelson Mandela
Pope John Paul
President Clinton
#1 If you leave, we are certain to die
have a letter, sir
Zozo hands Paul the letter
He studies the address
It reads "To the great man Muhammad Ali
" thers crowd around
will get you all visas
promise will get you out of here
Paul's at a loss
He has to tear himself away
fraid to look back, he heads for the convoy
103
The last of the evacuees clamber onto the  trucks
The children are on board but Tatiana waits
Ask them to wait a little longer
For the twins
Get on the truck, Tatiana
No
He checks his watch, then takes her in his arms
Look, our children are crying, please get on the truck
Paul helps Tatiana on board
He looks toward the door
: The unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows, lost souls watching out from their prison at the lucky ones
Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards
Paul clambers on beside him
He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits beside her
have to stay
No
Sit down now
cannot leave these people
will wait for the twins
Paul backs off
Tatiana tries to follow
Benedict grabs her
Let go
Let me off this truck
commotion as she tries to get up
(') Let me go
Children get off
104
will follow on the next plane
Go
The truck starts up
Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana
love you
Keep the children safe
Paul
Then another voice
Papa
Papa
The convoy takes off down the driveway
Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door
looks round, Sees: Gregoire put a phone down
Colonel Oliver sits next to a
he convoy passes looters and small groups of Militia on the road but proceeds unheeded
' The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal junk accumulated over four weeks
Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with doubt - Why did he do this
Then the door bangs
Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick
The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo
105
(breathless) Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on the radio
Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen
The cooks and others are clustered, listening to the radio
(
) Block the roads to the airport
The cockroaches from the Mille Collines are escaping
Xavier
The liar Benedict, the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches
Stop them now at Rue Don Bosco
Thirty thousand francs for the head of Xavier
Dear lord, how did they know
saw Gregoire make a call, sir
When
As the trucks go
Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged
Gregoire is at the front desk
Sees Paul - understands instantly
Gregoire takes off, running for his life
Paul chases after him, through the door
Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees
Paul after him
Through the trees
Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence
Finally, Paul reaches the fence
106
Sees Gregoire escape into the bushes on the other side of the fence
Paul gives up, turns back toward the hotel
As the  jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver  crowds of Interahamwe swarming from beside houses, from gardens
They pull burning tires, old furniture, junk onto the road
The  truck suddenly lurches, then slows
The refugees from the Mille Collines grow alarmed
What's happening
Paul is on the fax phone, begging
Please, General,  will give you money, whiskey
(
) You said you had no whiskey
Please,  have money
They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio
Swarms of crazed Militia fill the road
Gun fire breaks out
Colonel Oliver steps from the jeep, waving his pistol in the air
ilitia men swarm around him, push past to the truck
: through the canvas
hildren scream,   at people
Benedict is hauled off the truck
Beaten
Tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab for her
107
: Xavier falls to the ground
Screams, shouts,
Oliver fights his way through to Xavier
Oliver points his pistol
The crowd backs off slightly
Xavier gets to his feet
- more gun fire
falls, wounded in the foot
More are dragged from the trucks
Machetes flash in the sun
Then ,  -   drive through the crowd in two jeeps
The crowd scatters, then re-forms as Rwandan soldiers push between the Militia and the refugees
As they do, another Militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the refugees, but wounds    in the stomach
Suddenly fights erupt between the Militia and the soldiers
Paul paces up and down, he can hear gunfire in the distance
-
Paul jumps in the van, guns the engine, drives
Paul's van speeds toward the gate
- As a  , its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims, screams up to the guard house
Paul slams on the brakes
The jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering in the wind
Paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way
The convoy pulls up in front of the hotel
Bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks
108
Paul and Odette run among the casualties
Then he sees them: Tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face
The kids screaming in terror
runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder
Battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on - equally terrified because: They know they are doomed
Paul sees Roger, trembling, tears soak his face
Papa
Papa
He grabs Roger up
Tatiana struggles to Paul, embraces
Thank God you are safe
Tatiana breaks from the embrace
Did he bring the twins
Paul shakes his head no
Paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden
cloud of despair shrouds him
As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool
e hurries toward them
What are you doing
There is no water from the pipes
heads for the front doors
He's intercepted by the two Rwandan policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu
here is our beer
You promised us beer
Did you explain to the good General that have temporarily run out of stock
109
He said to ask Mitterand and the French to send you more
You will get it in due time
Now, please, get back to the gate
Paul enters, sees Zozo
What is this about no water
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off
' Paul enters
Odette, Benedict watch  on the
shakes his head in disbelief
We can still get  here in hell
state department woman gives a press conference
The Americans are talking about us
: From the reports we have received from Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide have been committed
Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does it take to declare this a genocide
, ahh, there is, ahh we have terminology, that has been
110
You haven't answered the question
How many acts of genocide before your government will declare this a genocide
'm not prepared to, nor am  able
Everyone in the room is dumbfounded
Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee
've got it
have the answer
Watch
They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like an ape
(') We must become mountain gorillas
Then they can put us on the endangered species list
Come on, try it
They think we're halfway there already
Benedict hops up onto a desk
The door flies open
It's General Bizimungu
He surveys the room, then points at Paul
Come here
Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering
s
Where are my supplies
'm sorry, General
The cellar is empty
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty
Did they drink my whiskey
No
We have no way of finding other stock but  have money for you from the guests
111
Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General
Rwandan francs
They are only good now for wiping your ass
There is nothing more  can do for you people
No police
No protection
You're on your own
The General storms off
Paul walks through the lobby
He carries an ash tray to a trash can, the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot
He sees a jeep pull up outside
Paul meets the  soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the gate)
They look frightened
The policemen have gone
What happened
ran out of whiskey
Please go down and guard us
Then  of an engine and the  of splintering wood
As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway
The truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind
Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup
, ,
Militia man fires a pistol into the air
The Tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the Militia truck speeds around the driveway
The Militia taunt and yell at the Tutsi refugees
The truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway, leaving a trail of splintered wood
(') Get down there and stop them, please
Now the Ghanians are really frightened
(') Get down and stop them
112
You know we cannot shoot
What do you mean you cannot shoot
We are peacekeepers, it is not in our mandate to shoot
Then go and pretend you are soldiers
Paul and Tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking fires
They pass the pool, now just a third full
He sits her on the bench in the grove
We are almost out of water
We are almost out of everything
He takes her hand
(') We had a good life, you and
want to make our peace
To thank God for the time we had
He kisses her, total love
(') We have to have a plan
What sort of plan
Our children cannot see us die first
If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof
will meet you there
Please do not talk like this
We have to
If  do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump
She puts her hands to her ears
He pulls them down
113
(') The machete is no way to die
Promise me you will do it
She cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear
uddenly,  , from behind them and then above their heads a trail of fire - an  rocket - zigzags toward the hotel
on the wall, one-story beneath the roof
Paul throws Tatiana to the ground, covers her
moke and concrete dust fall around them
Paul, Zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall
The room is covered in burned note papers, menus brochures for Sabena's two hotels, the Mille Collines and the Diplomat
Odette appears carrying her medical bag
Was anyone hurt
No
It was only a storeroom
Colonel Oliver arrives in his armored truck
Paul, Odette, Benedict and others gather around him
They fired a rocket at us
Yes
Where are the Rwandan police
ran out of bribes
Bizimungu took them away
That explains it
'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel
Will you protect us
114
can't,  don't have the men
We have no one
We will be killed
There's one option
What is it
The rebels have fought their way into the city
They have many Hutu prisoners
They're willing to exchange them for you all
Will the Hutu army agree
think so
They are in disarray now
The rebels are winning, and the Hutu high command are anxious to get some of their men back
How would we escape
By convoy
This time the Militia will kill us
They will surely kill us here
It's over here
We have to take the chance
No, we'll be chopped on the street
We'll be chopped here
The crowd disperses
Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside
man came to my headquarters, asked that give you this
Colonel   Oliver hands a letter
115
(') Paul,  need you to buy me a day or two
don't have the fuel for this convoy will have to scrounge it
can't
have nothing left to bribe with
Can your men at the gate hold out for another day
No, Paul, they're afraid
They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now
Give me their uniforms
will put people at the gate, in disguise
wish  could, Paul
Try to hold out
One more day
Colonel Oliver leaves
Their is nothing more Paul can do
' Tatiana is beside him
He opens the envelope, finds his makeshift house deed and a note
It's from Garandi
(reads) am sorry
There is no hope for the twins
The old lady's house has been destroyed
' Paul sleeps fitfully
It is almost dawn, then he sits up
The Diplomat
Tatiana wakens, startled
What's wrong
have to go to the Diplomat
116
Paul is on the one working phone
General, sir
am glad to find you have found you some supplies
(
) Whiskey
The finest, and cognac, champagne
Come and  will get them for you
(
) 'll be over
Bring back your policemen
But the line is already dead
Bizimungu's jeeps arrives at the hotel
Paul greets him
We must go to the Diplomat
Get in
Your police are at the gate
After the Diplomat
Paul clambers in the back
The jeep turns away from the Mille Collines front gate
They travel at high speed along the road
Then the driver sounds his horn, because
Paul sees:  large crowd of Militia marching along the road toward the hotel, waving machetes and sticks
117
Where are they going
They can go where they want
They are in charge now
What do you mean, General
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama
When
Today
/ Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat
Looters have stripped the place bare
The convoy pulls up
General Bizimungu stands with his pistol out
The looters see him and disperse
Maggots
Paul enters the manager's office, followed by the General
It has been stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet strikes
: Paul: he sees a big problem
The dial is damaged
Do your work
Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing
It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he takes off his jacket
It might be damaged, General
Bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake
118
Paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the safe door
He pulls it open, sees six bottles of Glenfiddich, four bottles of brandy
Bizimungu is joyous as Paul hands him a bottle Bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig
Here
(offers) To celebrate
takes a swig
(') You know what the Scottish call it
No
Ishca Baha - the water of life
went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world
Have you ever been to Scotland
No, sir
Wonderful country, wonderful golf wonder - will  ever go back
What do you think
hope we all get to do many things
Can we go now
The soldier arrives with a box
He whispers to Bizimungu
(to the soldier) Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them
(looses his cool) Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate
The soldier packs the bottles
Bizimungu pours into Paul's cup
119
am going to do you a great favor
(studies glass)  am going to take you with us to Gitarama
do not want to go to Gitarama, General
You cannot go back to the hotel
The crazy men are going there now
Better to come with me
Paul is now terrified
The Militia are at the hotel
We must go back now, General, please, for my family
Bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more
We are better here
(desperate, forceful) Listen, you need me
Bizimungu laughs
(') You are a marked man
How so
The Americans, and the  they have you as a war criminal
You are on a list
am on a list
What list
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists
Bizimungu grabs Paul
You lie
120
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list
committed no war crimes
Who will tell them
You need me to tell how you helped the hotel
The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune
They say you led the massacres
(nervous now)  led no massacres
You think they will believe you
You will tell them the truth
(defiant) will do nothing unless you help me now
Bizimungu reaches for his pistol
(') What are you going to do, shoot me
It will be a blessing
Go ahead shoot will pay you to shoot my family
You can do nothing to me
Bizimungu jumps up, grabs Paul, pulls him
You will tell them  did nothing
Paul and Bizimungu rush out to the jeeps
Paul almost overcome with anxiety
Bizimungu worried
Militia swarm around the front of the hotel
121
The jeeps race through, scattering them
They screech to a halt
Several refugees sit, huddled and battered
Bizimungu jumps out, snatches an
from a soldier, fires in the air
Get back
(to his soldiers) Get them out of here
does not wait
Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee
Then Paul sees a face he recognizes
It's Gregoire with the Militia
Paul ducks into the stairway
He leaps the stairs four at a time
He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who race down the stairs
He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia
Rusesabagina
Show us Rusesabagina
They shove Paul along the corridor
#1 Show us the manager
He wears a suit
They have him in the lobby, go quickly
The killers race off
Paul gets to his feet and runs
' Paul bursts in
The place is a mess
And it's empty
Oh God, please Lord
He careens out of the room
122
And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia
That's him
That's Rusesabagina
They charge toward Paul
Then a roar of gunfire
The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode
General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn
Get out, or 'll shoot you
Paul rushes to the stairs
More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia)
- Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling to get down
- now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there, including Xavier who huddles in a corner
Tatiana
Oh God
Have you seen Tatiana
Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over
: bodies -   women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a row of hedge
(') (screams in agony) The bodies move, look up, it's not them
It's refugees hiding
Paul, delirious with fear, runs along the parapet
he sees soldiers herding the Militia
He runs back to the stairs
: He jumps four stairs at a time
: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia
: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear
He looks under the bed
- empty
He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining hotel room is slightly open
123
: It's empty, then
, he moves in, cautious
: Nothing
He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain
Reveals:  cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands over the mouths of the younger ones
And there at the back: Tatiana and his kids
(') It's alright, they're gone
Tears, hugs, women tremble
The grey of dawn, before the sunrise
Colonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of  trucks past the guard house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive
: Parked in front of the hotel
Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on board by  soldiers
Paul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck
An  breaks out towards the back of the convoy
Paul rushes toward Xavier and Benedict who argue
They should go one truck at a time
When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow
We can't wait
We all go together or not at all
Paul takes matters into his own hands
He locks the doors of the hotel
There is no going back
(') It is time to leave
The Mille Collines is closed
Paul climbs onto the truck
The others follow, some reluctantly
Colonel Oliver gives the signal
124
The trucks take off down the driveway
Paul now at the front of the truck out through a slice in the canvas
, the convoy pull out of the Mille Collines
They travel along the road
Turn a corner, and the truck slows
: a great mass of Hutus fill the road: Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms
No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them, fleeing the advancing of the rebel army
crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks
Don't stop
Push through
The driver reluctantly speeds up
break in the mass of Hutu refugees
Then   ahead
Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's children, some of the women
Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the road
They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles
There's more gunfire behind
The Militia are almost upon them now
Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn
(') Keep going
The Militia are at the truck
But they run
125
As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and   red and blue headbands) burst from the brush
Pursuing, careful, professional
It's the rebels
The crying stops
Silent disbelief
(') We've made it
Cheering breaks out
Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria break into cries of joy
rebel soldier waves his  47 in the air
The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed together
Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks
They hug, cry, an outpouring of relief
Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds
She rushes over
Have you seen my sister Fedens
Heads shak `no'
Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the crowds
Two little girls, twins, an old woman had them
More `nos' Now she's desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around her we see others doing the same, then (
) Mama, mama
He reaches her, pulls at her dress
Mama, wait
She takes his hand
126
No, mama, look
Tatiana turns
and sees Paul carrying the twins in his arms
She squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms
Oh, my babies
(') Anais, it is so good to see you
'm Carine
(in Tatsi's arms) And 'm Anais
Their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of survivors
